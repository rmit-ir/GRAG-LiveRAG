1	why viruses spread more now than 100 years	The spread of viruses is increasing because humans are dismantling the living world at an unprecedented rate, climate change is pushing species to new areas, and we're radically changing our interaction with the biosphere. This creates opportunities for viruses and bacteria to infect new species. Additionally, urbanization and globalization mean that when a virus jumps from an animal to a human, it can spread quickly across the world through connected cities and transportation networks.	['While pandemics and major epidemics have been defining moments throughout history, compared to now, they used to be relatively rare. That’s changing this century: first came SARS, then the swine flu, MERS, a new outbreak of Ebola, Zika, Dengue fever, and now COVID-19. And while scientists race to develop a vaccine and drugs for the new coronavirus, that won’t solve the larger problem. There’s a clear link between the spread of viruses and the relationship between humans and the natural world—and if that relationship doesn’t change, we can expect to see more pandemics in the near future, some of which may be far deadlier than COVID-19.\n“The difference between today and 100 years ago is that we’re dismantling the living world at a rate that’s unprecedented in human history,” says Aaron Bernstein, director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital. “We’ve got climate change, which is pushing every living thing that isn’t human to the poles, more or less, to get out of the heat. We’re radically changing how we do business with the biosphere. And that creates the opportunity for viruses and bacteria to get into new species that they weren’t in before.”\nIn some cases, the link is very direct. The current outbreak seems to have started at a Chinese market that sold wild animals for food, including wolf pups, civets, bamboo rats, and crocodiles; pangolins, a type of anteater, may have been the vector. The animals, now endangered, have been illegal to sell there for more than a decade, but the laws haven’t been widely enforced. “It’s just insane, in today’s world, to have global trade in wildlife and wildlife parts, because that’s taking something that used to be isolated and moving it all around the world into highly populated areas,” says Lee Hannah, a scientist at the nonprofit Conservation International. “Coronavirus is nothing compared to what’s out there—just think about Ebola.”\nBefore the world was as closely connected, viral outbreaks were sometimes more limited. “When these diseases were passed to humans, sometimes, like flu, they become well entrenched and entered the human ecosystem, but other times, the really nasty ones would impact possibly a community of forest people, and it might wipe out a village,” Hannah says. “But it wouldn’t wipe out the whole planet. When we start trading wildlife all around the planet and seeing declines in the health of nature, then you face the prospect of those diseases that used to die out in an isolated, lowly populated forest somewhere spreading all around the world.”\nUrbanization and globalization also mean that when a virus jumps from an animal to a human, it can now spread quickly. Wuhan, where the new coronavirus emerged, is one example of the overall trend. The city sprawled between 2000 and 2018, tripling in size, while new rail lines and flights connected it to the rest of China and the world.\nChina has taken new action to stem illegal wildlife trade, and shut down wildlife markets, though it remains to be seen how permanent the changes will be (after the SARS outbreak, which was also linked to wildlife markets, the markets closed only temporarily.) But eating wild animals is only one part of the problem. As humans continue to expand into previously uninhabited areas, it’s more likely that humans will come in contact with viruses that circulate in animals. There are more than a million viruses similar to new coronavirus; one organization has documented more than 500 different types of coronaviruses in bats alone. As forests are logged and oceans are overfished, pressure on animals increases, which may increase the chance that they get sick. Stress from climate change, including if it forces some animals to move, could also make it more likely that they get sick.\nIt’s critical, Hannah says, that nature is protected in a way that can keep ecosystems healthy. “We want to reenvision humans’ relationship with nature, and have a healthy relationship between people and nature,” he says. The recent Convention on Biological Diversity suggests aiming to preserve 30% of the planet for nature—a small fraction, but something that could easily be lost as the human population grows and agriculture expands.\nProtecting nature might seem like a luxury, but it’s a vital part of public health. “We think we can handle this, and if another disease emerges, we’ll have a vaccine, we’ll protect ourselves,” says Bernstein. “I’m hoping a silver lining of the mess that’s unfolding in front of us is that we realize that after-the-fact actions simply are not that great in protecting ourselves, and that we know why these things happen and we can do things that prevent it.”\nWe should be as alarmed by the statistics about the natural world as the stock market, he says. “I think it’s quite clear that the rapid rate of biodiversity loss is a measure of how much we’re disturbing the living world upon which our health depends. People get really upset when the stock market takes massive punches. Well, if people think the stock market is a measure of human welfare, magnify that by a millionfold and look at the amount of life we share the planet with. Then you have something to really be concerned about.”']	['<urn:uuid:0d744581-30e9-48f4-9909-858fecfa9c2c>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	8	74	890
2	What challenges prevent reforming Europe's monetary system?	The main challenge is that Germany perceives the euro crisis as confirmation of the soundness of their 'stability-oriented' principles and their own virtuous conduct under the euro regime. This perception makes it difficult to implement necessary regime reforms and policies that would need to permanently abandon Bundesbank wisdom.	"['At the Crossroads: The Euro and Its Central Bank Guardian (and Savior?)\nAbstractThis paper investigates the role of the European Central Bank (ECB) in the (mal-) functioning of Europe\'s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), focusing on the German intellectual and historical traditions behind the euro policy regime and its central bank guardian. The analysis contrasts Keynes\'s chartalist conception of money and central banking to the peculiar post-WWII German traditions as nourished by the Bundesbank and based on fear of fiscal dominance. Keynes viewed the central bank as an instrument of the state, leading and controlling the financial system and wider economy but ultimately an integral part of, and controlled by, the state. By contrast, the ""Maastricht (EMU) regime"" (of German design) positions the central bank as controlling the state (and disciplining labor unions, too). The paper identifies a number of potential weaknesses that could undermine the euro\'s guardian of stability, and ultimately the euro itself. Essentially, the national success of the Bundesbank model in pre-EMU times has left Europe stuck with a policy regime that is wholly unsuitable for the area as a whole. As the general perception in Germany today is that the euro crisis has confirmed the soundness of the key ""stability-oriented"" principles and ideas behind the euro regime, and of the virtuousness of Germany\'s own conduct under that regime in particular, it is hard to see how Europe might escape doom through regime reform and policies that would need to permanently put to rest Bundesbank wisdom.\nDownload InfoIf you experience problems downloading a file, check if you have the proper application to view it first.

4	standard practice policy for patient files removed from facility storage	If records need to be removed from the premises, it is recommended to only take copies of necessary portions of the records, potentially with personal identifying information edited out. This ensures the original complete record remains secure. Additionally, when records are taken off premises, they should be kept in one's personal possession rather than left in a car or other location.	['… A supervisee is receiving off-site supervision (assuming it is legal and appropriate in the jurisdiction) and brings the patient’s records with him or her to the supervisor’s office in order to allow the supervisor to review the treatment records being kept by the supervisee, who works for a non-profit organization. Before being able to return the files to the agency, they are lost, stolen or destroyed. The supervisee calls the supervisor and tells her what happened. The central question that is raised by this and similar scenarios is: Should the patient be told of the occurrence, and if so, when? Before answering this question, some comments are necessary.\nThe primary fear of the therapist or counselor when records are lost or stolen is that confidential information will be seen by a third party, thus violating the patient’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Accurate and complete records are important for the current therapist, for future treatment providers, and for the patient (e.g., when the patient may be relying upon the records to support his or her position in pending litigation – a common occurrence). Thus, it is important for therapists, supervisors and agencies to develop and implement policies that control access to patient records and that control the location, at all times, of records.\nEven were an agency to allow records to be removed from the premises (hopefully, on rare and compelling occasions), it would be wise to take copies of only those portions of the records that are needed, so that if something were to happen to the copies, the original and complete record will still be where it is supposed to be. Additionally, it may be easy to edit the copy so that no personal identifying information is discernable. Of course, if the supervision occurred at the agency, this problem would be avoided in its entirety. Even where the supervision occurs off-site, the supervisor might visit the agency whenever records need to be reviewed. If records are taken off premises, it is best to keep the records in one’s personal possession, rather than to leave them in a car or other location.\nWhen records are lost, stolen or destroyed, the practitioner may want to reconstruct the records for treatment purposes. The ability to reconstruct will depend upon the complexity of the case and the length of time that the patient has been in treatment. Records from former providers can usually be obtained again. Dates of treatment might be retrievable from an appointment book or other records. If records are reconstructed, the date of the reconstruction should be apparent and the reason for the reconstruction should be provided. Remember, the therapist might not be at fault in many cases. For instance, an office or home can be burglarized even though reasonable safeguards have been put in place. A natural disaster, fire, or accident of some kind, not the fault of the therapist or agency, might have caused damage or destruction.\nDepending upon the length and content of the records, some unintended disclosures can be seriously invasive of the patient’s privacy and cause significant harm or embarrassment to the patient. Other disclosures can be less harmful or damaging. Counselors and therapists who find themselves in this kind of difficulty are rightly afraid of liability, both civilly (lawsuit) and administratively (licensing board/disciplinary action), and usually want to minimize their liability and, if possible, mitigate harm to the patient. Because of the varying circumstances that occur and the different degrees of possible liability, therapists and counselors may need to consult with an attorney and perhaps others to help them navigate their way through a thorny situation.\nGenerally, the therapist or counselor is better off telling the patient of the missing records– and doing so promptly-rather than suppressing that information for a period of time. If prompt notice is given, the therapist will not later be found to have intentionally kept the information from the patient in an attempt to hide the occurrence. Delaying disclosure may increase the liability for the practitioner and perhaps bring the issue of “bad faith” into the fore. Prompt and full disclosure is easy when the therapist has not acted negligently with respect to the destruction, theft or disappearance of the records. If the loss, however, is the result of a supervisee’s negligence (leaving records in a car in a high crime area), and also the result of the negligence of the employer (who allowed the records to be taken and who had no written policy regarding this issue), the supervisee and employer may not be too anxious to reveal the full and true facts to the patient.\nThose who find themselves in this situation may sometimes be reluctant to promptly tell the patient because they are hopeful that the records will be found, returned or recovered. If records are missing because of a theft or other crime, for example, the practitioner will likely make a police report, and will do so promptly. Recovery of the records could occur, for instance, if the stolen car is quickly recovered and the records that a supervisee negligently left in the trunk are still there. While misplaced or lost records may be found or returned, practitioners must carefully evaluate the pros and cons of delaying disclosure and must be certain that they act in good faith. If there is a delay, even if arguably justified, the patient can nevertheless allege that the delay was in bad faith or simply wrong.\nAnother reason why some are reluctant to promptly notify the patient is that they don’t want the patient to suffer serious emotional distress, especially where the patient is already under great stress. While there may be times when the patient is in such emotional condition as to warrant the therapist to delay disclosure of the loss of records for some period of time (the shorter the better), it is critical that such a reason not be a baseless excuse. Moreover, there must be sound clinical support (e.g., clinical consultation) for any such delay. While prompt notification may subject those involved to some liability for their negligent handling or maintenance of the records, the fact of prompt disclosure may help to mitigate the liability or to show that those involved “did the right thing” once the discovery was made. Again, consultation with an attorney or others may be necessary.\nDo not put yourself or your employer in such situations. Think twice before taking records from the place where they regularly are kept!']	['<urn:uuid:bdd1937f-cf38-4e92-96e1-1ab35e873297>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	10	61	1080
5	when did first flowers plants first appear on earth timeline history	Flowering plants (angiosperms) first evolved during the Jurassic period, after dinosaurs and mammals had already appeared. This coincided with a time when insects were diversifying, and the evolving plants used these emerging bugs to transport their genetic material between plants.	"[""Editor's note: The following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research.\nPhotosynthesis – the ability to convert energy from the sun into fuel – first appeared on Earth in single-celled organisms, which eventually evolved into algae, then mosses, then ferns. Flowering plants, now such a familiar part of our landscape, didn’t evolve until the Jurassic period, after dinosaurs and mammals had already hit the scene. At this time, insects were diversifying, and the evolving plants used the emerging bugs to carry their own genetic material from plant to plant. Flowering plants, also known as angiosperms, are a product of this early version of sex and its exchange of genetic material – so important in evolution.\nA recent discovery and analysis of fossilized plants has opened up the discussion of the nature and relationships of these early plants. First found in the lithographic limestone being mined in the Pyrenees Mountains over 100 years ago, these fossils, with their strange sprawling stems, were little understood. Some thought they were mosses, some considered them to be conifers, but few recognized the fossils as flowering plants.\nNow my colleagues and I, on a team of paleobotantists led by Bernard Gomez of Lyon, France, have presented evidence that this fossil, Montsechia, which lived as long ago as 130 million years, is the earliest known example of a fully submerged aquatic flowering plant. After careful analysis of hundreds of well-preserved newly collected fossils from northeastern Spain, we believe Montsechia flowered underwater and was pollinated underwater, living in a similar fashion to the plantCeratophyllum that’s found around the world today.\nFlowers are all about sex and getting new genetic material into the breeding line. Montsechia is an example of a very early line of evolution that solved this challenge in a new and novel way – relying on water to disperse its pollen, not the wind or animal pollinators.\nThe plant we see in these new old fossils\nBased on the many fossil examples we examined, Montsechia floated in freshwater lakes and was submerged in the water. It had a spreading growth, branching freely. This flowering plant didn’t display any of the showy blossoms we tend to associate with flowers. But because it contains seeds enclosed in a fruit, the basic characteristic of angiosperms, it is classified as a flowering plant.\nWe’ve found two forms of this fossil: one form has leaves that are small and closely pressed to the stem. On this form, we frequently saw mature fruits.\nThe other form has leaves that extend out from the stems and only rarely are mature seeds found attached. We saw the two leaf types associated together at the same fossil localities.\nToday, many flowers are made up of petals and then male stamens (with filaments and anthers that produce pollen) and female carpels (which mature into fruits and contain the seeds, like peas in a pod). We didn’t identify any male flowers or remains of where they were borne on the stems in Montsechia. It appears they had separate flowers to contain pollen organs and carpels.\nFishing around for the first flower\nWhen asking the question of what the first flower in the world was like, 30 years ago some botanists said that magnolias were the typical form. Later, others suggested that perhaps water lily flowers may be a better choice.\nThen the tools of molecular systematics allowed botanists to use DNA and RNA from the nuclei and chloroplasts of plant cells to puzzle out relationships based on molecular characteristics. That’s when a genus calledAmborella, found living today only in New Caledonia, gained favor as a possible first flowering plant.\nAnother contender, Ceratophyllum, was also once thought to be basal to all flowering plants before being displaced by Amborella, and its position in the angiosperms has been uncertain since. Montsechia, at 130 million years old – among the oldest megafossil remains known of any flowering plant – is in the lineage of Ceratophyllum. This makes this lineage of flowering plants one of the oldest known and suggests that underwaterCeratophyllum is back in the running to be the original flowering plant.\nCeratophyllum, modern descendent of first flower\nCeratophyllum consists of six species found around the world today in the single genus in its own order, Ceratophyllales. These plants, known as foxtails, live in freshwater lakes on all continents of the world today, save Antarctica.\nThese modern-day descendents ofMontsechia have separate male and female flowers with no sepals or petals, just simple reproductive organs, like stamens and carpels. When they reproduce, the stamens release the anthers that contain the pollen to float up to the water’s surface. Then the pollen is released and begins to slowly sink through the water column. As it descends, being moved by water currents, a branched pollen tube grows out. When the pollen tube makes it into the vicinity of a female, a branch will find a small hole enter and pollinate. This is how the plant fertilizes and creates a seed.\nBecause of the water dispersal of the pollen there is genetic mixing or outcrossing, just as if an insect had carried the pollen.\nThe fossil fruits of Montsechia also have a similar small pore in the fruit wall, and the seed is positioned similarly as those of Ceratophyllum today. This suggests that these very ancient flowers flowered underwater, were very simple in nature (no beautiful petals yet) and were pollinated underwater. This very early and inventive way for flowering plants to manage their reproduction so early in their evolution is impressive.\nMontsechia places the Ceratophyllumlineage as one of the oldest of all the flowering plants and suggests that we need to reevaluate the nature of the evolution of the original angiosperm again.\nDavid Dilcher does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above.""]"	['<urn:uuid:628598df-3e60-45ca-b5c5-c6818252e12f>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	11	40	993
6	maritime competition puget sound historical significance current legal restrictions	Maritime competitions in Puget Sound blend historical traditions with modern regulations. The Washington 360 race allows participants like the Hammer brothers to honor their family's maritime history, using traditional vessels like the Norwegian 'geit' boat similar to what their ancestors used 150 years ago for milk delivery. However, modern maritime activities are strictly regulated, particularly regarding safety and impairment. Washington state law enforces strict BUI regulations for all vessels, including traditional boats, with violations being considered prior offenses for future DUI convictions. Law enforcement conducts regular patrols, especially during holidays, as part of Operation Dry Water, a national campaign to reduce alcohol-related boating accidents.	"['St. Petersburg rowers honor family history in Washington race\nThe Washington 360, a motorless boat race around Puget Sound, kicked off this week.\nOf the 56 teams, only one is from Alaska. Jacob and Jens Hammer are originally from Petersburg and they row the course. The brothers see running as a way to honor their family history.\nWashington 360 ships include sailboats, catamarans, kayaks, and even a stand-up paddle board.\nThe Hammer brothers chose a handcrafted wooden rowboat called the “geit” boat. Jens said his family would have used the same type of boat in Norway 150 years ago.\n“It’s just an absolutely gorgeous boat, way too beautiful for us,” he said. “We’re already doing it and we’re having a good time doing it.”\nHe called from Port Townsend, where the road begins and ends. The teams have two weeks to complete the race. The Hammers hope to do so in ten days.\n“We know there’s no way we’re going to be successful in this area by the speed of our boat or by any technological advantage we can gain,” Jens said. “We just have to row harder and row longer. It will be our advantage.\nThe Washington 360 is a whole new race. It’s similar to the popular Race to Alaska, which was canceled this year due to the pandemic. This race, all in Washington State, attracts some of the same competitors. They can choose what type of vessel they want to sail. They just can’t use motors.\nJens said he and his brother learned to cope without a motor at a young age.\n“Our dad was a big believer in always knowing how to do things the old fashioned way first, no matter what technology you might use later,” he said. “If you wanted to go camping alone in the cabin, up to Petersburg Creek, before you could take the single scull, before you could go alone, you had to be strong enough to row yourself. So if you can row yourself up there, then you’re probably smart enough and strong enough to figure out how to get out of a pinch.\nFrom strong currents to harsh weather conditions, the Hammers could face many pinches over the next two weeks. But this is not the first time that Jacob has rowed in the region. In 2018, he rowed the first stage of the Race to Alaska from Port Townsend to Victoria, BC.\n“The tide comes where our normal speed is reduced,” Jacob said during a live broadcast on the team’s Facebook page on Monday. “But cannot lower our spirits.”\nThis spirit comes from a desire to honor their great-grandfather, John. In the 1920s, he and his partner, Andrew Wikan, traveled back and forth between Petersburg and the mainland to deliver milk. The Hammer and Wikan store on North Nordic Drive turns 100 this year.\n“We’ve always looked for excuses to go on an adventure,” Jens said. “It seemed like a great way to celebrate a little further and row us all around Puget Sound.”\nThe Hammers are posting updates on their team’s Facebook page, titled “Team Time and Tide.” Live tracking of all competitors is available on the Northwest Maritime Center website.', ""Operating a boat while under the influence of alcohol and drugs is not only unsafe—it’s illegal. Washington state’s boating-under-the-influence (BUI) law applies to all boats include kayaks, canoes, row boats and inflatable fishing rafts.\nIf you own, rent or operate a borrowed boat, you are responsible for the safety and well-being of everyone on board. Never operate a boat under the influence or allow an intoxicated person to operate the boat. Be sure to check any prescription and non-prescription drugs for side effects that could impede your ability to be alert!\nDo everyone a favor, always designate a sober skipper. Take the pledge today!\nKeep everyone safe\nBoating under the influence is dangerous to everyone on the water. Wind, sun, noise, motion and vibration can amplify the effects of alcohol and marijuana. Boats don’t have the same safety features as cars, such as airbags and seat belts. When someone is involved in a car accident, they are not normally faced with the threat of drowning. Emergency response may not be nearly as quick on the water as on land. To be as safe as possible, passengers are encouraged to stay sober, too.\nOperating a boat under the influence is not safe for you, passengers and other people on the water. You put everyone at risk if you choose to go boating while impaired.

Source code is a particular programming language that allows developers to create and edit computer programs. This source code is available to the general public under a license that permits users to study, modify, improve and distribute it.\nThe main thing that differentiates open source software from any commercial software is its license. License indicates how to use the software and whether it is copyright or not. It is unique in this way, because it is always released under general public license. Under this license, certain parameters are required, which certify that the software is available to all or not.\nAccording to the definition, these are the parameters specific to open source software.\nUsers can share the modified source code developed from original source code each time when the source code is modified again and again.\nSoftware contains free source code and sharing is permitted in original form, as well as its modified version.\nModifications in original source code have some derived works to modify it. License allows sharing this work to other users.\nIntegrity of Author’s Source Code\nSharing of edited source code can be restricted, if the license requires sharing of patch files with source code at the time of modifying it. In such cases, license must be clear to share software which is developed from modified source code with its whole details to be known by different name or version from the original.\nNo Discrimination of Persons or Groups\nLicense must not discriminate any person or user group.

8	brain barrier metal particles immune response personalized treatment considerations	The blood-brain barrier plays a crucial role in metal-related neural effects, as some metals like mercury can cross this barrier and remain in the brain for years to decades. This is particularly relevant for new therapeutic approaches like the nano-photothermal neural stimulation technique, which uses metal nanoparticles for personalized neuromodulation therapy. While this technique offers precise control through printed patterns, consideration must be given to the immune response, as research shows that metal exposure can trigger inflammatory responses in brain microglia cells. This immune activation is especially pronounced when combined with bacterial endotoxins, suggesting that concurrent infections could enhance the potential neurotoxic effects of metals in the brain.	['A research team from KAIST has devised a highly personalizable neural stimulation technique. The researchers have developed a technology that can be used to print the heat pattern on a micron scale to allow the remote control of biological activities.\nProfessor Nam and Dr. Kang, right. (Image credit: KAIST)\nThe team combined a precision inkjet printing technology with bio-functional thermo-plasmonic nanoparticles to create a “selective nano-photothermal neural stimulation method.”\nThe team of Professor Yoonkey Nam from the Department of Bio and Brain Engineering anticipates that this will function as an enabling technology for customized precision neuromodulation therapy for patients suffering from neurological disorders.\nAs part of the nano-photothermal neural stimulation technique, the thermo-plasmonic effect of metal nanoparticles is used to control the activities of neuronal networks. Using the thermo-plasmonic effect, the metal nanoparticles can absorb a particular wavelength of illuminated light to effectively produce localized heat. Four years ago, the researchers found out the inhibitory nature of spontaneous activities of neurons following photothermal stimulation. From that time, they have advanced this technology to modulate hyperactive behaviors of neural circuits and neurons, which is usually the case in neurological disorders such as epilepsy.\nTo overcome the restriction on the resolution and spatial selectivity of the already devised nano-photothermal technique, the researchers used an inkjet printing technique to micro-pattern the plasmonic nanoparticles (a few tens of microns) and successfully showed that the nano-photothermal stimulation can be selectively employed based on the printed patterns.\nThe team employed a polyelectrolyte layer-by-layer coating technique to print substrates in a manner to enhance the pattern fidelity and accomplish uniform assembly of nanoparticles. The electrostatic attraction between the coated printing substrate and the printed nanoparticles also improved the stability of the attached nanoparticles. Since the polyelectrolyte coating is biocompatible, biological experiments including cell culture can be carried out by using the technique developed in this study.\nThe researchers used printed gold nanorod particles with a resolution of few tens of microns over an area of several centimeters and demonstrated that highly complex heat patterns can be accurately formed through light illumination based on the printing image.\nFinally, the researchers established that the printed heat patterns have the ability to selectively and promptly obstruct the activities of cultured hippocampal neurons through near-infrared light illumination. Since the printing process can be applied to flexible and thin substrates, the technique can be easily used for implantable neurological disorder treatment devices and wearable devices. The selective application of the heat patterns to only the desired cellular areas enables providing personalized and customized photothermal neuromodulation therapy for patients.\nThe fact that any desired heat patterns can be simply ‘printed’ anywhere broadens the applicability of this technology in many engineering fields. In bioengineering, it can be applied to neural interfaces using light and heat to modulate physiological functions. As another engineering application, for example, printed heat patterns can be used as a new concept of anti-counterfeit applications.\nYoonkey Nam from KAIST, Principal Investigator\nThis study, mainly headed by Dr. Hongki Kang, was reported in\nACS Nano journal on February 5, 2018.', 'Can metal-exposure induce innate immune reactivity in brain cells and thus contribute to neurotoxicity?\nUse of metals in dentistry is quite common for braces, crowns, fillings, implants. Problems sometimes occur, such as allergy, locally inflamed mucosae, or vague symptoms throughout the entire body. However, alternatives such as methacrylates will never completely replace metals, since their characteristics do not meet all clinical requirements.\nMetals have also been speculated to be involved in the pathogenesis of neuro-degenerative diseases and to cause neurotoxic symptoms such as headache and disorientation. Amalgam is in particular debated for its safety. Attempts to link its usage with neuro-diseases were reinforced by the finding that elemental mercury is lipid soluble and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Moreover its half-life time in the brain is estimated to last from several years to decades. Also the level of other transition metals was found to accumulate in liquor from neurologic patients. However, little evidence for immune mediated effects of dental alloys on brain cells has been reported so far. Since chronic activation of innate immune responses is a common finding in various neuro-degenerative diseases we set out to evaluate the innate stimulatory effects of dental metals.\nWe found that the transition metals cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, palladium, gold and mercury in high supra-physiologic concentrations can activate the innate immune cells of the brain (microglia), with nickel and cobalt giving the strongest stimulation, measured as IL-8 production. However, in low physiologic concentrations, even up to 10 fold the levels found in normal blood plasma, only zinc and copper induced a detectable inflammatory response in microglia (see Fig. 1). Therefore, the commonly used high quality alloys are considered to be relatively safe with respect to neurotoxicity. Still, one should realize that, depending on possible corrosive conditions in the oral cavity, as well as on the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and the actual efflux from the brain, metals may accumulate in the central nervous system, thereby reaching incidentally neurotoxic levels.\nOf note, zinc and copper, both metals with important physiological functions, were present in much higher levels in normal plasma – and thus in our in vitro stimulation experiments – than the other transition metals. Although it is unlikely that dental alloys containing copper (present in palladium based alloys and amalgam) or zinc (present in gold based alloys) will substantially add to these relatively high systemic levels, disturbances in homeostatic control of zinc and copper should be considered as potential risk factors for chronic brain inflammation. Interestingly, we found that even low levels of bacterial endotoxin (LPS) could potentiate the innate stimulatory potential of zinc and copper. Therefore also low grade infections may contribute to the neurotoxic potential of metals.\nIn conclusion, we now have clear evidence that microglia can respond to metal exposure with IL-8 production and thus contribute to an elevated state of inflammation in the brain. The results confirmed that microglia can be triggered by metal salts, although at concentrations which may not readily be seen in situ. Nevertheless, also microglial cells reveal a strong synergy between exposure to metals, in particular to copper and zinc, and microbial endotoxin, indicating that such unfortunate coinciding activities may contribute to or augment chronic inflammation and neurotoxicity in humans.\nDessy Rachmawati 1, Ingrid M.W. van Hoogstraten 2\n1Faculty of Dentistry, University of Jember, Indonesia\n2Dept. of Pahtology, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\nMetal ions potentiate microglia responsiveness to endotoxin.\nRachmawati D, Peferoen LA, Vogel DY, Alsalem IW, Amor S, Bontkes HJ, von Blomberg BM, Scheper RJ, van Hoogstraten IM.\nJ Neuroimmunol. 2016 Feb 15']	['<urn:uuid:131a007f-05b1-4cbb-8214-28aa627f6eaf>', '<urn:uuid:2f9e269b-006d-4cb8-a2a4-5ea9e5cfdbb8>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	9	108	1101
9	teeth replacement cost versus maintenance	A bridge generally has a lower upfront cost compared to an implant. However, in the long term, implants may be more cost-effective since bridges involve treating neighboring healthy teeth, which shortens their life cycle and requires future re-treatment. Additionally, bridges require special maintenance, including using special flossing instruments daily and specific brushing techniques to prevent plaque buildup. In contrast, implants can be cleaned like natural teeth without additional tools.	['The two best options for replacing a missing tooth are a dental implant or a bridge. Let’s start by briefly describing what each option entails. If you look at the illustration below, tooth “a” is on one side of the missing tooth (site “b”) and tooth “c” is on the other side.\nA bridge involves removing tooth structure on teeth “a” and “c” so that there is room for a ceramic material which will replicate their original contours and esthetics. The ceramic replacing teeth “a” and “c” will be connected by a floating crown which will complete the bridge. As shown in the illustration below, the three unit bridge will be permanently cemented over top teeth “a” and “c” and will replace the missing tooth at site “b”.\nAn implant involves placement of a titanium screw into the jawbone which after it heals functions very similar to the root of a natural tooth. A crown is then built on top of the implant and the final result looks something like the illustration below. An implant at site “b” has no impact on teeth “a” or “c”.\nSo now that you understand the basic structure of a dental implant and a bridge let’s talk about the benefits of each.\nBenefits of a Bridge:\n- Faster turnaround time: A bridge can be completed within a 3-4 week timeframe over two visits.\n- No surgery: Some people are at a higher risk of complications with surgery given their health or age; no surgery is required in the placement of a bridge.\n- Lower up front cost: If you are to compare the total cost of a bridge to the total cost of an implant, most of the time the bridge will be less expensive up front.\nBenefits of a Dental Implant:\n- Independence from neighboring teeth: A bridge permanently connects at least two teeth; if a single tooth in a bridge becomes a problem, the entire bridge is at risk for failure.\n- More hygienic: Cleaning around an implant is very similar to cleaning around a natural tooth. You will not need any additional tools to ensure you are maintaining the site well. Cleaning around a bridge is more challenging because the teeth are connected. You will need to thread a piece of floss under the bridge every day when you clean it.\n- Improved force distribution: Since a dental implant replaces the root of a tooth, the forces put on the implant crown are absorbed in a more favorable manner in comparison with a three tooth bridge that only has two teeth for support.\n- Lower long term cost: Involving neighboring teeth in the form of a bridge has long term consequences that are often overlooked. Nothing is better than a completely natural tooth; every time we remove more natural tooth structure the tooth is worse off in the long run. If we are completing a bridge on teeth that would not otherwise need treatment, we are subjecting them to a shortened life cycle that will inevitably need re-treatment at some point in the future. Due to the fact that an implant is independent from the neighboring teeth, it does not subject the neighboring teeth to treatment that may shorten their overall life span and therefore an implant will be less expensive in the long term.', 'Missing teeth are more than a cosmetic issue. When you have missing teeth, it can become difficult to chew or speak properly. In time, if the teeth are not replaced, your remaining teeth will move to fill the gaps, pulling out of their pockets. This can be quite painful and may lead to other serious dental issues such as bruxism, temporomandibular joint disorder, gum and bone loss, increased tooth decay and periodontal disease. When you are missing multiple teeth, a dental bridge can be used to fill the gap to prevent these issues from occurring.\nA dental bridge works similarly to a dental implant or removable partial denture. There are several different types of fixed dental bridges for you and your dentist to choose from based on your unique situation. For cantilever and conventional dental bridges, the teeth on either side of the gap will need to be properly shaped and prepared for a dental crown that will be used to anchor the fixed dental bridge into place. In cases where the missing teeth are the visible front teeth, a resin-bonded bridge may be used. This requires less tooth enamel to be removed, but it can only be used in areas where the gums and anchoring teeth are healthy.\nDeciding Which Dental Bridge Is Right for You\nOnce our dentist has determined that a fixed dental bridge is the correct restoration to replace your missing teeth, he will discuss which type of dental bridge is best suited to your situation. You will also be allowed to choose the materials your dental bridge will be made from, as well as select the proper shade for these materials to allow the restoration to blend with your natural teeth. The materials you can choose from will depend on the area of your mouth where the dental bridge will be placed, the dental laboratory that will be making your restoration, and whether or not you suffer from bruxism. In most cases, your dental bridge will be created from a combination of porcelain and metal. If you are allergic to metals, your bridge can be created from materials such as zirconia or alumina.\nCreating and Placing the Dental Bridge\nIn order for the dental laboratory to create your dental bridge, our dentist will take impressions and x-rays of your teeth. In some cases, photos may be taken as well. All of these will be used to help the laboratory plan and create a unique restoration. In most cases, your bridge will consist of anchor crowns on either side of the gap joined by a piece of metal that will hold the replacement teeth.\nBefore the impressions for your restoration can be taken, your anchoring teeth will need to be properly prepared for the crowns. A local anesthetic will be used to numb the area around the teeth to be prepared. Then, a small amount of your tooth enamel will be removed in order to roughen the surface of the teeth, allowing the dental crowns to be properly bonded. If your teeth are not healthy enough, they will need to be treated and restored before your dental bridge can be placed.\nA model of your teeth will then be made using a special material with a putty-like consistency. This provides the dental laboratory a model of the area where the dental bridge will be placed, allowing them to create a restoration that will fit snugly but comfortably into the gap. This will take up to eight weeks to create so you will be given a temporary bridge to wear. Once our office has received your permanent dental bridge, you will return to our office and it will be cemented into place.\nCaring for Your Dental Bridge Properly\nOnce your dental bridge has been cemented into place, you will be given a list of care instructions. This will ensure that your teeth and gums remain healthy and that your restoration lasts as long as possible. Our office will provide you with a special flossing instrument to use around the dental bridge daily. In addition, you may be advised to use a special brushing technique and toothpaste to prevent plaque and tartar buildup.\nYour dental bridge will also need to be checked regularly to ensure that it still fits properly and remains free from damage. This will be simple as long as you continue to maintain a bi-annual schedule of visits to our office for checkups and cleanings. If you find any damage or discoloration on your bridge, you will need to contact our office right away for repair.\nIf you have any questions about dental bridges, or if you would like to see if you might be a good candidate for a dental bridge restoration, contact our office today for a consultation. Our goal is to help all of our patients achieve their healthiest, brightest smile, and we look forward to answering any questions you might have.']	['<urn:uuid:108a0d3b-23ec-4fd6-8201-77d8678d6352>', '<urn:uuid:e3a0c26b-a6a3-4653-87d9-14b5ad984ff5>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	5	69	1374
10	investment analyst interested commodity linked currencies relationship with local commodity prices examples norway canada	Currencies such as the Norwegian krone and Canadian dollar are commodity-linked currencies. Their exchange rates tend to increase in value when there is a rise in the prices of locally produced commodities, such as oil.	['Find the answers to some common questions about foreign exchange (FX) risk, forward contracts, the factors that affect exchange rates and more.\nFrequently asked questions\n- Why is it difficult to predict currency rate changes?\n- What long-term factors affect currency rates?\n- What short-term factors affect currency rates?\n- How do natural disasters or conflicts affect currency rates?\n- How can I make more informed choices about FX transactions?\n- How much risk should I take?\n- Can Barclays International help me manage the tax and legal side of FX transactions?\nExchange rates are affected by a number of different factors, some long term, others short term. You can examine the various factors in detail and still have difficulty making an accurate prediction. Sometimes uncertain or unexpected events cause volatility in exchange rates.\nLong-term inflation: this is a rise in the general level of the prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. Consequently, inflation wears away the purchasing power of money in that country. So higher inflation in a country typically weakens its currency.\nEconomic performance: it can take many years for an economy to grow or to recover from a shock. For example, the subprime crisis in the US took place over four years ago, and it’s taken years for the US economy to recover to its current level.\nInterest rates: a government may decide to lower interest rates in an attempt to stimulate growth in the economy. Generally, this means that investment funds will flow out of that currency and into another that has higher interest rates. So when looked at in isolation, lower interest rates could weaken the currency.\nTrade flows: a trade surplus is where there is a greater demand for goods and services from a country, which means its currency (needed to pay for those goods) will be stronger. Conversely, a trade deficit will usually weaken the currency.\nEconomic growth: an investor may choose to hold one currency over another simply because that country is growing at a faster pace than the other or is perceived to do so in the future. This can lead to increased demand for the country’s currency, and its exchange rates becoming stronger.\nLinks to commodities: currencies such as Norwegian krone or Canadian dollar are commodity-linked currencies and their exchange rates tend to increase in value when there is a rise in locally produced commodities, such as oil.\nShort-term inflation: if inflation is starting to rise, then the natural response for the authorities will be to limit inflation by increasing interest rates. This leads some to convert into that currency in anticipation of gaining a better return on their money.\nNatural disasters: after the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, those countries’ currencies followed a similar pattern. The currencies initially weakened on the events because of the unknown damage to the economy. They then strengthened as insurance funds and other sources of funding flowed back to these countries from overseas to fund the repairs. The currencies then weakened again as their central banks took action to aid economic recovery by injecting additional funding into the financial market and reducing interest rates.\nConflict: there may be a period of time where there is no official government in place or when a person or organisation has taken power illegally. This will naturally have an effect on the currency and will be ongoing as the conflict continues.\nWith so many factors in play, there is always some uncertainty as to whether a particular FX transaction could cost you more today than it would tomorrow. But there are some steps you can take to help you make more informed choices. For example, you can get some guidance on the relevant options by speaking with the experienced Barclays International Treasury team or specialists.\nThis is an important question to answer for yourself before you enter into an FX transaction. The answer depends on your personal risk tolerance and whether you feel the potential rewards are worth the potential loss.\nIf you don’t know your personal risk tolerance, we can walk you through a process to help you understand your own attitude towards risk. We’ll then work with you to find the most appropriate solutions based on your profile and financial objectives. However, we cannot recommend transactions as being suitable for you.

The peanut shape is produced when quarks inside the proton are moving at nearly light speed and spinning in the same direction as the proton.	"['The shape of a proton depends on the speed of the quarks inside. Of the four shapes shown here, the spherical shape (lower right) is the shape most physicists expected to find. The peanut shape (top left) is produced by quarks traveling nearly at light speed and spinning the same direction as the proton. (Gerald A. Miller, University of Washington)\nSurprise To Physicists — Protons Aren\'t Always Shaped Like A Basketball\nPHILADELPHIA — When Gerald A. Miller first saw the experimental results from the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, he was pretty sure they couldn\'t be right. If they were, it meant that some long-held notions about the proton, a primary building block of atoms, were wrong.\nBut in time, the findings proved to be right, and led physicists to the conclusion that protons aren\'t always spherically shaped, like a basketball.\n""Some physicists thought they did the experiment wrong,"" said Miller, a University of Washington physics professor. ""Even I thought so initially. And then I remembered that it looked like something else I thought was wrong — our own conclusion in 1995.""\nIn fact, by 1996 he and two colleagues were ready to publish a paper theorizing the angles at which protons would bounce off electrons after collisions in a nuclear accelerator. The measurements would tell a lot about protons\' internal electric and magnetic properties, and virtually everyone expected the two effects to cause the same kinds of collisions. But the 1996 paper described collisions that were quite different.\nMiller was sure he and his colleagues had gotten it wrong somehow — until he saw the results of the actual experimental work at Jefferson, a national laboratory in Newport News, Va. Researchers at Jefferson published their initial results in 2000 and updated their findings last year.\nWhat Miller discovered from those results is that a proton at rest can be shaped like a ball — the expected shape and the only one described in physics textbooks. Or it can be shaped like a peanut, like a rugby ball or even something similar to a bagel.\nHe was able to use his model to predict the behavior of quarks, and he discovered that different effects of the quarks could change the proton\'s shape. The model showed that the highest-momentum quarks, those moving nearly at light speed inside the proton, produced the peanut shape.\n""The quarks are like prisoners walking around in a jail cell. They just are walking very fast, and when they come to a wall they have to turn around and we can see that, indirectly, and measure it,"" Miller said.\nIf the quarks are moving more slowly, the surface indentations of the peanut shape fill in and the proton takes on a form something like a rugby ball, or a beehive. The slowest quarks produce the spherical shape that physicists generally expected to see. Another shape — a flattened round form like a bagel — is sort of a cousin to the peanut shape with the high-momentum quarks. In the peanut shape, the quarks spin in the same direction as the proton, while in the bagel shape they spin in the opposite direction as the proton.\nThe variety of shapes is nearly limitless and depends on the speed of the quarks inside the proton and what direction they are spinning, said Miller, who presents his findings today (April 5) during a news conference and an invited talk at the American Physical Society meeting in Philadelphia.\nThe Jefferson results, he said, are a small piece of the puzzle for physicists who are trying to unify the four forces of nature — gravity, electromagnetic, strong and weak — into a ""theory of everything"" by which they can understand the form and function of all matter. Taking this step, Miller said, allows physicists to make better predictions so other experiments can get even closer to a unified theory, and it provides clues for how to devise those experiments.\nThe first implication of the Jefferson findings, he said, is that ""a bunch of textbooks will have to have some of their pages updated.""\nBeyond that, he said, it isn\'t clear right now whether there will be practical implications. However, he tells the story of Michael Faraday, who presented findings in the 1830s on electromagnetic induction but was at a loss to explain the value of his findings. Yet today, the principles he developed are responsible for all the electric generators sending juice from power stations.\n""You just never know until you understand something where it might lead,"" Miller said.']"	['<urn:uuid:2d6ff935-56d0-41fd-907c-4907e00a7598>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	13	25	757
12	durability comparison maintenance costs vinyl vs WRC siding	When comparing Western Red Cedar (WRC) siding with vinyl siding, vinyl requires minimal maintenance with just regular cleaning needed, while WRC needs more careful maintenance since damp wood can be corrosive to iron and may need protective coatings. However, WRC has proven performance over centuries and natural durability, while vinyl can crack in cold temperatures and requires replacement after about 20 years.	"[""Vic Ash or Victorian Ash is not a species. It is the trade name for a mixture of two similar species; Mountain Ash and Alpine Ash from Victoria.\nSustainability and the Environment\nSourced from renewable plantation grown eucalypts, Victorian Ash is a beautiful and naturally renewable resource. Its use for timber products and value added process is energy efficient and greenhouse positive.\nLight pink to blonde with a range of characteristics. A range of different finishes can be used to bring out the unique appeal of Victorian Ash.\nVictorian Ash is sought after for appearance grade applications such as flooring, studs, bearers, joists, trusses, furniture, staircases, mouldings, window frames and doors.\nIt ranges in colour from a highly attractive pale blonde through to nutty brown tones. Natural features, such as gum vein, add decorative appeal to this species, telling the tale of the tree’s previous life in the natural elements.\nWith a grain that is straight, open and even with a uniform texture, Victorian Ash is easy to work, with a good propensity for steam bending and laminating.\nColour and Stability\nThe naturally light colour of Victorian Ash responds beautifully to stains and lacquers allowing versatility in colour and design. It also blends attractively with other timbers and furnishings.\nUnlike other hardwoods, Victorian Ash is quarter sawn thereby minimising the effect of fluctuations in atmospheric conditions. This method of sawing enhances its natural stability ensuring trouble free Performance in a wide range of applications.\nWESTERN RED CEDAR\nThuja Plicata, commonly called Western or Pacific Red Cedar, Giant or Western Arborvitae, Giant Cedar, or Shinglewood, is a species of Thuja, an evergreen coniferous tree in the cypress family Cupressaceae native to western North America. Despite its common names, it does not belong with the true cedars within the genus Cedrus.\nGrown in North America, Western Red Cedar is renowned for its high impermeability to liquids and its natural phenol preservatives, which make it ideally suited for exterior use and interior use where humidity is high.\nWestern Red Cedars’ slow growth, dense fibre and natural oily extractives are responsible for its decay resistance and its rich colouring, which ranges from a light milky straw color in the sapwood to a vanilla-chocolate in the heartwood. It is a stable wood that seasons easily and quickly, with a very low shrinkage factor.\nHeartwood very pale brown to very dark brown. Sapwood yellowish white. Texture fine but uneven. Grain straight. Growth rings prominent.\nEasy to work but the sanding dust can be very irritating to the breathing passages, so a well-ventilated workshop is essential. It is rather brittle, so care is needed in working end grain.\nSince it is very soft there is a risk when dressing it that the cutters may compress the softer earlywood, which will later recover to produce a ridged surface. Glues well and is a good base for coatings.\nThe damp wood is corrosive to iron, resulting in a black discolouration of the surrounding wood, so hot-dipped galvanised nails are commonly used in areas likely to experience any dampness.\nA yellowish colouring readily leaches from the wood, so white-painted woodwork at a lower level can be stained if storm rains penetrate, say, to the unprotected rear surface of cladding. Not resinous.\nSTUDY: CEDAR IS MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY CHOICE\nThird-Party Study Proves Western Red Cedar is Most Environmentally Friendly Choice for Siding and Decking\nOverview of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and why it is important\nConsumers of building materials, whether professional architects, engineers and specifiers, or home owners, are increasingly concerned about their environmental “footprint.” They are particular about products they choose and factor environmental considerations into the decision-making process.\nUnfortunately, getting the “whole picture” about a product’s environmental impact can be challenging. Most manufacturers only promote a selective criterion of attributes. Sure, a product may be biodegradable or contain recycled content. However, this does not address other key considerations like energy consumed in manufacture, emissions and impact on global warming. Accessing and comparing like information about alternative products is another challenge.\nA Life Cycle Assessment or LCA (also known as life cycle analysis, ecobalance, and cradle-to-grave analysis) quantifies environmental impacts of materials in a side-by-side comparison.\nLCA measures cradle-to-grave environmental impact through complex analysis of a range of measurables such as resource, water and energy use, emissions, transportation, and waste created. Extraction, manufacture, transportation, consumption or use, and end-of-life disposal practices are examined to create a scorecard against which objective comparisons can be made. Testing is done on a third-party basis, providing consumers reliable data.\nOverview of this study\nWestern Red Cedar Lumber Association (WRCLA) members determined commissioning a third-party LCA of siding and decking products was the only credible way to provide consumers with reliable environmental performance information. To place the study results in sharper perspective, a parallel study of alternative products including brick and fiber cement siding as well as composite decking products was also commissioned.\nForintek, Canada’s leading forest products research organization, conducted the study in accordance with international standards in the ISO 14040/44 series, which requires that all products be treated equally and be of similar quality. Study results were presented for peer review to independent third-party organizations to ensure ISO standards compliance.\nFor Western Red Cedar products, the study was based on data obtained from a representative cross section of cedar mills in British Columbia and Washington state in 2007. Secondary publicly available data were used to develop life cycle inventories (LCIs) for clay brick, fiber cement and vinyl siding. Cradle-to-grave LCIs for wood-plastic composite decking made with either virgin or reprocessed plastic were also developed using secondary data sources as well as information collected from experts in the petrochemical and wood-plastic composite fields.\nIn order to evaluate the environmental impacts of the life-cycle stages of product alternatives, the life cycle was modeled as four distinct life-cycle stages: resource extraction and manufacturing, transportation to customer, installation and use, and end-of-life disposition. This approach helps identify where environmental contributions occur within the life cycle of each product system.\nSummary of decking and siding findings\nThe following statements summarize the LCA results of the study for decking and siding products, giving consumers a reliable basis for comparison. Environmental impact measures applied consistently to each product were: total primary energy on a cumulative demand basis, global warming potential, acidification potential, aquatic eutrophication potential, ozone depletion, smog formation potential, and human particulate (respiratory) effects.\n- Western Red Cedar decking substantially outperformed composite decking in each of the seven criteria tested and was by far the product with the least environmental impact when compared with both virgin and recycled wood-plastic composite decking products.\n- Even after subjecting the cedar decking results to a “worst case” scenario in which Western Red Cedar required the replacement of 20% of boards in normal service and periodic application of coatings, the environmental impact results remained strongly favorable to Western Red Cedar over a “best case” scenario for composite decking.\n- Western Red Cedar siding had the best overall performance when compared to vinyl, fiber-cement and brick; it received top marks in five of seven impact criteria, including “global warming potential.”\n- Total life energy of Western Red Cedar siding can be further improved by altering end-of-life disposal practices away from the assumed practice of 100% landfill, to a mix of reuse, energy recovery and landfilling. This practice, already reality in many communities, results in cedar siding becoming a net “carbon sink;” other products tested remained green house gas contributors.\n- Cedar siding impact on smog and eutrophication – the criteria in which it was not the leader – can be traced directly to the use of paint, not the natural characteristics of cedar. Use of high quality paints and stains (some of which carry length performance warranties) or the use of the new water borne coatings would have a very positive impact on results.\nAbout Western Red Cedar Lumber Association:\nWestern Red Cedar Lumber Association (WRCLA) is a Vancouver, B.C. based non-profit association known as “the voice of the cedar industry.” Founded in 1954, the association operates architect advisory and technical service programs throughout the U.S. and Canada. It seeks to inspire, inform and instruct architects and consumers about Western Red Cedar, its uses and benefits.\nWestern Red Cedar is one of nature’s truly remarkable building materials. Not only does it have distinctive beauty, natural durability and centuries of proven performance, Western Red Cedar is the ultimate green product. It produces fewer greenhouse gases, generates less water and air pollution, requires less energy to produce than alternatives and comes from a renewable and sustainable resource. Equally important, Western Red Cedar is carbon neutral.\nFor more information please visit, www.wrcla.org.\nThe following information has been sourced from the Rainforest Information Centre Goodwood Guide. www.rainforestinfo.org.au\nAraucaria Cunninghamii is a species of Araucaria known as Hoop Pine. Other less commonly used names include Dorrigo Pine, Colonial Pine, Arakaria and Queensland Pine. The scientific name honours the botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham, who collected the first specimens in the 1820s. Hoop refers to the tendency of the bark to remain as hoops on the forest floor after the timber has decayed. Hoop Pine is a rainforest timber, native to northern NSW, Queensland and the mountain regions of PNG. It is the only native tropical timber grown in substantial quantities in plantations within Australia. (Plantations have been established since the early 1920's, when attempts to source Hoop from naturally regenerated forests failed.) It is the major rainforest species used in plantations in Queensland. From an ethical, sustainable point of view, Hoop Pine is streets ahead of most of its plantation-grown exotic softwood counterparts.\nHoop Pine and the Environment\nFrom an ecological point of view, growing Hoop Pines in plantations is preferable to growing Radiata Pine.\nAdmittedly, Hoop Pines are, like Radiata, grown in monocultures and at maturity are clearcut. But they have the advantage over exotic timbers in that they at least belong to the land of our region. Hoop pine is native to north-east NSW and southern Queensland, as well as mountainous areas of Papua New Guinea; Radiata comes from a relatively limited area on the west coast of North America, but is planted widely in the world's southern temperate zone (especially South Africa, Chile, New Zealand and Australia).\nIn Hoop plantations, an understorey can develop which, at least for a few decades under present cutting regimes, provides habitat for other species (of plants and animals), whereas the ground in Radiata plantations is usually covered in a layer of highly acidic pine needles and a few hardy (exotic) weeds, but is otherwise barren. Native plants and animals just cannot make a go of it in or under under these trees. (Go into a radiata plantation: more often than not, all you will hear is the wind sighing in the trees - no birdsong.)\nThe duration between 'crop-rotations' in a hoop plantation is also longer - about 45 years rather than 35 years, as for Radiata Pine. This gives the other understorey species a longer time-frame within which to establish their habitat before the plantation is again harvested. Hoop Pine plantations are also preferable to Radiata in that they require less fertilisers and/or herbicides.\nIn NSW, it would appear that demand for Hoop Pine currently outstrips supply, yet there are good supplies of the timber in northern NSW and Queensland.\nNonetheless, the existing plantation estate in Queensland could be expanded for example by converting regional pineapple farms - whose environmental track-record is appalling. (Pineapple farms are highly vulnerable to soil erosion because of archaic management techniques used, and are usually heavily contaminated by pesticides. Retrained pineapple growers would be able to have a less toxic, much safer and more sustainable livelihood!)\nLikewise, in the NSW Northern Rivers region, financially beleaguered cattle farmers could transfer to Hoop production and capitalise on the increasing world prices for plantation timber whilst progressively divesting themselves of their devaluing livestock. (Regenerating rainforest in cattle-free riparian zones could also begin to stabilise and restore the region's highly degraded river systems.) With increased supply of the timber, the potential for marketing Hoop Pine both domestically and overseas is huge.\nHoop and Radiata have different site requirements, so expansion of the Hoop plantation estate can complement existing stocks of Radiata. Clearly, the agenda for future timber supplies should include plans for many more mixed-species native softwood and hardwood plantations - Hoop Pine could be one of the dominant species in these, putting it at the forefront of a resurgence of our ailing timber industry.\nNB: Be wary of any product with a clear-grade Hoop Pine veneer, as it may come from what are or should be high conservation value [HCV] areas within state forests. Environment groups are campaigning to change the areas of NSW forests which have been reserved for their so-called 'high conservation value', because too many logged-over areas have been included in reserves, and too many high-value old growth forest areas have remained on State Forests' Order of Works."", 'If you’re considering having siding installed on your home, you may be wondering if aluminum or vinyl is the better option. Both materials have their pros and cons, but in the end it comes down to personal preference. In this article, we will take a closer look at both aluminum and vinyl siding, so that you can make an informed decision about which material is right for you!\nWhat Is Vinyl Siding?\nVinyl siding is a popular choice for homeowners because it’s relatively inexpensive and comes in a variety of colors and styles. Vinyl siding is made from PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, which makes it extremely durable. It’s resistant to moisture, won’t rot or mold, and will last for many years if properly maintained. One downside to vinyl siding is that it can be prone to fading over time when exposed to direct sunlight. If you live in an area with extreme temperatures, you may want to consider another material. \nThe Look & Maintenance of Vinyl Siding\nVinyl siding is available in a wide range of colors and styles, so you can customize the look of your home without much effort. The cost to install vinyl siding is also relatively low compared to other materials. It requires little maintenance, aside from regular cleaning with a garden hose or mild detergent solution.\nVinyl Siding Installations in Varying Climates\nWhen considering which material to use for your home’s siding, climate should factor heavily into the decision. While both aluminum and vinyl are low-maintenance and relatively durable options, they may hold up differently in different climates.\nIn wetter climates prone to moisture, mold and mildew, vinyl is typically recommended because of its resistance to water damage. The nonporous surface of vinyl makes it harder for moisture or dirt to penetrate the siding and cause discoloration or other damage over time. Additionally, since most forms of vinyl siding are insulated, these types of sidings can provide an extra layer of protection from the elements and limit energy loss from the home—making it a more energy efficient option than aluminum.\nOn the other hand, in dry climates prone to extreme temperatures—both cold and hot—aluminum siding may be a better option because it is more heat resistant than vinyl. This can help keep your home cooler in hotter months and reduce energy costs associated with cooling the home. Additionally, aluminum resists fading more effectively than vinyl due to its paintable surface, which allows you to customize your siding to fit your home’s aesthetic while also ensuring that it will maintain its pigment over time even when exposed to direct sunlight. \nThe Durability of Vinyl Siding\nVinyl siding is made of polyvinyl chloride, often referred to as PVC. This is a type of plastic that is particularly resistant to weather and temperature changes, so it stands up to rain and snow very well. It’s also not prone to rusting or corroding like aluminum siding can be. Vinyl siding comes in many different colors and styles, so you have lots of options when choosing what look you want for your home.\nOn the downside, vinyl siding is not as strong as aluminum and can become warped from exposure to excessive heat or cold, although this effect is minimal. Also, if you live in an area with frequent hailstorms or other high-impact weather events, vinyl siding may not be the best choice as it is more prone to cracking or breaking.\nWhat Is Aluminum Siding?\nAluminum siding is a popular choice for many homeowners. It is lightweight, yet strong and durable, making it an ideal material for exterior cladding. Aluminum siding comes in a variety of panel styles, colors, and textures that can help you create a unique look for your home. It is also designed to resist dents and scratches, so it will stay looking good over time. Additionally, aluminum siding is low maintenance – all you need to do is rinse it down with a garden hose occasionally to keep it clean. \nThe Look of Aluminum Siding\nAluminum siding has been a popular choice of exterior cladding for homes since the 1950s. It comes in a variety of colors and textures, with an authentic painted metal look that’s often preferred over vinyl. Aluminum siding is also relatively lightweight, making it easy to install.\nHowever, aluminum siding does require some maintenance — it can dent easily if hit by hard objects or hailstones; and over time, it may become discolored due to exposure to the elements. Homeowners must be sure to check their siding periodically for any signs of rust or corrosion.\nUsing Aluminum in Varying Climates\nAluminum siding is considered to be more durable and heat resistant than vinyl, making it the preferred choice in areas with extreme temperature variations. Additionally, aluminum siding is paintable, which allows for a customized look that can last for years.\nOn the flip side, aluminum does not offer as much insulation as vinyl and is prone to corrosion over time—especially near ocean or saltwater locations. For this reason, vinyl may be the better option for wetter climates prone to mold and mildew growth. \nThe Durability of Aluminum\nAluminum siding is strong and durable, making it an ideal choice for those with homes in climates prone to extreme temperatures. It can withstand hot and cold temperatures without warping or cracking like vinyl siding may do. Additionally, aluminum siding is rust-resistant and doesn’t require much maintenance—just an occasional rinse with a garden hose will keep it looking good.\nMaking Your Choice\nWhen it comes to choosing between aluminum and vinyl siding there is no clear-cut answer. Both materials have their advantages and disadvantages, so the final decision really depends on your particular needs, budget, and preferences.\nAluminum is often seen as a more traditional choice that still offers robust protection for homes. It’s a durable material that can last for decades with proper maintenance, but may not be the best choice in locations prone to extreme weather conditions because of its susceptibility to rusting and other forms of corrosion. Aluminum also requires regular painting and caulking to keep it looking its best over time.\nIn addition to choosing between aluminum and vinyl siding, you’ll also have to decide on a color scheme for your home. A dark or light shade of siding can greatly affect the overall look of your house. If you choose a lighter color, it will help reflect heat away from the building in the summertime. Darker colors tend to absorb more heat, however, which could lead to higher energy bills in hot climates.\nThe first aluminum siding was developed in the 1930s and quickly became a popular choice among homeowners. It has since become one of the most common types of exterior cladding due to its durability and aesthetic appeal. Vinyl siding gained popularity in the 1970s as it offered an alternative to aluminum that was less expensive, easier to install, and more energy-efficient.\nWhen it comes to durability, aluminum siding typically lasts longer than vinyl — up to 30 years with proper care and maintenance. Vinyl is more prone to cracking, fading, and other forms of damage due to its plastic composition.\nAluminum siding is a great choice for those who want the look of traditional wood siding but need the durability of metal. It’s rust-resistant and can be painted to match any color scheme you have in mind. Vinyl, on the other hand, comes pre-colored so you don’t have to worry about painting or staining it yourself.\nVinyl siding is often seen as the more energy-efficient option due to its insulation properties. It’s able to resist heat transfer better than aluminum, helping to keep your home cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. Aluminum may not be as efficient but it is still an effective way of reducing air infiltration into your home.\nWhen deciding between aluminum and vinyl siding, there are a few things to keep in mind. Consider your budget, climate, and maintenance requirements. Also ponder the aesthetic appeal of each material and decide which one best fits with the style of your home. Whichever you choose, both types of siding can offer excellent protection for your house against the elements and help make it look great for years to come.\nOne of the biggest differences between aluminum and vinyl siding is the amount of maintenance they require. With aluminum siding, you will need to keep an eye on any dents or scratches that may occur over time. Periodically, these areas should be repaired to prevent further damage from occurring. Additionally, aluminum siding requires repainting every few years to maintain its look and protect it from the elements.\nVinyl siding is much easier to maintain than aluminum siding as it does not require regular painting or repair for minor dings or scratches. However, if there is any chipping or cracking in the vinyl material then it must be replaced promptly before further damage occurs. Additionally, if strong winds have shifted your vinyl siding, you may need to check periodically to make sure it has not moved out of place.\nWhen choosing between aluminum and vinyl siding, it is important to consider their environmental impacts. Aluminum is a durable material that can be recycled for reuse. However, the production process for aluminum does involve energy-intensive practices such as smelting.\nVinyl siding can be significantly more harmful to the environment due to its plastic composition and non-biodegradable components. Additionally, most vinyl products contain chemical softeners that have been linked to health problems in humans and animals when released into waterways or soil.\nFinally, the cost of both materials should be taken into consideration when deciding between aluminum and vinyl siding. While aluminum may be slightly more expensive upfront, its longevity often makes it a better investment in the long run. Vinyl is usually cheaper but will most likely need to be replaced after 20 years or so due to its susceptibility to damage from heat and cold temperatures.\nAluminum vs. Vinyl Siding: Understanding the Differences\nWhen choosing siding for your home, comparing materials like aluminum and vinyl is essential.

Additionally, you may want to consider repainting every few years to keep the siding looking its best and prolong its life.\nCan you paint aluminum siding with a roller?\nYes, you can paint aluminum siding with a roller. However, it is important to choose the correct type of paint for your siding and make sure to use light even strokes in order to ensure an even coat of paint. You may also want to consider using a sprayer for easier application or seek professional help for best results. \nDoes vinyl siding crack in the cold?\nYes, vinyl siding does have a tendency to crack in cold weather. This is due to its plastic composition which makes it more susceptible to damage from cold temperatures. It is important to check your vinyl siding regularly for any signs of cracking and repair or replace as needed before further damage occurs. \nDoes vinyl siding decrease home value?\nWhile adding vinyl siding to your home can sometimes bring an increase in energy-efficiency and curb appeal, it is important to note that some buyers may be put off by the plastic composition of vinyl siding. Ultimately, when deciding between aluminum and vinyl siding, you should consider both aesthetic and financial factors before making a decision.\nWhich siding option is more durable, aluminum, or vinyl?\nBoth aluminum and vinyl siding are durable options, but aluminum siding tends to be more resistant to impact and denting. Vinyl siding, while durable, can be more susceptible to cracking in extreme cold temperatures.\nHow does the maintenance of aluminum siding compare to vinyl siding?\nAluminum siding requires periodic repainting to maintain its appearance and protect against corrosion. Vinyl siding, on the other hand, is virtually maintenance-free, as it doesn’t require painting and only needs occasional cleaning.\nIs one siding type more energy-efficient than the other?\nVinyl siding often offers better energy efficiency due to its insulating properties. However, some aluminum siding options come with a layer of insulation underneath, which can also contribute to energy savings.\nWhich siding option offers more design choices and customization?\nVinyl siding typically offers a wider range of design options and colors, allowing for greater customization to match your aesthetic preferences. Aluminum siding options may be more limited in terms of colors and styles.\nDoes aluminum siding or vinyl siding require more frequent replacement?\nBoth aluminum and vinyl siding are designed to be long-lasting. However, vinyl siding tends to hold up better over time, as aluminum siding can fade, chalk, or dent more easily, potentially requiring replacement sooner.\nHow do aluminum and vinyl siding compare in terms of moisture resistance?\nVinyl siding is generally more moisture-resistant than aluminum siding. Vinyl doesn’t absorb water and won’t rust, whereas aluminum can corrode when exposed to moisture and salt, especially in coastal environments.\nWhich siding is more eco-friendly, aluminum, or vinyl?\nVinyl siding is considered more eco-friendly due to its lower environmental impact in production and maintenance. Aluminum requires more energy to produce and can be more challenging to recycle.\nIs one type of siding more suitable for extreme weather conditions?\nAluminum siding is known for its durability and ability to withstand strong winds and impacts. It’s often chosen for areas prone to severe weather. However, vinyl siding’s flexibility and resistance to moisture make it suitable for various climates as well.\nCan you install aluminum and vinyl siding together on the same house?\nWhile it’s technically possible to install aluminum and vinyl siding on the same house, it’s not recommended due to differences in appearance, expansion rates, and potential moisture issues between the two materials. It’s best to choose one siding type for consistency.\nDo aluminum and vinyl siding have different price points?\nAluminum siding is often slightly more expensive than vinyl siding, mainly due to its durability and resistance to impact. Vinyl siding offers a cost-effective option for homeowners seeking durable and low-maintenance siding.\nUseful Video: Aluminum vs. Vinyl: The Battle for the Cosmetics of a Home\nWhen it comes to your home’s siding, you want to choose a material that is durable and will last for years to come.

TILLING for allergen reduction and improvement of quality traits in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.). Biomed Central (BMC) Plant Biology. 11:81. Interpretive Summary: Allergic reactions to peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) can cause severe symptoms and in some cases can be fatal. Avoidance of peanuts is the best strategy to prevent allergic reactions, but this can be difficult because peanut-derived products are common in processed foods. One strategy of reducing the allergenicity of peanuts is to alter or eliminate the allergenic proteins in the seed through mutagenesis. Other seed quality traits such as oil composition also could be improved through this approach. We subjected peanut seeds to mutagenic chemicals ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) or diethyl sulfate (DES), planted the seeds, and then screened the plants for mutations in specific genes. A treatment of 0.4% EMS for 12 hr yielded the highest mutation frequency, while we did not detect any mutations in the DES treatment. To identify mutations we used a technique called TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes), which identifies mismatches between mutant and wild-type DNA sequences. We showed that peanut possesses two copies of the gene Ara h 1, a major allergen. Using TILLING, we identified a premature stop codon mutation in one copy (Ara h 1.02), which should result in elimination of an allergen protein. Though there are only two genes, many Ara h 1 protein products are produced, so we used two-dimensional protein analysis to show that several of these products were reduced or eliminated in homozygous mutant offspring. We also have shown that another major allergen Ara h 2 has two gene copies in peanut. Through TILLING, we identified several mutations in these genes. Two Ara h 2.01 proteins with altered amino acid sequence were tested for allergenicity using patient serum, but no changes were observed. We also found a mutation in Ara h 2.02 that disrupts the start codon, eliminating this protein altogether. TILLIING was also used to identify mutations in AhFAD2, a gene which controls the ratio of oleic to linoleic acid in peanut oil. This work represents the first steps toward the eventual goal of creating a peanut cultivar with reduced allergenicity. Alterations in seed oil composition will also improve the nutritional quality of peanuts.\nTechnical Abstract: Allergic reactions to peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) can cause severe symptoms and in some cases can be fatal, but avoidance is difficult due to the prevalence of peanut-derived products in processed foods. One strategy of reducing the allergenicity of peanuts is to alter or eliminate the allergenic proteins in the seed through mutagenesis. Other seed quality traits such as oil composition also could be improved by altering biosynthetic enzyme activities. Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes (TILLING), a reverse-genetics approach developed to screen mutagenized populations for individuals carrying mutations in specific genes, was used to identify mutants affecting seed traits in peanut. Two similar copies of a major allergen gene, Ara h 1, have been identified in tetraploid peanut, one in each subgenome. The same situation has been shown for Ara h 2, also a major allergen. Thus, TILLING presents challenges for discriminating between homeologous genes in an allotetraploid such as peanut. Nested PCR was employed, in which both gene copies were amplified in the first PCR, followed by a second PCR using gene-specific labelled primers. Mutations were detected upon heteroduplex formation, CEL1 nuclease digestion, and separation of fragments on a Li-Cor DNA Analyzer. The highest mutation frequency (1 SNP/931 kb) was achieved by treating seeds in 0.4% ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) for 12 hr. The two most significant mutations identified to date are a disrupted start codon in Ara h 2.02 and a premature stop codon in Ara h 1.02. Homozygous individuals were recovered in succeeding generations for each of these mutations, and elimination of the Ara h 2.02 protein was confirmed. Several Ara h 1 protein isoforms were eliminated or reduced in 2D analyses, suggesting elimination of Ara h 1.02 as well. The TILLING approach also was used to identify mutations in fatty acid desaturase AhFAD2 (also present in two copies), a gene which controls the ratio of oleic to linoleic acid in the seed. This work represents the first steps toward the eventual goal of creating a peanut cultivar with reduced allergenicity. Alterations in seed oil composition will also improve the nutritional quality of peanuts.']	['<urn:uuid:ec38fd70-876b-413c-8040-7737b826f0d6>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	14	15	804
15	I've been trying to understand why Jesus used parables in his teaching - what was the main purpose of speaking in parables?	The main purposes of parables were to sort the audience into righteous and wicked, to reveal truth to the righteous while concealing it from the wicked, to teach new truth to the righteous, and to fulfill prophecy.	"['The Parables of Jesus: Overview and Summary\nI. Definition Of ""Parable""\nA. Two different Greek words are translated ""Parable"" (Vine)\n1. gr: parable\na) Literally ""a placing beside""\nb) Close to paraballo (gr:""to throw or lay beside, to compare. It signifies a placing of one thing beside another with a view OT comparison.""\n2. gr: paroimia (denotes a wayside saying, a byword, maxim; Jn 10:6; 16:25,29\nB. A parable is not a...\n1. FABLE: R.C. Trench in The Parables of the Lord says, ""The parable is constructed to set forth a spiritual truth; while the fable is essentially of the earth, and never lifts itself above the earth. The fable just reaches that pitch of morality which the world will understand an approve...The parable differs from the fable, by moving in the spiritual world, and never transgressing the actual order of natural things."" Fables teach human wisdom through fairy-tale like stories with speaking trees and animal. Parables teach divine wisdom through realistic, true to life stories. See Judges 9:8-15; 2 Chronicles 25:17-19. In the story of the Rich man and Lazarus, Luke 16:19-31 is viewed by Jehovah\'s witnesses as Parable, actually they view is as a fable. Why would Jesus use Jewish false doctrine and Pagan fables in the core of His teaching? Such is condemned in: (The word is used of Gnostic errors and of Jewish and profane fables and genealogies, in (example for use of fable in Greek):1 Tim. 1:4; 4:7; 2 Tim. 4:4; Tit. 1:14; of fiction, in 2 Pet. 1:16)\n2. MYTH: Trench, ""The mythical narrative presents itself not merely as the vehicle of the truth, but as being itself the truth: while in the parable we see the perfect distinction between form and essence, shell and kernel"" The myth unconsciously mixes the symbol with the deeper meaning, the parable keeps the two separate. A myth claims to be the truth itself, not a vehicle for truth like parables do. Myths confuse fantasy and reality. Modernists view the creation story, miracles and the resurrection of Christ as mythical fantasy stories.\n3. PROVERB: Although sometimes used interchangeably with the Greek word ""parable"", (Jn 10:6; 16:25,29) the parable is a comparison extended beyond the short use of the ""wayside saying"" of the proverb. See 2 Pe 2:22 for example of use\n4. ALLEGORY: Trent, ""In the allegory, there is a blending, and interpretation of the thing signifying and the thing signified."" An allegory transfers the properties of one thing to another rather than comparing one thing to another. See Gal 4:21-31 esp. v24 & Mt 12:40 for 2 examples\nSummary Chart Of What Makes Parables Distinct\nFable Vs Parable\nFables are knowingly untrue, unrealistic fantasy stories that illustrate previously discovered human wisdom.\nParables are true or realistic stories that illustrate a deep spiritual truth not previously understood by man.\nMyth Vs Parable\nMyths are fantasy/untrue stories that are accepted as reality/truth themselves.\nParables clearly divide between the story part and the spiritual lesson being taught.\nProverb Vs Parable\nA short saying to be taken literally itself to teach some obvious human wisdom.\nParables are longer, more illustrative and teach a hidden truth.\nAllegory Vs Parable\nAn allegory transfers the properties of one thing to another.\nParables compare two separate things to one another.\nII. Purpose Of Parables\nA. To sort the audience into righteous and wicked: Mt 13:10-17; Mk 4:10-12; Lk 8:9-10\n1. Parables either attracted, interested provoked inquiry, and thus sowed seed for future development; or left the self-righteous and stubborn self-condemned in spiritual blindness. Thus parables sifted the audience and found out the willing hearers. (H. Monsor, Topical index and Digest of the Bible)\nB.

16	What paperwork do I need before approaching potential licensees for my invention?	You need proof of patent-pending status (at minimum a provisional patent application), a prototype, videos, pictures, and a description of the product benefits. Additionally, most larger companies will only accept submissions in the form of a patent application, as this clearly determines the rights of all parties.	"[""Selling The Invention\nThe developer of a new idea may have sufficient funds to undertake direct manufacture and distribution, but most private individuals, or even small companies, may consider that the cost of development is well beyond their means. Even for a small company it has to be realised that the cost of taking a new development to the market may be 100 times as much as the actual original costs in going from concept to proving that it works.\nThere is, therefore, always a continuing interest in licensing as a means of development. However, the problem with new ideas as distinct from licensing of established technology is that one has to convince the potential licensee of the possible benefit without strong commercial evidence which will support the arguments.\nIt is vital that confidentiality be maintained even if a patent application has been filed. It is also important the inventor appreciates the most general rule in business that there is no return unless effort is put into the business.\nDespite the old saying about better mousetraps, the innovator has to sell the idea and be prepared to invest not only time and effort but possibly significant financial resources.\nIt is important that one first determines precisely the available protection for the development. Patent protection is only available for industrially applicable developments, usually machines or processes, and is not available for say business plans, ingenious television game shows, etc. If your idea is in the latter direction, you may have to rely on copyright or depend on the law of confidentiality.\nIf your creativity does run to television programmes, plays, books, etc, then simple vague ideas as to a new scheme will not be sellable. The project must be worked out in detail. For example, an idea for a new television series would have to have specific details of the characters to be involved, rough indication of location, at least one episode fully worked out and outlines of the first five or seven episodes.\nIain C. Baillie\nRelated further reading...\nInvest in protection\nAn ingenious advertising scheme or business promotion scheme has equally to be worked out in considerable detail.\nFor the more common instance of mechanical devices, products or processes, the first step, therefore, is to show that the invention is at a stage at which it is commercially practical. There must be some effort to manufacture a prototype, or at least to have a very detailed analysis of the technical features of the invention. As this website indicates, there are various means by which, if you are without technical resources, individuals or companies can be found who can assist in taking an invention to a prototype. A scrappy piece of paper with a rough drawing and some generalisations as to value are unlikely to be sellable.\nThe investment in a patent application is vital. Most larger companies are not prepared to accept submissions except in the form of a patent application, since this can form a clear determinant of the rights of the parties.\nJust as important, however, as the technical description and possible prototype, is the identification of likely licensees. There are, of course, skilled professionals who undertake both the identification of licensees and developing approaches to the ones with the real potential. As with any skilled professional, however, this involves reasonably substantial fees. However, considerable self-help is possible. Always beware of an entity which initially appears to be providing services for virtually nothing. Many of these agencies in the end charge substantial fees, give extremely bad advice both legally as to the patentability and commercially as to the likely application of the invention.\nAccordingly, therefore, the inventor has to:\n• Take an inventory of the intellectual property protection available in order to protect the idea. This is best done by consulting a professional in the field of intellectual property, for example, a Chartered Patent Agent.\n• Identify the types of company who manufacture or distribute similar products. If the product is so new that there is no present distributor of a similar product, then who is at least in the same commercial field for the intended market?\nUsing Companies House\nHaving identified some potential licensees, try and identify the names of persons in these companies to whom a letter could be addressed personally. In this connection use of the information in Companies House and its various branches can be very helpful.\nA specific business plan should be developed. Where would the new development fit into the existing lines of the identified potential licensees. For example, writing to a screwdriver manufacturer, to be able to point out that your new development fits neatly into their line and solves a problem not solved by some of their existing screwdrivers will create interest.\nAt this stage it is best to try and concentrate on a limited number of potential licensees. Also, even if you think the market might be in another country it is more practical to try and sell to a manufacturer in your home territory. With a detailed analysis of the development and its commercial practicability, one can then prepare the submission. Normally we hope you have patent protection or at least an application which can be used as the attachment to the submission.\nIf, however, the submission relates to something which is unpatentable, e.g. a business plan, then it is vital that any submission should be in confidence. The letter of submission should indicate that it is being submitted in confidence for evaluation only and that the recipient must not disclose the invention nor make any use without an agreement. It must be emphasised that not all companies will accept such a submission, and you have to make a judgement as to whether you are prepared to risk proceeding solely on good faith (or a patent application if available).\nIn creating a confidential submission, one must be prepared to accept that confidentiality will not apply to something which proves not to be confidential, i.e. already known, or that the receiver already has in its possession. More sophisticated forms are available but legal advice should be taken on these.\nIf financial resources are already strained, then submission to a more limited number or even only one party together with an offer of an option, for say three months, on payment of a modest sum may be a helpful approach. Normally option agreements have, as an attachment, the full licence agreement, but one can simply have an option that the invention will not be offered to any other party within these three months or that the receiver will have the right to the development if they are prepared to match any other offer and this would be legally binding.\nThe danger for most newcomers to licensing is greed, and it is more desirable to sell that first invention for a reasonable return than to hope to make one's fortune for the rest of one's life. One has to be practical that the small private inventor rarely makes an earth-shattering invention. One also has to remember that the company which is going to make the product and distribute it has a very large investment in taking something which is at best a prototype to market. They will not be prepared to add to that investment risk (large upfront sums), until there is some more indication of the likely success of the invention. Initial payments, therefore, for its rights tend to be modest, although it is useful always to negotiate a situation in which legal costs, particularly for patent protection, are covered by the licensee.\nOne may wish to maintain a limited territory for the licensee, but there is much to be said for the simplicity of granting world-wide exclusive rights to a single licensee with perhaps the capacity to cancel the exclusivity for part or parts of the territory.\nAt this point the innovator may receive an offer to purchase the invention on the basis that payment will be made over a number of years based on sales. Always remember that such an assignment of the invention destroys the control the inventor has over the rights in the event that the purchaser defaults. This is the whole reason for licensing as distinct from selling inventions.\nMore Articles by Iain C. Baillie:\nShould the licensor send a draft licence at the beginning?\nThis is probably both inappropriate and unnecessary and it is only rarely that there is such a thing as a 'form licence' which will fit all situations. It is far better to negotiate some commercial considerations first and then embody these in the licence agreement with the advice of an appropriate lawyer. The licence agreement may, however, be a relatively simple document simply identifying the development and its protection, granting world-wide rights (subject to the incentive to continue working), identifying the sums to be paid up front (although its nature should be specified since different reasons for lump sum payments have different tax and accountancy implications), and then identify royalty.\nMost simple mechanical inventions, despite the various elaborate articles on the subject, tend to wind up with a royalty of approximately 5% of the licensee's original sales price.\nRoyalties are always related to the licensees sales, not the final market price of the retailer. It is important, however, that there may be some review of the basis for the payments. The phrase 'net sales' is a bear trap. Avoid elaborate exchange rate clauses if the licensee pays in a different currency. The licensor is better advised to take the payment and see how the market goes in currency. If a royalty is based on unit sales, i.e. price per unit, one must take account of inflation.\nThe seller of an invention should never warrant that the invention or the patent protection for it is valid, nor that it does not infringe other rights. These are all risks which should be taken commercially by the licensee. Accordingly, therefore, the less that is said as to what the licensor warrants the better.\nOn the other hand the licensor should ensure that, even if the licensee is paying the expenses of legal protection, this is routed through the licensor so that it can always ensure that these rights are being maintained.\nIt is also important that the agreement sets out very clearly the conditions on which it terminates, either by reason of the efflux of time or by default by either party. There are a number of other technical areas such as a choice of law, but these can be best left to a discussion with the legal adviser.\nNot all licence agreements are lengthy complex legal documents and, providing you understand the risks, a request to a legal adviser to produce a simple agreement will be respected although clearly the simpler the agreement the greater the potential that some issue may be omitted. A straight forward relatively simple agreement drafted by a legal adviser will be better than a layman's attempt at a complex legal structure prepared by copying chapters and sections from a text book on licensing.\nThe closer an agreement is kept to the actual subject matter of IP rights, for example registered patents, registered designs, copyright or even trade marks rather than confidential information, the easier it will be to define and to police.\nIn entering into a discussion with a potential licensee it is important that it is made clear that the discussion is only for the purpose of establishing basic commercial terms, and that the agreement will only be binding once a final agreement has been approved by the legal adviser and signed by the parties. However, if negotiating in another country, you may find the law of that country creates a legal obligation out of what first might appear to be only outline thoughts. Certainly before negotiating outside of the United Kingdom any licensor would be extremely well advised to secure sound legal advice.\nNames of Solicitors can be obtained through the Law Society.\nWho Can Advise?\nMany Chartered Patent have long experience in licensing can be very helpful. Normally one does tend to think of a solicitor as the legal adviser in licensing, but here it is important to be sure that the solicitor is, in fact, knowledgeable in the licensing of technology, and one should be quite ruthless in examining the knowledge and commercial experience, for example of a local solicitor whose main practice is obviously real estate and wills.\nA list of Chartered Patent Agents is obtainable from:\nChartered Institute of Patent Agents\nUnfortunately legal advisers are perhaps not the best people to help with the purely commercial side of both developing the invention and submitting it and assessing the likely return. Professional advisers on licensing can be found through:\nThe Institute of International Licensing Practitioners\nThe Licensing Executives Society"", 'A Licensing Primer for Inventors\nBy Brian Fried,\nDid you dream up and develop a great concept for a new tool, housewares product, novelty item, toy design, sport or exercise product? What now?\nAs an inventor, there’s nothing more exciting than coming up with that big idea and feeling that you have something special! But that’s just the start; knowing what to do, where to go and what to expect will go a long way toward determining your eventual success. Subjects such as patentability, product design, prototyping and intellectual property protection will be key to your ability to monetize your idea, whether via licensing, setting up your own manufacturing or some other mechanism of commercializing your invention… When you start tapping into your time, energy, effort and resources, consider yourself to be in business, no matter what direction you choose.\nMany inventors choose to license their idea because they’re limited on funds or, even if they have the resources, don’t have the expertise or desire to dive into the many aspects of running a business — raising funding, assembling production, and developing and executing a sales and distribution plan.\nSo licensing may be the solution that propels your idea into production and, eventually, retail sales. Here are some of the key questions, challenges and points to ponder.\nLicensing can help streamline your way into retail with less risk and initial investment, utilizing a manufacturer that already has retail distribution. You earn a royalty, in most cases, on each piece sold. But you should make sure that your idea is legally protected. Do a proper patent search and obtain a patentability opinion. At a minimum, you should file a provisional patent application to claim patent pending status. Some licensees may require an issued design or utility patent.\nBe prepared before meeting with a potential licensee. You should have proof of patent-pending status, prototype, videos, pictures and a description of the benefits your invention or idea will deliver.\nWhat are the steps?\nGo shopping! Stroll through the aisles of your local retailers or through the web pages of online stores that you can envision carrying the product you’ve invented. Look at products in the same general areas as the one you’re envisioning, and jot down the names of those brands. Flip over the package and take note of the manufacturer. Do research on them and filter through the companies that would be good candidates, potential partners for you and your invention. Connect on social media – LinkedIn is particularly good — check out industry trade shows to attend, make calls to their product teams; if you can’t find those teams, ask for the president, and you’ll most likely be directed to the right department. Some manufacturers may have new idea submission instructions on their websites. This may be the point at which you consider working with an agent to represent your invention or intellectual property.\nThe financial side: How do you get paid?\nEssentially, you’re leasing your idea/invention to company who is then responsible for commercializing it: final product development, manufacturing (whether in their own factory or through a subcontractor), marketing and distribution. In most cases, when they sell your product, you earn a royalty on each piece (In some cases, a license may be granted for a flat fee.) – A royalty usually is defined as a percentage of the manufacturer’s wholesale price; in some cases, it may be some other defined royalty rate for a direct-to-consumer distribution channel.\nFor example, if the product sells wholesale for $4, the retailer may sell it for $8.99. As the licensor, you may receive between 2%-6%; the percentage will depend on a wide variety of factors, including the nature of the product,typical margins of the merchandise category and retail distribution channel in which it’s being deployed. It’s a complex calculation and negotiation that requires a broad knowledge of legalities , as well as familiarity with specific categories and business norms. In almost all cases, it’s best to make sure you have an attorney and/or qualified consultant to guide you through the issues and negotiate on your behalf.\nSome important considerations/deal terms\nAs the licensor, you’re responsible for the intellectual property – your idea or invention. Any licensing agreement should define such areas as term (i.e. the length of the agreement); geographical territory covered (i.e. is this global, or only for North America?) royalty rate and when payments are to be made; minimum guarantees and advance payments. If a licensee includes a licensed property (for example, a character) in addition to your intellectual property, margins may be less considering they have to pay both you and the property owner — both licensors — a royalty. Again, make sure you have a competent attorney who is familiar with handling the ins and outs of Intellectual Property.\nSo, a quick summary…\n- What retailers you envision your product on the shelf or online store offering\n- Potential licensees (manufacturers with distribution)\n- Contacts within the company\n- Intellectual property protection, prototype, videos, photos and bullet points of benefits\n- To pitch on phone, virtual, in person or at trade show\nClose the deal:\n- Understanding expectations of terms\n- Protect your intellectual property and review agreement with attorney or qualified consultant\nRecently appointed as Inventor Liaison with Licensing International, Brian connects and guides inventors to earn royalties from their inventions to licensees and brand properties looking for new ideas and intellectual property to expand existing or add to new product lines.

17	cro magnon tools and weapons made from what	Cro-Magnon people made tools out of bones, stones, rocks, sticks, and antlers. They created burins, awls, bone needles, and straight-backed knives.	['Introduction In this PowerPoint, you will learn about the spectacular, amazing Cro-Magnon who lived 40,000 years ago. You will learn about why the Cro-Magnon are one-of-a-kind. CroMagnons were the first kind of Homo Sapiens before the modern humans. Cro-Magnon were also widely known for their cave art. Now sit back, relax, and enjoy this amazing PowerPoint!!!!!! Dates and Place of Existence • Cro-Magnon lived up to 40,000 through 10,000 years ago. • They spread throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa. • Cro-Magnon crossed a land bridge during the Ice Age to get to North and South America from Asia, Europe, and Africa. They did this following their prey. • Cro-Magnon people came at the end of the Ice Age after the Neanderthals were already around.(1) • They were discovered by a man named Louis Lartet.(2) Physical Appearance • Cro-Magnon had the same shaped skulls and bodies as modern humans. • They had pointed chins and rounded brain cases. • Their eyebrows had small ridges and they had flatter foreheads. • Cro-Magnon had smaller noses and jaws than earlier humans. • Their mouths had tinier and more crowded teeth. (3) Fire was a vital part of the Cro-Magnon people’s culture. Fire was the only source of heat and light in the caves in which they lived. The fire in front of the caves kept them warm from the cold, and it also kept animals away so the Cro-Magnon were safe from attack in their homes. Fire was also used to herd animals to hunt them by driving the prey off the edge of a cliff. Fire could be used to drive animals away as well. Fire was the only means for cooking food, and it was the only source of light at night. Fire was very important to their culture (4). Shelter Cro-Magnon usually lived in caves or huts. They used large bones to build a shelter. They covered these with animal skins and stuck the skin in the ground with animal leg bones. CroMagnon were also cave-dwellers. They lived under openfaced rock overhangs. Underground caves were used for ceremonies and burials. Sometimes Cro-Magnon people made tepee-like huts to live in. They also covered these with warm fur. Long huts had many rooms, and in each room was a fire to keep warm. When Cro-Magnon traveled they lived in sturdy and portable tents.(5) Language Cro-Magnon were the first humans to have a clear speech. They were capable of getting a more advanced language. They passed down stories, traditions, and knowledge. Speaking let them work together, share what they were thinking, and organize groups to gather and hunt food. Communication helped Cro-Magnon have a better life and a stronger culture.(6) Clothing Cro-Magnon used animal hide to make their clothes . They stretched the hide to make it easy to cut and shape. Out of the hide they made dresses, tunics, pants, wraps, and other styles of clothing. They bore holes in the skin and sewed the clothes together with sinew or animal tendon and bone needles. For extra decoration, they would add on little shells, rocks, or beads. They made jewelry out of bits of eggshell, stones, shells and, fish bones.(7) Food • • • • • • • • • Cro-Magnon ate various kinds of food. Women and children gathered together fruits, vegetables, and things they could pick. Some of the things they collected were carrots, beets, onions, berries, seeds, nuts, and eggs. They preserved the food by drying them out in the sun. Sometimes they would catch small mammals in snares and nets made of sinew. Men were the hunters of the culture. The game they caught were large mammals, Wooly Rhinoceros, Mammoths, and Saber-Tooth Tigers. They used traps and bows and arrows to hunt. When they fished they used woven nets, spears, and even poison to kill the fish.(8) Daily life Men Cro-Magnon men hunted for food and meat. They had not learned how to domesticate animals. They hunted most of the day. Some times they would drive a stampede of horses off a cliff to eat their meat and use the bones. Daily life for Cro-Magnon was pretty difficult. Women and Children Cro-Magnon women collected fruits and veggies with the children. They didn’t know how to harvest crops yet. They preserved the food so it would last longer and they could save it. Daily life for them wasn’t that easy.(8) Tools and Weapons Cro-Magnon people had several types of weapons and tools. They made tools out of materials such as bones, stones, rocks, sticks, and antlers. Some of the tools they created handmade were burins, which were axe\\chisel-like tools, awls, bone needles, and straight-backed knives. Hunters used to hunt, but they invented throwing sticks to get better aim and shot. Bows and arrows allowed them to have several shots at the prey they were hunting. CroMagnon people left nothing to waste.(9) Art • Cro-Magnon people were the first people to learn how to carve, paint, sculpt and use color. They mainly sculpted chubby female figures that scientists believed were totems or gods. Sculptures were made of bone, ivory, antlers, and stone. • Most of their artwork was found in caves. Their first paintings were scenes of hunting groups and animals. Few plants and people were in the paintings. They made paint by grinding rocks into powders and then mixing it in with mammal fat. Red, orange, brown, yellow, and black were the colors they made. Brushes were made from hair tied to small bones. CroMagnon were most famous for their cave paintings.(10) Religion Scientists believe that Cro-Magnon were more religious than earlier humans. They also were the first to believe in afterlife. When a person died, the shaman, or religious leader, would lead the funeral, and the whole tribe would participate. They would bury the body with tools, weapons, and food so that the dead person could survive in the afterlife. After they made the grave, they covered it with dirt and stones. CroMagnon were a very religious type of early human.(11) We hope you enjoyed learning about the culture of Cro-Magnon and how they lived! Cro-Magnon was a one-of-a-kind tribe that lived up to 40,000 years ago! Learning about them was really interesting! Thank you for watching this PowerPoint!!! Questions • Did Cro-Magnon people fish or not? If they did, what did they use to hunt the fish? • How did Cro-Magnon make their clothes and what did they use to sew them together? • Did they believe in the afterlife, and if they did, how did they prepare the dead body? Answers 1. They fished with nets and nooses. 2. They made their clothes by sewing stretched leather together with sinew. 3. They prepared for afterlife by keeping tools, food, and needs to survive.

18	What are malnutrition measurement methods and rural nutrition education barriers?	Malnutrition is measured by comparing body weights to reference means (considering two standard deviations below as malnourished) and by measuring food consumption.

Alternatively, we could measure food consumption and count as either the current, or likely future, malnourished all those people whose intakes are so low as to be more likely the result of food restriction than of their having unusually low requirements for the maintenance of their preferred states.\nC. , (1977) 'The presentation and use of height and weight data for comparing the nutritional status of groups of children under the age of 10 years', WHO Bulletin, no. 55, pp. 489-98. 3 The Changing Role of Developing Countries in International Trade 1 Tim Josling INTRODUCTION It is only to be expected that the patterns of production and trade which underlie international economic relationships among countries will change over time. Sometimes this change is so slow as to allow the patterns themselves to be taken as constants; at other times the change is rapid enough to alter our conception of the world economy.\nNot only are children in Kerala pronounced to be malnourished simply because they are smaller than they could be: in terms of the 'human capital' paradigm, their present condition is also a measure of future human capital foregone. 2. If, as the model proposes, individuals with no food constraints automatically assume their preferred states of nutritional health, then studying healthy populations will provide us with normative values of variables - body dimensions, growth rates, blood levels etc."", '- Grocery store availability. As the population density in urban and rural communities has decreased, large grocery stores have moved out. Often, only smaller stores are available to the community. These small corner grocery or convenience stores offer less variety of fresh foods and healthy items (Morland, 2002).\n- Quality of healthy foods. Urban and rural grocery stores operate at a lower volume and higher cost than large supermarkets. As a result, there is a reduced availability of fresh fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy products. In addition, the prices for the fresher foods are often higher (Zenk, 2005).\n- Access to nutrition education. Many nutrition concerns in rural America stem from the lack of proper education and available dietitians. In addition, schools may lack resources for adequate nutrition interventions (Tai-Seale, 2003).\n- Socioeconomic status. The socioeconomic status of individuals living in urban and rural communities might explain differences in healthy food intake (Drewnowski, 2004).The per capita income in rural areas is lower than in urban and suburban areas. Also, individuals living in these areas are more likely to live under the poverty level. For minorities, the disparity in income is even greater (NRHA, 2005).\n- Higher fat intake. Studies show that rural residents have a higher fat and calorie intake than others (Tai-Seale, 2003).\n- Sedentary lifestyles. Rural youth may spend more time watching television than their urban peers. This leads to an increase in snacking, increased desire for highly advertised foods, and less time participating in calorie-expending activities (Tai-Seale, 2003).\nStrategies to address these considerations\n- Improve availability of affordable, healthy food choices. Work with local community- and faith-based organizations, businesses, and governmental leaders to increase the healthy options available at existing markets and restaurants (Zenk, 2005). Some communities have offered grants, loans, and tax benefits to stimulate the development of neighborhood groceries, farmers’ markets, community gardens, and farm-to-cafeteria programs (IOM, 2005). A larger supermarket will carry more fresh items at lower prices (Zenk, 2005).\n- Improve access to healthy food choices. Creating a network that includes community groups, local government, nonprofit organizations, local farmers and food processors can help expand accessibility (IOM, 2005). It may be useful to work with city officials, urban planners, transportation departments, and faith-based organizations to develop city- or county-wide strategies related to land use planning and transportation so as to provide equal access to healthy food choices (Yancey, 2004).\n- Improve access to nutrition information. It may be useful to work with registered dietitians, school and worksite personnel, and community-based organizations and community members to ensure that the messages, content, format and placement of educational materials are appropriate for the population of interest. It may also be useful to work with healthcare providers in rural and urban settings to enhance their ability to convey appropriate nutritional counseling (Tai-Seale, 2003).\n- Use established settings. Strategies should maximize participation in the nutrition education intervention by having meetings or events at convenient locations and times (Bank-Wallace, 2002). It may be useful to schedule intervention activities with other church or community social events.\n- Convenient dissemination of nutrition information. Correspondence or web-based courses may prove useful in overcoming barriers to meeting places and times in rural areas (Tai-Seale, 2003).\n- Increase usage of supplemental food and nutrition information programs. Helping individuals get to the right place at the right time, and with necessary information, to enroll or participate in food and nutrition assistance programs can increase usage of food assistance programs (Strasser, 1991). Case management has also been suggested as a mechanism to help individuals overcome barriers and increase use of food assistance programs (Heslin, 2003).\n- School/Worksite Environment. Many successful interventions have focused on making more healthy choices available in schools and worksites as well as incorporating nutrition education and time for physical activity (Tai-Seale, 2003).\n- Involve the priority populations. It is important that individuals who are from the community of interest take an active role in planning, implementing and evaluating interventions (Bank-Wallace, 2002).\n- Engage community stakeholders. Leadership and active participation by community members, especially health care providers and community and religious leaders, can strengthen the credibility of and respect for the intervention (Bank-Wallace, 2002).\nPrint this window']"	['<urn:uuid:7cc0ee6e-334b-4098-91a3-86f672638594>', '<urn:uuid:cd1cb9e4-296e-47b4-bdfe-6727a3fb0b35>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	10	47	1213
19	When are insects most active outdoors, and what safe prevention works?	Insects are most active during summer months when warm temperatures enable comfortable movement and breeding, with increased activity due to abundant vegetation and moisture from summer rains. Safe prevention through green pest control involves creating an integrated management plan that focuses on prevention through building examinations, addressing entry points, and using environmentally sensitive methods before resorting to targeted pesticide application in specific areas.	['Increased pest activity in the summer has been widely observed and well documented. Their patterns and habits change with the seasons where the warmer months provide ideal conditions for more prevalence and activity. Many factors contribute to this, most of which can be attributed to the state of the environs when the weather is warmer outside.\nMost insects and bugs are naturally cold-blooded. They rely on the heat provided by the sun to regulate their body temperatures. Therefore, when summer comes about, warmer outside temperatures mean that they can comfortably move from place to place. The cold in wintertime makes them more sluggish and less prone to excessive movement. In most cases, these pests will breed in the winter and the springtime. As the temperature becomes warmer late in spring and into the summer, they will leave these nesting areas to seek out nourishment. Usually, at some point, pests will go into the home to get out of the heat once peak summer arrives, just as humans do.\nThe life cycle of certain pests like termites and ants is also affected by outside weather conditions. Reproducing while it is warm outside, will grow colony sizes to a degree. This growth serves to ascertain the continuity of the colony once the temperatures become cool once again and the insects are forced to be relatively inactive. This explains why swarms are typically observed in the summer. If you have felt as though there seem to be more insects when it is hot outside, this is more than likely a major contributing factor.\nWith summer come food sources in greater numbers. There is an abundance of vegetation that has been growing throughout the spring that will reach its flourishing peak period in the summer. The vegetation covers a wide variety of plants, from vegetables to flowers. The plants are a dependable source of food for pests of all kinds. Their abundance is a good draw for insects as they come out to feed to their satisfaction. Once the source of food has been exhausted, the pests will migrate to other areas in search of the same.\nSummer showers and the resultant humidity can also be a significant contributor towards increased pest activity. The two will often bring about extra moisture in the environs. This moisture, combined with ideal heat conditions, then helps to create the perfect environment for shelter and the creation of new nests. In addition to the added moisture, long summer days give those insects that are dormant in the evening hours more time for feeding. You will, therefore, observe greater numbers of insects as they are not only able to feed longer, but have more daylight with which to carry out their activities.\nAll in all, summertime is not ideal for just us. Pests love the warmer period of the year as well and will always be present even as you attempt to enjoy outdoor activities. The trick behind minimising the adverse impact that they may have on your enjoyment is a strict pest management plan that you may have to adhere to. You should also keep a trust worthy pest control service in close proximity so that you may engage the expertise of a knowledgeable pest technician to draw on as soon as their help is required.', 'Green pest control does not suggest inefficient pest control; rather, it is all about incorporated pest management, or IPM. A pest control company that welcomes IPM believes avoidance, client awareness and education, and building examinations are all as important as managing pests.\nWhat Green Pest Control Is\nIntegrated pest management begins with discovering how and why a pest entered a home or structure. Professionals in this field are experienced about the life cycle of insects and their chosen nesting places. Hence, they are able to utilize innovative pest prevention strategies that are the least hazardous to plant life, residential or commercial property, individuals and pets.\nIPM utilizes sound judgment practices in coordination with environmentally delicate chemicals. Instead of utilizing damaging chemicals to prevent the return of a pest, pest control specialists may set up preventative products such as new window and door screens, fresh caulking, new door sweeps, and so on. The specialists may also establish traps to learn more about additional areas a pest might live or set up solar powered repellants as an option to using hazardous chemicals.\nThe Advantages of Green Pest Control\nPest control products that are green are made of natural and natural ingredients. Furthermore, these items are crafted to be biodegradable and equally as efficient as their non-green counterparts.\nGreen pest management practices help promote the health and structure of plants, as they supply a biologically based option to chemical sprays. The control tactics used in IPM are benign and for that reason lower the ecological risk frequently connected with standard pest management, such as ground water contamination. IPM likewise helps reduce the risk of an invasion and is a cost effective service.\nHow It Functions\nInstead of spray a multi-purpose pesticide all over a plagued property, IPM experts utilize a procedure that sets an action threshold, monitors the insects in order to determine them, avoids their return and utilizes control approaches.\nWhen an action limit is set, the expert learns how large an infestation is, just how much of a risk the insects pose, and determines the type of immediate action needed.\nWhen an IPM professional screens insects, he is making certain he is identifying the pest correctly. Proper identification of a pest helps ensure the best kinds of pesticides are utilized, however pesticides are prevented if they are not required.\nAvoidance of pest intrusions is among the crucial parts to green pest control. IPM consists of recognizing and remedying issues that make a house or structure welcoming to pests. Prevention is cost effective and does not risk the health of individuals or the earth.\nIf pest avoidance techniques are ineffective by themselves, control approaches are needed. If the thresholds in place indicate these approaches are not efficient, the control process then moves to the use of pesticides in targeted areas.\nExactly what to Search for in a Green Pest Control Company\nWhen looking for a green pest control business, look for one that will create a strategy that fulfills your needs. The company needs to consider the type of pest, the size of the infestation and the environment where the insects live.\nFind out about the procedure and chemicals a business uses before employing them. Some experts use green pest control items initially and then follow them with standard chemicals, which you may not want. An excellent environmentally friendly pest control specialist should concentrate on using quality items that are low or non-toxic rather than items that are the least expensive, which are typically extremely toxic. In addition, quality green pest control companies educate their customers on how to avoid the return of pest, assistance remedy conditions that are welcoming to them and offer to set up pest-proofing materials.\nThe observation, intervention and prevention method to green pest control assists consumers have comfort knowing that kicking out insects from the house does not imply injuring the environment. Whenever you need the aid of professionals to help with unwanted insects, keep in mind that green pest management is the only technique that has both your individual and financial wellness in mind.\nIntegrated pest management begins with discovering how and why a pest got in a home or structure. Instead of using damaging chemicals to prevent the return of a pest, pest control professionals may install preventative products Surrey Pest Control such as new window and door screens, fresh caulking, brand-new door sweeps, and so on. Avoidance of pest invasions is one of the essential parts to green pest control. Some professionals utilize green pest control items initially and then follow them with conventional chemicals, which you might not want.

20	How do volumetric and vortex flowmeters differ in their ability to handle viscous fluids?	Volumetric flowmeters are suitable for measuring fluids with high viscosity and low Reynolds number, while vortex flowmeters are unsuitable for use on high viscosity liquids. The vortex meters require a minimum Reynolds number of 10,000 to 10,500 to operate properly.	"[""Principle analysis of various types of flowmeters\n(1) Principles of mechanics: Instruments belonging to such principles have differential pressure and rotor type using Bernoulli's theorem; impulse type and movable tube type using momentum theorem; direct mass type using Newton's second law; The target type of the momentum principle; the turbine type using the angular momentum theorem; the vortex type using the principle of fluid oscillation, the vortex type; the pitot tube type using the total static pressure difference; the volumetric type, the enthalpy, the trough type, and the like.\n(2) Electrical principle: The instruments used for such principles are electromagnetic, differential capacitive, inductive, strain resistant, etc.\n(3) Acoustic principle: Ultrasonic type, acoustic type (shock wave type), etc. are used for flow measurement using the acoustic principle.\n(4) Thermal principle: The heat, direct thermal, indirect calorimetry, etc., which measure the flow using the thermal principle.\n(5) Optical principle: laser type, photoelectric type, etc. are instruments belonging to such principles.\n(6) Originally based on physical principles: nuclear magnetic resonance, nuclear radiation, etc. are instruments of this type.\n(7) Other principles: Marking principle (trace principle, NMR principle), related principles, etc.\nFlow meter type\nInstruments that measure fluid flow are collectively referred to as flow meters or flow meters. The flowmeter is one of the important instruments in industrial measurement. With the development of industrial production, the accuracy and range of flow measurement requirements are getting higher and higher, and the flow measurement technology is changing with each passing day. Various types of flow meters have been introduced to suit various applications. More than 100 flow meters have been put into use. From different perspectives, flow meters have different classification methods. There are two commonly used classification methods. One is to classify according to the measurement principle adopted by the flowmeter: the second is to classify according to the structural principle of the flowmeter.\nClassified by flowmeter structure principle\nA volumetric flow meter is equivalent to a standard volume container that measures the flow medium continuously. The larger the traffic, the more times the metric is, and the higher the frequency of the output. The principle of the volumetric flowmeter is relatively simple and suitable for measuring fluids with high viscosity and low Reynolds number. According to the shape of the rotary body, the products currently produced are: an oval gear flow meter suitable for measuring liquid flow, a lumbar flowmeter (Roots flowmeter), a rotary piston and a scraper flowmeter; a servo type suitable for measuring gas flow Volumetric flowmeters, membranes and flowmeters, etc.\nUltrasonic flowmeter measurement principle\nWhen the ultrasonic beam propagates in the liquid, the flow of the liquid will cause a small change in the propagation time, and the change in the propagation time is proportional to the flow velocity of the liquid, and its relationship conforms to the following expression.\nθ is the angle between the sound beam and the direction of flow of the liquid\nM is the number of linear travels of the sound beam in the liquid\nD is the inner diameter of the pipe\nTup is the propagation time of the sound beam in the positive direction\nTdown is the propagation time of the sound beam in the reverse direction\nLet the speed of sound in the stationary fluid be c, the velocity of the fluid flow be u, and the propagation distance be L. When the sound wave is in the same direction as the fluid flow direction (ie, the downstream direction), the propagation velocity is c+u; otherwise, the propagation velocity is cu. Two sets of ultrasonic generators and receivers (T1, R1) and (T2, R2) are placed at two places separated by L. When T1 is in the forward direction and T2 transmits ultrasonic waves in the reverse direction, the time required for the ultrasonic waves to reach the receivers R1 and R2 respectively is t1 and t2, then\nSince the flow velocity of the fluid in the industrial pipeline is much smaller than the sound velocity, that is, c>>u, the time difference between the two is ▽t=t2-t1=2Lu/cc. Thus, the propagation velocity of the acoustic wave in the fluid is known. When it is known, the flow rate u can be obtained by measuring the time difference ▽t, and the flow rate Q can be obtained. The method of measuring the flow using this principle is called the time difference method. In addition, a phase difference method, a frequency difference method, or the like can be used."", 'Vortex Meters can be used for a wide range of fluids, i.e. liquids, gases and steam. They are to be seen as first choice, subject to verification to cover the requirements of a particular application.\nVortex meters are essentially frequency meters, since they measure the frequency of vortices generated by a “bluff body” or”shedder bar”. Vortices will only occur from a certain velocity (Re-number) on-wards, consequently vortex meters will have an elevated zero referred to as the “cut-off” point. Before the velocity becomes nil, the meter output will be cut to zero.\nAt a certain back-flow (above cut off point) some vortex meters could produce an output signal, which could lead to a false interpretation.\nAlso See: Vortex Flow Meter Animation\nVortex meters are actual volume flow meters, like orifice meters. These being intrusive meters like orifice meters, will cause the pressure drop as flow is increased, resulting in a permanent loss. consequently, liquids near their boiling point, could introduce cavitation as the pressure across the meter drops below the vapour pressure of the liquid. As soon as the pressure recovers above the vapour pressure the bubbles will impode. cavitation causes the meter to malfunction and should be avoided at all times.\nPrincipal – A fluid flowing with a certain velocity and passing a fixed obstruction generates vortices. The generation of vortices is known as Karman’s Vortices and culmination point of vortices will be approx. 1.2D downstream of bluff body. Strouhal discovered that as soon as a stretched wire starts vibrating in an air flow, frequency will be directly proportional to air velocity,\nSt= f*d/V0 (without dimention)\nSt= Strouhal’s number\nf=frequency of wire\nd=diameter of wire\nThis phenomena is called “vortex shedding” and the train of vortices is known as “Karman’s Vortex street”.\nThe frequency of vortex shedding is a direct linear function of fluid velocity and frequency depends upon the shape and face width of bluff body. Since the width of obstruction and inner diameter of the pipe will be more or less constant, the frequency is given by the expression-\nf= vortex frequency, Hz\nSt=strouhal’s number, dimention less\nV=Fluid velocity at the sheddar bar, m/s\nD=Inner diameter of the pipe, m\nc=constant (ratio d/D)\nd= Face width of sheddar bar, m\nThe pressure loss gradient across the vortex meter will have a similar shape to that of an orifice meter. the lowest point in pressure will be at the sheddar bar (comparable to vena contracta for orifice meter). downstream of this point of pressure will recover gradually, finally resulting in permanent pressure loss. To avoid cavitation, the pressure loss at vena-contracta is of interest.\nThe minimum back pressure required to ensure cavitation doesn’t occur is:\nPmin=3.2*Pdel + 1.25*Pv\nPmin= minimum required pressure at five pipe diameters downstream of the flow meter in bar\nPdel= calculated permanent pressure loss in bar\nPv= vapour pressure at operating temperature in bar\nRemember- for most vortex meters d/D will have range, 0.22 – 0.26, & frequency od vortices will depend on sizre of meter, larger the meter, lower the frequency. So the maximum diameter of vortex meter is restricted, because resolution of meter could become a problem.for control purposes. To overcome this problem, on-board digital multipliers are used which will multiply the vortex frequency without additional error.\nFrequency Sensing Principle –\nPiezo-electrical Sensors- a pair of piezo-electrical crystals is built into the sheddar bar. as the sheddar bar will be subject to alternating forces caused by shedding frequency, so will the piezo-crystals.\nVariable capacitance Sensors- a pair of variable capacitance sensors is built into the sheddar bar. As the sheddar bar will be subject to alternating micro movements caused by forces as a result of the shedding frequency, the capacitors will change their capacitance accordingly.\nPerformance of Vortex meters is influenced by-\nchange in sheddar bar geometry owning to erosion\nchange in sheddar bar geometry owning to deposits, i.e. Wax\ncorrosion of upstream piping\nchange in position of sheddar bar if not properly secured\nIn-general votex meter will consist of following electonics part-\npick-up elements, AC-pre amplifiers, AC-amplifier with filters, Noise abatement features, Schmitt Trigger, Microprocessor\nThe vortex shedding meter provides a linear digital (or analog) output signal without the use of separate transmitters or converters, simplifying equipment installation. Meter accuracy is good over a potentially wide flow range, although this range is dependent upon operating conditions. The shedding frequency is a function of the dimensions of the bluff body and, being a natural phenomenon, ensures good long term stability of calibration and repeatability of better than ±0.15% of rate. There is no drift because this is a frequency system.\nThe meter does have any moving or wearing components, providing improved reliability and reduced maintenance. Maintenance is further reduced by the fact that there are no valves or manifolds to cause leakage problems. The absence of valves or manifolds results in a particularly safe installation, an important consideration when the process fluid is hazardous or toxic.\nIf the sensor utilized is sufficiently sensitive, the same vortex shedding meter can be used on both gas and liquid. In addition, the calibration of the meter is virtually independent of the operating conditions (viscosity, density, pressure, temperature, and so on) whether the meter is being used on gas or liquid.\nThe vortex shedding meter also offers a low installed cost, particularly in pipe sizes below 6 in. (152 mm) diameter, which compares competitively with the installed cost of an orifice plate and differential pressure transmitter.\nThe limitation include meter size range. Meters below 0.5 in. (12 mm) diameter are not practical, and meters above 12 in. (300 mm) have limited application due their high cost compared to an orifice system and their limited output pulse resolution. The number of pulses generated per unit volume decreases on a cube law with increasing pipe diameter. Consequently, a 24 in. (610 mm) diameter vortex shedding meter with a typical blockage ratio of 0.3 would only have a full scale frequency output of approximately 5 Hz at 10 ft/s (3 m/s) fluid velocity.\nSelection and Sizing :\nAs the first step in the selection process, the operating conditions (process fluid temperature, ambient temperature, line pressure, and so on) should be compared with the meter specification. The meter wetted materials (including bonding agents) and sensors should then be checked for compatibility with the process fluid both with regard to chemical attack and safety. On oxygen, for example, non ferrous material should be used avoided or approached with extreme caution. The meter minimum and maximum flow rates for the given application should then be established.\nThe meter minimum flow rate is established by a Reynolds number of 10,000 to 10,500, the fluid density, and a minimum acceptable shedding frequency for the electronics. The maximum flow rate is governed by the meter pressure loss (typically two velocity heads), the onset of cavitation with liquids, and sonic velocity flow (choking) with gases. Consequently, the flow range for any application depends totally upon the operating fluid viscosity, density, and the vapour pressure, and the applications maximum flow rate and line pressure. On low viscosity products such as water, gasoline, and liquid ammonia, and with application maximum velocity of 15 ft/s (4.6 m/s), vortex shedding meters can have a rangeability of about 20:1 with a pressure loss of approximately 4 PSIG (27.4 kPa).\nThe meter’s good (“of rate”) accuracy and digital linear output signal make its application over wide flow ranges a practical proposition. The rangeability declines proportionally with increase in viscosity, decrease in density, or reductions in the maximum flow velocity of the process. Vortex shedding meters are therefore unsuitable for use on high viscosity liquids.\nVortex Meter Advantages\n• Vortex meters can be used for liquids, gases and steam\n• Low wear (relative to turbine flow meters)\n• Relatively low cost of installation and maintenance\n• Low sensitivity to variations in process conditions\n• Stable long term accuracy and repeatability\n• Applicable to a wide range of process temperatures\n• Available for a wide variety of pipe sizes\nVortex Flow Meter Limitations\n• Not suitable for very low flow rates\n• Minimum length of straight pipe is required upstream and downstream of the vortex meter\nVortex flow meters are suitable for a variety of applications and industries but work best with clean, low-viscosity, medium to high speed fluids.\nSome of the main uses include:\n• Custody transfer of natural gas metering\n• Steam measurement\n• Flow of liquid suspensions\n• General water applications\n• Liquid chemicals & pharmaceuticals\nAlso Read: Turbine Flow Meter Working Principle\n- Vortex Flow meter Working Animation\n- Difference between Different Types of Flow Meters\n- Types of Vortex Flow Meter Sensors\n- How to Select a Flow Meter\n- What is a Vortex flowmeter ?\n- V Cone Flow Meter Working Principle\n- Comparison of Venturi and Orifice flow meter\n- Swirl Flow Meters Working Principle\n- Flow Transmitter Rangeability\n- Flow Measurement Multiple Choice Questions']"	['<urn:uuid:9d2dd47d-55b4-4da0-826a-cb60182617c0>', '<urn:uuid:62cb8005-b1b0-4130-923e-fcdbf2907b07>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	14	40	2230
21	How do finger positioning requirements compare between traditional guitar fretting and slide guitar when it comes to hitting the correct pitch?	In traditional guitar playing, notes are played by pressing strings in the middle of the fret, whereas with slide guitar, the slide must be positioned directly above the metal fret dividing bar (at the point where one fret ends and the next begins) to achieve the correct pitch. Additionally, while regular guitar playing uses multiple fingers pressing strings to the fretboard, slide guitar technique requires the slide (typically on the third finger) to barely touch the strings while other fingers provide muting.	['By Jeffrey Pepper Rodgers\nThe first job of playing acoustic guitar is to make those strings ring, with a clear and rich tone. The second is to make them stop.\nThis second aspect of playing, controlling how long notes ring by way of muting, is often underappreciated, yet it’s essential in every kind of music. Muting adds necessary space between the notes and makes melodies and rhythms pop. Leo Kottke, whose signature sound is built with extraordinary control over the duration of notes, memorably said in these pages many years ago that letting the strings ring all the time and bleed into each other is “like drooling—there’s a beginning to everything but no end.”\nTo minimize the drool factor, you can employ several techniques for muting on guitar, using both the fretting and picking hands. This lesson runs through the basics and gives you practice muting single notes as well as chords, with examples drawn from rock, reggae, and blues.\nFretted notes are the simplest to mute on guitar. To cut a note short, you just stop pressing down with your fretting finger and leave it resting on the string. Practice that in Ex. 1, a little melody forever lodged in my head from high-school sports games. In the last measure, instead of shouting “Go big red!” (or your team of choice), strum a G barre chord. I’m using this example because the notes are cleanly separated and therefore require muting. Even where there are no rests between notes, pay attention to the staccato marks (the dots), which mean play those notes shorter than indicated—a staccato, or dotted, quarter note should sound more like an eighth note followed by an eighth rest, for instance. Pick the note (whether with a flatpick or your fingers) and then quickly release your fretting finger to stop it from ringing. Make sure you don’t lift your finger completely off the string—that may start it ringing again. The same goes for the G barre chord: After you strum, release your fretting fingers right away but hold the shape, lightly touching the strings.\nFollow the suggested fingerings: Use your first finger for notes on the second fret, second finger for the third fret, and so on. This keeps you in position and gives you muting practice with all your fingers.\nMuting Open Strings\nMuting open strings is a bit trickier—you need to touch the ringing open string with one (or more) of your fingers. Try Ex. 2. The notes are exactly the same as in Example 1, but the line now includes the open fourth and third strings. To mute the open-string notes, touch the string with your fret hand’s first finger. It’s harder to play open-string notes staccato compared with fretted notes, but you’ll get better with practice. Be sure to keep your fretting fingers close to the strings when you’re not using them so you can quickly put them into service for muting—this is a good all-around playing habit to minimize the movement of your fingers.\nNow play the same pattern in the keys of A (Ex. 3) and E (Ex. 4). In Ex. 3, keep your first finger in position for a barred A shape at the second fret, and after you pick the open fifth string, mute it with your fourth finger. In the second measure, mute the open fourth string with your first finger, and on the final A chords, mute the open strings with any free fingers. If you use a first-finger barre for A, your second, third, and fourth fingers are available for muting. Just lay them lightly across the strings. Use a similar strategy for Ex. 4. When you’re holding down an E chord, use your fourth finger to mute the open strings.\nThe next example uses a 3–2 clave-rhythm pattern, aka the Bo Diddley beat. This variant is a bit like Buddy Holly’s “Not Fade Away” as played by the Grateful Dead. The groove relies on chord chops separated by rests, so muting is essential.\nFirst play the pattern using G and C barre chords in Ex. 5. As with Example 1, muting is straightforward because all the notes are fretted. On the C chord, use a third-finger barre at the fifth fret so you can shift quickly back to the G. In Ex. 6, try the same pattern in the key of E, where you’ve got to deal again with open strings. On the E chord, use your fourth finger to mute the open strings. (You can also get your fret hand’s thumb into the action, by reaching around the edge of the fingerboard to touch the sixth string). For a little extra help with muting, flatten out your fretting fingers while remaining in the E shape so they touch the open treble strings.\nWith the quick change from E to A, try using a third-finger barre for A as you did with the C in the previous example. That way you can keep most of the fingers in position for the E shape.\nReggae is good for muting practice because it’s all about staccato chops on beats 2 and 4 with rests in between. Check out Ex. 7, which moves between Gm and Cm barre chords—think Bob Marley’s “I Shot the Sheriff.” Again, barre chords make for simple muting, so for a little extra challenge try Ex. 8—the same pattern with open chords in E minor. If you fret the Em chord with your first and second fingers, you can use your third and fourth fingers for muting. On the Am chord, mute with your fourth finger.\nNow Try Palm Muting\nYour fret hand doesn’t have to do all the work of muting. You can also mute by touching strings with your pick hand’s fingers or with the side of that hand’s palm. That’s the focus of Ex. 9, a basic 12-bar blues shuffle in E. You can play this pattern with no muting, but it doesn’t sound, well, bluesy. For a thumpier sound, lightly rest your palm on the strings near the bridge while you strike the bass strings. (This is easier to do when you’re playing with a flatpick or thumbpick than with your bare fingers, due to the angle of your hand.) Experiment with the placement of your palm: The closer you are to the soundhole, the deader the sound. If you rest your palm right on top of the saddle, you’ll mute the strings just slightly.\nTo dial in all those eighth-note triplets, which have a rest in the middle, you’ll need to mute with your fret hand, too. As in the previous examples, touch the open strings with any available fretting fingers.\nEven when you’re not keeping your palm on the strings for a thumpy blues sound, you can use your palm to help dampen the sound. If you’re strumming, say, the clave or reggae rhythms from earlier in this lesson, try landing your palm gently on the strings at the end of the strum motion—rather than striking the strings and then moving away from them. This sort of palm muting, in conjunction with fretting-hand muting, will add some thump to your rhythm.\nAs these last examples suggest, your muting motto should be: all hands on deck. The fret and pick hands work together to keep the notes contained and the rhythms nice and tight. And, of course, when the music calls for it, let those strings ring. Muting is great for contrast—it makes sustained notes and chiming chords sound even bigger.', 'Slide guitar, when done well, is a thing of absolute beauty. Over the years, slide guitar players from Ry Cooder to Duane Allman to Derek Trucks have shown innovative, creative and lyrical ways to use the famous bottleneck slide to great effect.\nLike any technique, practice, study and time is required to achieve full mastery. However, with slide guitar playing there are certain basic essentials you need to get down from the beginning to be on the right track.\nThese absolute basics are just little points of technique, approach and understanding that will make all the difference between become a competent slide guitarist, fast, or not. So here they are. Good luck, and enjoy!\nP.S. Whatever you do with tips 1-5, don’t leave without reading tip 6 – especially if you can’t figure out why your slide playing sounds out of tune even though you’re perfectly tuned!\nFirst thing’s first – what tuning are you in? There’s no one definitive answer here, as such. Many slide guitarists play in an open tuning (i.e. A tuning in which the open strings sound as a chord, hence ‘open G’ or ‘open E’). This is great for being able to slide into full chords with just one finger.\nHowever, conversely, Derek Trucks has famously played extensively in standard tuning, using a more linear, vocal-style approach.\nBoth styles have their pros and cons. But the point is – which one are you in? Make sure you know, you’re in it consciously, and you know the basics of how that tuning works. If you’re in ‘open G’ for example, and you’re playing a 12-bar blues, you can no doubt find the G chord easily enough, but where are the IV and V chords? C and D? Get to know your tuning!\nSlide guitar is far far easier on a guitar with a higher action (i.e. The strings are further away from the fretboard – the exact opposite of what usually makes guitar playing easier!)\nWhat this essentially amounts to is that any semi-serious slide guitarist will need a guitar dedicated entirely to slide playing. Thus they can have the action ridiculously high as it doesn’t matter – it isn’t used for non-slide playing.\nOf course, we can’t all just go out guitar shopping all the time due to practical and financial constraints! So be on the lookout for cheap second hand guitars in thrift shops/stores or online. If you can get hold of something, raise the action and dedicate it to slide playing, that’ll really help. It doesn’t matter how cheap, old and battered the guitar is, it’s just to get your technique up. Plus – it’s all part of the old bluesy charm!\nThe point on the high action feeds directly into this point on pressure. Don’t press the string down! The bottleneck slide should just glide along the string, the string should not be pressed onto the fretboard at all.\nThe high action helps with this as it creates more room to play with here. If you’re playing on a low-action setup strat for example, it’s almost impossible to avoid regularly pressing the string onto the fretboard.\nAgain, this approach is a little counter-intuitive as it’s the exact opposite of what you want to do in non-slide playing. However, as always, practice makes perfect, and when you get it right, and the sound is coming from that sweet spot, it makes it worthwhile.\nStart with the kind of pressure you’d apply to play a harmonic, and work from there.\nWhich finger to wear the slide on? The short answer is, your 3rd (ring) finger.\nThe long answer is either finger 2, 3, or 4, whichever feels most natural and comfortable. You may just find that wearing it on finger 4 feels like the most natural thing in the world and your playing rockets, in which case, obviously, carry on!\nHowever the logic behind wearing it on finger 3 is that, you have enough fingers behind that (1 and 2) to give adequate muting (see next point!) or to play non-slide sections of the song, but at the same time finger 3 is strong enough to give enough control over the slide.\nFinger 2 is even stronger, but leaves only one finger for muting or playing non-slide parts. Finger 4 leaves 3 fingers for this, but means your pinky is in control of the slide. Meaning finger 3 is the happy medium – so start from there!\nMake sure whichever fingers you have free behind the slide dampen the strings slightly i.e. Enough to provide a kind of non-humming canvas for your slide part to sit on top of.\nNot doing so may mean a lot of unwanted noise and strings ringing out (as after all, your slide part is fundamentally not pressing down any strings, just gliding along). This adds up to quite a messy sounding part, however good the rest of your slide technique may be.\nThis muting should be done with just the amount of pressure you’d use to stop some strings ringing out while you’re not playing. Just a light touch, making contact, without hammering on any chords!\n6. End Of The Fret!\nOK, now you’re all set. You’re in a slide-friendly tuning, on a high-action guitar, the slide’s on the right finger, and your strings are muted. You start playing over some chords, and it sounds horrendous. It sounds like you’re not in tune even though you double checked. What’s going on?\nThis is absolutely vital – do not position the slide in the middle of the fret, position it at the end of the fret. For example, if you want to play the ‘e’ note at the 12th fret of the 1st (e) string, you do not position the slide above the middle of the 12th fret, where you would if playing non-slide.\nInstead, position the slide directly above the actual metal fret dividing bar, i.e. At the point where fret 12 ends and fret 13 begins. Here you’ll find the correct pitch.\nSuch a minor adjustment, but so central to playing slide guitar!']	['<urn:uuid:53ed2c7c-70d1-4488-be9a-3f7573264890>', '<urn:uuid:8b86c201-b725-49fa-8031-f2dd8c5f9ef8>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	21	82	2268
22	parrot veterinarian researching common health problems affecting captive lories treatment options	Lories are susceptible to several diseases, with common problems including Candida, flagellates, and bacterial infections such as E. coli and Salmonella. Polyoma virus is an important viral infection in this group. Rapid intervention is crucial, and a quarantine cage is essential. Some conditions can be identified through crop smears using a microscope. For flagellates, preventative measures can be taken using Ronidazol (such as 'Roniplus') in Europe and South Africa, though resistance can occur if insufficient medication is given.	"['All material Copyright © 1991–2002 by the Canadian Parrot Symposium unless otherwise noted. For permission and information about reprinting articles, please e-mail your request.\nKeeping LoriesJos Hubers\nLories are among the most colourful of all parrots. They are found mainly in Indonesia, the Philippines, Australasia, Papua New Guinea, and neighbouring islands as well as some Pacific islands. Many species are loved by the local population; an example is the Purple Capped Lory, Lorius domicellus, kept by the Ambonese as house pets. Despite their beautiful colours, lories are relatively seldom kept by those in aviculture. The reason for this is well known; their basic feed is liquid, which results in liquid faeces which can be sprayed over a relatively large area. Fortunately, it has been proven that with the right accommodation, these unique birds can be easily and well maintained.\nBreeders who change over from seed-eating birds to lories make a common mistake of failing to adapt their accommodation, with resulting problems. Their accommodation must be totally adapted, i.e., everything must be totally washable. When the climate during the entire year is favourable, the birds may be permanently kept outside in hanging cages. However, in many countries they can only be kept if a suitable indoor space is available. This space must constantly be kept clean, which means it should ideally be tiled. The cages should be made of synthetic material or mesh, perhaps combined with aluminium or steel. Wood is not to be recommended. Several materials are suggested as a floor covering. In outside aviaries, grass or brick could be used. In large, covered aviaries, sand is sometimes used; in smaller aviaries and cages, wood shavings. If all cages are sprayed clean every day, good ventilation is necessary to prevent too much humidity.\nAs far as feed is concerned, this has changed greatly in the past few years. Many breeders use a pre-mixed food. Note that same pre-mixed food is not always suitable for all lory species. The diet of a Whiskered Lorikeet, Oreopsittacus arfaki, is different from that of a Green Naped Lorikeet, Trichoglossus haematodus haematodus. Not all suppliers of food are knowledgable, and quite often it appears that the food is formulated by guesswork. Figures regarding percentage compositions do not necessarily mean anything. Breeders should also know if components are capable of being absorbed, especially where proteins are concerned. Once a breeder has formulated his own feeding regime and has had positive results, the formula need not be changed. One reason to change to commercially available feed is when there are time constraints. Commercial feed usually demands less time than that which is prepared at home.\nLories are as susceptible to diseases as any other living being. A lory can fall ill for any number of reasons. One of the most common problems is that of Candida, flagellates and bacterial infections such as E. coli and Salmonella. Polyoma virus is proving to be an important viral infection within this group.\nRapid intervention is very important. A quarantine or hospital cage is a must. If a microscope is available, some techniques are easily learned, e.g. crop smears. Candida and flagellate infections can be identified from these smears. Preventative measures can really only be taken against flagellates since resistance is not built up to medications used against this disease organism. In Europe and South Africa the medication used is Ronidazol (trade name ""Roniplus"" for example). Resistance can occur when too little of the medicine is given.\nSpecies in European Aviculture\nThere are approximately 120 known species and subspecies of lories. As previously mentioned, they are scattered over an enormous area. Of all the species, several are kept in aviaries, some of them common, others not so common. Of the Chalcopsitta species, the Yellow Streaked Lory, Chalcopsitta scintillata, was the most commonly kept species. It appears that it is now becoming overshadowed by the recently much imported Cardinal Lory, C. cardinalis, which is also proving to be very prolific. All the species of this genus are strong birds, although they do not breed very quickly. The Duivenbode Lory, C. duivenbodei, remains the most difficult species to breed.\nOf the genus Pseudeos, there is only one species although it appears in a range of colour forms. The Dusky Lory, Pseudeos fuscata, is known basically in two colour variants, the yellow and the orange/red variant. It is a hardy and easily bred species.\nClosely related genera are the red lories or the Eos species. Of these most are known in captivity and kept in Europe. The most familiar is the Moluccan Red Lory, Eos bornea bornea, the least familiar being the Blue Eared Lory, E. semilarvata. Generally, they are lories which are easily bred. Recently, the endangered Red and Blue Lory, Eos histrio taluensis, has been successfully bred in Europe.\nThe species with the most character belong to the genus Lorius. Most of these have been bred quite successfully and certainly, with the recently imported Yellow Bibbed Lory, L.chlorocercus, good results have been obtained. In South Africa as in Europe the Chattering Lory, L.garrulus, is the most frequently kept species.\nThe largest genus is Trichoglossus. Those which are kept are usually relatively easily bred. The best known are perhaps the Green Naped Lory, Trichoglossus haematodus haematodus, the Swainson\'s Lory, T.h.moluccanus, and the Goldies Lorikeet, T.goldiei. This last species is sometimes placed in the genus Psitteuteles, though since this has not been officially acknowledged I am not going to use this name. Several species are virtually unknown, of which the Ponape Lory, T.rubigtinosus, is the least known.\nThe genus Charmosyna includes the Stella or Papuan Lory, Charmosyna papou and the Red Flanked Lorikeet, C.placentis which are the most commonly kept species. Both are regularly and successfully bred. Less commonly kept are the Fairy Lorikeets, C.pulchella, Josephine\'s Lory, C.p.josefinae and Red Spotted Lorikeets, C.rubronotata. Striated Lorikeets, C.multistriata, are seen only very seldomly.\nThe other genera such as Phygis, Glossopsitta, Vini, Oreopsittacus and Neopsittacus are represented by a limited number of species and then in only certain countries. Three species of Glossopsitta are known, mainly only in Australia: the Purple Crowned Lory, Glossopsitta porphyrocephala; the Little Lorikeet, G.pusillus; and the Musk Lorikeet, G.concinna. The latter is bred successfully outside of Australia.\nThere is only one species of Phygis known, the Solitary Lory, Phygis solitarius, which is only seldomly bred. The latter is also true for Vini species. Only the Blue Crowned Lorikeet, Vini australis, is bred successfully by several breeders. The genus Oreopsittacus has only one species, the Whiskered Lorikeet, Oreopsittacus arfaki which has three subspecies. The subspecies O.a.major is bred successfully, especially in Europe.\nThe genus Neopsittacus has two species, each with three subspecies which are known. Both species are bred, but not frequently. The Emerald Lorikeet, Neopsittacus pullicauda alpinus, has recently been bred successfully, in particular in the Netherlands and Germany. The Musschenbroek\'s Lorikeet, N.musschenbroekii, is kept and bred in much larger numbers than the previous species.']"	['<urn:uuid:1a926668-a920-4d1c-a0f5-f7b627051f30>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	11	78	1153
23	How does sewage pollution affect coastal waters and shellfish safety during different seasons of the year?	Sewage pollution severely impacts coastal waters, with water companies allowing raw or partially-treated sewage to run into rivers and watersheds for over 3.9 million hours last year. The safety risk varies by season, particularly regarding bacteria like Vibrio vulnificus, which is most likely to be present during warm months. In South Carolina, for example, shellfish harvesting is generally not permitted between April and October due to these seasonal risks. The contamination is widespread - in the UK, the River Teign in Devon experienced 2,198 cases of sewage contamination, while water companies issued 5,517 sewage discharge notifications over a 12-month period, an 87.6% increase.	"[""Contamination could have caused E.coli or norovirus\nShellfish areas around the UK were polluted by human sewage tens of thousands of times last year, data reveals.\nThe River Teign in Devon was the worst hit of the shellfishing areas, suffering 2,198 cases of sewage contamination, it’s claimed.\nThe River Ribble in North Yorkshire and Lancashire was the second-worst affected, met 1,713 incidents.\nIn all, water companies allowed raw or partially-treated sewage to run into rivers and watersheds or into the sea for a total of more than 3.9 million hours last year, Volgens die Top of the Poops website, which uses Environment Agency official statistics.\nBut even these figures are an underestimate, it says, because the data is “poorly collected by the water companies, with monitoring defective or in many cases completely absent”.\nSewage contaminated areas where shellfish are found more than 30,000 times last year, the data shows. Shellfish can become unfit for human consumption when polluted by sewage because of the health risks.\nIt coincides with a report from Surfers Against Sewage that finds water companies are increasing the discharge of harmful sewage into our seas and rivers, with devastating consequences for the environment.\nWater firms issued 5,517 sewage discharge notifications over a 12-month period to September this year, an increase of 87.6 persent.\nIn Julie, Southern Water was fined a record £90m for dumping 21 billion litres of raw sewage into the sea from 2010-2015.\nTot 10,000 contaminated oysters are believed to have entered the food chain and dogs became violently ill after swimming in the sea.\nThe Environment Agency found high levels of faecal matter, E.coli and norovirus, Canterbury Crown Court heard.\nIn summer this year, the Whitstable Oyster Fishery Company had to stop selling oysters after customers reported suffering from norovirus, prompting the boss to warn sewage leaks could threaten shellfish companies’ businesses.\nIndustry chiefs say buying from licensed fishermen who clean shellfish of bacteria is safe but anyone catching them to eat is at risk.\nLast month the government provoked fury for vetoing more severe action against pumping raw sewage into rivers and seas, eventually bowing to pressure and performing a U-turn.\nAn Environment Agency spokesperson said it was working with water companies to ensure overflows were properly controlled “and the harm they do to the environment stopped”.\nMonitoring of the sewerage network has increased 14-fold in the past five years, het hulle bygevoeg. “In the next four years, water companies will undertake 800 investigations and over 800 improvement schemes to storm overflows.

(New 12/99.)\nThe organism Vibrio vulnificus causes wound infections, gastroenteritis or a serious syndrome known as ""primary septicema."" V. vulnificus infections are either transmitted to humans through open wounds in contact with seawater or through consumption of certain improperly cooked or raw shellfish. Studies have shown that V. vulnificus is most likely to be present during warm months. In South Carolina, shellfish harvesting (both commercial and recreational) is generally not permitted between April and October. The harvest season will vary depending on environmental conditions.\nThis bacterium has been isolated from water, sediment, plankton and shellfish (oysters, clams and crabs) located in the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Coast as far north as Cape Cod and the entire U.S. West Coast. Cases of illness have also been associated with brackish lakes in New Mexico and Oklahoma.\nWound infections result from contaminating an existing open wound with seawater harboring the organism, or by cutting part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism.\nAll individuals who consume foods contaminated with this organism are susceptible to gastroenteritis, which usually develops within 16 hours of eating the contaminated food. Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bulbous skin lesions.\nHigh-Risk Factors: Certain health conditions put you at risk for serious illness or death from V. vulnificus infection. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). These individuals are strongly advised not to consume raw or inadequately cooked seafood. Some of these conditions have no signs or symptoms so you may not know you are at risk. If you are an older adult, you also may be at increased risk because older people more often have these risk conditions than younger people. Check with your doctor if you are unsure of your risk.\nThese high-risk conditions include:\nIF YOU ARE OR THINK YOU MAY BE IN ANY OF THESE RISK CATEGORIES, YOU SHOULD NOT EAT RAW OYSTERS.\nAvoid exposure of recent or healing wounds, cuts, punctures, or burns, to warm seawater. When swimming or wading, temporarily cover wounds with watertight wrap. The V. vulnificus lives naturally in warm seawater, can enter a person’s wound and, in some cases extend to the bloodstream and cause a potentially fatal illness. The highly invasive nature of this bacterium is cause for special concern.\nConsumers in high-risk categories should avoid consumption of raw shellfish, particularly oysters. Oysters are filter-feeding animals that can concentrate Vibrio bacteria from the water into their system. The bacteria are not a result of pollution; so, although oysters should always be obtained from reputable sources, eating oysters from ""clean"" waters or in reputable restaurants with high turnover does not provide protection. Eating raw oysters with hot sauce or while drinking alcohol does not kill the bacteria, either.\nWhen eating shellfish, particularly oysters, be sure they are properly and thoroughly cooked. Thorough cooking kills the Vibrio bacteria and markedly reduces the risk of becoming ill. However, steaming oysters as is done at an oyster roast does not always provide enough heat to kill all the Vibrio bacteria. Additional heating is necessary to impart a noticeable cooked appearance.\nAvoid cross-contamination of previously cooked shellfish with raw shellfish. A common cause of cross-contamination is storing cooked shellfish in the original container used for raw shellfish, or storing raw and cooked shellfish in the same area.\nDrinking Alcoholic Beverages Regularly & Liver Disease: If you drink alcoholic beverages regularly, you may be at risk for liver disease, and, as a result, at risk for serious illness or death from raw oysters. Even drinking two to three drinks each day can cause liver disease, which may have no symptoms. Liver disease will put you at increased risk for V. vulnificus infection from raw oysters. The risk of death is almost 200 times greater in those with liver disease than those without liver disease.\nAt Restaurants: Order oysters fully cooked. Some states display notices for those at risk. Use them as reminders of how to avoid illness.\nCooking at Home:\nIn the Shell: Cook live oysters in boiling water for three to five minutes after shells open. Use small pots to boil or steam oysters. Do not cook too many oysters in the same pot, because the ones in the middle may not get fully cooked. Discard any oysters that do not open during cooking. Steam live oysters four to nine minutes in a steamer that’s already steaming.\nShucked: Boil or simmer for at least three minutes or until edges curl. Fry in oil for at least three minutes at 375 °F. Broil 3 inches from heat for three minutes. Bake (as in Oysters Rockefeller) for 10 minutes at 450 °F.\nThe culturing of the organism from wounds, diarrheic stools or blood is used to diagnose the illness. The infective dose for gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy individuals is unknown, but for predisposed persons, septicemia can occur with doses of less than 100 total organisms.\nRare! No major outbreaks of illness have been attributed to this organism. Sporadic cases have occurred in South Carolina, becoming more prevalent during the warmer months. To date no fatalities have been related to eating oysters harvested in S.C. waters. Most healthy individuals are not troubled by V. vulnificus infections from water or food. Also, extensive federal and state regulatory programs monitor the production and marketing of raw shellfish to assure product safety. Thus, the V. vulnificus problem is primarily restricted to individuals in the risk categories. These individuals are advised not to eat raw shellfish.\nPage maintained by: Home & Garden Information Center\nThis information is supplied with the understanding that no discrimination is intended and no endorsement of brand names or registered trademarks by the Clemson University Cooperative Extension Service is implied, nor is any discrimination intended by the exclusion of products or manufacturers not named.

24	What role do special hooks and careful handling techniques play in modern fishing practices, and how do these methods impact fish conservation efforts?	In modern fishing, specialized hooks serve specific purposes - from thin dry hooks for small nymphs to stronger variants like H 490 for trophy fish. The Dohiku HDJ and HDN SP hooks are designed for different species and situations, with varying wire strengths and sizes. These hook choices directly connect to conservation efforts through catch and release practices. Catch and release has become a crucial conservation tool, first introduced in Michigan in 1952, and now widely used globally to prevent overfishing and ensure sustainability. The success of catch and release largely depends on proper handling techniques and hook selection. Barbless hooks are particularly important as they minimize injury and reduce handling time. When combined with proper handling techniques - avoiding excessive fighting time, maintaining fish's protective slime layer, and proper gill protection - these practices have shown extremely high survival rates of 97% or more for released fish.	"[""Recommendations for basic selection of fly hooks for tying tungsten jig nymphs.\nThis year's fishing season is slowly coming to an end, the winter is all around and the time is coming when we should move from the water to the warmth of our home, to the fly tying vise. In addition to choosing a lot of new fly tying materials, the most important thing for every fly tyier is choosing the right fly tying hooks. The time when there was a limited number of fly fishing hooks is long gone and the development is moving at enormous speed. This article is dedicated to my selection of the most used hooks for tying modern river tungsten nymphs.\nThis hook is designed primarily for dry flies, but when tying small nymphs it is indispensable for me. This fly hook is recommended especially for the smallest flies with which we target medium-sized fish. It is not a hook for trophy fish! A thin, dry hook enters the fish mouth more easily and is sharper than conventional jig hooks.\nThe secret is, before tying with dry fly hooks, bending the hook arm into a jig shape. With such a small change you will get the most delicate jig hook! Bending is a bit more difficult at first, be careful not to break the hook. If you do not have this Hanak Competition hook at hand, use the Hends BL 454 hook to replace it with a similar effect.\nAvailable sizes: 10 - 20\nThe hook, which I have connected mainly with trout fishing, is thin enough for good penetration into the fish's mouth, but at the same time I do not have to worry about playing larger fish. This way I would define the H 450 series. The big advantage of these hooks is the wide bend and the long throat.\nThe shape of the hook is designed so that even on a small hook you can use larger tungsten beads. On hooks size 16 I use tungsten heads with a size of 3.3 mm.\nAvailable sizes: 10 - 16\nAnother hook I choose is H 480, which, like the previous type, has a very wide bend, but differs with a needle point and is produced up to size 20! The wide bend helps hooking a fish, even if the fish are not very appetizing and just suck the fly and want to spit it straight away. These hooks are also suitable for larger fish.\nIf I were to compare the H 450 and H 480, they would mainly differ in the way they penetrate in the fish's mouth because of the different point shape. I cannot say exactly that one of the hooks to be compared is simply better, but in some situations one of the types may be more successful.\nAvailable sizes: 6 - 20\nH 490 is a stronger variant of the H 480, designed for truly large fish and can be used on premium fishing stretches where trophy fish is targeted.\nAvailable sizes: 10 - 16\nThe hook, which I enjoy to use in small sizes on smaller waters for catching brownies and grayling, is the Slovak jig hook Dohiku HDJ. This fly hook is also produced in extremely small sizes - 18, 20, to 22. Size 22 is actually the smallest jig hook on the market, which is designed mainly for fly fishing competitors and fits perfectly on tiny grayling flies.\nAll micro jig hooks, however, when compared to dry hooks of the same size, will be slightly larger. In larger sizes, the strength of the wire increases and you do not have to worry about these hooks to use for larger fish.\nAvailable sizes: 6 - 22\nThe last hook presented is again from the production of the Slovak company Dohiku, which I used recently during abroad expeditions and I caught on it the biggest fish of the season. In the smallest sizes I use Dohiku HDN SP during competitions on my local Czech rivers e.g. Vltava river. The hook is designed primarily for brownies and rainbows, which corresponds to the strength of the wire. The hook has a special shape of the shank, which is the same as the bent dry fly hooks (see hook No 1 in this article).\nAvailable sizes: 12 - 18\nFor competition purposes, Dohiku also produces a version of SPR, from a thiner wire, but this version is still waiting for my testing.\nAvailable sizes: 12 - 16\nWell, that is my recommendation of the fly hooks for tungsten jigs. As you can see there are differences in each hook type and i recommend to think about the usage of the hook before the purchase!\nBelow you can see some patterns tied on the hooks mentioned in the article."", 'Catch and release is a practice within recreational fishing intended as a technique of conservation. After capture, the fish are unhooked and returned to the water before experiencing serious exhaustion or injury. Using barbless hooks, it is often possible to release the fish without removing it from the water (a slack line is frequently sufficient).\nIn the United Kingdom, catch and release has been performed for more than a century by coarse fishermen in order to prevent target species from disappearing in heavily fished waters. Since the latter part of the 20th century, many salmon and sea trout rivers have been converted to complete or partial catch and release.\nIn the United States, catch and release was first introduced as a management tool in the state of Michigan in 1952 as an effort to reduce the cost of stocking hatchery-raised trout. Anglers fishing for fun rather than for food accepted the idea of releasing the fish while fishing in so-called ""no-kill"" zones. Conservationists have advocated catch and release as a way to ensure sustainability and to avoid overfishing of fish stocks. Lee Wulff also promoted catch and release as he observed the Atlantic Salmon population dwindle.\nIn Australia, catch and release caught on slowly, with some pioneers practicing it the 1960s, and the practice slowly becoming more widespread in the 1970s and 1980s. Catch and release is now widely used to conserve — and indeed is critical in conserving — vulnerable fish species like the large, long lived native freshwater Murray Cod and the prized, slowly growing, heavily fished Australian bass, heavily fished coastal species like Dusky Flathead and prized gamefish like striped marlin.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, catch and release has been used as a conservation tool for atlantic salmon and sea trout fisheries since 2003. A number of fisheries now have mandatory catch and release regulations. Catch and release for coarse fish has been used by sport anglers for as long as these species have been fished for on this island. However catch and release for Atlantic salmon has required a huge turn about in how many anglers viewed the salmon angling resource. To encourage anglers to practice catch and release in all fisheries a number of Government led incentives have been implemented.\nIn Switzerland, catch and release fishing is considered inhumane and will be banned beginning in September 2008.\nEffective catch and release fishing techniques avoid excessive fish fighting and handling times, avoid damage to fish skin, scale and slime layers (that leave fish vulnerable to fungal skin infections) by nets, dry hands and dry surfaces, and avoid damage to throat ligaments and gills by poor handling techniques.\nThe use of barbless hooks is an important aspect of catch and release; barbless hooks reduce injury and handling time, increasing survival. Frequently, fish caught on barbless hooks can be released without being removed from the water, and the hook(s) effortlessly slipped out with a single flick of the pliers or leader. Barbless hooks can be purchased from several major manufacturers or can be created from a standard hook by crushing the barb(s) flat with needle-nosed pliers. Some anglers avoid barbless hooks because of the erroneous belief that too many fish will escape. Concentrating on keeping the line tight at all times while fighting fish, equipping lures that do not have them with split rings, and using recurved point or ""Triple Grip"" style hooks on lures, will keep catch rates with barbless hooks as high as those achieved with barbed hooks. Triple Grip treble hooks work particularly well with the barbs crushed.\nTo make a hook barbless, the barb is simply crushed flat with a pair of needle-nosed pliers; a 2-second task. Medium grit sandpaper can be further used to ensure complete removal of the barb, but this is not necessary and is rarely done.\nKey aspects of catch and release include:\nIf fish are removed from the water for unhooking and/or a photo, key aspects of handling include:\nThe effects of catch and release vary from species to species. A number of scientific studies have shown extremely high survival rates (97%+) (e.g. ) for released fish if handled correctly and particularly if caught on artificial baits such as lures. Fish caught on lures are usually hooked cleanly in the mouth, minimising injury and aiding release. Other studies have shown somewhat lower but encouragingly high survival rates for fish gut-hooked on bait if the line is cut and the fish is released without trying to remove the hook. This procedure should be followed for any gut-hooked fish intended or required to be released.\nCatch and release is a conservation practice developed to prevent overharvest of fish stocks in the face of growing human populations, mounting fishing pressure, increasingly effective fishing tackle and techniques, inadequate fishing regulations and enforcement, and habitat degradation. Scientific studies are showing generally high rates of survival for released fish — which is the aim of catch and release — and the alternative of banning or severely restricting angling is generally unreasonable or not feasible. Fishermen have been practicing catch and release for decades, including with some highly pressured fish species, and no significant, measurable effects from catch and release have been observed, indicating that mortality rates from catch and release are not excessive. Conversely, had recreational fishing for these highly pressured species continued to the present on a totally catch and kill basis, some of these species fisheries would certainly have collapsed by now. Catch and release is criticized by some who claim it is unethical to stress fish for sport or amusement. Some oppose catch and release only but do not oppose fishing for food, per se.\nProponents of catch and release dispute the suggestion that fish hooked in the mouth feel pain. Many point to the fact that fish consume spiny, hard prey items such as crayfish, molluscs and other fish, and require a tough, insensitive mouth to do so; such a mouth is unlikely to feel a hook point. Some point to studies that claim fish lack the higher brain functions that physiologists often associate with the ability to feel pain. And some quote the many observations fishermen have made of fish succeeding in throwing a lure and then turning around and striking the same lure again, an unlikely behavior if being hooked in mouth causes pain. Similarly, all observations from fishermen support the contention that hooked fish fight because they feel the pull of fishing line, not because the hook in their mouth hurts. Suitably strong tackle reduces fighting times and reduces stress on captured fish.\nOpponents of catch and release point out that fish are highly evolved vertebrates that share many of the same neurological structures that, in humans, are associated with pain perception. They point to studies that show that, neurologically, fish are quite similar to ""higher"" vertebrates and that blood chemistry reveals that hormones and blood metabolites associated with stress are quite high in fish struggling against hook and line. The idea that fish do not feel pain in their mouths has been studied at the University of Edinburgh and the Roslin Institute by injecting bee venom and acetic acid into the lips of rainbow trout; the fish responded by rubbing their lips along the sides and floors of their tanks in an effort to relieve themselves of the sensation. Lead researcher Dr. Lynne Sneddon wrote ""Our research demonstrates nociception and suggests that noxious stimulation in the rainbow trout has adverse behavioral and physiological effects. This fulfills the criteria for animal pain."" However, others argue this may demonstrate a chemical sensitivity rather than pain; notably, no similar result has been obtained with trauma, such as using fishhooks. Thus, the evidence for pain sensation in fish is at best ambiguous. the last reference shows that fish can detect toxins, as demonstrated by Brown, but that this is very different from pain. Some anglers accept the arguments that fish are highly evolved vertebrates that can feel pain, but again point out that that fish have tough, bony mouths that often consume spiny, hard prey items, and that hooks therefore do not cause fish pain, despite fish being capable of feeling pain.\nWhile a number of scientific studies have now found survival rates of shallow water fish caught-and-released on fly and lure have extremely high survival rates (95–97%) and modestly high survival rates on bait (70–90%, depending on species, bait, hook size, etc.) emerging research suggests catch and release does not work very well with fish caught when deep sea fishing.\nMost deep sea fish species suffer from the sudden pressure change when wound to the surface from great depths; these species cannot adjust their body\'s physiology quickly enough to follow the pressure change. The result is called ""barotrauma"". Fish with barotrauma will have their enormously swollen swim-bladder protruding from their mouth, bulging eyeballs, and often sustain other, more subtle but still very serious injuries. Upon release, fish with barotrauma will be unable to swim or dive due to the swollen swim-bladder. The common practice has been to deflate the swim bladder by pricking it with a thin sharp object before attempting to release the fish.\nEmerging research indicates both barotrauma and the practice of deflating the swimbladder are both highly damaging to fish, and that survival rates of caught-and-released deep-sea fish is extremely low. However, barotrauma requires that fish be caught at least 30 - 50 feet below the surface. Many surface caught fish, such as billfish, and all fish caught from shore, do not meet this criterion and thus do not suffer barotrauma.\nIn light of this research, anglers must show responsibility and restraint when deep sea fishing and, after catching and keeping a reasonable number of deep sea fish, cease fishing for them.']"	['<urn:uuid:2cf489ff-9cd8-4004-8c9e-af3ed93cef91>', '<urn:uuid:11a3a467-c87f-4562-93ac-9d4f50d59342>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	23	148	2424
25	How has the understanding of dietary fats changed over time, and what are the current recommendations for which fats to include or avoid in a healthy diet?	The understanding of dietary fats has evolved significantly. In the 1960s, all high-fat diets were considered harmful, leading to widespread advice to avoid cholesterol and saturated fats. This oversimplified view led to the promotion of partially hydrogenated oils, which we now know are harmful. Current recommendations are more nuanced: people should choose foods with healthy unsaturated fats (like fish, nuts, and most plant oils), limit foods high in saturated fat (such as butter, whole milk, cheese, coconut and palm oil, and red meats), and try to completely avoid trans fats. Professional organizations like the American Heart Association recommend using non-tropical plant oils like canola or olive oil, while emphasizing that the overall dietary pattern, including plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and fish, is more important than focusing on single ingredients to avoid.	"['On November 7th, the FDA announced that it will remove partially hydrogenated oils from the GRAS list (Generally Regarded As Safe). These oils contain trans-fats. The agency has concluded that the voluntary replacement of such fats has not progressed far enough to adequately protect Americans from the negative cardiac health dangers that they pose. This is a good, if seriously belated, decision. It is worth looking back at the history of this food ingredient to see how we came to be eating trans-fats in the first place and what role food labeling (mandatory and marketing) played in that story.\nThe Origins Of The Low Fat Diet Push\nIn the 1960s, medical and public health officials became alarmed at the high rates of cardiac-related sickness and deaths in the American population. A correlation was found with high-fat diets and soon there was widespread advice to avoid two particular categories of fat – cholesterol and saturated fats. In retrospect this was a severe over-simplification and a demonstration that correlation does not mean causation. Unfortunately a “low fat diet” caught on as “the answer” with the public and with food marketers. More and more food products entered the market with voluntary labels such as “Low Fat,” “Cholesterol-Free,” “Zero Fat,” and “Low in Saturated Fat."" This trend didn’t turn out to be health-promoting. In many foods with lowered fat content, additional sugar was added to make it more palatable. For many years, eggs were demonized because of their cholesterol content when in fact they are an excellent and reasonably priced protein source. All the decades of focus on avoiding fats or certain fats did nothing to stem the obesity epidemic, and reductions we do see in heart attacks and strokes are thus probably linked to other factors.\nHow Misguided Food Labeling Led To Our Consumption Of Trans-Fats\nWhen the negative focus on fats began, animal fats were major sources of cholesterol and saturated fat in our diets (butter, lard, bacon fat). Tropical oils, such as palm and coconut, were additional sources of saturated fats. The pressure to find alternatives to these oils coincided with an increasingly abundant supply of oil from the domestic soybean crop. Soybeans were a minor US crop before World War II, but by the 1970s they had become the major source of protein for animal feeds. A soybean contains ~20% oil and so it rapidly became the lowest-cost oil in the American food supply.\nThere are, however, issues with soybean oil. It has properties that make it unsuitable as a simple substitute for animal and tropical fats in various applications (if you are interested there is a short course on the chemistry of oils and fats at the end of this post). It couldn’t be used to make a substitute for stick butter because it was liquid at room temperature. Soybean oil was also poorly suited for deep fat frying applications because it didn’t have the necessary “fry life” to fit in the burgeoning fast-food industry of that time. After a relatively short period of high temperature cooking, it would develop off-tastes. In other products it tended to turn rancid faster that other alternatives.\nFood scientists had earlier developed “partial hydrogenation,"" a process through which most of those issues could be addressed (hydrogenated oils began to be sold early in the 20th century). Hydrogenation allowed food companies to turn soybean oil into margarine and then to market it against butter as a perceived healthier option. In the anti-fat environment, oil processors could sell partially hydrogenated oil to the fast food industry, which then promoted the supposed health advantages of their switch to “vegetable oil.” The converted oils were also extensively marketed in products with the marketing claim, “No Tropical Oils.” This was somewhat of an intended health claim, and also a means of competing with the low cost imported oils from palm and coconut. The hydrogenated oil also had some unique properties which were particularly useful for certain baked goods.\nBetween low cost and these positive-sounding messages, hydrogenated soybean oil found its way into a host of foods in the US diet. When mandatory nutrient content labeling was established in 1990, Congress failed to fund the education component envisioned in the bill. Thus, the official ""back label"" only served to further propel the sales of various fat-avoidance products and trans-fats, and did nothing to stem the disinformation on the front, marketing-oriented labels.\nEarly on, the substitutions being made by these commercial entities were done with confidence that they were a good thing. Unfortunately, that was not true.\nThe Solution Becomes The Problem\nUnfortunately, during the hydrogenation process “trans” versions of certain fats are generated. The term trans has to do with a specific chemical configuration in the fat molecule. In most oils and fats that configuration is generally of the “cis” configuration and rarely the “trans” (again, more details below). It was this subtle difference which was later found to change the way that these fats functioned in our bodies. Most of the fat we eat is simply converted to energy, but some is incorporated in the membranes that surround each of our cells. Some of the fat can also end up in plaque deposited in our veins and arteries. The health issues for trans-fats played out importantly in those functions.\nIn retrospect, Americans would have been much better served in terms of flavor and health if they had stuck with the animal fats and tropical oils instead of hydrogenated oils (French fries have never been as delicious as when they were cooked in beef tallow!)\nEventually, evidence began to emerge that trans-fats were problematic for human health when consumed in larger quantities. This only very slowly built up to the point where regulators raised red flags and began to require trans-fat labeling in 2006. Many food companies shifted away from trans-fats and to market foods as having ""zero transfat."" Now the FDA is finally moving to fully eliminate an undesirable ingredient which became common because of earlier labeling trends.\nWhat Should We Learn From This?\nSo, did we learn from the low fat marketing experience? Seemingly not much. Instead we have continued down the path of magical thinking about food. We go through fad after fad about what single bad actor ingredient to avoid or what magical good component to eat, somehow believing that these simplistic formulas can put us on the path to health. The press, various celebrities and ""experts"" are often guilty of over-selling such ideas as they emerge incompletely formed from the fields of nutrition or medicine. Well-meaning or simply opportunistic food marketers are then more than willing to follow or even promote each fad. I call that ""the marketing of non-existance."" We continue to be sold new non-existence options such as “Low Carb,” “no High Fructose Corn Syrup,” “Gluten-Free,” and “non-GMO.” These are dietary strategies based on the mindset that foods are something to be feared or at least viewed with suspicion.\nThese fads distract us from the fundamental healthy diet principles of moderation and diversity. They distract us from the fact that the most dramatic way that most Americans could improve their health prospects would be to consume more fruits and vegetables. Perhaps its time to start buying what we eat for what it is as a whole food, not for what it is not.\nYou are welcome to comment here and/or to email me at email@example.com. I tweet about new posts @grapedoc\nA Short Course About Oils And Fats\nFats and oils are similar with fats being solids at room temperature and oils being liquid. In both cases they consist of triglycerides - three ""fatty acids"" connected to a glycerol backbone.\nWhat makes the various fats and oils different from one another is what kind of fatty acids they contain.Fatty acids are chains of carbon atoms with a polar carbonyl group at one end. They differ in the length of the chain and in how many double bonds there are between the carbons.\nAs shown above, the dominant fatty acid in animal fats is stearic acid with 18 carbons and no double bonds (saturated). Oleic acid which is a major component of olive oil or modern Canola and Sunflower oil also has 18 carbons, but has one double bond (mono-unsaturated). Linolenic acid was one of the problematic components of soybean oil which needed to be fixed by partial hydrogenation. It has 18 carbons and three double bonds (poly-unsaturated). ""Tropical oils"" are generally shorter chained - Palm oil has mostly 14 carbon amino acids and coconut oil has mostly chains of 12 carbons.\nThe cis- and trans- fats differ in the orientation of the hydrogen atoms (white) attached to the carbon atoms (black) that are connected by a double bond. The normal cis- configuration has both hydrogens on the same side of the chain. The trans- configuration has the hydrogens on the opposite side of the chain and this gives the fatty acid a different bend and influences its fluid properties when it is part of a membrane. There are some natural trans-fats, particularly in meat and milk from ruminants because rumen bacteria convert unsaturated fats to saturated forms, going through some trans- intermediates along the way. There are actually health benefits associated with the production of Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) in this process.', 'By: JoAnn E. Manson, MD, DrPH, and Shari S. Bassuk, ScD\nContributing Editors, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School\nIf you saw last month’s news headlines declaring that saturated fat is no longer deemed harmful to your heart, you may be (understandably!) confused. After all, for years, clinicians and scientists have recommended reducing saturated fat for heart health. Is it time to rethink this advice? Hardly. Here’s the deal.\nThe research that sparked the recent news splash was an analysis by Canadian researchers of up to a dozen long-term observational studies of diet that included a total of 90,000 to 339,000 participants from various countries. These study volunteers reported on the foods they typically ate. Researchers then tracked the health of these folks for years, sometimes decades. The analysis found no association between consumption of saturated fat — dairy foods (e.g., cheese, butter, and milk) and meats are two main sources — and future risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke (strokes resulting from a blocked vessel), diabetes, or deaths from cardiovascular disease or all causes. Less surprisingly, the analysis also found that trans fats are harmful to health, with the highest intakes of trans fat linked to a 21% higher risk of coronary heart disease and a 33% higher mortality rate compared with the lowest intakes. The findings were published on August 12 in the medical journal The BMJ.\nUnfortunately, the news coverage of this analysis often missed a key point. It’s not just the amount of saturated fat you eat, it’s also what you replace those calories with (the quality of your overall diet) that affects your health. Most people naturally tend to keep their calorie intake at a constant level over time (scientists call this “calorie preservation”). If they cut saturated fat calories out of their diet, the missing calories have to come from somewhere else (“calorie substitution”). People with lowered saturated fat intake may replace those calories with other unhealthy foods such as refined carbohydrates (e.g., white bread, white rice) or sugary beverages. So although they are eating less fat, their overall diet is no better — and may even be worse — than people who don’t try to limit saturated fat. .\nNumerous studies show that substituting unsaturated fat — found in fish, nuts, and plant oils — for saturated fat improves health. For example, a careful analysis of observational findings from the Nurses’ Health Study, in which my colleagues and I (JEM) tracked 80,000 initially healthy female nurses for many years, suggested that replacing just 5% of calories from saturated fat with calories from unsaturated fat cuts risk of coronary heart disease by 42% and is more effective at preventing heart attacks than simply reducing overall fat intake. Short-term dietary trials also show heart benefits of lowering saturated fat intake while boosting unsaturated fat intake, including improvements in blood cholesterol levels and insulin sensitivity.\nThe most harmful type of dietary fat is trans fat, also known as partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. These fats are a double whammy: they boost the “bad” LDL cholesterol and lower the “good” HDL cholesterol. New government regulations are reducing the presence of artificial trans fats in the food supply, but such fats are still found in many products. What’s the take-home message? The type of fat does in fact matter, so choose foods with healthy unsaturated fat (fish, nuts, and most plant oils), limit foods high in saturated fat (butter, whole milk, cheese, coconut and palm oil, and red meats), and try to avoid foods with trans fat. Achieving the last goal can be tricky. In supermarkets, check package labels carefully. The best way to tell if trans fat is present is to read the ingredient list; if the phrase “partially hydrogenated oil” appears, then trans fats are indeed lurking.\nMany experts and professional societies, including the American Heart Association, advise a dietary pattern that (1) emphasizes vegetables (richly colored vegetables, including dark leafy greens, are best, and white potatoes don’t count), fresh fruits, and whole grains (whole-grain cereals, breads, rice, and pasta); (2) includes fish, beans, nuts and seeds, poultry, low-fat dairy products, and non-tropical plant oils (such as canola or olive oil, but not coconut or palm oil); and (3) limits sweets, sugary drinks, and red meats. Well-known examples are the Mediterranean and DASH diets. People who eat such diets have consistently had much better health outcomes than those who do not.']"	['<urn:uuid:ef1464b2-0cea-4f5b-b301-e80b3b2a3028>', '<urn:uuid:dc46bd42-057c-42e5-9273-512f463e1347>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	27	133	2286
26	As a cybersecurity expert exploring healthy lifestyle changes, I'm curious about how data breach response protocols connect with dietary choices - what's the connection between having proper incident response teams in cybersecurity and following structured dietary plans for managing health conditions?	Both cybersecurity incident response and dietary management require systematic, well-documented approaches. In cybersecurity, an Incident Response Team (IRT) follows a structured Incident Response Plan (IRP) that includes specific steps: detecting threats, isolating systems, alerting team members, communicating with stakeholders, and conducting post-event analysis. Similarly, managing health through diet, particularly for conditions like diabetes, requires a structured approach with specific dietary guidelines, regular monitoring, and systematic implementation. A vegan diabetes diet, for example, requires following specific food lists, meal timing, and nutritional guidelines while avoiding certain foods. Both approaches emphasize the importance of having proper procedures in place, documentation, and the involvement of experts - whether it's IT and legal teams for cyber incidents, or healthcare providers and dietitians for dietary management. Additionally, both require regular assessment and adjustment of strategies based on outcomes.	['Cyber crime is on the rise. Data breach and cyber attack incidents have become more diverse and numerous, and their impact more damaging and disruptive. It feels like every other day, there is news of a large corporation getting hacked and/or losing some of your personal data. It is not a matter of “if” you will be impacted, but “when”.\nThis is why it is so important for corporations and organizations to have a cyber security AV policy in place, along with an Incident Response Plan (IRP), and the right team of people who know how to react appropriately, often called the Incident Response Team (IRT).\nOnce a threat is detected, the IRP acts as a road map, allowing the IRT to take a systematic approach to solving the problem, documenting everything along the way, and minimizing human error.\nThis reduces losses and downtime after a data breach. The other big advantage is that, following an incident, evidence that the cyber security policy, including IRP and IRT, were in place will be useful should the attack lead to legal proceedings.\nIgnorance is no excuse when it comes to cyber security.\nNegligence can result in costly fines, lawsuits, and/or time in prison, all of which can negatively impact a company’s reputation.\nThere are many variations, but the best Incident Response Plans typically include the following steps:\nIs it a false positive? The IRT should review the logs for vulnerability tests or other abnormalities. What systems have been attacked? What stage of the attack? What is the origin?\nProvides time to determine the next steps, while limiting the spread, and the impact. Your team should isolate the system if possible and make a backup for forensic investigation.\nAlert everyone on the Incident Response Team including IT, HR, Legal, Operations and Management representatives.\nShould law enforcement/FBI be contacted? Experts like FireEye? Third party vendors? Industry peers? How soon should you alert the public?\nThe laws vary by state in the US. In the EU, the GDPR says within 72 hours.\nYour IRP should include a detailed cyber crisis communication plan, detailing who should be contacted in case of an attack, what message that will be conveyed to them, and who has the authority to communicate on behalf of the organization.\nScan all systems for malware. Isolate and disable all accounts and components that have been compromised. Remove access to systems by suspect employee logins. Change passwords, apply patches, and reconfigure firewalls.\nThis can take a while, so you need to prioritize what systems are most critical to resume functionality\n6. Post-event analysis\nWhat was the dwell time? (time from data breach to recovery) Are changes to policies, procedures, or equipment in order? How effective was the incident response plan? Then, test the revised IRP using simulated attack.\nIn conjunction with having an incident response plan, organizations need to provide adequate cyber awareness training to all employees, not only explicitly telling everyone what to do, but what not to do, in the event of a data breach or cyber-attack.\nSetting guidelines for communicating with outside parties regarding incidents is key. You don’t want someone in your organization tweeting “WE ARE GETTING HACKED!!!”, followed by a dozen hashtags, do you?', 'A vegan diet is highly beneficial for people with diabetes. The foods are rich in dietary fiber, protein, and healthy fats that improve glycemic control (1). But not all vegan foods are healthy for people with diabetes (examples include potato wafers or bread). That is one reason you need experts’ advice before trying the vegan diet for diabetes.\nIn this post, experts explain how a vegan diet helps manage diabetes. They also discuss the foods to eat and avoid, a sample menu plan, benefits, and precautions. Scroll down to get started with a dietitian-approved vegan diabetes diet.\nIn This Article\nDefinition: What Is The Vegan Diabetes Diet?\nA vegan diabetes diet is a dietary strategy to manage diabetes through the consumption of only plant-based foods and avoiding all animal-sourced products (honey, yogurt, cheese, milk, etc.), processed foods, and saturated fats.\nBut does eating a plant-based diet actually help reverse or manage diabetes? Is there any research study to back this claim?\nBenefits: Why The Vegan Diet Is Good For Diabetes\nA vegan or plant-based diet has been studied by researchers extensively. Such a diet was found to have positive results on many health conditions, including diabetes (2). Dr. Mubashar Rehman, Ph.D., says, “Managing diabetes is about controlling the body’s glucose levels. A vegan diet makes it easier to control not only the sugar levels but also the cholesterol intake and saturated fats. This is why going on a vegan diet is beneficial for diabetic patients.”\nHere are the 7 reasons a vegan diet is good for people with diabetes.\n1. May Help Manage Weight\nBrittany Lubeck, MS, RD, says, “Vegan diets are high in nutrients like fiber and antioxidants. A vegan diet, especially one that primarily consists of whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein, tends to be lower in carbohydrates than the modern Western diet.” Many studies have also shown that vegan diets help reduce body weight and BMI in people with diabetes (1), (4).\n2. May Help Manage Insulin Resistance\nInsulin is a hormone that encourages glucose uptake by cells, where it is converted to usable energy. Kaytee Hadley RDN, MSNHL, CPT, says, “The saturated fat found in animal products contributes to inflammation and belly fat, causing insulin resistance.” Insulin resistance hampers glucose uptake by cells and leads to high blood sugar. Studies have proven that a plant-based or vegan diet helps improve blood sugar control by making the body more insulin sensitive (1), (5).\n3. May Help Manage HbA1c Levels\nHbA1c or hemoglobin A 1c levels are tested to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes. An HbA1c value of 5.7% to 6.4% is diagnosed as prediabetes, while that of 6.5% or higher is diagnosed as diabetes. Hemoglobin’s main function is to carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. Excess glucose in the blood causes the hemoglobin to get coated with glucose (6). A study found that people who consumed a plant-based diet reduced HbA1c values compared to those on conventional diets (7).\n4. May Help Manage LDL Cholesterol Levels\nConsumption of excess red meat and animal products and processed foods can elevate LDL cholesterol levels. This may eventually block arteries and lead to cardiovascular issues (8). But eating a vegan diet and exercising regularly can help lower LDL cholesterol. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition confirms that people on a vegan diet tend to have low LDL cholesterol levels and a reduced risk of heart disease (9).\n5. May Reduce Diabetes-Related Complications\nMajor diabetes-related complications include kidney disease, diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Studies have proven that a plant-based or a vegan diet helps reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy, chronic kidney disease, neuropathy, and nephropathy (10).\n6. May Reduce Metabolic Syndrome Risk\nMetabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions including obesity, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. It increases the risk of heart disease and insulin resistance. As per a study, consuming a plant-based diet can help reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome by 56%. A plant-based diet also helps reduce inflammation that helps prevent excess fat accumulation (11).\n7. Promotes Psychological Wellbeing\nA vegan diet can also help improve psychological wellbeing. Researchers studied the effect of a plant-based diet on people with diabetes. They found that a plant-based diet helped reduce HbA1c levels (reduced blood sugar) and cholesterol as well as improved emotional wellbeing. It reduced depressive symptoms and improved the quality of life in people with diabetes (12).\nGoing on a vegan diet is the best way to manage diabetes or reverse prediabetes. But not all vegetables and fruits are ideal for people with diabetes. One has to choose low-GI foods and also be mindful not to consume vegan junk food (like potato chips). Read to know the foods to eat and avoid.\nEat: Foods List For The Vegan Diabetes Diet\n- Vegetables: Broccoli, cauliflower, bitter gourd, bottle gourd, spinach, chard, arugula, kale, edamame, cabbage, Chinese cabbage, purple cabbage, scallions, carrot, green beans, squash, onion, etc.\n- Fruits: Apple, grapefruit, muskmelon, avocado, strawberries, plum, pears, oranges, lime, lemon, and tangerines.\n- Whole Grains: Barley, sorghum, wheat, broken wheat, red rice, black rice, brown rice, quinoa, millet, and amaranth.\n- Protein: Lentils, beans, tofu, mushrooms, teff, mock meat, and nutritional yeast.\n- Healthy Fats: Olive oil, avocado oil, rice bran oil, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, melon seeds, pepita, chia seeds, and moderate amounts of peanut butter, almond butter, and sunflower seed butter.\n- Beverages: Water, fenugreek seed water, freshly pressed fruit or vegetable juices, and tea and coffee without cream and sugar.\n- Herbs And Spices: Rosemary, thyme, dill, cilantro, fenugreek, cinnamon, pepper, cardamom, star anise, coriander, cumin, turmeric, cayenne pepper, ginger, garlic, etc.\nThat’s a long list of foods you can eat! Take a screenshot and save it to refer to it when you go grocery shopping again. But there are also foods that you must avoid when on a vegan diet for diabetes. What are they?\nAvoid: Foods Not To Eat\n- Sugary Foods: Sugar, cakes, pastries, candies, doughnuts, dried fruits, maple syrup, high fructose corn syrup, packaged sauces, etc.\n- Refined Carbs: White rice, bread, pasta, refined flour, and breakfast cereal.\n- Trans Fats: Chips, wafers, onion rings, onion blossom, biscuits, cookies, dairy whiteners, frozen foods, ready-to-eat foods, canned foods, etc.\n- Fruits And Vegetables: Potato, sweet potato (without skin), beetroot, green peas, pumpkin, watermelon, pineapple, papaya, and sapodilla.\n- Fats And Oils: Salted nuts, safflower oil, and corn oil.\n- Beverages: Packaged fruit and vegetable juices, alcohol, tea or coffee with sugar and cream, and sports drinks.\n- Others: Fish, meat, sausage, salami, milk, yogurt, cheese, honey, etc.\nKnowing what to eat and avoid is the first step to managing diabetes. The next step is to design a meal plan that will work for you. You may refer the following sample vegan diabetes diet plan.\n|Meals||What To Eat|\n|Early Morning (7:00 a.m.)||2 teaspoons fenugreek soaked in water overnight|\n|Breakfast (8:00 a.m.)||Avocado toast (whole-wheat bread) + Grapefruit juice|\n|Snack (10:30 a.m.)||½ cup muskmelon|\n|Lunch (12:30 – 1:00 p.m.)||½ cup quinoa with boiled chickpeas + ½ cup cooked or raw veggies and greens|\n|Snack (4:00 p.m.)||5-6 cucumber slices with ¼ cup homemade hummus|\n|Dinner (6:30 – 7:00 p.m.)||1 cup roasted cauliflower, green beans, bell peppers + 3 oz. pan-tossed tofu|\nYour vegan diabetes diet does not have to be boring. The diet plan mentioned above includes nutritious plant-based foods that have flavor and crunch. In addition to the diet, you also must take care of your lifestyle to manage diabetes. The following section takes you through certain lifestyle tweaks that you can make.\nLifestyle: Improvements To Manage/Reverse Diabetes\n- Exercise Regularly\nExercising and staying active are crucial for diabetes management. Mix cardio and strength training to keep your workout routine fun (13). Get 4 to 5 hours of exercise per week to reduce BMI and body weight and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications like cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy (14).\n- Follow A Routine\nA well-thought-out routine that accommodates your daily activities and integrates the new diet and lifestyle seamlessly is the best way forward. Without a routine, you will not be able to plan and achieve your goal – to manage and probably reverse diabetes. Create a weekly routine, make to-do lists, and journal your progress.\n- Stay Stress-Free\nStaying stress-free is easier said than done. But conscious practice gradually helps reduce stress. There are many ways to practice being stress-free. Start by spending at least 20 to 30 minutes by yourself. You also can learn a new skill to keep your mind engaged productively. Understand that not all your problems require immediate attention – and neither can all problems be solved always. Make smart choices while dealing with problems by deciding if a problem deserves your time at all. Finally, get 7 to 8 hours of sleep. Sleeping reboots your brain, which will help you think clearly and make wise decisions.\n- Join Support Groups\nA support group can help you discuss and talk about diabetes in a closed circle of people. You will also be able to exchange recipe ideas or meet workout friends to keep you motivated to exercise regularly.\n- Have A Positive Outlook\nDealing with diabetes is not easy. Your food habits and lifestyle that you are so accustomed to must change completely. The mantra to success is to have a positive attitude. You will be able to manage and possibly reverse diabetes if you take all the limes that life’s throwing at you, and make lemonade without sugar in it!\nYour diet, exercise, and other lifestyle changes will work together to help you manage diabetes. However, being on a vegan diabetes diet may also cause nutritional deficiencies in some. While taking supplements can help, one must also know which ones to go for. Read the next section.\nPrecautions: How To Overcome Nutritional Deficiencies\nBrittany Lubeck, MS, RD, says “Vegans may need to take a few supplements to prevent nutrient deficiencies. They need to know what nutrients they are not getting from their diet, as some nutrient deficiencies can cause serious issues.” She advises considering taking the following supplements after consulting your doctor:\n- Vitamin B12\nVitamin B12 is only found in animal foods. Hence, vegans must take this nutrient in supplement form or through fortified vegan foods.\nAlthough you can get calcium from some plant-based foods, getting enough as a vegan can be difficult.\n- Vitamin D\nYour body can synthesize vitamin D from the sun, but it may be a good idea for vegans to take a vitamin D supplement as well. Vitamin D increases calcium absorption, and since calcium may be hard to come by for vegans, this could be an essential supplement to add to the list.\nDHA, or docosahexaenoic acid, is an omega-3 fatty acid. Your body can use another type of omega-3 called ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), found in some plant-based foods, to synthesize DHA – but that may not be enough DHA.\nIt can be a challenge to eat enough protein without a daily intake of animal foods. Use plant-based protein powders (brown rice or hemp) to reach your protein goals.\nThere are two types of iron – heme and non-heme. While non-heme iron is found in some plant foods, heme iron is only found in animal foods. However, heme iron is more easily absorbed than non-heme iron. Hence, vegans may want to take an iron supplement or multivitamin that contains iron to prevent a deficiency.\nA vegan diabetes diet is an effective nutritional strategy to manage and possibly reverse diabetes. Consuming plant-based foods and avoiding all animal products can help in diabetes treatment and even reduce the risk of other health issues. Talk to your doctor and get a customized vegan diet plan, workout regularly, and have a positive attitude. You will be able to win this!\nExpert’s Answers For Readers’ Questions\nWhat changes will I see with my insulin on a vegan diet?\nA vegan diet has been found to improve insulin sensitivity in people with diabetes. Your body will be able to use circulating glucose effectively and will make you feel less hungry. You will consume fewer calories as a result.\nHow to get enough protein in a vegan diabetes diet?\nYou can get protein from nuts, seeds, lentils, beans, edamame, tofu, soy, mushrooms, teff, and quinoa. You may also go for a vegan protein supplement (sugarless) after talking to your dietitian.\nArticles on StyleCraze are backed by verified information from peer-reviewed and academic research papers, reputed organizations, research institutions, and medical associations to ensure accuracy and relevance.

28	I'm planning to make Roti Jala but having trouble with the mould - what's a better alternative tool for making this net-like bread?	A condiment ketchup bottle like those found in American Diners works better than a Roti Jala mould. It's easier to handle and squirts out an even amount of batter every time.	"[""As for every curry dish, it is best eaten with bread like side dish, mainly because bread soaks up the gravy and it is undeniable that the gravy is what makes any curry or Rendang outstanding in flavor. There are many types of flour dough made products that can be the choice of a curry person and the options are endless from Roti Canai, Murtabak, plain white bread to rice itself. I have chosen Roti Jala for today's dish as I have never made it before despite having bought the mould 5 years ago and I love the turmeric yellow color which goes well with the brown Rendang. 'Jala' is another Malay word that means Net as in fish net and this particular Roti is named so for its particular appearance that resembles a web of net all mingled together with its holes randomly scattered.\nIn the whole process of preparing this dish with its accompanying Roti, I would say the Roti was the one that tested my patience and I found the Roti Jala mould difficult to swirl around and some of its funnel holes simply get clogged after a few rounds of the batter filling. I was about to give up after making the third piece when I suddenly remembered I have a better tool to do the job. I used the usual condiment ketchup bottle that they have at the American Diners to complete the next 10 Roti Jala. It was much easier to handle and squirts out even amount of batter everytime. Still, getting one piece to cook nicely with slight burnt color is not an easy thing to do as each piece has to be made and cooked individually and it takes up a long time to make 12 to feed everyone in my household. Of course, I got the rice cooked too as I wasn't ready to spend another 45 minutes to do another round of 12 more Roti Jala!\nThe results were good and Curry and his father really enjoyed dipping those Roti into the spicy Rendang.

29	fish handling circle hooks benefits drawbacks	Circle hooks provide the benefit of typically setting in the corner of the mouth, making hook removal easier and safer. However, they require specific handling techniques - you must not strike the rod when the fish takes the bait, but instead allow tension to build naturally. When handling any hooked fish, it's crucial to minimize time out of water and use wet, rubberized gloves to protect their protective slime coating from damage.	['OVER the years I’ve written several articles on fishing for sharks in Southern Queensland. I regularly get asked about the kind of rig used so I’ve decided to explain it in greater detail.\nThere are large numbers of sharks in Moreton Bay and they can also be caught in all the creeks, rivers and canals that feed into it. The Nerang River system and most other estuaries, bays and canals up and down the coast have healthy populations of noahs also. They can be found just about anywhere there is saltwater and even some places there isn’t. Most anglers encounter them by chance while targeting other species, so few are landed. Sharks are probably responsible for more ‘the one that got away’ stories than any other species.\nIf you want to target sharks, having an appropriate rig will go a long way towards a satisfying final result. Let me tell you about the components and the rig I use.\nThe downside of conventional (J pattern) hooks is that you never know where they are going to ‘set’ or penetrate the flesh of the target species. When fishing for sharks, circle pattern hooks are a better option when used correctly because they’ll more often than not find purchase in the corner of the mouth. This makes hook removal easier, which is a big plus. When you’re dealing with a strong shark, possessing razor sharp dentures, you want to spend as little time as possible mucking around with the business end.\nHooks that set further in the mouth or throat are best just cut off and left because it’s too dangerous to try to remove them. Leaving the hook in the shark may not be the best scenario for him, but losing a finger, hand or your life isn’t healthy for you either.\nYou need to follow a few simple rules to ensure that your circle hooks work well. When the shark grabs the bait it must be allowed to run so that the angle of tension on the line is from behind the shark. As the tension on the line increases when you use the drag, the shark is forced to turn its head slightly. As the angle between the shark and the line increases the point of the hook will penetrate the flesh, usually in the corner of the mouth.\nYou must remember not to strike the rod when fishing with circle hooks, as this is likely to jerk the bait out of the shark’s mouth without allowing the hook to do its job. When the shark runs with the bait, just push the lever up to engage the drag (assuming you’re using a lever drag reel or a Baitrunner style reel) and allow the line to come tight. Once you have a good tension, with the shark taking line, you can gently raise the rod into a fighting curve.\nThere are several hooks on the market that are called circle hooks, however few of them are ‘true’ circles. Most are only semi-circles and many are slightly offset, which is not a characteristic of a true circle hook. The one I mainly use is not a true circle hook either but it works just as well. The Gamakatsu Octopus Circle has been my hook of choice for many years and it’s great for line classes up to 10kg. If you want to fish heavier, I recommend their Big Bait Circle, a heavier duty hook.\nOther brands on the market are also good and you can try a few until you find one you are happy with. Some other brands of circle hooks include VMC, Mustad, Gladiator, Owner and Daichii, and there are possibly a few other hook manufacturers who make them also. I’ve never had a problem with the Gamakatsus and have taken some big fish and sharks on them, including two world records, so I have a lot of faith in them. I normally use 8/0 Octopus circle hooks and I also produce a light tackle shark rig with them under my brand name ‘Master Baiter Custom Tackle’.\nWhichever style of circle hook you use, make sure it’s razor sharp.\nYou’ll need to rig your hooks on wire to avoid being bitten off by the sharks’ razor sharp teeth. Bear in mind though, that whenever metal and saltwater mix you get electrolysis, which is a bit like a small electric pulse. Sharks have very sensitive receptors in their head called ‘ampullae of Lorenzini’ that can detect these pulses, and these fish will regularly shy away or reject baits rigged on uncoated wire.\nUsing nylon covered wire greatly reduces this effect and, as a result, sharks are much more likely to take the bait. Plastic or nylon-coated 49-strand wire is reasonably flexible and can be bent easily. This allows the hooks to be snelled straight onto the wire, which eliminates the need for crimping and also makes a stronger connection with less effort. I usually use around a metre of 135lb nylon-coated wire in my rig, with two hooks, snelled around 15cm apart (distance varies depending on the bait). I crimp a small loop in the other end so that the snap on the leader can be attached. Circle hooks also work better with this stiff connection to the wire, which is a bonus.\nThe next part of the rig is important to reduce the chafing on the main line caused by the ‘dermal dentacles’, or sandpaper-like skin of the shark. The leader is usually thick monofilament, 80lb to 100lb for 3kg to 4kg line, 200lb for 6kg to 10kg line and 300lb for 15kg to 24kg line. The leaders I use and also make commercially are called wind-on-leaders, so called because the connection between leader and main line can be wound through the rod tip and onto the reel. Instead of having a swivel to join it to the main line, the leader has a spliced Dacron loop. This allows a loop-to-loop connection between the double in the main line and the leader. Making wind-on-leaders is not that hard once you learn how, but they are a little time consuming.\nYou’ll be able to retrieve the wind-on-leader onto the reel until the snap swivel connecting the leader and the wire trace is at the rod tip. You’ll only have the short wire leader out the tip, which allows a shark to be brought close for tagging, netting or gaffing. When the shark is at close quarters you can often put a little more pressure on the shark by locking the leader between your thumb and the foregrip of the rod. My wind-on-leaders are 3m long, which keeps my rig within the regulations of the International Game Fish Association. You must never touch the Dacron part of the leader, as it relies on tension to grip the leader material.\nThe double in your main line can be done in a number of ways. In light line to 15kg you can use a spider hitch or a bimini twist but in heavier line a plait is the best. The bimini twist is a better option than the spider hitch as it has a much higher breaking strain. It takes a little longer to learn but it’s definitely worth it if you’re serious about having your rig as strong as possible.\nIf you’re fishing under IGFA rule with line classes up to 10kg, and have a 1m wire leader and 3m wind-on-leader, your double can be up to 1.5m long if you wish. This will keep you well within the maximum combined length of 6.1m for leader and double. If you’re fishing under sportfishing rules or using line heavier than 10kg, consult the rules of your relevant angling body.\nThis rig has worked well for me over the many years I have been chasing sharks, and I use the same rig for livebaiting pelagics – except that instead of the wire I use 80lb monofilament. If all your connections are done properly you’ll have a very sound rig. I highly recommend it for line classes up to 15kg, which is plenty heavy enough for chasing sharks in the bay. I have never fished heavier than 8kg line in the southern end of the bay and have lost very few sharks. The light line is a lot of fun to fish with, especially 4kg, and with this rig the hooks will set firmly almost every time.\nSharks are plentiful in Moreton Bay and most other waters, so rig up, float a few baits into a tuna oil slick and hang on!\nGeoff Wilson’s Complete Book of Fishing Knots & Rigs\nWind-on leader – page 28-29\nSimple snell – page 8\nBimini twist – page 34 (page 33 in 2000 edition)\n1) Circle hooks usually set in the corner of the mouth, which makes hook removal easier.\n2) The small spots on a shark’s head are sensitive receptors called ‘ampullae of Lorenzini’.\n3) Wind-on leaders allow you to put a little more pressure on in the closing stages of the fight.', 'Catch and Release\nNative fish populations play vital roles in the delicate balance & ecology of our rivers, creeks & waterways. By practicing Catch & Release fishing, you are helping Conservation & sustaining fish populations for future generations of Anglers.\nIf you are new to Catch & Release Fishing, here’ s a few tips to get you started.\nUsing suitable tackle for the type of fish you are targeting, reduces stress on the fish with quicker landing times, whilst minimizing bust-offs.\nRubberized gloves help maintain the protective slime coating on the fish when handling.\nKnotless or fine mesh landing nets minimize landing times & damage to the fish.\nBarbless hooks are great for quick hook removal & for minimizing hook damage. If you don’t have Barbless hooks, try pinching the barbs of a standard hook with needle nose pliers.\nThe use of Circle hooks & Artificial lures or flies increase the frequency of mouth hooked fish, rather than gut hooked.\nHook-Eze can be used to assist in the removal of mouth hooked fish (up to 3kg) & as a line cutter.\nHemostat or long nose pliers help to remove hooks quickly & Wire cutters come in handy if the need arises to cut a hook from a lure to assist in lure removal.\nLANDING THE FISH\nAlways try to land the fish as quickly as possible, don’t play it to exhaustion – fatigue can kill. If it takes a while to land your fish, check the drag is not set too loosely & your gear is not too light for the fish you are catching. Using a sensible line & tackle & keeping fight times short, will reduce stress on the fish & minimize bust-offs. Landing nets reduce the amount of time landing the fish & protects the fish when thrashing about.\nWhen water temperatures are warmer, dissolved oxygen levels in the water decline, so fish are subject to stress & exhaustion in a much shorter period of time, compared to cooler water temperatures, so take this into consideration as the seasons change.\nIt’s extremely important never to use a dry cloth or towel to hold the fish, always wet your hands & any equipment that comes into contact with the fish, such as Gloves, Brag Mats etc. This prevents the removal of the fish’s protective slime coating, which acts as a barrier against disease & infection.\nHold the fish firmly but carefully. Avoid dropping the fish onto hard surfaces such as rocks or the bottom of the boat.\nCradle the fish near the head & tail if possible or gently support the mid-section. Bass can be safely handled by holding the lower jaw, thumb in mouth & forefinger under the chin.\nNever hold the fish by the gills or the eyes & always keep the fish in the water. The longer a fish is out of the water, the less chance of survival once released. If you do have to take the fish from the water either for hook removal, measuring or photographing your catch, always support the fish correctly & release back to the water as soon as practical.\nRemember, many surfaces, especially metal can become extremely hot in the sun, placing a fish on such surfaces can damage the fish significantly, reducing its chance of survival once released.\nTry to keep the fish in the water during hook removal if possible & remove hooks quickly. If the fish is deeply hooked & hook removal is difficult or impossible without harming the fish, cut the line as close to the fish’s mouth as possible & release. Damaging the internal organs of a fish in an attempt to remove a hook, will not result in a successful release. Survival is significantly reduced when damage results & bleeding occurs.\nRelease the fish as soon as practical & do not keep it out of water any longer than necessary. Always release the fish head first into the water, supporting the body. Revive exhausted fish by gently holding upright underwater, facing into the current, this forces the water to flow into the mouth & through the gills, helping to resuscitate the fish. If there is no current, gently move the fish forward & backward to help water flow through the gills. Give the fish enough time to recover, it should remain upright in the water & be able to swim off forcefully on its own.\nRevival time can depend on the species & temperature of the water; longer recovery times are required for some large cold water species. If you do happen to catch a fish that does not revive & swim away on its own, is bleeding, sinks to the bottom or floats to the surface after being released, this should be kept as part of your daily limit if it’s legal to do so.\nWhen you’re finished fishing for the day, leave no trace. Discarded fishing line, lures, sinkers etc. cause serious wildlife injury & often death, please do the right thing & take your rubbish with you when you leave your fishing spot. Recycle all plastic containers, even when you’re not fishing, plastic in the ocean & our waterways is a major Global Issue.\nLastly, remember, never to over fish a particular river or stream, always familiarize yourself with current fishing regulations that apply to your State, such as size, take & possession limits & keep protecting our waterways.\nHappy Catch & Release Fishing!']	['<urn:uuid:4dc0a50c-00f2-4e54-9f8b-335b6dda5c95>', '<urn:uuid:d3d6f4c3-1dfc-4547-8e83-b18bbacc39a7>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	6	72	2412
30	museum dementia programs vs home therapy comparison	Both museum-based and home-based programs offer support for people with dementia. Salford Museum and Art Gallery participates in the House of Memories program, providing museum resources and activities that can be used both during museum visits and at home to support people with dementia and their carers. In contrast, organizations like Jewish Family Service provide in-home mental health counseling and care management, allowing individuals with Alzheimer's to remain in their own homes. Both approaches aim to improve quality of life, with museum programs focusing on cultural engagement and memory stimulation, while home-based services emphasize daily living support and personal care management.	"['Salford Museum and Art Gallery and Ordsall Hall have a rich history of working collaboratively with Salford’s varied communities to support them in engaging with their heritage and that of the city. Through externally-funded and core activities and projects, we have worked creatively with communities, groups, societies and organisation from across the City of Salford.\nWe have offered support for projects and activity that groups are planning to undertake, and run projects with heritage themes in partnership with many different organisations and audiences, including older people, young groups, local history societies and schools. These projects aimed to offer community involvement and ownership at all levels, and helped local people gain an insight into the broad heritage of Salford in a variety of ways, ranging from oral history collection to participatory art.\nSalford Sporting Memories supported older people in reconnecting with their sporting heritage through reminiscence and object handling. Whether you are a supporter or a player, if you live in Salford, sport will have touched your life. With support from The Booth Charities and Salford CCG, this project aimed to bring sport back into the lives of those that may have lost touch with their sporting heritage. The project team worked with older people in Salford living with dementia, depression or other mental health issues, or who may be experiencing loneliness or isolation, to introduce them back into healthy social and physical activity.\nCome along and share your sporting memories at our new FREE Sporting Memories sessions at Swinton Library, which take place on the first Monday of each month from, 2-3pm. Check out the Libraries things to do section of our website for the next session.\nSalford Remembers (World War One Centenary) marked a city-wide focus on commemorating the 100 year anniversary of the First World War, and its significance locally, nationally and globally. Based at Salford Museum & Art Gallery, it saw an events programme, artefact loans and community engagement work towards highlighting the conflict’s impact on the city.\nHouse of Memories is a dementia awareness programme for museums run by national Museums Liverpool (NML), designed to support people living with dementia, their social carers and families. It aims to provide them with new skills and resources to share with people living with dementia, thus contributing to their well-being and quality of life. These include information on accessing museum resources and visiting the museum, as well as running sessions in care settings and trying new activities at home. Salford Museum & Art Gallery has a long-standing relationship with NML and has hosted a number of events for professional and family carers, as well as supporting with resources and ideas.\nStories of Chat Moss was a project that grew out of the changing use of the traditional mossland used for farming around Irlam and Cadishead. Oral Histories were collected from individuals with close links to the Moss, and used by schools and local creative writers to respond creatively to the themes brought up, resulting in wonderful learning resources, artworks, and a Story Map of Chat Moss. A huge amount of interest was generated locally in these stories and they have now been captured for posterity.\nThe First Cut: 250 Years of the Bridgewater Canal marked the significant anniversary of the canal’s opening in 1761. The Bridgewater Canal is arguably the birthplace of the industrial revolution, with its engineering and social innovations shaping modern society. This project supported creative community activities, including oral histories, textile art and film making, to engage local people in the canal’s history and significance today, leading up to an exhibition at Salford Museum and Art Gallery in October 2011.\nDownload the app via the App Store or Google Play.\nSign up to our mailing list and be the first to find out about our latest news, offers and forthcoming events.

31	vatican council aim mass participation	According to the Second Vatican Council, the primary aim is 'Full, conscious, active participation by all the people'.	"['Have you ever wondered why we celebrate Mass the way we do? Why do we have a procession at the start of Mass? Why do we make the sign of the cross? Why do we sometimes kneel, while at other times we stand? Why are we encouraged to join in the singing? Questions such as these are often on the minds of every Catholic who comes to Mass. We look for answers to questions such as these to help us not only to become better-informed Catholics but, more importantly, to help us enter more fully into our Eucharistic celebration. As the Second Vatican Council emphasized, “Full, conscious, active participation by all the people” is the “aim to be considered before all else.”\nAt the request of Bishop Wester, each parish in the diocese has been asked to present a series of short talks on the structure of the Mass. These Four-Minute Reflections, following the Prayer after Communion, will hopefully help us, as the assembly, come to a better understanding of the Mass, and enable us to participate more fully, consciously and actively. They will not be sermons, but carefully prepared talks that over time will cover the key aspects of the Mass. Imagine a “class about the Mass” without ever leaving the comfort of your pew!\nThe purpose of these reflections will not be to overwhelm us with a lot of detail, but rather to increase our awareness of how various parts of the Mass work together to heighten a sense of unity as we are drawn into the sacred mystery and then sent forth to carry on Christ’s mission in the world. We will see how the introductory rites – the procession, the singing and prayers – prepare us to listen attentively to the word of God so that we may enter more joyfully and gratefully into the Liturgy of the Eucharist and Communion. Then, renewed by word and sacrament, we will better appreciate the significance of the prayers, blessings and dismissal that come at the conclusion of Mass.\nYou can do a lot of things in four minutes: drive four miles, write an email, heat up your dinner, or listen to a song. We believe that these Four-Minute Reflections will provide a better understanding of the symbols, gestures, and rites that are sometimes not understood or taken for granted at Mass thus enabling us to share more deeply in the mystery of this great sacrament. Over the course of the liturgical year, we will strive to shed some light on practices that are ever ancient and yet, ever new. We invite you to listen attentively to what is being presented. And remember: Each reflection will only take four minutes.\nIn the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, following the Prayer after Communion and before the Final Blessing and Dismissal is an optional section where announcements are made; this is where these talks will be inserted. For the sake of consistency throughout the diocese, it is the best place for it. It is not meant to take time away from the homily; before Mass interferes with the congregation\'s preparation and after Mass people are looking to leave.\nI am hoping the underlying current of this is to give examples regarding what is the most contentious phrase found in Sacrosanctum Concilium--""full, conscious, and active participation"". Is is about doing or is it about being, doing flowing from it? It seems to be hinting at the second part of the last sentence.\nThe serial continues.\nUPDATE: 12/19/2014.

32	minimum carbs needed daily to survive	There is no minimum amount of carbs needed for survival. The body can function without any dietary carbohydrates as it can produce glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis, where the liver converts amino acids from protein and glycerol from fatty acids into glucose. While there are essential amino acids and fatty acids that we must get from food, there are no essential carbohydrates. However, many low-carb foods like vegetables, nuts, and seeds provide valuable nutrients and fiber that can be beneficial to include in your diet.	"[""Carbohydrates on a keto or low carb diet\n- What are carbs?\n- How are carbs processed in the body?\n- Video: Carbohydrates on a low carb diet\n- How are carbs used by the body?\n- What are the benefits of restricting carbs?\n- Do I need a minimum amount of carbs?\n- The best carbs to eat on a keto or low carb diet\n- What are “net carbs”?\n- How many carbs should I eat per day?\nWhat are carbs?\nThere are two basic types of carbs in food: starches and sugars.\nStarches are made up of long chains of individual glucose (sugar) units that are linked together.\nThe diagram below is a simplified depiction of the structure of starch.\nStarchy foods generally don’t taste sweet.1 However, because starch is just a long chain of sugar (glucose) molecules linked together, once it’s digested in the gut, it’s absorbed into the blood as pure glucose, which raises blood sugar levels.2\nExamples of foods high in starch\nSugars are much shorter chains compared to starches. In fact, sometimes they are just a single glucose or fructose molecule. However, in food they’re usually two sugar molecules linked together, such as sucrose (glucose and fructose) or lactose (glucose and galactose).\nBelow are simplified depictions of a sucrose and a lactose molecule.\nSugars are found in whole foods such as many plants and dairy products, but aside from fruit and root vegetables like carrots and beets, these foods don’t taste very sweet. Most vegetables, nuts and seeds only have tiny amounts of sugar.\nExamples of whole foods that contain sugar\n- Nuts and seeds\n- Milk, yogurt and kefir\nProcessed and packaged foods often contain added sugars. Food manufacturers typically add refined sugar or high-fructose corn syrup to their products, although they sometimes use honey or other “natural” sugars that are considered healthier. But sugar is sugar, and your body processes all of it the same way.3\nExamples of added sugars\n- Refined white sugar and all other sugars: brown sugar, raw sugar, beet sugar, coconut sugar, turbinado sugar, etc.\n- High-fructose corn syrup\n- Maple syrup\n- Agave nectar\nTo learn more about sugars and other sweeteners on a keto or low carb diet, check out our keto sweeteners guide.\nHow are carbs processed in the body?\nStarches and two-unit sugars like sucrose and lactose are too big for your body to absorb. Therefore, after you eat carbs, your body produces enzymes that break them down into single sugar units that can be absorbed.\nThese single sugar units are handled by the body in different ways. To understand the effect of carbs on the body, it’s useful to know how glucose and fructose are absorbed.\nOnce glucose enters your bloodstream, it causes your blood sugar to rise immediately.4 This prompts your pancreas to produce insulin, the hormone that allows glucose to move out of your blood and into your cells. How much your blood sugar goes up – and how long it stays elevated – depends on a number of factors, including how many carbs you eat, how much insulin you produce, and how sensitive your cells are to insulin.\nOn the other hand, fructose doesn’t raise blood sugar the way glucose does.5 Instead, it goes straight to the liver, where it is converted to glycogen for storage.\nYour liver can handle small amounts of fructose found in whole foods without difficulty.6 However, consuming processed foods and beverages high in fructose can overwhelm your liver’s ability to process it properly. High fructose intake on a regular basis may potentially lead to insulin resistance, fatty liver, and obesity.7\nAgave nectar and other high-fructose “healthy” alternative sweeteners are often marketed as being “low glyemic index” because they don’t raise blood sugar as much as white sugar does. But they may possibly be an even worse choice than white sugar when it comes to your weight and health due to fructose’s adverse effects.8\nImportantly, all digestible carbs, or net carbs, are absorbed and (with the exception of fructose) can raise blood sugar — whether they come from whole or refined grains, fruits, vegetables, or sugar itself.9\nHow does the body use carbs?\nOnce the carbs you’ve eaten are digested and absorbed, the glucose they provide can be used as an energy source by all the cells in your body, including those in your muscles, heart, and brain.\nGlucose that isn’t immediately needed by these cells can be stored in your liver and muscles as glycogen (long chains of glucose, similar to starch in food). However, there’s a limit to the amount that can be stored. Once your glycogen storage sites are full, any additional glucose from the breakdown of excess carbs will be converted to fat and stored in your body, including your liver.10\nWhat are the benefits of restricting carbs?\nA keto or low carb diet provides several benefits, especially for people who want to get their blood sugar under control or lose weight:\n- Lower levels of blood sugar and insulin.11\n- Elimination of carb cravings.12\n- Powerful appetite control.13\n- Ability to go for many hours without eating due to feeling full and satisfied.14\nDo I need to eat a minimum amount of carbs?\nThe short answer is no. In fact, you technically don’t need to eat any carbs at all.\nWhen carbs are restricted, your body switches to using fat and ketones rather than sugar as its main energy source.15 Aside from your red blood cells and a small portion of your brain and kidneys, which do require glucose, your cells can use fatty acids or ketones as fuel.16 You can learn more about this in our complete guide to ketosis.\nYour body is actually capable of making glucose for any cells that need it, even if you don’t consume any carbs. This is because your liver can convert amino acids (found in protein) and glycerol (found in fatty acids) into glucose. This process is known as gluconeogenesis.\nIn their 2005 textbook “Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids,” the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine states:\n“The lower limit of dietary carbohydrate compatible with life apparently is zero, provided that adequate amounts of protein and fat are consumed.”17\nInterestingly, there are nine essential amino acids found in protein and two essential fatty acids, but there is no such thing as an “essential” carbohydrate.\nHowever, there are valuable nutrients in many low carb foods that contain some carbs, such as vegetables, nuts, and seeds. These foods also provide fiber, flavor and texture, which can enhance your eating experience.\nBest of all, including them in your diet will still allow you to experience the benefits of a low carb or keto lifestyle.\nThe best carbs to eat on a keto or low carb diet\nBy choosing your carbs wisely you should still be able to keep your blood sugar within healthy limits, while nourishing your body with important vitamins and minerals. Adding some carbs to your diet may also make your low carb lifestyle more sustainable, fun, colorful and varied.\nHere are some of the best sources of carbs on a keto or low carb diet:\n- Leafy greens\n- Macadamia nuts\n- Pumpkin seeds\nWhat are “net carbs”?\n“Net carbs” refer to the amount of carbs a food contains after subtracting the fiber.\nIt’s generally accepted that the fiber in whole foods isn’t digested and absorbed.18 However, not all experts on carb-restricted diets agree on this point.\nAdditionally, in people with type 1 diabetes, fiber may distend the stomach and trigger the release of hormones that raise blood sugar.19 Therefore, you can either subtract the fiber carbs in whole food to get the ‘net carbs’ or count total carbs, depending on your personal preference and tolerance.\nHere is an example of how to calculate net carbs: 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of cauliflower contains 5 grams of total carbs, 2 of which come from fiber.\n5 grams of total carbs minus 2 grams of fiber = 3 grams of net carbs.\nOn the other hand, many processed low carb foods display labels indicating their “net carbs,” which reflect their total carbs minus added fiber and sweeteners known as sugar alcohols. Studies have shown that some of these additives can be partially absorbed and raise blood sugar levels.20 Therefore, the term “net carbs” on packaged foods may be very misleading.\nWhen calculating net carbs, only subtract fiber from whole foods. In any case, we recommend sticking with whole foods and avoiding processed and packaged “low carb” products.\nHow many carbs should I eat per day?\nNot everyone needs the same carb restriction for optimal health. Healthy, physically active, and normal-weight individuals may not necessarily have to restrict carbs at all, especially if they choose minimally-processed sources most of the time.21\nHowever, for people with a range of health issues or weight problems, it’s often beneficial to keep carb consumption relatively low. Generally speaking, the lower the carbs, the more effective for weight loss and for metabolic health problems like type 2 diabetes.22\nAt Diet Doctor, we define three different levels of carb restriction as follows:\n- Ketogenic: less than 20 grams of net carbs per day\n- Moderate low carb: 20-50 grams of net carbs per day\n- Liberal low carb: 50-100 grams of net carbs per day\nTo learn more about these levels and how to choose the one that’s best for you, be sure to check out our helpful guide, How low carb is low carb?\nTop posts by Franziska Spritzler\nCarbohydrates on a keto or low carb diet - the evidence\nThe guide contains scientific references.

33	I've been doing ballet for years and recently started hearing a clicking sound in my hip when I dance. Sometimes it hurts too - what could this be and should I be worried?	This sounds like snapping hip syndrome, also known as dancer's hip. It occurs when a band of connective tissue (the iliotibial band) passes over part of the thigh bone, causing a snapping or popping noise. This condition is particularly common among athletes who practice disciplines requiring intensive hip load and twisting, like ballet. While every third patient experiences pain, it doesn't always require surgical treatment. The condition can typically be treated conservatively through rehabilitation aimed at stretching and making structures more flexible, restoring proper body posture and positioning of the pelvis. Physical therapy and pharmaceutical treatments are used as supportive measures.	['Arthroscopy of the hip is in many cases an alternative to hip arthroplasty, resulting in many benefits such as:\n- Complete pain relief,\n- minimally invasive treatment (one day surgery),\n- 2-3 small (5 mm) cuts,\n- fast full fitness recovery,\n- the possibility of further sports activity,\n- prevention of degenerative changes in the hip joint.\nNowadays, many doctors who diagnose their patients with hip joint problems, start off with pharmaceutical treatment, leaving an open option for serious surgery in the form of joint replacement in the near future. Such surgery, as well as hip implants, is connected with a 7-14 day hospital stay. The solution to this medical condition is minimally invasive arthroscopic hip surgery (one day surgery). Performing hip arthroscopy is recommended to all patients whose clinical examinations and imaging had proven:\n- damage to the labrum,\n- femoral impingement conflict,\n- damage to the ligament of the femoral head,\n- damage to the articular cartilage,\n- synovitis disease,\n- loose bodies,\n- Pipkin fracture type,\n- inflammation of the hip with effusion,\n- internal hip popping ligament pathology,\n- lumbar hip,\n- pain present for more than 6 months.\nTomasz Piontek, MD, PhD, is one of few surgeons in Poland, who performs arthroscopic hip surgery. Many years of experience, and scientific knowledge, of the Rehasport Clinic specialist ensures that this technically difficult procedure is performed successfully with utmost precision, using the latest surgical techniques. For the past ten years such procedures have been popular in the United States and Western Europe, whereas they are just gaining popularity in Poland.\nBy undergoing hip arthroscopy patients save their hip joint. Additionally, pain and problems related to movement are forgotten and full sport activity is regained.\nExternal and Internal snapping hip\nExternal snapping hip, otherwise known as dancer’s hip is a medical condition of the hip where a band of connective tissue known as the iliotibial band passes over part of the thigh bone, called the greater trochanter. This may be accompanied by an audible snapping or popping noise, at times resulting in pain, however more often causing a feeling of discomfort.\nInternal snapping hip is caused by the iliopsoas tendon snapping over a bony prominence of the pelvis.\nCauses of Injury\nThe most frequent group experiencing snapping hip syndrome are athletes practicing disciplines of intensive hip load and requiring twisting, e.g. ballet. The most frequent causes of injury are:\n- Dysfunction of the knee, e.g. lopsided knees,\n- Anterior hip tilt\n- hip flexion contracture,\n- frequent intramuscular injections in the hip.\nWhat are the symptoms\n- A characteristic noise in certain situations.\n- Every third patient experiences pain.\nHow to diagnose snapping hip syndrome?\nThe diagnosis is based on three following elements:\n- I Doctor-Patient interview focusing on ailment, pain and function\n- II Examinations – clinical tests performed by a doctor in the office\n- III Additional examinations such as ultrasound, MRI or X-ray\nTypically, snapping hip does not require surgical treatment. This method of treatment is used only in case of bursitis among people complaining about walking disorders, and also in cases where conservative treatment had not been satisfactory. In Rehasport Clinic, snapping hip surgery is performed by a minimally-invasive arthroscopic technique that guarantees fastest recovery.\nPeople suffering from snapping hip are most often treated conservatively. Rehabilitation is aimed at stretching and making structures of high contracture more flexible, restoring proper body posture and proper positioning of the pelvis. Pharmaceutical and physical therapy are used supportively.\nArthroplasty is considered one of the greatest medical achievements of the last century. It is a surgical procedure in which the damaged hip tissue and joint is replaced by a prosthetic implant. The hip is a ball and socket joint, which may be replaced with prosthetic implants. The femoral head is replaced with a metal or ceramic ball, whereas the socket (acetabulum) with polyethylene, ceramic or metal inserts.\nCurrently, endoprosthesis of the hip joint can be divided into:\n- Cement use (mostly among elderly patients over 75 years)\n- hybrid use, where one element (usually the acetabulum) is attached without cement, and the other element by use of cement.\nEndoprosthesis used in Rehasport Clinic are products of renowned orthopedic manufacturers, proving a record of the best mechanical and tribological properties:\n- e.g. cemented Exeter (Stryker)\n- resurfacing – BHR (Smith & Naphew)\n- neck – BMHR (Smith & Naphew)\n- metaphyseal – Proxima TriLock (De Puy), SMF (Smith & Naphew), Fitmore (Zimmer)\n- standard Corail (De Puy), Alloclassic (Zimmer)\nDuring pre-operative planning an implant is selected, which meets all the expectations of its activity after surgery, based on X-ray images and the degree of destruction of the hip joint.\nIn Rehasport Clinic we also perform endoprosthesis replacement surgery (complications of aseptic loosening of the implant components). A highly specialized and experienced medical team guarantees high quality of procedures\nHip replacement surgery is performed most often in epidural anesthesia and lasts from 1 to 2 hours. On the day of treatment the patient receives antibiotic protection and thrombotic prophylaxis in the form of low molecular weight heparin. Due to blood loss during surgery, and in the perioperative period, blood transfusion is sometimes neccessary. It is possible to use one’s own blood taken 2 weeks prior to surgery (1j.) or a device for automatic blood transfer (blood use from postoperative drainage). Such a procedure allows patients to avoid transfusion of other blood.\n1 day after surgery isometric exercises in the form of breathing, upright posture walking with a slight weight bearing on the operated lower limb are used. Exercises are gradually expanded, so that in the 3rd -4th day after surgery, the patient may move independently using one or two elbow crutches.\nAntibiotics are used as protection for 2-3 days after surgery, whereas prophylaxis against thromboembolism (elastic stockings or low molecular weight heparin and oral formulations) for six weeks after surgery. In 3 to 7 days after surgery, after having learnt to walk, the patient is discharged from hospital, with the recommendation of further continuation of rehabilitation. After 4-6 weeks of progressive rehabilitation, proper radiographic pictures and the appropriate use of implants, the patient is allowed to start walking without crutch support. Such recommendations are applied to each patient individually, and depend on factors such as overall efficiency and patient age, remaining joint disease process, body weight, and others.']	['<urn:uuid:fa6eed8a-d76c-4be6-b432-23be5493399e>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	33	101	1058

It is a product of the Earth Summit (UN Conference on Environment and Development) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. It is an action agenda for the UN, other multilateral organizations, and individual governments around the world that can be executed at local, national, and global levels.\nThe ""21"" in Agenda 21 refers to the 21st Century. Although it is also the area code for Greater Rio de Janeiro, plus Teresópolis and Mangaratiba in the countryside. By this cause, it is a number generally associated with Rio de Janeiro in Brazil (as 212 is famously related to Manhattan). It has been affirmed and had a few modifications at subsequent UN conferences.\n- 1 Structure and contents\n- 2 Development and evolution\n- 3 Implementation\n- 4 National level\n- 5 See also\n- 6 References\n- 7 Further reading\n- 8 External links\nStructure and contents\nAgenda 21 is a 350-page document divided into 40 chapters that have been grouped into 4 sections:\n- Section I: Social and Economic Dimensions: is directed toward combating poverty, especially in developing countries, changing consumption patterns, promoting health, achieving a more sustainable population, and sustainable settlement in decision making.\n- Section II: Conservation and Management of Resources for Development: Includes atmospheric protection, combating deforestation, protecting fragile environments, conservation of biological diversity (biodiversity), control of pollution and the management of biotechnology, and radioactive wastes.\n- Section III: Strengthening the Role of Major Groups: includes the roles of children and youth, women, NGOs, local authorities, business and industry, and workers; and strengthening the role of indigenous peoples, their communities, and farmers.\n- Section IV: Means of Implementation: implementation includes science, technology transfer, education, international institutions and financial mechanisms.\nDevelopment and evolution\nThe full text of Agenda 21 was made public at the UN Conference on Environment and Development (Earth Summit), held in Rio de Janeiro on June 13, 1992, where 178 governments voted to adopt the program. The final text was the result of drafting, consultation, and negotiation, beginning in 1989 and culminating at the two-week conference.\nIn 1997, the UN General Assembly held a special session to appraise the status of Agenda 21 (Rio +5). The Assembly recognized progress as ""uneven"" and identified key trends, including increasing globalization, widening inequalities in income, and continued deterioration of the global environment. A new General Assembly Resolution (S-19/2) promised further action.\nThe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, agreed to at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2002), affirmed UN commitment to ""full implementation"" of Agenda 21, alongside achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other international agreements.\nAgenda 21 for culture (2002)\nThe first World Public Meeting on Culture, held in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2002, came up with the idea to establish guidelines for local cultural policies, something comparable to what Agenda 21 was for the environment. They are to be included in various subsections of Agenda 21 and will be carried out through a wide range of sub-programs beginning with G8 countries.\nIn 2012, at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development the attending members reaffirmed their commitment to Agenda 21 in their outcome document called ""The Future We Want"". 180 leaders from nations participated.\nThe Commission on Sustainable Development acts as a high-level forum on sustainable development and has acted as preparatory committee for summits and sessions on the implementation of Agenda 21. The UN Division for Sustainable Development acts as the secretariat to the Commission and works ""within the context of"" Agenda 21.\nImplementation by member states remains voluntary, and its adoption has varied.\nThe implementation of Agenda 21 was intended to involve action at international, national, regional and local levels. Some national and state governments have legislated or advised that local authorities take steps to implement the plan locally, as recommended in Chapter 28 of the document. These programs are often known as ""Local Agenda 21"" or ""LA21"". For example, in the Philippines, the plan is ""Philippines Agenda 21"" (PA21). The group, ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, formed in 1990; today its members come from over 1,000 cities, towns, and counties in 88 countries and is widely regarded as a paragon of Agenda 21 implementation.\nIn other countries[which?], opposition to Agenda 21\'s ideas has surfaced to varied extents. In some cases, opposition has been legislated into several States limiting or forbidding the participation and/or funding of local government activities that support Agenda 21.\n|This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2012)|\nThe UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs\' Division for Sustainable Development monitors and evaluates progress, nation by nation, towards the adoption of Agenda 21, and makes these reports available to the public on its website.\nAustralia, for example, is a signatory to Agenda 21 and 88 of its municipalities subscribe to ICLEI, an organization that promotes Agenda 21 globally. Australia\'s membership is second only to that of the United States. European countries generally possess well documented Agenda 21 statuses. France, whose national government, along with 14 cities, is a signatory, boasts nationwide programs supporting Agenda 21. The French activist group Nouvelle Force announced in March 2012 that they viewed Agenda 21 as a ""sham"".\nIn Africa, national support for Agenda 21 is strong and most countries are signatories. But support is often closely tied to environmental challenges specific to each country; for example, in 2002 Sam Nujoma, who was then President of Namibia, spoke about the importance of adhering to Agenda 21 at the 2002 Earth Summit, noting that as a semi-arid country, Namibia sets a lot of store in the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). Furthermore, there is little mention of Agenda 21 at the local level in indigenous media. Only major municipalities in sub-Saharan African countries are members of ICLEI. Agenda 21 participation in North African countries mirrors that of Middle Eastern countries, with most countries being signatories but little to no adoption on the local-government level. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa generally have poorly documented Agenda 21 status reports. By contrast, South Africa\'s participation in Agenda 21 mirrors that of modern Europe, with 21 city members of ICLEI and support of Agenda 21 by national-level government.\n|This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (May 2014)|\nThe national focal point in the United States is the Division Chief for Sustainable Development and Multilateral Affairs, Office of Environmental Policy, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, U.S. Department of State. A June 2012 poll of 1,300 United States voters by the American Planning Association found that 9% supported Agenda 21, 6% opposed it, and 85% thought they didn\'t have enough information to form an opinion.\nThe United States is a signatory country to Agenda 21, but because Agenda 21 is a legally non-binding statement of intent and not a treaty, the United States Senate did not hold a formal debate or vote on it. It is therefore not considered to be law under Article Six of the United States Constitution. President George H. W. Bush was one of the 178 heads of government who signed the final text of the agreement at the Earth Summit in 1992, and in the same year Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Eliot Engel and William Broomfield spoke in support of United States House of Representatives Concurrent Resolution 353, supporting implementation of Agenda 21 in the United States. Created by a 1993 Executive Order, the President\'s Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD) is explicitly charged with recommending a national action plan for sustainable development to the President. The PCSD is composed of leaders from government and industry, as well as from environmental, labor and civil rights organizations. The PCSD submitted its report, ""Sustainable America: A New Consensus"", to the President in early 1996. In the absence of a multi-sectoral consensus on how to achieve sustainable development in the United States, the PCSD was conceived to formulate recommendations for the implementation of Agenda 21.\nIn the United States, over 528 cities are members of ICLEI, an international sustainability organization that helps to implement the Agenda 21 and Local Agenda 21 concepts across the world. The United States has nearly half of the ICLEI\'s global membership of 1,200 cities promoting sustainable development at a local level. The United States also has one of the most comprehensively documented Agenda 21 status reports. In response to the opposition, Don Knapp, U.S. spokesman for the ICLEI, has said ""Sustainable development is not a top-down conspiracy from the U.N., but a bottom-up push from local governments"".\nThe Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry successfully lobbied against an anti-sustainable development bill in 2012, arguing ""It would be bad for business"" as it could drive away corporations that have embraced sustainable development.\nDuring the last decade, opposition to Agenda 21 has increased within the United States at the local, state, and federal levels. The Republican National Committee has adopted a resolution opposing Agenda 21, and the Republican Party platform stated that ""We strongly reject the U.N. Agenda 21 as erosive of American sovereignty."" Several state and local governments have considered or passed motions and legislation opposing Agenda 21. Alabama became the first state to prohibit government participation in Agenda 21. Many other states, including Arizona, are drafting, and close to passing legislation to ban Agenda 21.\nActivists, some of whom have been associated with the Tea Party movement by The New York Times and The Huffington Post, have said that Agenda 21 is a conspiracy by the United Nations to deprive individuals of property rights. Columnists in The Atlantic have linked opposition to Agenda 21 to the property rights movement in the United States. In 2012 Glenn Beck co-wrote a dystopian novel titled Agenda 21 based in part on concepts discussed in the UN plan.\n- Ecologically sustainable development\n- Education for sustainable development\n- Global Map\n- ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA\n- International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives\n- Man and the Biosphere Programme\n- National Strategy for a Sustainable America\n- Think globally, act locally\n- ""What is Agenda 21?"".

35	I'm learning about car belts. What causes them to break and how do they work?	CVT belts work through a pulley system with variable-diameter pulleys made of two cones, allowing infinite variability between highest and lowest gears. One pulley connects to the engine's crankshaft (drive pulley), while the other transfers energy to the wheels (driven pulley). Belts can break due to several factors: excess heat from slippage, hot environments making them brittle, contamination from oil and debris that weakens compound bonds, and improper loading conditions like high-shock loads or incorrect tension.	['CVT Belt Guide\nConstant Variable Transmission or CVT\nThe job of the transmission is to change the speed ratio between the engine and the wheels. The transmission uses a range of gears — from low to high — to make more effective use of the engine’s torque as driving conditions change. The gears can be engaged manually or automatically. Today’s side x side vehicles all use a type of automatic transmission called a continuously variable transmission or CVT.\nUnlike traditional automatic transmissions used in cars that are much too heavy for a side x side vehicle, CVTs don’t have any sort of gears. The CVT operates on a pulley system that allows an infinite variability between highest and lowest gears with no discrete steps or shifts.\nCVTs used in Rhinos, RZRs, Rangers, Teryx and Prowlers have three basic components:\nThe variable-diameter pulleys are the key to a CVT. Each pulley is made of two cones facing each other. A belt rides in the groove between the two cones. When the two cones of the pulley are far apart, the belt rides lower in the groove, and the radius of the belt loop going around the pulley gets smaller. When the cones are close together, the belt rides higher in the groove, and the radius of the belt loop going around the pulley gets larger.\nOne of the two pulleys is connected to the crankshaft of the engine. This pulley is typically called the drive pulley. The second pulley is called the driven or output pulley because the first pulley is turning it. The driven pulley transfers energy to the transfer case and onto the differentials, through the axles and out to the wheels.\nExcess heat is a real killer of CVT belts. Excess heat is created by belt slippage. The belt is cooled by air flow, so anything you do to slow the flow of air over your belt will make your belt even more hot.\nCVT belts slip as a normal part of operation, but limiting the amount of slip is key. Adding extra weight to the vehicle without changing how the clutch operates will cause more slipping. So will over size tires and added performance (pipe, air filter and other performance work). Added stress on the engine while driving in mud or in the sand dunes will also create belt slip.\nWhile it is impossible to set up a clutch on a UTV to handle all variations or vehicle weight, horsepower and driving conditions, it is possible to adjust your clutch with different springs and weights for the majority of conditions. Think of it as tuning your CVT to your vehicle modifications and riding areas.\nSince the RZR’s engine sits sideways, the belt is in between the seats and right behind them.\nOverview of changing a Polaris RZR CVT Belt and installing a EPI Clutch Kit:\nAftermarket Clutch Kit:\nEPI carries a complete line of clutch kits to work with your machine and your riding style… everything from trail riding and heavy duty hauling/working to mud running with oversized tires.\nEPI (Erlandson Performance Inc.) – www.erlandsonperformance.com\nReplacement Polaris RZR CVT Belts\nUTV Product Reviews', 'Many gremlins attack belts. Anticipating problems helps belts drive for years to come\nAwell-designed, industrial belt drive is capable of operating for several years when used under normal conditions, and properly maintained. Put it in a difficult environment, however, or simply neglect it, and you may end up with a belt that fails in days, hours, or even minutes. Fortunately, by troubleshooting for common problems and making periodic inspections, premature belt failures can be virtually eliminated.\nTHREAT: Ambient temperature\nThe most common cause of hot belts, by far, is a hot environment. Overheated belts threaten the whole motion system — they can become brittle, crack, and ultimately fail, often without warning. Their reduced flexibility also decreases drive efficiency.\nApplications with inherently high ambient temperatures benefit from ventilation around the drive to help dissipate this harmful heat. Designing sheaves with spokes or fins creates airflow while rotating, which cools belts; external air sources such as fans and air blowers also get the job done. However, fans should not force hotter air from a heat source across belts. More openings in the drive guard are another option; sometimes simply letting heat escape lowers temperatures to acceptable levels.\nBelt drive contamination is perhaps the easiest failure mode to identify. Belts can be visually inspected for oil or debris, which sometimes push through to the backside of the belt, making visible holes. Grease and oil on a pulley can also induce V-belt slipping, causing glazed, or shiny belt sidewalls. Another sign of oil contamination is when V-belts fall apart in layers; oils tend to weaken compound bonds and make for soft, spongy, and considerably weaker belts. Pitted or streaked sidewalls, or a tensile break, can indicate a larger foreign object in the pulley; an unusually loud drive might indicate smaller debris. Other types of contamination — harsh weather, high humidity, and sunlight exposure — also decrease drive performance.\nWhen pulleys are contaminated they must be cleaned, cleared of rust, paint, or dirt in grooves, and better shielded. After that, maintaining a clean environment will protect the drive, preventing other foreign objects from lodging between the belt and pulley. Anticipating these types of problems in V-belt and synchronous drive systems can also be useful in designing more user-friendly and serviceable equipment.\nTHREAT: Poor drive design\nDrives must be properly designed and built to reach their intended service life. In addition to determining the best size and number of belts to use, an engineer must consider other drive-design factors. For example, pulleys must be manufactured according to industry-accepted tolerances. Minimum recommended pulley diameters must be noted; for example, on a 3V-section V-belt, pulleys smaller than 2.65 in. will be troublesome. If a V-belt has deep cracks that begin at regular intervals in the undercord material, it might be running on a pulley that is too small.\nWith an unusually loud drive, improper belt cross-section might be the problem. Because belts don’t ride properly in pulleys that have the inappropriate angle, they should always be sized for proper cross-section prior to installation. In synchronous drive systems, sprockets should also be examined to confirm that they have the correct tooth profile.\nBelt guards must be designed for adequate worker safety and drive protection, yet still provide ventilation. Structural members of the drive including framework, motor mounts, and machine pads must be rigid, and must not deflect under load. Drives should be designed for minimal vibration, and for ease of maintenance and inspection.\nDefective drive components are rarely the cause of a drive problem. If other possible causes have been eliminated and a part is suspected defective, the belt or pulley supplier should help verify the concern and correct the problem.\nTHREAT: Improper loading\nSevere operating conditions or drives improperly designed for their challenging situations can cause high internal belt temperatures. Examples of these situations include:\n• Unavoidable high-shock loads — In certain applications, inherent conditions will always be severe (as in rock crushers and logging sawmill equipment). • Use of motors or engines larger than originally specified • Higher loads than expected — Failure to account for startup loads is one cause. • Use of high-speed motors with a corresponding reduction in pulley size\nThe Rubber Manufacturers Association (RMA) has developed service factor tables that categorize the severity of a variety of applications to help designers determine how rugged a system should be. By decreasing belt loads by designing drives with more or wider belts, internal belt temperature can be lessened. Decreasing belt bending stress also helps. This can be accomplished with a larger pulley or a different belt cross section; on V-belts, a cogged or molded notch version, which has increased flexibility, can also be substituted.\nImproper belt tension is the most common and obvious cause of slip, which generates unwanted heat. The friction that occurs when a V-belt slips in a pulley causes belt sidewalls to become glazed, and decreases gripping ability.\nAfter incorrect tensioning, faulty drive alignment is the second most significant cause of failure in belt drives. Misalignment is often indicated by unusual belt or pulley wear patterns; sidewalls become uneven, and covers become frayed; on synchronous belts, uneven tooth and side wear indicates misalignment. Misalignment also makes it hard to maintain proper tension, which compounds problems. Good installation practices require drive alignment and proper belt tension setting. Both V-belts and synchronous belts perform optimally with a tension appropriate for the load to be carried.\nTroubleshooting should include pulley alignment inspection and belt size and cross-section checks. During installation, belts should never be forced over the sheave edges. Using the drive center distance adjustment to slip the belt onto the sheaves — without prying — is a better method. Otherwise, tensile cords in the belt could be damaged or severed, greatly shortening life. Removal of one of the pulleys might be necessary to install the belt; when reinstalling them, correct alignment with the bushings is paramount. The bolts that connect sheaves to shafts need conscientious, alternating tightening for consistent torque levels. Finally, bushing hardware should never be substituted with another size.\nTHREAT: Everyday wear\nA common misconception is that metal sheaves and sprockets never wear out. Not so — many application engineers report that a significant number of belt drive problems can be traced to a problem with a metal component. Replacing worn pulleys is the only solution for the unusual belt noise and premature failure caused by this situation. At the end of their service life synchronous belt drives begin to show wear at the base of each tooth. Cracking will usually begin on the forward side of the tooth, in the direction of belt travel.']	['<urn:uuid:5a3063fc-2326-407c-b33c-fae895d9366d>', '<urn:uuid:2c9952d0-0f81-48df-ad82-9ae0bc59c2fe>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	15	76	1629
36	Which causes more acid buildup: diarrhea or kidney problems?	They cause different types of acidosis. Diarrhea causes a normal anion gap acidosis due to bicarbonate loss, while kidney problems (uremia) cause an increased anion gap acidosis. The anion gap is normally 3-11 mEq/L.	['For more information, visit www.nursing.com/cornell\nGet unlimited access to lessons and study tools\nIn this lesson we’re going to talk about the anion gap at what it means for your patient.\nSo to get started, the anion gap normal measurement is 3 to 11 ml equivalent per liter and what anion gap is is it’s a measurement of cations, so you positively charged ions in the body and anions or the negatively-charged ions in the body. So let’s look into how we get this measurement.\nSo in our body we have all of these molecules. And some of them are positively charged and some of them a negatively charged. So you have the positively charged particles or ions which are called cations, and you have the negatively charged ions. examples of positively charged ions are hydrogen, potassium, or sodium, and then negatively charged ones are chloride or bicarb. And all of these ions basically change the pH of the serum or the blood in the body. If you go to our lesson on arterial blood gases, you can get better ideas and understanding some things that cause issues like metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis, but these are conditions where the pH of the blood is changed. And what we need to look at is how we measure does changing the pH looking specifically at these molecules.\nThe way we do that is by using this equation. We look at the the difference between potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarb. Because potassium and sodium are positively charged you add those together, and because chloride and bicarbonate are negatively charged, you add those together. And then you look at the difference. So let’s say our potassium is 4 are sodium is 135, when we add those two together it gives us 139. Now let’s say our chloride is 105, and our bicarb is 25. that means the total of are negatively charged ions is 130. Now we’re going to look at the difference between are positive and negatively charged ions. That difference is 9, which is normal.\nWhat eventually happens is that if the gap ends up increasing, and we can’t account for it with these four standard variables. That means that there’s a buildup of some sort of other acid that’s contributing to this Gap. So these are things like lactic acid or keto acid and because you know that the accumulation of acids in the body is going to drop the pH, we can use the anion gap to look at specific causes for systemic changes in PH.\nWhen you submit you labs, you’re going to submit them in a green top tube or red top tube and they’re going to be either submitted with other panels, or they’re going to be commonly submitted with electrolytes. Its usually standard and most of your comprehensive metabolic panel is, or in conditions where you’re concerned about some sort of acidosis, so let’s get into reasons for acidosis or changes in that Gap.\nThere are three situations where you’re actually going to have changes in your Gap. You’re going to have an increased anion gap, you’re going to have a normal anion gap but the patient’s pH is off, or you’re going to have a decreased anion gap. With your increased anion gap, remember the mnemonic MUDPILES so it literally stands for the things that are going to cause increases in anion gap, or this increase in the amount of a negatively charged ions or anions. So methanol, uremia which is a problem with the kidneys, you’ve got Diabetic ketoacidosis where fats are being broken down for energy and that causes the increase in anions.. Propylene glycol toxicity, infection. You’ve also got lactic acidosis which could be due from different types of trauma or sepsis which is going to cause an increase in acidity, you’ve got ethylene glycol toxicity, and you’ve got salicylate toxicity as well.\nWhen you have decreased anion gaps, so this is going to be less than three, you’re going to look for situations where you have a loss of albumin. So you’ll want to pay attention to your albumin levels.\nThere is a situation where your patients pH is low, but the anion gap is actually normal or what we call closed. So the main cause of it is a loss of bicarbonate, so you’re going to look to things like renal failure or diarrhea. So correcting those two things will actually correct the patient’s pH even though the Gap is normal.\nIn this lesson for our nursing Concepts, we look at lab values and really pay attention to that acid-base balance because the anion gap is going to give us so much information about it.\nSo let’s recap.\nThe normal values for an anion gap is 3 to 11 ml equivalent per liter.\nRemember the formula that were looking for the difference in positively charged ions and negatively charged ions. They’re going to add your sodium & potassium together and take away your chloride and bicarb, and that’s going to give you your Gap.\nThe Gap is actually caused by the accumulation of other acids in the body\nWhen you’re looking at causes for an increased anion gap remember the mnemonic mudpiles. So methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis, propylene glycol poisoning, infection, lactic acid build up, ethylene glycol poisoning, and salicylate poisoning.\nAlso remember that you can have a normal anion gap with a decrease pH, and that’s going to be caused by losses of bicarb through the kidneys or the stool.\nThat’s it for our lesson on anion gap. Make sure you check out all the resources attached to this lesson. Now, go out and be your best selves today. And, as always, happy nursing!!', 'Hyperchloremic acidosis is caused by the loss of too much sodium bicarbonate from the body, which can happen with severe diarrhea.\nHow does Diarrhoea cause metabolic acidosis?\nBecause diarrheal stools have a higher bicarbonate concentration than plasma, the net result is a metabolic acidosis with volume depletion.\nHow does diarrhea affect acid base balance?\nHowever, diarrhea directly causes bicarb loss and the loss of bicarb is balanced by a net gain of chloride, creating a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis.\nWhy does diarrhea cause normal anion gap acidosis?\nDiarrhea: due to a loss of bicarbonate. This is compensated by an increase in chloride concentration, thus leading to a normal anion gap, or hyperchloremic, metabolic acidosis.\nWhat are three 3 causes of metabolic acidosis?\nThe most common causes of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis are gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss, renal tubular acidosis, drugs-induced hyperkalemia, early renal failure and administration of acids.\nDoes dehydration cause metabolic acidosis?\nMetabolic acidosis occurs in dehydrated patients with gastroenteritis; there are multiple causes of this acidosis. 1-5 It is generally believed that acidosis, equated with a reduced concentration of bicarbonate in serum, reflects the severity of dehydration, although no study substantiating this has been found.\nWhat electrolytes do you lose when you have diarrhea?\nWhen you have diarrhea, your body loses fluid (liquid) and you can become dehydrated. In addition to losing water, your body loses minerals called electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium.15 мая 2020 г.\nWhy do you lose bicarbonate in diarrhea?\nBase-deficit acidosis (metabolic acidosis)\nDuring diarrhoea, a large amount of bicarbonate may be lost in the stool. If the kidneys continue to function normally, much of the lost bicarbonate is replaced by the kidneys and a serious base deficit does not develop.\nWhy does hypokalemia cause diarrhea?\nGastrointestinal losses, from diarrhea, vomiting, or nasogastric suctioning, also are common causes of hypokalemia. Vomiting leads to hypokalemia via a complex pathogenesis. Gastric fluid itself contains little potassium, approximately 10 mEq/L.\nIs diarrhea acidic or basic?\nStomach acids, digestive enzymes, and bile\nBy the time food passes through, these acids and enzymes should no longer be acidic. Diarrhea speeds up the digestion process, so foods often do not break down fully. This means that stomach acids, digestive enzymes, and bile may still be present in diarrhea.\nDoes normal saline cause acidosis?\nRapid isotonic saline infusion predictably results in hyperchloraemic acidosis. The acidosis is due to a reduction in the strong anion gap by an excessive rise in plasma chloride as well as excessive renal bicarbonate elimination.\nHow does the body compensate for metabolic acidosis?\nAs blood pH drops (becomes more acidic), the parts of the brain that regulate breathing are stimulated to produce faster and deeper breathing (respiratory compensation). Breathing faster and deeper increases the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled. The kidneys also try to compensate by excreting more acid in the urine.\nWhich of the following is a cause of gap acidosis?\nThe most common causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis are: ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, kidney failure (also known as renal failure), and toxic ingestions.\nWhich condition is likely to cause metabolic acidosis?\nDiabetic acidosis (also called diabetic ketoacidosis and DKA) develops when substances called ketone bodies (which are acidic) build up during uncontrolled diabetes. Hyperchloremic acidosis is caused by the loss of too much sodium bicarbonate from the body, which can happen with severe diarrhea.\nHow do you fix metabolic acidosis?\nAdding base to counter high acids levels treats some types of metabolic acidosis. Intravenous (IV) treatment with a base called sodium bicarbonate is one way to balance acids in the blood. It ‘s used to treat conditions that cause acidosis through bicarbonate (base) loss.\nHow do you know if its metabolic acidosis or respiratory?\nHCO3-: Respiratory or Metabolic? After you’ve determined whether the sample is acidic or alkaline, you need to work out if it’s due to respiratory or metabolic causes. If the cause is respiratory in nature, the PaCO2 will be out of the normal range, whereas for metabolic problems the HCO3- will be abnormal.']	['<urn:uuid:b5f85d6a-0f2a-4066-ab02-426f27b57d90>', '<urn:uuid:54be9346-2852-4d1d-ba49-02002ee82709>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	9	34	1628
37	Why might time not have a definite forward direction?	Einstein's equations of general relativity make no fundamental distinction between forward and backward time directions. A time-symmetric solution shows the universe could expand in both time directions from the initial quantum fluctuation point, with each direction experiencing its own arrow of time defined by increasing entropy. This suggests the universe could be eternal and infinite without a beginning.	"['The Other Side of Time (2000)\nVictor J. Stenger\nUniversity of Hawaii\nIn The Creator and the Cosmos: How the Greatest Scientific Discoveries of the Century Reveal God, physicist Hugh Ross gives the following ""proof of creation"":\n""The universe and everything in it is confined to a single, finite dimension of time. Time in that dimension proceeds only and always forward. The flow of time can never be reversed. Nor can it be stopped. Because it has a beginning and can move in only one direction, time is really just half a dimension. The proof of creation lies in the mathematical observation that any entity confined to such a half dimension of time must have a starting point of origination. That is, that entity must be created. This necessity for creation applies to the whole universe and ultimately everything in it.""(Ross 1995, 80)\nThis claim is based on the ancient kaläm cosmological argument, which has been used in recent years by theistic philosopher William Lane Craig during his frequent debates on the existence of God and by many other theistic debaters who follow his lead. Craig states the argument as a simple syllogism (Craig 1979):\n(1) Whatever begins has a cause.\n(2) The universe began to exist.\n(3) Therefore, the universe has a cause.\nRoss interprets that cause as the creation.\nNote that Craig is not saying that everything must have a cause, which is a frequent misinterpretation. Only something with a beginning is supposed to require a cause. However, he gives no reason for (1) other than a kind of ""metaphysical intuition.""\nWhile (1) can be challenged on a number of fronts, let me just mention one rebuttal that has been made from physics. Quantum electrodynamics is a fifty-year-old theory of the interactions of electrons and photons that has made successful predictions to accuracies as great as twelve significant figures. Fundamental to that theory is the spontaneous appearance of electron-positron (anti-electron) pairs for brief periods of time, literally out of ""nothing."" Thus we have a counter example to statement (1), something that begins without cause.\nHowever, one might still argue that the quantum process, though random, is still a causal one. Rather than engage in a semantic dispute on this, let me move to statement (2) of the kaläm syllogism and attempt to show that the universe did not necessarily have a beginning. This will also serve to rebut another theist claim:\nRoss also uses the kaläm argument to counter the common atheist taunt: ""Who created God?"" He claims that God is not confined to a ""half dimension"" of time, and so need not have been created. I take this to mean that if I can demonstrate the universe is not necessarily confined to a half dimension, then Ross, Craig, and other theists who use the kaläm argument will be forced to admit that the universe was not necessarily created. (Of course they won\'t).\nFor this purpose, it should be adequate for me to provide a scenario in which the universe occupies both halves of the time axis. I do not feel compelled to prove that this scenario is true, just show how this is possible within the framework of existing knowledge.\nMy scenario is provided by inflationary big bang cosmology. Ross, Craig, and I agree that the big bang is strongly supported by astronomical observations. Inflation remains less firmly established, but remains the only current theory that successfully explains a wide range of observations. Furthermore, the model is falsifiable, and so maintains good scientific credentials. Indeed, with the 1992 COBE observation of a 1/100,000 fluctuation in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background, inflation passed at least one risky falsification test.\nSuppose the universe was at some point in time completely empty of matter, radiation, or energy of any type. It was about as nothing as nothing can be, a void. Physicists can still describe the void in terms of general relativity. It is completely flat geometrically, with space and time axes that run from minus infinity to plus infinity. Anything else and matter, radiation, or spacetime curvature would have to exist and this universe would no longer be a void.\nIn the absence of matter and radiation, Einstein\'s equations of general relativity yield the de Sitter solution, which simply expresses the curvature of space as proportional to the cosmological constant. When the universe is flat, this term is zero and the equation then reads: 0 = 0. This denotes the void.\nThis is the way things would have stayed were it not for quantum mechanics, which we can also apply to an empty void. The uncertainty principle allows for the spontaneous, uncaused appearance of energy in a small region of space without violating energy conservation . If that energy appears as matter (that is, rest energy) or radiation (kinetic energy of massless particles like photons), then it will have to disappear in a short time interval to maintain energy conservation. This can be expected to happen randomly throughout the spacetime void, with no significant permanent result.\nHowever, another possibility exists that can lead to a quite significant and permanent result. The fluctuation energy can appear instead as spacetime curvature within this tiny region, which is called a ""bubble of false vacuum."" This bubble still contains no matter or radiation, but is no longer a ""true vacuum"" because of the curvature, as expressed by a non-zero cosmological constant. According to the de Sitter solution, the bubble will expand exponentially in what is called inflation.\nThe energy density is constant for a brief interval of time. As the volume of the bubble increases exponentially during that interval, the energy contained within also increases exponentially. Although the first law of thermodynamics may seem to be violated, it is not. The pressure is negative and the bubble does work on itself as it expands. By the time it has inflated to the size of a proton, in perhaps 1042 second, the bubble contains sufficient energy to produce all the matter in the visible universe today. Frictional processes (this is all in the equations--see Stenger 1990) bring inflation to a halt, particle production begins, and the familiar Hubble expansion of the big bang takes over.\nWe can label as t = 0 the time at which the initial quantum fluctuation takes place. The expansion then proceeds on the positive side of the t-axis, as defined by the increasing entropy on that side. As first suggested by Boltzmann a century ago, the direction of time is by definition the direction in which the entropy of the bubble universe increases.\nNow, what about the negative side of the t-axis, the other half dimension? If we look at Einstein\'s equations, nothing forbids an expansion in that direction as well. Physicists usually simply ignore that solution because most share Ross\'s prejudice, expressed above, that time ""proceeds only and always forward."" But the equations of classical or quantum physics, including those of general relativity, make no fundamental distinction between the two time directions. Where that distinction appears, it is put in by hand as a boundary condition.\nHowever, a completely time-symmetric solution of Einstein\'s equations for the vacuum will give exponential inflation on both sides of the time axis, proceeding away from t = 0 where the initial quantum fluctuation was located. This implies the existence of another part of our universe, separated from our present part along the time axis. From our point of view, that part is in our deep past, exponentially deflating to the void prior to the quantum fluctuation that then grew to our current universe. However, from the point of view of an observer in the universe at that time, their future is into our past--the direction of increasing entropy on that side of the axis. They would experience a universe expanding into their future, just as we experience one expanding into our future.\nWould these different parts of the universe be identical, kind of mirror images of each other? Not unless physics is completely deterministic, which we do not believe to be the case. The two parts would more likely be two very different worlds, each expanding in its own merry way, filled with all the other random events that lead to the evolution of galaxies, stars, and perhaps some totally different kind of life.\nThis scenario also serves to explain why we experience such a large asymmetry in time, while our basic equations do not exhibit an asymmetry at all. Fundamentally, the universe as a whole is time-symmetric, running all the way from minus eternity to plus eternity with no preferred direction, no ""arrow"" of time. Indeed, the whole notion of beginning is meaningless in a time-symmetric universe. And, without a beginning, the kaläm cosmological argument for a creator fails because of the failure of step (2) in Craig\'s syllogism.\nI have described a scenario for an infinite, eternal, and symmetric universe that had no beginning. The quantum fluctuation occurs at one particular spatial point in an infinite void. Obviously it could have happened elsewhere in this void as well. This multiple universe scenario is exactly what is suggested by the chaotic inflationary model of Andre Linde. While multiple universes are not required to deflate the kaläm argument, they can be used to provide a scenario by which the so-called anthropic coincidences may have arisen naturally. Again, this scenario cannot be proven, just presented as a possibility that provides a non-supernatural alternative to the theistic creation. For more discussion and further references, see Stenger (1999).\nFinally, by showing that the universe did not necessarily have a beginning, we can counter another common theist line of argument used whenever the claim is made that a spontaneous ""creation"" violates no known physics. The theist will say, ""Where did physics come from?"" If their imagined God did not have to come from something, because she had no beginning, then neither did physics.\nCraig, William Lane 1979.

38	advanced feedstock sources implementation hurdles	There are multiple potential sources for advanced biofuel feedstock, including lignocellulosic materials from agriculture and forestry waste, seaweed, and biomass from underused marginal lands. However, implementation faces several hurdles. The scientific challenge involves efficiently breaking down plant cell walls to release fermentable sugars, as demonstrated in cow rumen research. Additionally, there are practical barriers including water scarcity, low fertility on marginal lands, infrastructure needs, regulatory compliance, and the need for internationally harmonized sustainability criteria, particularly for multi-output biorefineries serving international markets like shipping and aviation.	"['The study, in the journal Science, tackles a major barrier to the development of more affordable and environmentally sustainable biofuels. Rather than relying on the fermentation of simple sugars in food crops such as corn, beets or sugar cane (which is environmentally costly and threatens the food supply) researchers are looking for better ways to convert the leaves and stems of grasses or woody plants to liquid fuel. These ""second-generation"" biofuels ideally will be ""carbon neutral,"" absorbing as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as is emitted in their processing and use.\nBut breaking down and releasing the energy in the plant cell wall is no easy task.\n""The problem with second-generation biofuels is the problem of unlocking the soluble fermentable sugars that are in the plant cell wall,"" said University of Illinois animal sciences professor Roderick Mackie, an author on the study whose research into the microbial life of the bovine rumen set the stage for the new approach. ""The cow\'s been doing that for millions of years. And we want to examine the mechanisms that the cow uses to find enzymes for application in the biofuels industry.""\nIn previous studies beginning in 2008, Mackie and Washington State University professor Matthias Hess (then a postdoctoral researcher at the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute in California) used a decades-old technique for studying ruminant nutrition. They placed small, mesh bags containing either milled alfalfa or switchgrass through a cannula (a permanent, surgically installed portal) into the cow rumen and examined the microbes that adhered to each plant type after two or three days. Visual and chemical analyses showed that microbes in the rumen were efficiently breaking down both types of plant matter, with a different community of microbes attacking each plant type.\nThis and later experiments proved that the technique could help scientists find the microbes in the cow rumen that were most efficient at degrading a particular type of plant matter, said Mackie, who is a professor in the U. of I. Institute for Genomic Biology.\nIn the new study, the researchers focused on switchgrass, a promising biofuels crop. After incubating the switchgrass in the rumen for 72 hours, researchers conducted a genomic analysis of all of the microbes that adhered to switchgrass. This ""metagenomic"" approach, led by Edward Rubin, of the DOE Joint Genome Institute and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, analyzed all the genes in all the microbes present in a sample, rather than one at a time. This gave a more accurate picture of the processes in the rumen that make plant degradation possible, Mackie said.\n""Bacteria are microbes,"" he said. ""They don\'t live alone. They live in consortia, and they all contribute to the functioning and the services provided.""\nUsing a variety of techniques, the researchers sequenced and analyzed the total DNA in the sample, a huge undertaking that allowed them to identify 27,755 potential ""carbohydrate-active"" genes. They cloned some of these genes into bacteria, and successfully produced 90 proteins of interest. They found that 57 percent of these proteins demonstrated enzymatic activity against cellulosic plant material.\nThe researchers also were able to assemble the genomes of 15 previously ""uncultured"" (never before grown in a lab) microbes, said Hess, who is first author on the new study. Several techniques, including sequencing the genomes of individual cells and comparing those to the assembled genomes, validated this approach, he said.\nThese results suggest that the bovine rumen is one of the best microbial habitats to explore for sources of plant-degrading enzymes, the researchers reported.\nThe research team also included scientists from the DOE Joint Genome Institute, the University of California at Berkeley and Illumina Inc.

On the road to decarbonizing transport and reaching climate targets, the market uptake of renewable fuels is essential.\nThe European transport sector is the only major sector where greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are continuously increasing. According to the European Environment Agency, in 2016 the transport sector contributed 27 percent of total EU greenhouse gas emissions and they were 26.1 percent higher compared to 1990. While road transport has contributed the most to the transport sector’s GHG emissions, the largest increase in final energy consumption has occurred in the aviation sector between 1990 and 2016, and this sector is expected to continue growing rapidly. International shipping activity is also expected to increase as it is driven by increasing globalization and trade.\nIn response to increasing emissions, the EU has set several targets to mitigate and limit GHG emissions from transport. An overall target of a 60 percent reduction in GHG emission within the transport sector by 2050 was set in 2011 (compared to 1990) – still too low to reach the 2015 Paris Agreement aspiring to limit global warming to less than 1.5°C. In 2015, the study “Emission reduction targets for international aviation and shipping” conducted for the European Parliament suggests that by 2050 global aviation emissions should be at least 41 percent lower than in 2005, and the global emissions of the shipping sector to be at least 63 percent lower.\nRenewable fuels are among the most viable options to reduce GHG emissions in the transport sector. While electrification becomes more significant, (mainly in road and rail transport), advanced biofuels are expected to maintain a significant role for the shipping and aviation sectors – especially in the short- and mid-term. A number of scenarios conducted for the European Commission and by the International Energy Agency (IEA) indicate the need for large quantities of renewable fuel demanded by 2050. With the aim of contributing to the Paris Agreement goals, the PRIMES scenarios foresee a major increase in current biofuel use. If demand in 2050 is to be met completely by advanced biofuels, this implies a more than 10-fold increase of their uptake in the time frame between 2017-2050. For the successful and sufficient market uptake of biofuels, feedstock has to be produced sustainably in sufficient quantities.\nEnsuring sustainable feedstock\nThere has been a great deal of skepticism followed by strong debates about the overall sustainability of biofuels especially their impact on land use patterns and food prices, and their carbon emissions across the production value chain. In response, a new generation of renewable transport fuels is emerging produced from non-food biomass called advanced biofuels.\nEurope has significant potential to produce advanced biofuels from lignocellulosic feedstock (such as waste and residues from agriculture and forestry). There are many initiatives that provide evidence to that. The EU H2020 projects FORBIO and SEEMLA demonstrated that biomass can be produced for bioenergy in a sustainable way on underused land, a process which is in line with the objectives of the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED II), showing a high potential in promoting the production of advanced biofuels. The latest findings of the ADVANCEFUEL project show that many biomass sources are potential candidates that require sustainability efforts before they are readily available to produce advanced biofuels at a commercial scale (e.g. infrastructure, farmers experience, regulatory compliance and support, suitable for conversion).\nThe European transport sector is the only major sector where greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are continuously increasing.\nWater scarcity, low fertility and marginality are major challenges concerning biomass productivity and profitability on underused land. The web geographic information system (GIS) developed by the BIOPLAT EU project helps identify suitable marginal, underutilized and contaminated (MUC) lands around Europe, assessing environmental, social and economical sustainability indicators of bioenergy value chains. Another option to tackle limited available fresh water and marginal land is to use seaweed as novel biomass for alternative transport fuels. The MacroFuels project developed several routes for the con- version of seaweed to biofuels which, once upscaled, will be economically viable. MacroFuels further achieved urgent technological breakthroughs towards large-scale seaweed cultivation such as deployment and cultivation at sea, automated harvesting or efficient storage and pre-treatment methods.\nAlthough RED II is an important step forward in recognizing the need to cover all bioenergy uses and supporting renewable fuels in the transport sector, lack of internationally recognized and harmonized criteria between different bioenergy sectors remains a major barrier to the commercialization of advanced biofuels that will increasingly be produced in multi-output biorefineries and supplied to international markets such as shipping and aviation. Harmonization of national and voluntary sustainability certification schemes at EU level is key for the market uptake of advanced biofuels. The ADVANCEFUEL project provides a set of sustainability criteria and indicators along the whole supply chain and recommendations to enhance the sustainability performance of biofuels.\nEnd use of advanced biofuels\nIn addition to incremental sustainability governance and availability of biomass for the production of advanced biofuels, a secure and stable policy framework and significant cost reductions are essential for a successful market uptake. According to the progress review by the European Commission conducted by Navigant, the EU is on track for reaching renewable energy and biofuel targets 2020. However, the IEA World Energy Outlook, flags that the biofuel production in EU member states is not on track to meet the IEA Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) demand in 2030 as most biofuel consumption is at low percentage blend levels with fossil fuels. It forecasts annual production growth of 0.5 percent in Europe, falling short of the 8 percent of growth to meet the SDS. Higher biofuel blend rates or greater use of drop-in biofuels are essential to increase the consumption of biofuels. To tackle the high costs of advanced biofuel investment and production, the IEA recommends to introduce supportive policies to facilitate the technology learning and production scale-up necessary to reduce costs.\nEuropean renewable fuels market analysis by the ADVANCEFUEL project indicates that Europe started off well with the advanced fuels sub-obligation of 3.5 percent (including double counting) introduced in RED II. However, this may not be yet sufficient to meet the Paris Agreement targets. For road and rail transport, the EU introduced a mandatory renewable energy target. In contrary to road and rail, the aviation and shipping sectors are regulated at an international level. As of 2021, a global market-based measure, Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), will be operational addressing CO2 emissions in the aviation sector allowing airlines to buy emission reduction offsets from other sectors to compensate emissions or use eligible fuels with lower carbon use.\nProduction costs of advanced biofuels are more than twice the price of conventional fossil fuels.\nIn spring 2018, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adopted a strategy to reduce total GHG emissions from shipping by 50 percent in 2050, and to reduce the average carbon intensity by 40 percent in 2030 and 70 percent in 2050, compared to 2008 by focusing efforts on enhancing the energy efficiency performance of shipping, encouraging the development of national action plans to develop policies addressing GHG emissions from international shipping, and provide technical cooperation and capacity-building activities.\nScaling up advanced biofuels\nProduction costs of advanced biofuels from lignocellulosic feedstocks are typically more than twice the price of conventional fossil fuels and the current low fossil fuel prices have been a considerable obstacle to their development and deployment as shown by latest ADVANCEFUEL results. The shipping sector can use a large range of advanced biofuels. The future ability of advanced biofuels to compete in the market will depend on cost reductions such as technological learning, economies of scale, efficiency improvements, more affordable and more sustainable feedstocks as well as the evolution of fossil fuel prices. Making them competitive can be difficult, especially in the aviation sector due to their high production costs and energy intensity. In shipping, biofuels can be a viable option due to lower production costs and the large demand from the industry.\nTo reach climate goals and decarbonize road, maritime and air transport, upscaling biofuels is crucial and an indispensable way forward in the energy transition. In addition to using all possible renewable fuel options, maximizing energy efficiency and energy saving is necessary. There are still some roadblocks to remove in the strategy to ensure a smooth market uptake of renewable fuels. Concerted stakeholder action is essential to put transport biofuels on track with the Paris Agreement. Policy is therefore an important tool to steer future market uptake towards value chains that source sustainable feedstock and employ resource efficient conversion pathways generating rural and global economic development and a more decarbonized mobility around the world.']"	['<urn:uuid:e5032d76-f623-4c90-be46-89497eb798a4>', '<urn:uuid:09a8fc6a-0002-4743-ade4-8f119f121d9c>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	5	85	2472
39	origin historical significance cameos modern market trends	Cameos originated around 300 BC in Alexandria, Egypt, initially carved from sardonyx with images of gods and rulers. Their historical significance includes use by powerful figures like Alexander the Great and Roman emperors. Today, the global jewelry market has evolved significantly, with cameos being part of a broader luxury sector projected to reach $480.5 billion by 2025. Modern production mainly uses seashells from Madagascar and South Africa, with Torre del Greco, Italy as the primary carving center. The contemporary market shows a shift toward customization and ethical sourcing, with consumers increasingly valuing sustainability and transparent production processes.	"['History of Cameos and Cameo Jewelry\nWhat is a Cameo?\nCameo is a method of carving a piece of jewelry or other object with a raised relief, and where the colour of the relief contrasts with that of the background.\nThis is achieved by carving a piece of material with a flat plane where two different colours meet, taking away the entire first colour except for the image and leaving the background as a contrasting colour.\nDuring the course of history cameos have been used to depict rulers and famous leaders. In addition, famous leaders, like Alexander the Great, had them carved portraying themselves as gods.\nMythological and classical themes have also been popular in cameo carving and a lot of the modern ones are images of a beautiful woman in profile.\nNowadays a lot of cameos are carved from seashells, a production method that started in the fifteenth or sixteenth century and made popular in the time of Queen Victoria.\nThese days’ helmet shells from Madagascar and South Africa are the most commonly used shell and the main centre for carving from seashells is Torre del Greco in Italy.\nThe seashells are first marked with a series of ovals and then cut into a series of oval blanks. The highly skilled carver then uses a metal scraping tool called a bulino for the bulk of the carving of the cameo, and then a number of different gravers are used to complete the job.\nA grinding tool is used for faster production and when the cameo has been finished, it is soaked in olive oil, washed with soapy water and then polished with a hand brush.\nModern cameos can also be produced from layered agates. The most popular colour combinations are white on blue, white on black and white on red-brown, and the layers are often dyed to make the colour contrast stronger. Most of the current agate ones are produced with the use of an Ultrasonic Mill.\nA master design is produced by a highly skilled craftsman and the Ultrasonic Mill allows multiple copies of this master design for a cameo to be turned out very rapidly by pressing a master die on the agate blanks. A fine layer of diamond slurry is used to help with the cutting and the die vibrates ultrasonically in a vertical motion.\nCameos have been used as adornments for many things and have even been attached to military accessories such as helmets, sword handles and breastplates. They have also been used to ornament vases, dishes and cups.\nCameos were used as decorations in houses in Roman times and later in Georgian houses in Britain. As well as being carved from shell and hard gemstones such as agate and sardoynx, they have also been carved from the volcanic lava of Mount Vesuvius and in jet from Whitby.\nThe Origins of the Cameo\nThe origins of cameos go back into our distant past and to the development of ancient carving techniques which allowed figures, known as petroglyphs, to be carved into the rocks as long ago as 15,000 BC.\nTrue cameos, which are carvings in relief, were first produced in the Egyptian port of Alexandria in around 300 BC.\nThis development was generated from the introduction of the sardonyx, a multi-layered gemstone, into Egypt and Europe from India and Arabia.\nThese cameos created a picture from the lighter, upper layers of the stone which stood out from the lower, darker layers. The ancient craftsmen used simple belt driven drills and carved the finer details with hand held metal gravers.\nAn amazing example of bas-relief carved in sardoynx is the Farnese Cup, named after the family who acquired it in the fifteenth century. The Farnese Cup was carved around 150 BC and had the head of the gorgon Medusa complete with snakes carved on the underside of the cup.\nIt was believed in ancient times that having Medusa’s head carved on plates and drinking vessels would protect the person using them from being poisoned.\nThe Greek and Roman cameos were commonly carved with images of gods and goddesses, mythological symbols, and portraits of beautiful women. In ancient Greece, young women would use cameos carved with an image of the Greek god of love, Eros, on them to express their desire for a young man.\nThey also became very popular in Roman times. These antique cameos were placed in jewelry or created as portraits to hang on the walls of wealthy Roman’s villas. Many rich Romans owned Greek slaves who were skilled stone carvers who were set to the task of carving intricate cameo’s for their masters.\nAn exquisite example from the Roman era is the Gemma Augusta, which was carved in honour of the Roman Emperor Augustus and another is the Grand Camee de France jewel that was carved by Dioskourides in 25 BC.\nHistory of Cameos from the Renaissance\nThe art of carving cameos was largely lost during the Dark Ages and it wasn’t until the Renaissance brought a renewed interest in classical history and mythology that the lost art began to be relearned.\nIt is believed that seafarers from around the Bay of Naples began this process by carving sea shells into cameos during long sea voyages.\nIn Renaissance Italy, Pope Paul II was an enthusiastic collector and his fascination with cameos might even have played a part in his death as he loved to wear intricately carved ones on his fingers as rings. It is thought that wearing these cameo adornments led to his hands becoming so cold that he caught a chill and died.\nElizabeth I of England was supposed to have given cameos to her favoured loyal subjects as a sign of her regard and esteem. The best craftsmen that were carving them during this period were in Rome and Florence. During the 17th and 18th centuries cameos were collected by the nobility as a sign of wealth and prestige.\nNapoleon was also another lover of these jewels and he even wore a cameo on his wedding day and established a school in Paris that took in apprentices and taught the art of carving them.\nThe Russian Empress, Catherine the Great, was another who had an impressive collection of cameos.\nDuring the 18th century the English potter Josiah Wedgwood, started creating his famous blue pottery and also made Wedgwood cameos in two parts from jasperware ceramics in many different sizes and using lots of different profiles.\nCameos in the Victorian Era\nDuring the Victorian era the popularity of shell cameos grew and eclipsed the popularity of those carved from gemstones like agate and sardonyx.\nThe earliest seashell cameo’s date from the Renaissance and were usually white on a grey background, and these Victorian ones were carved mainly from cowry or mussel shells.\nBy the mid-18th century, shells from the West Indies were also being used, especially helmet shells and queen conch shells. It was also during this 19th century period that profiles of beautiful women on cameos started to predominate.\nDuring the Victorian era the carving of these jewels in the likeness of the owner also became very popular. The Victorian era saw the introduction of mass production and industrialisation, and so cameos could for the very first time be worn as jewelry by ordinary people.\nFinding The Best Cameo Jewelry\nIf you are a fan and wish to choose some jewelry, either for yourself or as a special gift, you will find a huge selection both in stores and online.\nThere are many contrasting colours to choose from, with the white on black, white on red-brown and white on blue colour combinations still being the most popular. The most popular image is still the profile of a beautiful woman.\nThis beautiful jewelry can be found in many different styles and to suit every budget. Traditionally, the pendants were worn on black velvet ribbons around the neck, but you can now get them attached to ribbons or chains.\nChoose from cameos set in gold and silver, and from a huge range of brooches, earrings, rings, bracelets and necklaces. Remember that when you wear your gorgeous jewelry, you are following in the footsteps of many mighty rulers and fashionable beauties from centuries gone by.', ""Jewelry is like a biography, a story that tells many chapters of our lives. Hence, the gems and jewelry sector plays a significant role in our life as well as in the Economy. Being quite a dynamic and fast-growing industry, consequential changes in jewelry industry are underway, both in the consumer behavior and in the industry itself. In the coming years, the development of large retailers/ brands would largely contribute to the growth of the gems and jewelry sector. Established brands are guiding the organized market and opening opportunities to grow.\nThe global jewelry market has seen continuous growth in the past few years and is projected to reach $480.5 billion by 2025. Jewelry has become one of the fastest-growing divisions in the luxury sector, prompting LVMH’s largest purchase yet: the $16.2bn acquisition of Tiffany in 2019. It contributes 7% to India's GDP and 15% to India’s total merchandise export. It employs over 4.64 million people, which is expected to reach 8.23 million by 2022. Annual global sales of $179 billion are expected to grow at a healthy clip of 5-6% each year, totaling $302.48 billion by 2020. But the jewellery industry is still primarily local. The ten biggest jewelry groups capture a mere 12% of the worldwide market. Only two— Cartier and Tiffany & Co. —are in Interbrand’s ranking of the top 100 global brands. The rest of the market consists of strong national retail brands, like Christ in Germany, Chow Tai Fook in China, and small or midsize enterprises that operate single-branch stores.\nFactors & Challenges:\nThe jewelry market trends research process includes various factors such as government policy, competitive landscape, market environment, present trends of the market, upcoming technological innovation, market risks and barriers, market opportunities and challenges, a growing number of digital buyers, an increasing female population, an increasing middle-class population, and growing tourism. The typical challenges would be in the form of declining rough-diamond mine supplies, e-Commerce fraud, and even delayed marriages.\nAs per the research, four types of consumers driving the growth of branded jewelry are identified as:\n“New money” consumers who wear branded jewelry to show off their newly acquired wealth and maintain a social strata\n“Old money” consumers, who prefer heirlooms or estate jewelry\nEmerging-market consumers, for whom established brands inspire trust and the sense of an upgraded lifestyle—a purchasing factor quoted by 80% of them.\nYoung working consumers who turn to brands as a means of self-expression and self-realization\nTo redefine the future of this industry, heavy jewelry is to be replaced with light-weight and sleek options. In upcoming times, industry manufacturers will focus on more sleek and simple designs, ranging between Rs 5000-25000. For example, the most famous Indian jewelry brand Tanishq has come up with 'Mia by Tanishq' . It is fashioned for the working woman who looks to jewelry to express herself. The charming collections are elegant and exciting, powerful and playful, trendy and tasteful, fine and fun. Their necklaces, bangles, rings, pendants, earrings, and bracelets are all made to mirror the woman who asserts herself in every sphere of her life, and looks great while balancing all aspects of her life – personal & professional together; for the woman of today who is always on the move, hence Mia- Me In Action .\nIn light of this trend, fine jewelers might consider introducing new product lines at affordable prices to entice younger or less affluent consumers, giving them an entry point into the brand. Alternatively, they could decide to play exclusively in the high-end and communicate that message strongly through its advertising, in-store experience, and customer service, like the brand Finnati , crafting ethereal designs with diamonds having supreme cut and clarity.\nDue to the high soaring prices of gold and diamond, artificial jewelry is in more demand and has a great potential to prosper. It is more affordable and convenient to embrace. For example - Voylla, Kushal, Sukkhi, Mirraw, Jumkey, Bluestone, Odara , and many small retailers are into the artificial business. Also, the concept of renting artificial and stoned jewelry is expanding as customers tend to rent the heavy bridal jewelry for the occasion and return it as they are of one-day use. The celebratory mindset of our returning customers looking to celebrate personal milestones will also add to the demand.\nCustomization & Personalization\nIt gives jewelry a special touch because it is designed to meet someone’s requirements. Giorgio Armani Privé, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, and Hermès all debuted their first high jewelry collections last year. Gucci , owned by Kering, also entered the high jewelry market, debuting a garden-themed Haute Joaillerie collection during the couture shows in Paris with a dedicated space in the Place Vendôme. This collection consists of more than 200 pieces, the majority of which are one-of-its-kind. Louis Vuitton traditionally bought cut gems but has started buying rough stones after seeing a surge in demand for unique creations, working with clients directly to determine their final forms. The success of personalization-driven jewelry brands like Pandora has inspired new businesses that approach the concept with varied aesthetics.\nHigher value on Ethical sourcing\nCrystal Clear Production - This shows a shift towards more transparency in the mysterious world of diamonds: a fascination with the stone, coupled with the increasing demand for sustainable production processes and traceable, ethical supply chains, means new procedures are coming into play. Transparency is critical especially among millennials, who favor products and businesses that have a conscience. The 4 Cs will no longer cut it –– millennials want to be assured that what they are buying has not had a negative impact on humans or the environment.\nMintel’s report demonstrates that sustainability and ethics are top of mind for 55% of UK jewelry buyers, who say it’s important for them that the jewelry and watches they purchase are made ethically. With an increased awareness of sustainability comes a desire for recycled materials. Many contemporary jewelers have been using mainly recycled gold for years, while others –– such as Lilian Von Trapp and Vieri –– work exclusively with it. British brand Lylie’s uses precious metal salvaged from technology waste, dental waste, and clients’ unwanted scrap: a process known as ‘e-mining’.\nInternationalization of brands & Industry consolidation\nThere is an expectation that a handful of thriving national or regional jewelry brands will join the ranks of top global brands by 2021. Swarovski is an oft-cited example. In addition, some local brands will almost certainly become known as globally as a result of industry consolidation. International retail groups will acquire small local jewelers. For example - Luxury goods giant LVHM’s acquisition of Tiffany & Co. for a whopping $16.2 billion at the end of 2019 marked the end of a year characterized by “super mega-mergers” worth over $10 billion in corporate deal-making. LVMH, owned by the wealthiest man in France, along with the addition of Tiffany’s to its global brand has helped bolster its jewelry branch, opening a path to the lucrative bridal and diamond sphere, and expanding the brand’s exposure to luxury consumers in the USA.\nWhen a jewelry business offers to finance their customers, the shopper doesn’t have to postpone a purchase due to a lack of immediately available funds. A brand like Harry Winston is very clear about what it stands for; a lower-priced offering would be dissonant with its image and dilute its brand. Subscription services, like Switch, MintGoose, and Pura Vida jewelry club allow customers to loan high jewelry, for a fraction of the cost of purchasing.\nA small-scale wedding may imply a bigger investment in jewelry. As wedding ceremonies have become a closed knit affair, families will not resort to lavish weddings, they will certainly look at gold as an embodiment of an auspicious beginning. Nowadays, gold and diamond are not considered as a mere investment but holding dignity in owning precious jewels.\nTimeless jewelry is all geared up to be a part of the new round. In this digital era, new standards will be set for after-sales services from home pick to home delivery of the repaired products, there will be a lot of new changes. A change will occur in terms of customer handling. Teams are being trained on how to demonstrate the jewelry to persuade the customers and at the same time, they are being trained how to communicate and channelize smooth experience for customers. The ‘Bureau of Indian Standard’ on gold hallmarking in India from January 2018 to include BIS mark purely in carat and fitness as well as the unit’s identification and the jeweler's identification mark on gold jewelry. The move is aimed at ensuring a quality check on gold jewelry.\nExperiential - More and more jewelers are opening piercing salons, as demand skyrockets, largely due to the trend of multiple ear piercings. Maria Tash at Liberty and Harrods, Lark & Berry in Marylebone and Sacred Gold in Coal Drops Yard is a far cry from the grungy tattoo and piercing studios of Camden High Street –– arguably a rite of passage for many a 15-year-old.\nSocial media marketing & Online shopping\nMost consumers prefer to buy expensive items from brick-and-mortar stores, which are perceived as more reliable and which provide the opportunity to touch and feel the merchandise—a crucial factor in a high-involvement category driven by sensory experience. As for fashion jewelry, it is predicted to have a slightly higher online share of sales, around 10-15% by 2020. The bulk of these sales will come from affordable branded jewelry, a somewhat standardized product segment in which consumers know exactly what they’re getting. Jewelry manufacturers can use digital media as a platform for conveying information, shaping brand identity, and building customer relationships.\nAccording to a recent survey, two-thirds of luxury shoppers say they engage in online research prior to an in-store purchase; one- to two-thirds say they frequently turn to social media for information and advice. According to Gartner research, the share of online sales across the US and Western European jewelry sales doubled over 2019 –– to the detriment of brick-and-mortar brands. More than 1 in 20 US jewelers stopped trading in 2018, according to the Jewelers’ Board of Trade (JBT), as companies were forced to either consolidate or close their doors.\nEg: Jennifer Fisher is praised for her social-media savvy, using her 270k-follower-strong Instagram account to promote her mid-range brass line, including on-trend pieces like statement hoops, sculptural cuffs worn by plenty of celebrities. Her private, direct-to-consumer fine jewelry that fuels the 100-percent self-funded business. Net sales were up 40% year-over-year, while the brand's online sales were up 200%.\nAs gender fluidity becomes more commonplace (35% of Gen Z know someone identifying as non-binary, a 2018 Pew study found), boundaries are being broken in jewelry trends, from watches to wedding rings and beyond. While male jewelry has always existed, more unisex pieces are coming to the fore –– for example, Gucci’s first jewelry collection is targeted at no specific gender.\nTo prosper and progress in life we have to accept changes and face challenges. Despite slowing down in the pandemic, the jewelry and gem industry has remained fluidic for many decades. The pandemic has changed the face of this industry which is more customer-centric and user-friendly. Gold has reaffirmed its faith in long term investment criteria and is a safe haven for bad times as what we are facing right now in post-Covid-19. Gold is beyond an adornment metal, it is a symbol of security. The phenomenal percentage increase in gold prices will eventually turn into an increment in sales in the coming future. As lockdown has given a negative sentiment to every trade and business, it is time to bring the change in all works of the industry.\n‘Jewelry is a treasure that lasts from one generation to another. ’\n– Dana Seng""]"	['<urn:uuid:10b04dd5-b898-49fe-9253-10956a91c7c6>', '<urn:uuid:877ff67a-928d-44b2-a726-342d2065c9a6>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	7	97	3337
40	how to find hidden water problems house when should get inspection professional	Water problems can be detected through visible signs like black/brown stains on walls/ceilings or musty odors in specific rooms. A professional inspection is recommended if you notice these signs. Professional inspectors use specialized equipment like non-invasive moisture meters, infrared imaging cameras, and thermal imaging technology to detect hidden water damage and elevated moisture levels. They can identify water damage even when it's not visible, as drywall can be soaked without showing moisture signs and can wick water up to 30 inches in height. The inspection process includes a comprehensive survey of affected areas, moisture measurements, and detailed reporting with photos. It's particularly important to get an inspection if you notice plumbing leaks or high water pressure (which should not exceed 75 PSI), as these can lead to slow leaks that may go undetected for months.	['When it comes to plumbing repairs, having the right tools in your arsenal c\nImagine waking up one morning, ready to start your day, only to find that t\nPosted by July 31, 2022on\nAn event that leads to water damage in the home may affect the floors and the walls too. When walls are not dried quickly, it can lead to a number of problems from mold growth to a lack of structural integrity. It’s important to contact a local restoration company to dry the walls and reduce the chance of further damage that’s expensive to fix. In this article, we will explain how drywall is saturated and how you can attempt to dry it yourself.\nWhen water enters an area at ground level, it will cover the floors and the floor coverings until they become fully saturated. At this point, the water will “wick” up the walls due to capillary action which is a common characteristic in porous materials. The speed and full extent of this upward water movement will depend on a few factors, such as: the volume of water present, the height of the water, the construction of the wall and more.\nIn this scenario, drywall is a bad material because it’s extremely absorbent and it contains cardboard and gypsum on both sides which are vulnerable to wicking. This may come as a surprise, but drywall can wick water up to a height of around 30 inches. This is on both sides of the drywall and the water can go higher on the inner wall surface due to restricted evaporation. Many people believe that water damage is visible, this is only partially true, the drywall can be soaked and it may display no signs of moisture.\nThe first consideration is whether you are going to hire a professional company to deal with the problem or if you’re going to attempt a DIY approach. We will always recommend the former. This may seem like bias, but drying out wet walls is a lot of work. The situation is exacerbated if the water damage is hidden and/or extensive in nature. There are many cases where a homeowner has attempted to dry out walls with no water damage restoration training and they have missed damaged areas. If you are determined to tackle this task, the following section may help.\nIf the source of the localized flooding is a burst pipe, then it’s important to shut-off the water source immediately. A local plumber should be contacted to identify and fix the section of broken pipe before you can dry the walls. When the repair is completed, you can open the windows and doors to speed up the drying process. Using floor fans to increase the air circulation in the affected areas in another smart move. If you have a dehumidifier, set it up near or in the room to remove the moisture from the air. This will remove more moisture from the damp walls indirectly.\nSpeeding up the evaporation process can help too. Remove the baseboards and molding to prevent the buildup of moisture behind them and store them in a dry location. If there are wall hangings on affected walls, they should be removed and put somewhere safe. If you have wallpaper, it should be removed and this can take a while when the paper is soaked. But, this is a crucial stage, the wallpaper will act as a seal to hold moisture next to the wall until it’s removed. You can find wallpaper removal products to dissolve the adhesive at your local hardware store. Then you will need a 3 inch up to a 6 inch scraping tool or flat broad knife to remove stubborn sections of wallpaper.\nWhen you dry out walls, it’s important to have patience because the process can take a long time. It may be tempting to rush the process or to start refinishing when the walls feel touch dry. But, this is a bad idea because the walls must be fully dry before you refinish affected rooms. One stage that many people miss is to check for the presence of mold growth in affected areas of the wall. Mold will release mold spores which are unhealthy to breathe and they will weaken the wall in the medium to long-term.\nIt’s important to dry the well walls quickly and correctly to reduce the potential for further damage. The walls will not fully dry if the problem is ignored and it will get worse which will drive up the eventual repair bill. The DIY approach is not recommended, a water damage remediation specialist has the experience and tools to dry walls faster.\nA restoration professional will have a tried and tested approach to your water damage problems. The technician will start with a survey of the affected areas to ascertain the true extent of the water damage. At this stage, they may use a non-invasive moisture meter which tests the walls with radio waves to prevent further damage. Another professional tool is the infrared imaging camera which displays where the water is located in the walls. When walls are wet there is more evaporation and this makes them look cooler than the walls that are still dry. Again, this is a non-invasive process and this helps the professional to identify the most affected areas for drying.\nIf the affected walls are not insulated, the restoration technician can dry the walls with no holes and the baseboard can stay in place. They will use high capacity air movers at 10-14 feet spacings along the entire wall, These will remove the excess moisture from the surface of the wall and then evaporate it quickly. A low grain refrigerant dehumidifier can be installed in a damp wall to prevent mold growth and reduce the humidity. Small holes may be drilled above the sill plate to get air into the wall cavity. This approach is a fast and effective way to dry water damage, but moisture barriers such as latex paints and wallpaper must be perforated or removed entirely. If the wall contains foil or plastic on the inner wall surface, it may be necessary to remove it because the wall will not dry properly.\nIf the affected walls are insulated, the process is similar to above if fiberglass insulation with paper backing is in place. But, foil-backed fiberglass, styrofoam or blown-in cellulose cannot be dried. The damaged wall sections will be removed with the insulation to start the rapid drying process and to prevent the growth of mold.\nThe restoration specialist will monitor the drying equipment at least once per day to check the progress. Moisture measurements will be taken to determine the drying times and when the dryness levels are equal to the unaffected areas the process is completed.\nIf you need plumbing pipe repair and water restoration services, contact your local professional plumber today.', 'The Purpose of a visual mold inspection is to identify the presence of mold growth or elevated moisture levels or moisture damage to the building. The inspector will use specialized equipment to detect if moisture is present in the building such as thermal imaging and moisture meter technology. The inspectors findings will be delivered to you in a comprehensive digital report with photos. Indoor air quality testing is also commonly performed during a mold inspection.\nHave you checked your water pressure regulator lately?\nWe have discovered several times during our Mold inspections that water pressure regulators have failed. This means the water pressure is too high which puts too much stress on the water supply piping, faucets and fixtures, water heaters etc. This condition may eventually lead to slow leaks in walls or ceilings which may go undetected for months, and or pipe bursts in the building which will cause major flooding and water damage. We have seen major damage occur from the failed water pressure regulator causing thousands of dollars in repairs and weeks of inconvenience to occupants during the remediation process. We strongly recommend testing your water regulator once a year and make sure it is no higher than 75 PSI.\nWhether you are buying, selling or renting a property or just want to ensure your present home or business has no visible mold present or poor indoor air quality, we can provide the professional service you need for piece of mind before moving into your new home or business. Our certified mold professional will perform a visual survey of your home or building. Using a variety of mold testing methodologies and 3rd party forensic lab analysis on air or surface samples collected. we can provide you with a detailed lab report of the findings and our recommendations for further remediation if mold is detected.\nHow Will You Know If You Need A Mold Inspection?\nDo you see black or brown stains on walls or ceilings in your home or business?\nDo you smell a musty odor in a specific room in your home or business?\nAre you experiencing roof leaks or plumbing leaks in your home or business?\nIf yes to any of the above then you may have a moisture intrusion problem and a possible mold problem.\nWe only provide mold inspections and testing, we do Not offer mold remediation services so we can offer you a honest non bias opinion of current conditions that may be conducive for mold to grow in your home or business.\nDetermining if mold exists in your home or business is a process:\nThe 1st step: Is to have our Certified mold inspector perform a non bias visual inspection along with air and surface samples if needed. Our certified mold inspector will visually inspect your home or business for visible mold and elevated moisture levels as well as conditions that may be conducive for mold to grow in the future.\nThe 2nd Step: If mold is observed during the visual inspection or if air and surface sampling test positive from the 3rd party laboratory, then a more intrusive inspection ( Mold Remediation ) may be needed by a qualified licensed professional. This intrusive inspection may require removal of drywall or plaster, cabinets or roofing materials to determine the amount of affected areas and find source of moisture. Then repair the source of moisture and remove all damaged materials, then dry out the affected areas with specialty mold remediation equipment such as Air Movers, Air Scrubbers and or Dehumidifiers.\nThe 3rd Step: Once the mold affected areas have been removed and source of moisture has been repaired and the mold affected areas have been dried completely a clearance test should be performed by us a non bias testing company. A minimum of 2 air samples should be taken in the mold affected containment area before any building materials are reinstalled. Once the test results are negative the contractor can rebuild the affected area of your home or building and then you can once again enjoy your home or business.\nWhat to Expect during the The Mold Inspection?\nWe will visually survey the structure’s interior for moisture stains/damage or possible moisture intrusion areas, as well as collect relative humidity, temperature and moisture reading measurements using moisture meter and thermal imaging technology. Should your property contain evidence of indoor mold growth, or conditions consistent with mold growth, we will recommend a sampling protocol, the sampling protocol is based on the overall condition of your property at the time of inspection. The mold inspector will explain how many samples are recommended however you will have final decision of how many we take aside from minimum of 2 air samples needed.\nSurface And Air Sampling Information\nSurface sample collection identifies what types of mold are found on a surface. Air sample collection identifies what types of mold spores are in the air and quantifies the amounts of each type. Air sample collection requires a minimum of two samples collected in order for the third party laboratory to have an outdoor control sample for comparative analysis. The indoor mold spore levels in your home should be similar to or lower than those in the outdoor environment.\nWhat does mold need to grow?\nMold requires moisture as well as a substrate or surface to grow on. High humidity, typically more than 60% may also provide an ample source of moisture for mold growth. Substrates such as wood, wallboard, ceiling tiles, carpet, wallpaper, paneling and leather items are favorite breeding grounds.\n(Mold inspection is outside the scope of a general home inspection and NOT included, It is offered as an additional service for a fee).']	['<urn:uuid:fdc0f2de-8c7b-4043-8f27-8a637816bd1c>', '<urn:uuid:ee948924-56fb-4e2d-ba96-ba3a14e7b3d9>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	12	135	2095
41	What happens at extreme temperature changes with thermometers?	Thermometers need to be calibrated when switching back and forth from extreme temperatures, such as freezing cold to boiling hot.	"[""why is calibration of a thermometer important\nOur Legionella Temperature Kits are trusted by facility management professionals nationwide. At this temperature, water can exist in solid, liquid, and gas phases simultaneously. Calibrate the thermometer when switching back and forth from extreme temperatures, such as freezing cold to boiling hot. New Report to Help Farmers Improve Poultry (Broiler) House Conditions Through Better Ventilation, Use Case: Temperature Monitoring of Investigational Product (IP) for Clinical Trial, Measurement Data via Bluetooth on Your Mobile & Remotely Via the Cloud, How to Choose a Data Logger That Suits Your Needs, Environmental Health Officer notices of closure. It’s mind-boggling to think about but doing so can increase appreciation for the role and need of calibration. Here are a few reasons detailing why calibration is important. The scientists announced they had observed a cold fusion reaction, but to the great embarrassment of the university, later tests proved they had not. The International Temperature Scale Once they realized it needed calibration, they sent the thermometer out for calibration and discovered it was out-of-tolerance to the point that all associated products had to be scrapped which cost the company about $1 million. With a well-executed calibration, it is ensured that your data loggers measure the same values as all other data loggers. Re-calibration of the certified thermometer updates the indications and thus allows the user to maintain accurate, reliable and consistent results when making temperature measurements. The reference thermometer and test thermometer are placed into bored holes in the test block. Calibration involves creating a constant temperature in which to test your thermometer to ensure that it is producing accurate readings. A uniform flow of gas is blown through the powder bath to maintain temperature equilibrium. Calibration defines the accuracy and quality of measurements recorded using a piece of equipment. The scale was later reversed, and now the boiling point is fixed at 100 degrees, and the freezing point at 0 degrees. “test thermometer”) is compared to a reference thermometer at certain temperatures within the range of use. Categories: As an example, watch this Fluke video on preventing common motor issues. To be safe, do so before the thermometer’s first use. Mike recalls when one of their pacemaker customers visited Boston Scientific to express appreciation for his pacemaker. Few people realize the critical role and importance of calibration in their daily lives. At one end is the “hot / measuring junction” which is connected to the substance needing its temperature measured. In my the next few posts I will continue to explore the science behind meaningful temperature measurement. Secondly, the ITS-90 scale is based on the assumption that the gasses used obey the ideal gas laws without exception. The equipment used as a reference should itself be directly traceable to equipment that is calibrated according to ISO/IEC 17025. To effectively use thermocouples to collect accurate data, it is important to calibrate it regularly. High Precision Digital Thermometers the centre of a piece of meat). Sampling and Gauging Supplies These fixed points were based on the intrinsic physical properties of certain pure materials, such as the boiling point of oxygen. Both stirred liquid baths and dry blocks operate under this simple concept. If not diagnosed quickly by calibrated, accurate test and measurement devices, the motor can fail unexpectedly. Your comment must be approved first, You've already submitted a review for this item, Thank you! These high-dollar items, while not quite as accurate as those maintained by a primary standards laboratory, can still provide a high-end calibration and a low measurement uncertainty that far exceeds what is required in most testing laboratories. More commonly, thermometers are calibrated by use of a comparison method in which the thermometer being calibrated (a.k.a. The Celsius system rapidly gained popularity for its ease of use with a decimal-based counting system and is still used today all over the world. See COVID-19 Information for our Customers, Wind Monitoring for Construction Sites & Cranes, Pharmaceutical/Medical Fridge Temperature Monitoring, Fridge/Freezer Temperature Monitoring Systems, Server Room Temperature & Humidity Monitors. Additionally, many medications must be manufactured within tight temperature and humidity tolerances to be effective and non-harmful. An example of why calibration is important in the aerospace industry is provided by the International Space Station. One pharmaceutical manufacturer learned the hard way about the significance of regularly calibrating and checking thermometers used in one of their drug manufacturing processes. Thank you for the comment! Personal injury and unnecessary business costs are some of the main risks of not calibrating. What is calibration and why is it important? The West 6100+ is part of the Plus Series of controllers that take flexibility and ease of use to new levels. One of the most famous scales was developed by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit around 1714. Let’s look at few examples by some of the industries illustrated in the Calibration Universe graphic above to further demonstrate the significance of calibration. Calibration Forms. Accurate measurements assured by calibration can improve safety by helping to maintain the proper environment for certain processes, especially those that are hypersensitive. Important Considerations • The calibration method used at your facility will depend on the types of temperature measuring device, monitoring frequency and intended use (ex: product receiving, product storage tanks, cold storage areas, pasteurization).\nJourneyman Plumber Test, Stanley Jr Tool Set Uk, Suny Oneonta Covid, Beethoven Piano Sonatas List, Yule Log For Sale, Suny Cobleskill Case, Multiple Choice Questions With Answers, Heraeus Silver Bar Fake,""]"	['<urn:uuid:10568201-9fdd-4b88-8720-26e9bfa4c14f>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	8	20	907
42	I need to store some epoxy products in my basement - what are the storage requirements for Clear Penetrating Epoxy Sealer compared to Craft Resin?	Clear Penetrating Epoxy Sealer should be stored in a temperature-stable environment like a cellar, with caps tightly screwed on to prevent solvent evaporation. Craft Resin should be stored in a shaded spot, out of direct sunlight, at a stable temperature of around 70°F (21°C) or slightly below.	"['What Is Clear Penetrating Epoxy Sealer™?\nSmiths Clear Penetrating Epoxy Sealer™ (CPES™) is a thin epoxy that will penetrate deeply into the surface of wood. It is the original product of Smiths and Co. and has been restoring and protecting for over 40 years now. It is also known as Lignu in Scandinavia and MultiWoodPrime for new wood applications. It is often abbreviated to CPES.\nThere is no substitute that performs as well. It is not cheap, but it is significantly cheaper than wood, repainting and maintenance generally. Do it once, do it right.\nClear Penetrating Epoxy Sealer is an epoxy product, supplied as Part A and Part B in two tins. It has to be mixed before use. It is mixed in a 1 to 1 ratio, and is tolerant of minor mix errors. If you wish to mix by weight, both Cold and Warm formula are mixed at 98 parts A by weight to 100 parts B by weight.\nPackaged between the two cans is a very comprehensive instruction leaflet. Please read this prior to use if you are unfamiliar with this product.\nCuring Rot With Clear Penetrating Epoxy Sealer\nClear Penetrating Epoxy Sealer is capable of restoring rotten wood and allowing it to resist further attack by rot. Often used in conjunction with Fill-It for this purpose to restore the original section of the timber. It’s use is well established in the marine world, where the cost of replacing timbers in a wooden boat give a significant incentive to ‘Restore not replace’, however it can be used to good effect to repair structural or cosmetic timbers in many other environments. Details on restoration use are found here. Because Clear Penetrating Epoxy Sealer and Fill-It work so well together, we sell repair kits containing both products at a discounted price too.\nPriming Wood to Make Paint and Varnish Last\nClear Penetrating Epoxy Sealer penetrates deeply into timber, especially so at the end grain. This penetration strongly resists the ingress of moisture, protecting joints and end grain particularly thoroughly. It also promotes adhesion of the top coat, which will bond far more strongly to CPES than to the wood itself, thus significantly increasing the life of the top coat and reducing maintenance costs. See here for full instructions on its use as a primer. Clear Penetrating Epoxy Sealer can be used without a top coat to achieve a natural surface finish on timber whilst protecting it from the elements, see here for instructions for this application.\nCuring characteristics: Which Formula CPES?\nClear Penetrating Epoxy Sealer is available in two formulations, a warm weather and a cold weather formulation. We stock and supply both formulations. For use in the UK Cold Weather Clear Penetrating Epoxy Sealer is recommended, Warm Weather Clear Penetrating Epoxy Sealer should be used if the temperatures will exceed 25 degrees centigrade. Check which temperature CPES you require if you are unsure.\nWorking With Smiths CPES, Clear Penetrating Epoxy Sealer\nThe two parts of Smiths CPES are supplied in separate tins, and the materials are mixed 1 part to 1 part prior to use. I find the easiest way is to take a parallel sided jam jar, decide how much you wish to mix, and make marks to suit,m say at 4 and 8cm up from the base on the jar. Pour to the marks, and shake gently.\nPrior to mixing you will find two metal inserts under the child proof caps. these inserts tightly seal the cans against solvent evaporation. I find these easiest to remove by hammering a small screwdriver through a cap, and prying it out.\nSolvent evaporation is the main means by which CPES ages, store the cans in a temperature stable environment such as a cellar, with the caps tightly screwed on, and 1.9 litre packs are useable well over a year later, bigger cans even longer. The resins do not go off or set in the cans.\nALL epoxy resins can cause skin sensitisation. Please always wear rubber gloves when working with CPES.\nIf you have some left over mixed CPES and wish to use it for the next coat, lightly cover the container in which you mixed it (Do not tightly screw the lid back on the jam jar, once the solvents have evaporated the resin is hard to the touch, and will glue the lid back on), keep it in a cool dark place (fridges are not recommended as sparks can ignite the solvents). It will remain useable for a surprisingly long time. Brushes likewise will soften again once placed into the container prior to applying the next coat.\nPriming for Caulks and similar\nModern polyurethane caulks, such as 3M 5200, will bind extremely strongly to CPES, as will the hybrid caulk Everbuild Stixall. This capability can be used to very good effect to achieve permanently sealed boat hulls, and permanent flexible sealed joints in timber framed houses etc.\nClear Penetrating Epoxy Sealer Reviews', 'We’ve covered the topic of using resin in warm/hot temperatures before, but now we’re moving towards cooler temperatures in the UK again, we’d like to switch it up and draw your awareness about working with resin in cooler temperatures.\nOne of the most important factors to ensure your epoxy resin cures properly is the temperature: the ideal temperature for both your Craft Resin and your workspace is slightly warmer than room temperature: 70-75F or 21-24C. Resin won\'t harden properly if the temperature is too low, so some precautions need to be taken during the colder months.\nHere are 3 simple things you can do to ensure a perfect cure in cold weather:\n- Ensure your resin is at room temperature: let it sit out for a few hours or give it a warm water bath.\n- Ensure your workspace is at room temperature: keep it no lower than 70F/21C and, ideally, above 75F/24C.\n- Ensure your workspace stays stable at room temperature for the first 24 hours of curing.\nBut why is temperature so important?\nWhat happens if you do use cold resin?\nAnd what effect can a cold room can have on your resin cure?\nWe’ll cover the why’s below:\n1. Ensure your RESIN is at room temperature.\nAt room temperature, Craft Resin is crystal clear with a honey-like consistency. Cold resin is thick with a cloudy, milky appearance due to thousands of cold-induced micro bubbles.\nYou’ll never be able to torch these out, which can be a complete pain if you want bubble free, crystal clear projects!\nCold resin is a thicker consistency, making it more difficult to pour.\nIt will have a cloudy, milky appearance due to thousands of cold induced micro bubbles.\nCold resin is thick and difficult to spread.\nIt will not self-level as easily as room temperature resin and has a frothy looking appearance.\nEven after torching, you will be left with frothy looking areas due to micro bubbles below the resin surface. You will not be able to torch these out.\nHow can I increase the temperature of my resin?\nIf your resin is cold, you need to bring it up to room temperature before you resin. You can do this by letting the resin bottles sit out to come up to temperature or an easier way is to try a warm water bath:\n- Always warm the bottles BEFORE you measure and mix.\n- Leave the lids on to prevent any water from getting mixed into your resin or hardener. (Water in your resin mixtures means a cloudy cure)\n- Place your bottles of resin and hardener in a container of warm water: the water doesn\'t need to be very hot ... about the temperature you\'d use for a baby\'s bath is just fine.\n- Don’t fully submerge the bottles.\n- Let the resin sit in the water bath for 15 minutes or so (this will depend on how cold your resin was to start with and how big your bottles are).\nTo prevent any water from getting into your resin mixture, always dry the bottles thoroughly before you open them.\nRoom temperature resin is smooth, clear and with a beautiful honey-like consistency. It pours and spreads with ease.\nTIP: If you are using a water bath to warm your Craft Resin, keep in mind that heat promotes a faster cure: this means that your 45 minute working time will be cut down by about 10 minutes. It also means that the resin may thicken and cure in the cup if you leave it sitting out on the work surface while you get your artwork ready. Get everything ready first, then measure and mix your resin and pour right away. Don\'t leave your warm resin sitting in the mixing cup!\n2. Ensure your WORKSPACE is at room temperature or above:\nWhen working with Craft Resin epoxy resin the 3 key guidelines for room temperature are:\n- WARM - 70-75F or 21-24C is ideal, but don\'t go below 70F/21C\n- DRY - 50% humidity is ideal, but anything below 85% relative humidity should be fine\n- STABLE - no dips in temperature during the first 24hrs\nDuring the colder winter months, the best case scenario is to plan ahead: use a heater in the room that you\'re planning on resining in to increase the ambient room temperature. Leave your resin in the room so that it will come up to temperature as well.\nWorking outside in cooler temperatures is not advised, and be careful when working in outside sheds/garages/workshops, as these areas can be very hard to stabilise the temperature in for the full 24 hours.\nWhat happens if the temperature of my room is too cold?\nWhen your room temperature is too cold, the resin will take far longer to cure.\nIf the temperature of your resin room is below 70F/21C, your resin may stay sticky for days or may not cure at all. If this happens, simply try moving your piece to warmer area or increase the room temperature ... your piece should cure dry to the touch after 24 hours.\nTIP: If your resin is still sticky, even after 24 hrs in a warmer environment, then temperature likely wasn\'t the issue. Your sticky resin is likely due to a measuring or mixing issue. Check out our blog Recommended Technique to learn how to measure and mix Craft Resin correctly. Every resin brands guidance is slightly different, if you’re not using Craft Resin, visit the brand you are using and seek guidance from them.\n3. Ensure your resin room STAYS STABLE at room temperature or above for the first 24 hours of curing.\nThe first 24 hours of a cure are critical ... and the resin room must remain warm, dry and stable, with no fluctuations or dips in temperature.\nFor example, placing your freshly resined piece to cure in a sunny window seems absolutely ideal, but when night falls and the temperature does too ... you may very well end up with what\'s known as the ""orange peel"" effect. This may look like dimples in your resin, waves and other strange surface imperfections.\nSo remember, when working with Craft Resin’s epoxy resin:\n- Use room temperature resin.\n- Ensure your resin room is at room temperature or above.\n- Ensure your resin room stays stable at room temperature for the first 24 hours of curing.\nFollow these simple points to help get a perfect, Craft Resin cure every time.\nWhat is the best temperature to store Craft Resin epoxy resin?\nOpened or unopened, store your Craft Resin bottles in a shaded spot, out of direct sunlight and in a spot where the temperature will stay stable at room temperature or just slightly below ( 70F or 21C ).\nIf you are in a warmer location right now and you’d like to learn more about working with Craft Resin in warmer conditions take a look at our warm weather Blog.\nIf you have any tips on working with epoxy resin in colder temperatures please do share them below in the comments.\nTeam Craft Resin']"	['<urn:uuid:459029e4-5357-4712-a245-634a0363b8bb>', '<urn:uuid:2d7323b4-6f5b-4573-a65a-0ccfe3a84e9c>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	25	47	2008
43	I'm researching the relationship between restaurant design and music - how do restaurants use both physical layout and sound elements to influence customer behavior, and what impact does this have on dining experience?	Restaurants strategically use both layout and sound to influence customer behavior. In terms of layout, fine dining establishments place tables further apart to create an intimate atmosphere that encourages lingering and higher spending, while fast-casual venues position tables closer together for faster turnover. Regarding sound, restaurants deliberately use music to affect dining pace - faster-paced music makes people chew faster and can help empty tables more quickly, while classical music slows people down and enhances the sophistication of upscale dishes. However, when combined with modern design trends that favor hard surfaces and open concepts, these acoustic elements can create excessive noise levels that have become the top complaint among diners, surpassing concerns about service, crowds, or food issues.	['When it comes to designing and decorating a restaurant, having a general knowledge of architectural balance and color palettes is a good foundation, but there is more to it. Restaurant design has a significant marketing component. Making the right design choices can reinforce your overall restaurant concept in a way that increases sales and promotes your business. Your restaurant design should enhance the dining experience and keep people coming back for both the food and the ambiance.\nHow Restaurant Design is Influenced by Restaurant Type\nYour restaurant may serve the best food in town, but if guests don’t enjoy the design and feel comfortable, they may not recommend your business to friends and family. The type of restaurant you are operating will have the most significant influence on your design choices.\nTypes of Restaurants\nEssentially, there are eight different types of restaurants:\n- Family style\n- Pop up restaurant\n- Cafe or Bistro\n- Fine dining\n- Fast food\n- Food truck\n- Restaurant buffet\nInterior Restaurant Design Essentials\nNo matter what type of restaurant you are operating, there are six main interior design elements that will need to be considered in your new restaurant design.\nBoth scientists and marketers understand the influence color can have on our brains. Color causes subconscious reactions that can be quite powerful. In the restaurant world, red is the predominant color because it tends to spark our appetite. Take McDonald’s for example. They have incorporated red in their logo, uniforms, and decor.\nNow consider the color blue. It has a calming effect that might be great for a home bathroom or bedroom where relaxation is the goal, but in a restaurant setting, it can actually slow metabolism. When it comes to restaurant design, your personal favorite color might not be the best choice for business.\nAs you choose tables and chairs, keep in mind that customers have no idea how much your decor costs. They won’t know the difference between a $900 designer chair or one that you bought in bulk at a warehouse. Customers are more concerned with function.\nIf you are operating a fine-dining restaurant, go for more plush and comfortable decor, soft lighting, and fluid lines that will make customers want to hang around and enjoy several courses along with some drinks. Cafes that cater to younger customers and have a faster table turnover rate can incorporate more modern elements like glass, metal and use more intense light and hard lines in their decor.\nThe importance and influence of lighting in restaurant design cannot be overstated. Lighting is the main factor in setting the mood of a restaurant. Strategically placed lighting can highlight certain architectural features, illuminate cozy seating areas, or hide some flaws. Smaller pendant lighting at tables tends to create an intimate and romantic feel while larger overhead lights make space feel lighter and more open. This is such an important aspect of restaurant design that if you don’t have experience with lighting, it is worth investing in hiring a lighting expert.\n4. Seating Spacing\nIt is important to find the balance between accommodating enough people to earn a profit and making people feel comfortable. You also want wait staff and customers to be able to easily navigate through the restaurant without having to squeeze between tables. For example, gourmet restaurants put more distance between tables for an intimate feel that encourages people to linger and spend more on a meal. Fast-casual restaurants can place tables closer together because customers tend to spend less time eating.\nMuch like color, music can have a major impact on the mood of both employees and customers while also stimulating appetites. Faster-paced music makes people chew faster and can help empty tables faster. Classic music slows us down and helps sophisticated dishes feel even fancier. Use the relationship between music and food to enhance your restaurant design and experience.\n6. Indoor Temperature and Air Quality\nYou don’t want the heat and smells from the kitchen overwhelming the dining area. The right HVAC and ventilation system can keep the dining room cool, comfortable, and smoke-free. While restaurant HVAC systems can be expensive, it is well worth the investment if it means that you can earn repeat customers who will provide you with positive word-of-mouth marketing.\nRestaurant Design Layout Basics\nIt can be easy to get caught up in the design of the dining room and overlook other essentials like the main entrance, bathrooms, and kitchen. However, these are also important elements that will affect the customer experience. Here are some restaurant layout basics to consider:\nThe Restaurant Entrance\nThe entrance, which includes both the interior and exterior, is the first impression a customer has of your restaurant. Use signs, music, lighting, plants, and other design tools to create a welcoming space that also reflects the theme of your restaurant.\nThe Waiting Area\nRestaurants that utilize a waiting area should not only include comfortable seating but make the most of the space by posting advertisements for special events, such as wine tastings, happy hours, etc. Also, be sure to place plenty of menus in this space so that customers can begin thinking about their order and get excited about the meal. If you have a bar area, customers should be able to grab a drink while they wait for their table.\nThe kitchen is the heart of every restaurant. The type of food you will be serving, the commercial equipment, and the technology you incorporate, will largely dictate the layout of the kitchen. You want to provide staff with a logical flow that helps them perform their best and have easy access to the tools they need.\nSome customers may prefer to enjoy their meal at the bar. That means that the bar should be just as comfortable and welcoming as the rest of the restaurant. The challenge is to make sure that it is also a functional space since servers will be coming in and out to pick up drink orders to deliver to tables and use the POS system. There needs to be the right balance between form and function.\nThe Dining Room\nDon’t forget to take your staff into account as you design your dining room. Yes, you want a comfortable and welcoming space, but your staff also needs to be able to function well in the dining area and easily execute their steps of service. Make sure that your seating capacity meets local fire codes and spend some time in every seat to get a feel for the overall view. This can help you perfectly position every seat and table.\nThis is another area where a bad impression can ruin that chance of repeat customers. The same design aesthetics and ambiance that define the rest of the restaurant should carry through to the bathroom. Also, make sure that someone is in charge of making sure paper products are adequately stocked throughout each shift and that the bathroom is clean.\nA great menu and delicious food can get you pretty far in the restaurant industry, but a well-designed space that enhances the dining experience will really seal the deal. Even if you are mostly dealing with online orders through apps and other software tools as COVID-19 continues to affect the industry, you can still work on making a great impression on customers. Putting the time and effort into considering essential design elements and their effect on how customers experience their food can make your establishment a success, no matter what type of restaurant you are running.\nHow do you design a restaurant?\nEssentially, there are eight different types of restaurant types that you can choose to design: fast casual,\nfamily-style, fine dining, cafe or bistro, fast food, food truck, restaurant buffet, and pop-up restaurant.\nHow do you design a restaurant interior?\nYou should pay careful attention to color, decor, lighting, music, seating spacing, and heating, cooling, and ventilation.\nWhat is the layout of a restaurant?\nBesides the dining room, you need to consider the entrance, waiting area, bar, kitchen, and restrooms and you design the layout of a restaurant.', '“I can’t hear you.”\nWhen the Line Hotel opened in Washington, DC, last December, the cocktail bars, gourmet coffee shops, and restaurants that fill its cavernous lobby drew a lot of buzz. Housed in a century-old church, the space was also reputedly beautiful.\nMy first visit in February confirmed that the Line was indeed as sleek as my friends and restaurant critics had suggested. There was just one problem: I wanted to leave almost as soon as I walked in. My ears were invaded by a deafening din. I felt like a trapped mouse, tortured with loud sounds for the purposes of an experiment. The noise was so irritating, I asked my husband whether we should go before our drinks arrived.\nWe ended up lingering for about half an hour at the Brothers and Sisters restaurant, straining to hear each other. On the way out, I tried to mention the tough acoustics to someone at the restaurant’s front desk. I don’t think he heard me.\nThis experience is by no means unique; it’s become a fixture of dining out in America. “What did you say?” “Can you repeat that?” and “It’s so loud in here” are now phrases as common as “Can I take your order?”\nBoth Zagat and Consumer Reports surveys have found that excessive noise is the top complaint diners have, ahead of service, crowds, or even food issues. Tom Sietsema, the restaurant critic for the Washington Post, also told me noise is “by far” his chief complaint about the restaurants he reviews.\n“I’ve been harping on this for a decade by now,” he said. “It’s a constant — a constant irritation.”\nBut here’s the thing: Loud restaurants aren’t just irksome — they’re a public health threat, especially for the people who work at or regularly patronize them. Being exposed to noise levels above 70 and 80 decibels — which many restaurants boast these days — causes hearing loss over time, Gail Richard, past president of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, told me. This kind of hearing loss is “preventable, but it’s also irreparable,” she added.\nIn reckoning with this underappreciated health threat, I’ve been wondering how we got here and why any well-meaning restaurateur would inflict this pain on his or her patrons and staff. I learned that there are a number of reasons — and they mostly have to do with restaurant design trends. In exposing them, I hope restaurateurs will take note: You may be deafening your staff and patrons. I also hope restaurant patrons will start, er, raising their voices about this, or voting with their feet.\n1) “No one wants to walk into a mausoleum”\nEveryone I spoke to for this story pointed out that some level of noisiness in restaurants is intentional — and you can thank (recently disgraced) celebrity chef Mario Batali for that.\nIn a great New York magazine article about loud restaurants, Adam Platt points out that the “Great Noise Boom” in eateries started to flourish in the late ’90s, around the time Batali began pumping the music he and his kitchen staff enjoyed working to into the dining room at Babbo in New York. “Over the next several years,” Platt writes, “as David Chang and his legions of imitators followed Batali’s lead, the front-of-the-house culture was slowly buried in a wall of sound.”\nBatali has explained his penchant for loud restaurants: He feels the sound conveys a sense of vibrancy and energy, feelings diners associate with eating out in New York. So the raucousness is by design.\nToday, restaurants still use loud music to achieve that same dynamism. As Sietsema told me, “When I go around town to hot restaurants, they are all pretty noisy, for a lot of reasons, I think. But partly I blame it on restaurants, because you’re looking to create buzz or energy in dining rooms. No one wants to walk into a mausoleum.”\nIndeed, quiet restaurants can be as unwelcoming as noisy ones. Remember the awkwardly silent haunts you’ve walked into that feel limp, where you had little privacy to speak freely? You probably wanted to leave as quickly as I did from the ear-piercing hotel in DC.\nStill, there’s a difference between spirited, ebullient sound levels and ears-on-fire, screaming-over-the-table, lip-reading clamor — and many restaurants fail to strike the right balance. In a New York Times investigation, a reporter got a decibel reading at 37 venues across New York City, including bars and restaurants, and “found levels that experts said bordered on dangerous at one-third of them.”\nFor this reason, Sietsema started carrying around a decibel meter (he also added sound ratings to his reviews) 10 years ago. Since then, he thinks restaurants have maintained a steady level of uncomfortable din. In other words, despite the years of complaining and awareness about the problem, it’s not getting any better.\nThere’s at least one other potential explanation for that: Noisy spaces may increase turnover, and there’s some evidence that they do encourage people to drink more and faster. So despite the discomfort and annoyance the noise causes for some people, it may still be good for the bottom line.\n2) Good acoustics can be expensive\nI used to think acoustics were an overlooked feature of restaurant design in America. So I was surprised to learn that they’re among the first thing restaurateurs think about when planning a new restaurant.\nBut doing acoustics right, it turns out, can be really expensive. You have to hire acoustic consultants or engineers, who case the geometry and surfaces of a space to figure out which materials and treatments might create a sound that’s pleasing to diners’ ears. Like any design and construction project, the more sophisticated you get, the more you drive up the cost.\nGreg Keffer, a partner with the Rockwell Group, an architecture and design firm, has worked on a number of restaurants with good reputations for acoustics, including Union Square Cafe in New York City. He noted that many common sound-controlling treatments — like spray-on foams or sound panels — “don’t look like a beautifully finished material.” So making sure your restaurant doesn’t feel or appear like a sound studio means investing in subtle sound-absorbing materials and treatments, which tend to be expensive.\nFor example, a custom acoustical finish system like Fellert can masquerade as stone or concrete and tamp down noise levels — but it costs a lot more to put in place than just leaving a ceiling raw. Simply sound-paneling a big ceiling can cost upward of $50,000.\n“There are a lot of products that address acoustics now in a way that can be beautiful and can be hidden, so you’re not feeling like they’re surrounding you and can really complement your designs,” Keffer added. “But it’s ultimately down to budget and whether [restaurateurs] want to invest.”\nMost restaurants aren’t exactly minting money, so owners need to think about what they’re going to prioritize in the budget. Because good sound treatments don’t make the splash that beautiful chairs or special artwork do, they can easily get punted to the bottom of the list.\n“Sound absorption can cost a lot,” Sietsema said. “I can see chefs and restaurateurs thinking, ‘I can either buy these sound panels people aren’t going to notice visually or I can hire an extra line cook or piece of equipment or somebody to do my pastries.’ It’s certainly a trade-off.”\n3) A shift in restaurant aesthetics has had a huge impact on our ears\nHaving said that, there are also low-cost techniques that can tamp down noise levels: carpets, table cloths, wall tapestries, drapes, plants. But they’ve mostly fallen out of fashion.\nThink about the last few trendy restaurants you visited. There’s a good chance at least one of them was housed in an industrial space, with minimally decorated brick or concrete walls, bare tables and floors, high ceilings, and exposed ducts. The explosion of new restaurants and the shift in aesthetics — down to the very spaces restaurants now commonly occupy — has fueled the restaurant noise boom.\nIn a 2010 article in the Wall Street Journal, reporter Katy McLaughlin documented how the move toward eating in concrete boxes coincided with a shift in decor and other design features, turning many restaurants into “noise traps”:\nUpscale restaurants have done away with carpeting, heavy curtains, tablecloths, and plush banquettes gradually over the decade, and then at a faster pace during the recession, saying such touches telegraph a fine-dining message out of sync with today’s cost-conscious, informal diner.\nAnd as these sound-absorbing elements went out of style, many restaurants introduced open-concept dining, with open kitchens or attached bar scenes, that helped turn up the volume.\nAs acoustically challenging as these settings have been for the ears of diners and restaurant workers, they’ve also been difficult for designers — which brings us back to the Line Hotel in DC.\n4) Some spaces — like former churches — will always be noisy when filled with people\nI called one of the designers on the Line Hotel project — Drew Stuart, a partner at Inc Architecture & Design — to ask him about what acoustics challenges he faced, and why the lobby was so loud. Stuart and his colleagues seem to have done everything right: They worked with an acoustics engineer “from day one,” he said, and looked top to bottom to find ways to control the sound.\nThey built high-tech sound-absorbing finishes into the ceilings and underneath the tables. The floor was originally pitched at an angle. “When we flattened the floor, we put in an acoustically isolating floor system,” Stuart said.\nBut the venue they were working with was really acoustically tricky. A former church, centered on a vast, open room with vaulted ceilings, it was created to be reflective, so that an entire congregation could hear the voice of the preacher with little amplification.\n“The [church] was designed for many to hear one,” Stuart added. “Now it’s been inverted so that many will hear the one across from them as opposed to the singular person addressing the room.”\n5) Americans are loud\nA final point about why restaurants are so loud. This has nothing to do with restaurateurs or designers or acoustic engineers. It has to do with Americans — who I believe are a slightly louder people, on average.\nAs a Canadian working in the US, I am often struck by how much louder my fellow diners in restaurants seem to be, and how much more loudly the people I’m walking near on streets speak to one another or into their cellphones.\nThis is not a scientific observation, but it’s one that’s fueled Reddit discussions and even a ban on “loud Americans” in a pub in Ireland. Sietsema, for one, also agreed with my view. “When Europeans imitate Americans, they shout,” he said. “We tend to be louder people — we’re louder talkers; we’re bigger with our expressions.”\nEconomist Tyler Cowen mused about this article at his blog, Marginal Revolution, and posited six interesting hypotheses for American loudness:\n1. At least originally, Americans had much more space than did Europeans, and this is still true to some degree. That induce norms of loudness, which have to some extent persisted.\n2. America is a nation of immigrants, with English-language proficiency of varying quality, including historically. For whatever reason, good or bad, we tend to shout a bit when the listener is not fluent in our language.\n3. Taleb has suggested that higher status people shout less, talk in more hushed tones, and are more likely to whisper, to grab the attention of the crowd. Perhaps America has fewer high status people to set social norms. Or perhaps our high status people derive status from their wealth, and feel the need to emit fewer cultural signals, just as wealthy Americans often dress more poorly or eat a worse diet than European elites.\n4. Characters on TV speak more loudly, and Americans watch more TV and admire and mimic it more.\n5. Americans command a broader personal space, keeping a greater distance, and thus they have to speak more loudly to each other (and they feel Italians are intrusive with respect to how close they stand).\n7. American culture values “forthrightness and self-confidence.” Plus maybe it’s a regional thing?\nFor fellow diners who aren’t used to American decibel levels, this noisiness can be particularly irritating — and it has been for me. One night at a pizza place in DC’s Georgetown neighborhood, I tried to compete with the howling of a woman at a neighboring table and felt myself screaming at my friends.\nThis factor, perhaps driving the noise in restaurants here, can’t be controlled for, but there are other things diners can do to protect themselves.\nHow to protect yourself from the noise\nThere is some consolation for restaurant-goers who cringe at the cacophony. A couple of recent developments may make dining out more pleasant.\nAt least at the high end, noise levels may be going down in restaurants. According to Devra Ferst at Eater:\nIn the decade since loud restaurants have become ubiquitous, small to mid-sized, casual restaurants — often with less backing — still embrace and work around the din, while a new generation of fine-dining and higher-end places with deep pockets are going back to if not a hushed dining room, one that allows for across the table conversation.\nThese restaurants have reintroduced noise-blotting carpets and tablecloths — and they’re making quiet dining a luxury for those who can afford to pay, Ferst writes. Hopefully this trend trickles down through all rungs of the restaurant population.\nDecibel-reading apps have also proliferated. Some, like SoundPrint, crowdsource users’ decibel readings to rate venues so that people who are hard of hearing or sensitive to noise,can find quiet spots. (In DC, for example, I found some popular restaurants with sound levels below 70 decibels, according to the crowdsourcing, and others that were “very loud,” over 80 decibels.) The NIOSH Sound Level Meter also allows you to measure sound in restaurants or your workplace.\nSince I downloaded a decibel reader, I’ve checked the sound in coffee shops, at the gym, in restaurants, even on the metro. It’s given me a sense of the relative loudness of various environments and which ones I might want to avoid.\nI also returned to the Line Hotel for a sound check. I found the noise less bothersome this time. The lobby’s bars and restaurants were pretty empty — about half as crowded as during my first visit, which coincided with the hotel’s opening months. But the sound still registered just above 80 decibels. (This is similar to what SoundPrint users have found, rating the Line’s Brothers and Sisters lobby restaurant a “loud” 79.)\nThere are even simpler things you can do to avoid loud restaurants or manage noise while you’re out:\nGo early: This one isn’t very fun. Who wants to eat at 5 pm? But if noise really bothers you, restaurants tend to be less heavily trafficked — and therefore quieter — before 7 o’clock.\nRequest a quiet table: Not all tables are equal. If you’re seated in what you think is a particularly loud spot, ask to move. You can also request a quiet table in advance.\nAsk for the music to be turned down: If you feel the music is blaring in your ears, there’s a good chance others do too. Ask for it to be turned down.\nComplain: If restaurant managers field enough complaints about the noise, they may understand that they’re doing something wrong. Consider registering a complaint with management before you leave.\nFind your noise nirvana: If you know of a restaurant with decibel levels that please your ears, keep going. If you’re having trouble finding your noise nirvana, try SoundPrint to search restaurant venues by sound level.\nI’d also urge restaurant owners to get a decibel reader to find out how much they might be torturing their patrons. Together, perhaps we can defeat the Great Noise Boom.\nThis article by Julia Belluz (firstname.lastname@example.org) originally appeared on Vox online here: https://www.vox.com/2018/4/18/17168504/restaurants-noise-levels-loud-decibels']	['<urn:uuid:48530dfa-20ce-4831-b2a5-47477e930c30>', '<urn:uuid:35872d5f-3687-4d87-8343-2d8a2bfc694b>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	33	118	4027

There are multiple such postures (list below)\nList of Meditation postures in Yoga\nWe hope this article gave you a good detailed information on Ardha Padmasana - Half Lotus Pose In Yoga, how to do the Ardha Padmasana - Half Lotus Pose In Yoga, its benefits, and precautions.', ""Is yoga right for you? It is if you want to fight stress, get fit and stay healthy.By Mayo Clinic Staff\nYour mobile phone is ringing, your boss wants to talk to you and your partner wants to know what's for dinner. Stress and anxiety are everywhere. If they're getting the best of you, you might want to hit the mat and give yoga a try.\nYoga is a mind-body practice that combines physical poses, controlled breathing, and meditation or relaxation. Yoga may help reduce stress, lower blood pressure and lower your heart rate. And almost anyone can do it.\nYoga — a mind-body practice — is considered one of many types of complementary and integrative health approaches. Yoga brings together physical and mental disciplines that may help you achieve peacefulness of body and mind. This can help you relax and manage stress and anxiety.\nYoga has many styles, forms and intensities. Hatha yoga, in particular, may be a good choice for stress management. Hatha is one of the most common styles of yoga, and beginners may like its slower pace and easier movements. But most people can benefit from any style of yoga — it's all about your personal preferences.\nThe core components of hatha yoga and most general yoga classes are:\n- Poses. Yoga poses, also called postures, are a series of movements designed to increase strength and flexibility. Poses range from lying on the floor while completely relaxed to difficult postures that may have you stretching your physical limits.\n- Breathing. Controlling your breathing is an important part of yoga. Yoga teaches that controlling your breathing can help you control your body and quiet your mind.\n- Meditation or relaxation. In yoga, you may incorporate meditation or relaxation. Meditation may help you learn to be more mindful and aware of the present moment without judgment.\nThe potential health benefits of yoga include:\n- Stress reduction. A number of studies have shown that yoga may help reduce stress and anxiety. It can also enhance your mood and overall sense of well-being.\n- Improved fitness. Practicing yoga may lead to improved balance, flexibility, range of motion and strength.\n- Management of chronic conditions. Yoga can help reduce risk factors for chronic diseases, such as heart disease and high blood pressure. Yoga might also help alleviate chronic conditions, such as depression, pain, anxiety and insomnia.\nYoga is generally considered safe for most healthy people when practiced under the guidance of a trained instructor. But there are some situations in which yoga might pose a risk.\nSee your health care provider before you begin yoga if you have any of the following conditions or situations:\n- A herniated disk\n- A risk of blood clots\n- Eye conditions, including glaucoma\n- Pregnancy — although yoga is generally safe for pregnant women, certain poses should be avoided\n- Severe balance problems\n- Severe osteoporosis\n- Uncontrolled blood pressure\nYou may be able to practice yoga in these situations if you take certain precautions, such as avoiding certain poses or stretches. If you develop symptoms, such as pain, or have concerns, see your doctor to make sure you're getting benefit and not harm from yoga.\nAlthough you can learn yoga from books and videos, beginners usually find it helpful to learn with an instructor. Classes also offer camaraderie and friendship, which are also important to overall well-being.\nWhen you find a class that sounds interesting, talk with the instructor so that you know what to expect. Questions to ask include:\n- What are the instructor's qualifications? Where did he or she train and how long has he or she been teaching?\n- Does the instructor have experience working with students with your needs or health concerns? If you have a sore knee or an aching shoulder, can the instructor help you find poses that won't aggravate your condition?\n- How demanding is the class? Is it suitable for beginners? Will it be easy enough to follow along if it's your first time?\n- What can you expect from the class? Is it aimed at your needs, such as stress management or relaxation, or is it geared toward people who want to reap other benefits?\nEvery person has a different body with different abilities. You may need to modify yoga postures based on your individual abilities. Your instructor may be able to suggest modified poses. Choosing an instructor who is experienced and who understands your needs is important to safely and effectively practice yoga.\nRegardless of which type of yoga you practice, you don't have to do every pose. If a pose is uncomfortable or you can't hold it as long as the instructor requests, don't do it. Good instructors will understand and encourage you to explore — but not exceed — your personal limits.\nNov. 05, 2015\n- Yoga for health.

46	dysphasia treatment recovery therapy methods	There is no medical or surgical cure for dysphasia. Treatment relies on speech therapies to help patients regain language function and rebuild communication skills. Treatment methods include output-focused therapy, psycholinguistic therapy, cognitive neurorehabilitation, and combinations thereof. These approaches identify specific communication deficits and target them using various modalities like computer-aided therapy, picture cards, reading and writing exercises, and speech practice. Recovery time can vary from days to years, and some patients never fully recover their pre-trauma communication abilities.	"['dysphasia(redirected from Speech problems)\nAlso found in: Dictionary, Thesaurus, Encyclopedia.\nRelated to Speech problems: aphasia, Speech disorders\nDysphasia is a partial or complete impairment of the ability to communicate resulting from brain injury.\nApproximately one million Americans currently suffer from one of the various forms of dysphasia, and an additional 80,000 new cases occur annually. The term ""dysphasia"" is more frequently used by European health professionals, whereas in North American the term, aphasia is more commonly preferred. These two terms, however, can be and are used interchangeably. They both refer to the full or partial loss of verbal communication skills due to damage or degeneration of the brain\'s language centers. Developmental Dysphasia is considered to be a learning disability, but will not be the focus of this article.\nVerbal communication is derived from several regions located in the language-dominant hemisphere of the brain. These include the adjacent inferior parietal lobe, the inferolateral lobe, and the posterosuperior temporal lobe, as well as the subcortical connection between these areas. Disease, direct trauma, lesion, or infarction involving one or more of these regions can disrupt or prevent proper language function. Dysphasia does not necessarily prevent proper cognitive function, so the patient can think and feel with perfect clarity. This can be extremely frustrating for the patient, as they cannot express these thoughts and feelings to others.\nDysphasia can occur in a variety of forms, depending on how the communicative disruption manifests. Classically, dysphasia can affect one or more of the basic language functions: comprehension (understanding spoken language), naming (identifying items with words), repetition (repeating words or phrases), and speech. Although there are several subtypes of dysphasias, they most commonly manifest in one of three syndromes: expressive dysphasia, receptive dysphasia, or global dysphasia.\nExpressive dysphasia, also known as motor dysphasia, produces a conscious and recognizable disruption of a patient\'s speech production and language output. This includes the impairment of speech initiation, proper grammatical sequencing, and proper word forming and articulation. Although patients can perfectly understand what is said to them, they have great difficulty communicating their thoughts.\nBROCA\'S DYSPHASIA. Broca\'s dysphasia is the most common type of expressive dysphasia. It is caused by damage to the lower area of the premotor cortex, located just in front of the primary motor cortex. This region is most commonly referred to as the Broca\'s area. Speech for patients suffering from Broca\'s dysphasia may be completely impossible. Others may be able to form single words or full sentences, but only through great effort. ""Telegraphing,"" the omission of articles and conjunctions, may also be exhibited.\nTRANSCORTICAL DYSPHASIA. Also known as isolation syndrome, transcortical dysphasia is caused by damage to the language-dominant brain that separates all or parts of the central region from the rest of the brain. There are three sub-classes of transcortical dysphasia, which define the impairments to a patient\'s ability to repeat words, sentences, and phrases: transcortical motor dysphasia, transcortical sensory dysphasia, and mixed transcortical dysphasia. Additional impairments may occur depending on the extent and location of the damage.\nReceptive dysphasia, also known as sensory dysphasia, impairs the patient\'s comprehension and meaning of language. Unlike expressive dysphasia, the patient can speak fluently and articulately, but will utilize meaningless words, nonsensical grammar, and unnecessary phrases to the point of becoming incomprehensible. However, they will be completely unaware of their mistakes. Additionally, the patient will find it difficult to comprehend spoken language and/or word-object relation.\nWERNICKE\'S DYSPHASIA. Also known as semantic dysphasia, Wernicke\'s dysphasia is the most common of the receptive dysphasia. It is caused by damage to the Wernicke\'s area, located in the posterior superior temporal lobe of the language-dominant hemisphere. Although the patient can speak clearly and at length, many of their words, phases, and sentences will be nonsensical in nature. Additionally, they will experience difficulty in understanding spoken language, if not suffer a complete lack of comprehension. Semantic distinctions between words may become mixed up and jumbled, furthering confusion.\nANOMIC DYSPHASIA. Anomic dysphasia, also referred to as amnesic dysphasia, is caused by damage to the temporal parietal area and/or the angular gyrus region. Although very similar to Wernicke\'s dysphasia, anomic dysphasia is distinguished by its disruption of a patient\'s word-retrieval skills. They will be unable to correctly name people or objects, causing them to pause or substitute generalized words (like ""thing""). Otherwise, the patient will exhibit few, if any, language impairments.\nCONDUCTION DYSPHASIA. Also known as associative dysphasia, conduction dysphasia is a relatively uncommon disease (representing only 10% of the cases). Damage to the upper temporal lobe, lower parietal, or connection between the Wernicke\'s and Broca\'s areas can result in the inability to repeat words, phrases, or sentences. The patient may also suffer the inability to describe people or objects in the proper terms.\nGlobal dysphasia, the third most common form of dysphasia, results from damage to both the anterior and posterior regions of the language-dominant hemisphere. In global dysphasia, all of the patient\'s language skills are disrupted; however, some may be disrupted more severely than others.\nCauses & symptoms\nCurrently, over one million people in the United States suffer a permanent type of dysphasia. Although dysphasia may manifest in several ways, the common cause for its onset is damage or trauma to the brain. Stroke, in particular, is the most common cause for dysphasia. Of the half million stroke victims reported annually in the United States, approximately 100,000 will suffer some form of dysphasia. Infection, direct trauma, transient ischemic attack (TIA), brain tumors, and degeneration can also instigate the onset of dysphasia.\nSymptoms of dysphasia will quickly manifest after damage to the brain has occurred, and will present in accordance to the particular type of dysphasia suffered. Due to the proximity to areas of the brain that control motor function, expressive dysphasias can be accompanied by noticeable motor impairment. The majority of symptoms will be language related, including:\n- Difficulty remembering words\n- Difficulty naming objects and/or people\n- Difficulty speaking in complete and/or meaningful sentences\n- Difficulty speaking in any fashion\n- Difficulty reading or writing\n- Difficulty expressing thoughts and feelings\n- Difficulty understanding spoken language\n- Using incorrect or jumbled words\n- Using words in the wrong order\nDysphasia is frequently diagnosed while the patient is being treated for injury to the brain, be it from trauma or disease. The health professional, typically a neurologist, will conduct standard cognitive tests, including tests to determine whether the patient\'s language centers have been affected. If the patient exhibits signs of difficulty communicating, they will often be referred to a speech-language pathologist. In turn, the pathologist will conduct a comprehensive examination of the patient\'s ability language and comprehension skills. This examination may begin with evaluating the patient\'s ability to repeat words and phrases, recognize and describe objects, and comprehend what is said to them. More extensive and standardized language-based tests may be required, including the Porch Index of Speech Ability and the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination. Based on the result of the examinations, the health professional will be able to determine the type of dysphasia inflicting the patient. More extensive damage may require the use of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging for an effective diagnosis.\nInitially it is necessary to treat and stabilize the injury underlying the development of the patient\'s dysphasia. In some cases, such as with damage caused by TIA, a full recovery can be expedient and take only a few days. Unfortunately, most dysphasias can take months, if not years, to recover from. Even after prolonged therapy, many patients never achieve a full recovery. Efficacy of treatment greatly depends on the promptness with which it begins. For this reason, many medical facilities have speech-language pathologists on staff to begin the initial treatment process as quickly as possible.\nThere is no medical or surgical cure for dysphasia. Treatment, instead, relies strongly upon the use of various speech therapies. Much like physical therapy strengthens muscles and bones back to normalcy, speech therapy allow the patient to regain language function, as well as rebuild their communications skills. Treatment is typically conducted with a trained speech therapist. However, group sessions are common and allow the patient to practice their language skills in a non-threatening environment with others sharing their disability. Although much of therapeutic work is conducted by a speech therapist, friends and family also play a vital role in the patient\'s recovery. They can help the patient continually practice and exercise language skills while outside the therapeutic setting. Many times, family members are included on therapy sessions to teach them how to communicate with and understand the patient.\nThere are several treatments available, which utilize the patient\'s remaining language abilities to rebuild and compensate for those that were lost. These include out-put focused therapy (stimulationresponse), psycholinguistic therapy (cognitive), cognitive neurorehabilitation, and combinations thereof. Although these treatments approach aphasia differently, they all share a common thread by identifying the specific communication deficits and then targeting them with various modalities (computer-aided therapy, picture cards, reading and writing exercises, speech practice, etc.). These techniques stimulate the various parts of the brain associated with language, memory, and understanding, and thus allow it to heal.\nFortunately, about half of patients will suffer from transient dysphasia, in which the symptoms fade completely after only a few days. However, a patient\'s prognosis will greatly depend on several factors, such as the location and extent of the underlying damage. Additional factors of importance are the patient\'s age, general health, and mental health and motivation. Handedness may also be an indicator for recovery, as left-handed individuals have language centers located in both hemispheres of the brain (not just the left). As such, left-handed patients have access to language skills from either side of the brain, which can expedite their recovery. Even with therapy, dysphasia may take several years to overcome. Indeed, some patients will never regain their pre-trauma skill level of communication and speech.\nDysphasia can be prevented by avoiding the causes of brain injury and stroke, such as high blood pressure. In particular, eating a healthy diet and not smoking to maintain proper blood pressure will help prevent damaging strokes. Although it is impossible to predict head trauma, the use of head protection while participating in dangerous sports or activities can reduce the risk of serious brain damage.\nTransient ischemic attack — Also known as a ministroke, a transient ischemic attack is caused by a temporary interruption of blood flow in an area of the brain. Unlike in a true stroke, normal brain function will return with 24 hours.\nBrookshire, R. Introduction to Neurogenic Communication Disorders (6th edition) St. Louis, MO: Mosby, 2003.\nDarley, F.

47	How do the philosophical teachings of Epicurus and the Stoics differ in their view of how humans should relate to the natural world and universal laws?	According to the documents, Epicurus taught that the universe is infinite and eternal, with events based on the motions and interactions of atoms in empty space. He emphasized direct observation and logical deduction in understanding nature. In contrast, Stoicism taught a pantheistic monism that saw God as identical with universal reason and natural law. The Stoics believed people should accept their place in the natural scheme of life by following this universal rational order. While Epicurus focused on understanding nature through empirical observation, Stoics emphasized aligning oneself with what they saw as the divine rational principle in nature.

He taught that pleasure and pain are the measures of what is good and evil; death is the end of both body and soul and should therefore not be feared; the gods neither reward nor punish humans; the universe is infinite and eternal; and events in the world are ultimately based on the motions and interactions of atoms.

As a boy, he studied philosophy for four years under the Platonist teacher Pamphilus. At the age of 18, he went to Athens for his two-year term of military service. The playwright Menander served in the same age-class of the ephebes as Epicurus.\n""No one is too young or too old to know what happiness is.""This is how the way to happiness begins according to Epicurus, the famous founder of one of the most important schools of thought of the Hellenistic and Roman age.

Epicurus is a key figure in the development of science and scientific methodology because of his insistence that nothing should be believed, except that which was tested through direct observation and logical deduction. He was a key figure in the Axial Age, the period from 800 BC to 200 BC, during which, according to Karl Jaspers, similar thinking appeared in China, India, Iran, the Near East, and Ancient Greece. His statement of the Ethic of Reciprocity as the foundation of ethics is the earliest in Ancient Greece, and he differs from the formulation of utilitarianism by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill by emphasizing the minimization of harm to oneself and others as the way to maximize happiness.\nAuthor: Jeffrey Fish\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press\nRelease Date: 2011-05-26\nBrings together the work of leading classicists and philosophers in order to show the vitality and development of Epicureanism after Epicurus, and especially the dynamic interplay between tradition and innovation.\nThe idea that happiness is a choice accessible to all is far from new; the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus developed the Natural Philosophy of life over two thousand years ago, providing practical, contemporary guidelines to finding meaning and happiness. Unlike Plato, who valued the divine logic above all, Epicurus argued that the pursuit of ideals produced by logic alone leads to inner conflict, cognitive dissonance, dissatisfaction, and even depression. He suggested that by first embracing our natural desires, then using logic to determine which choices will increase pleasure over time, and using our will to take action, we could learn and change, and achieve happiness.

48	What roles do communications and coordination play in both FARP operations and reconnaissance missions, considering the various specialized personnel involved?	Communications and coordination are crucial in both operations. In FARP operations, air traffic controllers maintain constant communication with pilots about wind conditions, airspace safety, and landing clearance. They relay information between pilots and the FARP officer in charge, who then coordinates with ground personnel for fueling and ordnance operations. In reconnaissance missions, RECON Marines must master specialized communications skills for team operations. They work as part of reconnaissance teams or assault teams, requiring coordinated efforts in various operations including scout swimming, small boat operations, and initial terminal guidance operations. Communication is essential for both immediate tactical operations and broader mission planning, with noncommissioned officers serving as team leaders coordinating various aspects of reconnaissance and assault operations.	"['US Marines with Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron 1 conducted forward arming and refueling point operations (FARP) as part of Assault Support Training 1 at the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range, California, in support of the semiannual Weapons and Tactics Instructor Course 2-17, April 17.\nLasting seven weeks, WTI is a training evolution hosted by MAWTS-1 which provides standardized advanced and tactical training and certification of unit instructor qualifications to support Marine aviation training and readiness.\nMarine WTI students were tested on their ability to come together to run the FARP at the Bull Attack FARP location supporting AST-1.\n“A FARP is an area to get us more fuel and ammo that is closer to the objective area,” said Cpl. Justin Gilstrap, UH-1Y Huey crew chief from Marines Light Attack Squadron (HMLA) 167 and a WTI student with MAWTS-1. “This makes it to where we don’t have to fly all the way back to base or airfield to get more fuel and ammo, allowing us to get back on station a lot quicker.”\nIn order for the aircraft to land to refuel or reload, or to take off, an air traffic controller communicates with the pilot to make sure his air space is safe. The air traffic controller Marine keeps the pilot updated on wind speed and direction, and of other aircraft that may be in the same air space.\n“There are four hot points, which means the aircraft will still be running when they get their fuel, and there are also cold spots where they fire down to refuel,” said Sgt. Nicolas Ramirez, air traffic controller with Marine Air Control Squadron (MACS) 2, Attachment A. “I help with coordination of which spot, hot or cold, the pilots want to land in. They tell me which spot and I coordinate with the FARP officer in charge and they relay that information to the Marines. It’s a communication relay from the pilot to me, giving me the knowledge to grant the aircraft landing clearance.”\nWhen the aircraft has landing clearance, the pilot then communicates if the aircraft needs to be refueled or reloaded. Bulk fuel Marines, Marines specializing in fueling Marine Corps assets including ground vehicles, generators, and aircraft, come in and refuel the aircraft. In hot spots, the refuelers are able to fuel the aircraft while it is still turning, making it a quicker process while ordnance Marines are preparing to load the aircraft.\n“What we, ordnance, do is when the aircraft come in, we de-arm them and the pilots let us know if they need to be refueled or reloaded,” said Sgt. Zachary Beeler, aviation ordnance technician with MAWTS-1. “If the pilots need a hot fuel, we have to de-arm the aircraft, essentially putting it on safe. When the fuelers are done, we arm the aircraft back up and load them with ordnance. Without ordnance you pretty much just have a surveillance aircraft. We put the attack, in light attack.”\nThe FARP operations training provided during WTI gives the Marines rare training with all the air and ground assets that everyday training doesn’t provide them.\n“The first month here was a lot of academics and a lot of information,” said Capt. David Cybulski, UH-1Y Huey pilot from HMLA-269, with MAWTS-1 as a WTI student pilot. “You get to see how the whole entire Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) integrates and how it all comes together. This right here gives you a prime example of what the Marine Corps says it can do.”', ""USMC Recon Job Description\nThis job plays a key role in Marine Special Ops\nThe reconnaissance man is responsible for providing the amphibious, long range, small unit, ground reconnaissance, and raid skills.

Typically a recruit can request a direct pipeline to the RECON course but he or she must first graduate from the following schools:\nMarine Corps Boot Camp is a complete boot camp with a 1st class PFT score and you can move onto the School of Infantry (SOI).\nMarine Corps School of Infantry, Infantry Training Battalion is a 59-day course. A UZ contract holder must attend the infantry school. And infantry school graduates who volunteer and meet the standards can attend the Basic RECON Primer Course.\nBasics of the Marine Corps RECON Courses\nPrimer is five weeks long and is the hardest physical and mental challenge of becoming a RECON Marine. Consider the Primer as your selection challenge to becoming a RECON Marine.\nThe Basic RECON Course is nine weeks long and has three phases that challenge Marines to their fullest, both physically and tactically. Phase 1 focuses on Marine individual physical skills such as running, high repetition PT, obstacle courses, ocean swims with fins, rucking, land navigation, helicopter rope suspension training, communications, and supporting arms. But after the Primer, you will be ready for this phase.\nPhase 2 focuses on the tactical mission. Small unit tactics, mission planning, and several day-full mission profile exercises are included. Phase 3 focuses on the maritime mission and you learn to conduct amphibious RECON, boat operations, and small boat navigation.\nResponsibilities of the RECON Marine\nIn addition to basic infantry skills, the RECON Marine is responsible for highly refined scouting and patrolling skills. He must possess advanced proficiency in scout swimming, small boat operations, close combat skills, airborne, surface and sub-surface insertion and extraction techniques, assault climbing, demolitions, forward observer procedures for supporting arms, initial terminal guidance operations for heliborne assaults, airborne insertion operations, and various waterborne operations.\nThe RECON qualified Marine specializes in communications, photography, threat weapons and equipment recognition, and various types of point, area, and related necessary overlap of ground amphibious reconnaissance operations.\nMarines assigned to assault teams possess advanced skills in assault weaponry, breaching demolitions, close quarter battle skills, and raid techniques. Selected reconnaissance men are further trained as static line and free-fall parachutists and combatant divers.\nNoncommissioned officers are assigned as reconnaissance and assault team leaders or their assistants and may be qualified as static line and free-fall jumpmasters, dive supervisors, helicopter insertion/extraction masters (HRST), and tandem offset resupply delivery system (TORDS) operators.\nRequirements of RECON Marines\nYou'll need a score of 105 or higher on the general technical segment of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) tests.

49	What are basic features and troubleshooting applications of oscilloscopes?	Oscilloscopes show frequency and amplitude of oscillating signals and display voltage/time relationships of signals. For troubleshooting, they help diagnose malfunctioning components by revealing subtle timing issues like switch contact bounce that multimeters can't detect, allowing visual examination of signal transitions and relationships between source and output signals.	"['The digital multimeter is the mainstay of electrical troubleshooting and the tool that most of us reach for first. In Beyond the Multimeter, we look at five examples of how reaching for an oscilloscope next can make troubleshooting faster, easier, and more effective.\nFigure 1. Optical proximity switch on a conveyor system.\nPart 4 describes troubleshooting the erratic operation of a conveyor system, using a digital multimeter and an oscilloscope. As process speeds increase, timing and signal transitions become more critical for reliable operations, and keeping switches operating reliably becomes a high priority.\nProximity switches (see Figure 1) are common in factories and process plants where they are used to control the position and flow of goods through the manufacturing process.\nThere are three types of proximity switches:\nMechanical switch contacts deteriorate over time. They are subject to mechanical wear, and arcing can cause pitting of the contact surfaces. Usually, these problems arise slowly and gradually worsen before the switch fails completely. Troubleshooting a mechanical switch that has failed completely - a “hard fault” - can often be done with just a visual inspection or with simple measurements made with a digital multimeter. It’s the gradual or intermittent switch failures that usually cause headaches.\nFigure 2. Multimeter displaying control pulse voltages in the “on” and “off” states.\nTroubleshooting with a digital multimeter\nIn this example, a failing mechanical proximity switch is causing erratic operation in a conveyor system.\nWhen a multimeter is connected to the output of the conveyor belt controller (which receives its input from the proximity switch), the “Voltage Peak Max” and “Voltage Peak Min” readings show that the switch is turning on and off as expected (see Figure 2).\nA digital multimeter with frequency measurement can also reveal the rate at which the switch is changing state (see Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Multimeter displaying control pulse frequency.\nNone of this information, however, is helping to diagnose the problem.\nAt this point, we could swap out the controller and hope for the best, or we can dig a little deeper.\nTroubleshooting with an oscilloscope\nA modern digital oscilloscope can give you a lot of the same numerical information as a digital multimeter, including the pulse voltage and frequency information shown above. But with an oscilloscope, you can examine signal information visually as well. That enables you to see switch on/off state timing and time relationships between a source and output signal (the switch and the controller output in the example shown in the following example).\nFigure 4. Oscilloscope displaying output pulses from the controller.\nFigure 5. Oscilloscope displaying the controller output pulse (top trace) and the signal from the proximity switch (bottom trace).\nFigure 6. “Zooming in” on the waveform by increasing the oscilloscope’s sweep speed. Switch “contact bounce” in the lower trace is making the output unstable (top trace).\nWhen the oscilloscope is connected to the output of the controller, it reveals nothing out of the ordinary about the controller output pulses. The pulse waveforms are well-formed and free from electrical “noise.” (Figure 4)\nWhat about timing? Next we connect the oscilloscope so it captures the signals from the proximity switch on first channel and the output pulse from the controller on the second channel (Figure 5). When we examine the result, it’s immediately clear that something is wrong. The bottom trace (the output from the proximity switch) is not stable in relation to the top trace (the controller output).\nAn oscilloscope displays varying voltages as a line (called a “trace”) that sweeps from left to right across the screen. If this line is drawn faster (that is, if we increase the oscilloscope’s sweep speed), we can see a more detailed view of how the voltage is changing moment by moment (or millisecond by millisecond).\n“Zooming in” on the signals in this way (Figure 6) reveals that the output from the proximity switch (lower trace) isn’t changing from off to on in a single transition (red circle). Instead, faulty switch contacts are bouncing on and off for about five milliseconds before the output stabilizes. The controller is unable read this jagged voltage correctly, so its output varies broadly (over the time range shown by the red bars in the top trace). That’s what’s causing the erratic behavior.\nThe bottom line\nA digital multimeter can show precise amplitude and time measurements, and can show when a switch fails to open or close, but when it comes to subtle or intermittent events, an oscilloscope can give you the additional information you need to diagnose the problem. A picture really is worth a thousand words!\nNext: Beyond the Multimeter, Part 5: Troubleshooting a DC Power Supply with a Multimeter and an Oscilloscope.', 'Introduction To Oscilloscope (""osc."")\nThe osc. is a graph displaying device that display the electrical signal based on the input to its probes. It shows in real time how signals change over time. Usually the Y axis represents the voltage and the X axis time.\nMost osc. have intensity or brightness that can be adjusted. The display is caused by the spot that periodically sweeps the display from left to right. In the design of electronics project, the osc. is one of the most handy equipment that is worth investing. Its functions are :\na) Shows and calculate the frequency and amplitude of an oscillating signal.\nb) Shows the voltage and time of a particular signal. This function is the main used of all the functions described here.\nc) Helps to troubleshoot any malfunction components of a project by looking at the expected output after a particular component.\nd) Shows the content of the AC voltage or DC voltage in a signal.\nWhen there is a change in the height of the waveform, it means that the voltage has changed. If the line is horizontal it means that there is no change in voltage for that period of time. Some of the common waveform that are measured using an osc. are as shown below.\nThere are basically 2 types of osc. namely analog or digital type. Analog uses continuously variable voltages. Digital uses discrete binary numbers that represent voltage samples.\nAnalog osc. works by directly applying a voltage being measured to an electron beam moving across the osc. screen. The voltage deflects the beam up and down proportionally, tracing the waveform on the screen.\nDigital osc. samples the waveform and uses an analog to digital converter to convert the voltage measured into digital format. It then uses this digital format to display the waveform. It enables one to capture and view events that may happen only once.\nThey can process the digital waveform data or send the data to a computer for processing. Also, they can store the digital waveform data for later viewing and printing.\nIn choosing to buy an osc., the designer needs to understand the terms used and what they are. By understanding the terms, one will be able to compare the features offered and its price.\nThe bandwidth tells the frequency range the osc. can accurately measures. When the frequency of the measured signal increases, the ability of the osc. to accurately respond decreases.\nb) Gain Accuracy\nThe gain accuracy shows how accurately the vertical system attenuates or amplifies a signal. This is shown in percentage error.\nc) Time Base or Horizontal Accuracy\nThe time base or horizontal accuracy indicates how accurately the horizontal system displays the timing of a signal. This is shown in percentage error.\nd) Rise Time\nRise time is another way of describing the useful frequency range of an oscilloscope. Rise time need to be considered in the measuring of pulses and steps. It cannot accurately display pulses with rise times faster than the specified rise time of the osc.\ne) Vertical Sensitivity\nThe vertical sensitivity indicates how much the vertical amplifier can amplify a weak signal. Vertical sensitivity is usually given in millivolts (mV) per division. The smallest voltage a general purpose osc. can detect is typically about 2 mV per vertical screen division.\nf) Sweep Speed\nThis specification indicates how fast the trace can sweep across the screen. It is usually shown in nanosec per div.\ng) Sample Rate\nIn digital type, the sampling rate shows how many samples per second the ADC can acquire. Maximum sample rates are usually given in megasamples per second (MS/s). The faster the oscilloscope can sample, the more accurately it can represent the fine details of a signal.\nThe minimum sample rate may also be important if you need to look at slowly changing signals over long periods of time. Typically, the sample rate changes with changes made to the sec/div control to maintain a constant number of waveform points in the waveform record.\nh) Record Length\nThe record length of a digital osc. show the number of waveform points the oscilloscope is able to acquire per record. The maximum record length depends on its memory. There is a trade off in acquiring either a detailed picture of a signal for a short period of time or a less detailed picture for a longer period of time.\nTips on using an oscilloscope\na) Probe the input to the test point on the oscilloscope to assure that a channel and probe are working. Normally every set comes with this test point with fixed voltage and frequency.\nb) Set the options of a channel to ""DC"" coupling, with automatic triggering. Increase the channel\'s volts per division until a line appears. Set the sweep time per division near the speed of the signal, and then adjust the volts per division until the event appears at a useful size.\nc) The bandwidth of the test probes should equal or exceed the bandwidth of the oscilloscope\'s input amplifiers.\nd) The capacitance of the wire in the test probe can cause an oscilloscope to inaccurately display high speed signals. Use the test output that produces a square wave to adjust the probe by ensuring that the corners of the square wave appear square, exhibiting no overshoot or undershoot.\ne) The ground connection of the oscilloscope should be attached to the ground of the circuit under test. Most test leads for oscilloscopes have the ground clip built into their end. To accurately probe high speed signals, the ground lead must be kept as short as possible; at frequencies above 100 MHz, the flying ground lead should be removed and replaced with a small ground pin which slips over the ground ring at the tip of the probe.\nf) Most oscilloscope has connection to mains earth of which the test lead ground is also attached to mains earth. If the circuit under test is also referenced to mains earth, then attaching the probe ground to any signal will effectively act like a short circuit to earth causing the earth circuit breaker to trip. This is solved by using an isolating transformer or special probe that has this isolation.\ng) AC coupling blocks any DC in the signal.\nh) DC coupling must be used when measuring a DC voltage.\ni) Trigger the correct channel and set the trigger delay to zero. After that adjust the trigger level until the desired event triggers.\noin electronics design contest and win prizes.

50	How do emergency and pregnancy triage processes compare?	In the emergency center at Rhode Island Hospital, triage involves nurses assessing vital signs and medical history to prioritize patients based on condition severity - for example, chest pain cases are seen before swollen ankles. For pregnancy care at Mayo Clinic, the Early Pregnancy Care (EPC) Clinic provides initial triage and assessment in early pregnancy (8-12 weeks), with providers evaluating symptoms and consulting maternal-fetal medicine specialists for high-risk cases to determine appropriate care pathways.	"['Your Visit to the Andrew F. Anderson Emergency Center\nRhode Island Hospital is the only Level I Trauma Center for southeastern New England, providing expert staff and equipment in emergency situations 24 hours a day. Last year, nearly 150,000 patients were treated in our emergency center. A dozen regional hospitals routinely refer cases to the center, which usually sees about twenty critical cases each day.\nWhen you first arrive, you will be met by some of our most experienced nurses. You will be asked several brief questions and have your vital signs taken. This will allow us to quickly assess the degree of your medical condition and ensure that urgent treatment, tests and medications are given. This process, called “triage,” ensures that patients with the most serious medical problems are treated first.\nBecause the center staff needs to be aware of your medical background, they will ask you many questions. Questions will often be asked by more than one center staff member.\nYou are the most important member of your health care team! Please be sure to let our staff know about:\n- Health problems you currently have or have had in the past\n- Prescribed and/or over-the-counter drugs you are taking\n- Any allergies you have\n- Recent trips you have taken outside of the United States\n- If you are pregnant or breastfeeding\nWaiting To Be Seen\nOnce the triage process is complete you may experience a wait, during which our team is determining the most appropriate treatment for your condition. Waiting times vary, as we first treat patients who have the most serious injuries and conditions (for example, chest pain cases are seen before patients suffering from a swollen ankle; heart attacks have priority over earaches; complicated fractures are treated before small cuts). Patients who arrive by ambulance enter the emergency center through a different entrance, so while the waiting area may be relatively quiet, we can still be very busy treating many people.\nWe thank you for your patience during this time. Our team is available in the waiting area to assist you and answer any questions. We will update you on your wait as often as possible.\nYour Turn For Treatment\nOnce you are brought to a treatment room you will be seen by more members of our care team. The team will further evaluate your medical needs and make recommendations for your course of treatment.\nOther diagnostic tests, medications, IV fluids and procedures may be ordered, or a specialist may be called to participate in your care.\nRhode Island and Hasbro Children’s Hospital are teaching hospitals affiliated with the Alpert Medical School of Brown University. As part of our teaching mission, a resident physician or medical student may participate in your care.\nWhat to expect after treatment\nIf the emergency physician recommends admission to the hospital, he or she will discuss this with you and may call your primary care physician to make the necessary arrangements. If you do not have a physician, or your physician is not a member of the Rhode Island Hospital medical staff, we will arrange for a Rhode Island Hospital physician to care for you.\nIf you are to be discharged from the Anderson Emergency Center, a physician or nurse will review your written instructions with you, including any medications prescribed, and answer any questions you may have. You will be given a referral to your own physician, or possibly to a specialist for follow-up care. Please stop at our Discharge Center to complete your emergency care.\nNeed an Interpreter?\nIf you are non-English speaking, deaf or hard-of-hearing, and require an interpreter to communicate, please let a member of the emergency center staff know.\nTell us about your experience\nAt Rhode Island Hospital, we work hard to provide the highest quality emergency medical care. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to better your experience in the Andrew F. Anderson Emergency Center. We also encourage you to recognize any of our staff members who may have gone above and beyond to make your visit as comfortable as possible. Please contact us to tell us about your experience.', ""At Mayo Clinic Rochester, our team provides a variety of specialty services designed to meet the individual needs of patients.

Follow our site to receive email notifications when new articles are posted.\nComplex Care Obstetric Team\nMayo Clinic in Rochester provides care for a myriad of patients including high risk pregnancies. Housed within the obstetrics division is a specialty clinic called the complex care team. This group of highly skilled providers manage the prenatal and postpartum care for patients with chronic and pregnancy related conditions that can potentially put their pregnancy at risk for complications. The complex care team collaborates with our maternal-fetal medicine colleagues to provide a multidisciplinary care model ensuring the highest quality of care for our patients.\nThe complex care team manages conditions and complications such as preterm labor, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, preeclampsia, twins, placenta previa and sickle cell anemia. Additionally, the complex care team spearheads the care for any obstetric patient that contracts covid-19 during their pregnant as an OB covid-19 care team. In collaboration with the Mayo Clinic Connected Care team, complex care providers evaluate patients via telemedicine during the acute illness phase of the viral infection. Patient remote monitoring is handled by the complex care team registered nurses overseen by our complex care providers. If symptoms worsen, our team is able to connect with our patients to request that they be seen in the hospital setting for their safety. Through telemedicine, the OB covid-19 care team is also able to establish a prenatal care plan for the patient and their care provider to follow throughout the rest of their pregnancy based on their new risk factor of covid-19 infection during pregnancy.\nEarly Pregnancy Care Clinic\nFor a patient with a new pregnancy, it can often feel exciting and scary to think about what's to come. Some patients may have experienced a miscarriage in the past or may have some vaginal bleeding in the first few weeks of this pregnancy. To best support our patients, we have an Early Pregnancy Care (EPC) Clinic in Rochester to help families through the initial weeks after conception. Our dedicated team of providers and nurses will walk with you through any testing or follow up that is necessary to ensure that you are safe and your pregnancy is on track. If miscarriage happens, our EPC team is knowledgeable and experienced in supporting you through this difficult experience.\nPatients are seen for their first obstetrical visit with our practice usually around 8-12 weeks of pregnancy. If you are experiencing any concerning symptoms prior to your first scheduled visit, our EPC team will help manage your care. These providers can see you for an early visit if needed based on your clinical situation. If your pregnancy is high risk, our EPC team will consult with our maternal-fetal medicine providers to get you to the right care provider when you need it.\nMany patients hope to breastfeed their newborns after birth but may be unsure about how to get started. Mayo Clinic Rochester has an incredible team of international board certified lactation consultants (IBCLCs) to help you reach your goals! IBCLC support is available while you are in the hospital after you give birth along with the expertise of our birth and postpartum registered nurses. For patients who may need additional help once they are at home, our lactation consultants are available for outpatient visits in the OB clinic. Patients and their babies can be seen for breastfeeding support through an in person or telemedicine visit to keep breastfeeding on track.\nOutpatient lactation consultations are also available in the clinic during the prenatal period. Basic information about breastfeeding and answers to specific concerns can be addressed with a prenatal lactation visit prior to giving birth. For patients that have had difficulty in the past, a prenatal lactation consult can help to review your breastfeeding history and create a plan for better success for this pregnancy. Breastfeeding classes are also available for patients and their families through the Mayo Clinic Perinatal Education Program.\nCardiovascular Obstetrics Clinic\nPatients with cardiac conditions are at higher risk of complications in pregnancy. These patients can be cared for within our Cardiovascular Obstetrics Clinic which is housed within the Maternal-Fetal Medicine division. The pregnancy heart team includes experts in pregnancy care (obstetricians specializing in high-risk maternal and fetal medicine), heart disease (cardiologists), high blood pressure (nephrologists), perioperative care (anesthesiologists), cardiac surgery and other specialties as needed. In addition, your care team includes nurse practitioners and nurses with experience in caring for pregnant women with heart disease.\nThe Cardiovascular Obstetrics Clinic manages patients with conditions such as aortic valve disease, congenital heart disease, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and Marfan syndrome. Patients are able to utilize Mayo Clinic heart programs such as heart rhythm halter monitoring, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, fetal echocardiogram, and other services to ensure their safety during pregnancy and beyond.\nMindfulness Based Childbirth and Parenting Support\nIn addition to the standard childbirth classes available through the Perinatal Education Center, Mayo Clinic offers a specialized training program focused on stress reduction during pregnancy and birth. This course entitled the Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) Program runs online and is available for any pregnant patient anywhere in the world. Led by Susan Skinner CNM, one of the midwives in the Rochester practice, this program teaches daily mindfulness activities that can help develop your mind body connection. The MBCP program is based on research on mindful birthing practices and stress reduction approaches that have been proven in the literature. Our course strives to increase your confidence and courage for the experience of labor, birth and life with baby along with enhancing partner communication skills and accessing your capacity for deep physical and mental relaxation.\nAfter the baby is born, alumni from the MBCP program can continue their journey in the new Mindful Parenting course. This curriculum helps new parents navigate the ups and downs of the first several months of having a newborn aiming to bring wisdom, openheartedness, joy and balance to families in a supportive environment with other parents. The course works to decrease new parent isolation, provide a source of caring and mindful connection, and reduce inter-generational suffering by encouraging new family dynamics as needed. This course is also held online and can be attended by new parents in any location.\nPerinatal Education Classes\nMayo Clinic offers classes to patients in the Midwest, throughout the United States and globally in an effort to educate individuals and their families. Over 30 courses are available specifically related to pregnancy through the Perinatal Education Center.\nClasses are available on many different topics such as childbirth, breastfeeding, car seat safety, cesarean birth, comfort strategies for labor, grandparenting class, infant massage, multiple gestation, sibling preparation, infant CPR and vaginal birth after cesarean preparation. Due to the covid-19 pandemic, classes are being offered in-person, through virtual-interactive live classroom on Zoom, and by online eClass. Safety measures are in place for in-person classes that include reduced class sizes, room arrangement that supports safe distancing, health screening of participants, and a requirement for everyone to wear a mask throughout the duration of class.\nThe Perinatal Education Center also runs a postpartum support group for new parents called Postpartum Connection. The session is held via Zoom every Wednesday from 10am-11:30am or 12:30pm-2pm. The group is free and you can register online. Any postpartum parent can attend with the focus on birth through six months postpartum.

51	What are the essential responsibilities of animal caretakers following a surgical intervention to promote optimal healing?	The post-surgery care is crucial for fast recovery. Pet owners must ensure medications are given on time and strictly follow the doctor's diet plan. Wounds must be dressed properly to prevent infections. If there are sutures, proper care must be taken. The pet might need assistance during defecation and urination for a few days, so owners should be present to help during these activities.	['Pets like dogs, cats, rabbits and ferrets require at least one surgery during their lifetime and it helps if the pet owner is aware about the procedure and what needs to be done before the surgical process. This will also reduce your anxiety levels as most pet owners dote on their pets and shower love and care on their pets, as much as they shower on their own kids. Here are five important things that you must know before the surgical process.\n1. Following guidelines\nBefore the surgical procedure, it is important for the pet owner to follow the instructions given by the surgeon. This could be things like preventing intake of food the night before the operation, keeping him clean and washed etc. Intake of food is restricted in most cases because while giving sedation, there could be chances of the pet vomiting and the food particles getting aspirated into the lungs which can be fatal.\nRead more on the next page\n2. Signing permission form\nYour doctor might require you to sign a form for gaining permission and for conducting important tests like Complete Blood Count (CBC), thyroid test, chemistry profile, ECG, etc. The tests could vary based on the kind of surgery undertaken and the age and species of your pet. It is important to read through the document and clear your doubts about the tests and procedures much beforehand rather than leaving it for the last minute.\n3. The surgical procedure\nUnderstanding the surgical procedure is an important aspect that will help you during after care. Ask the doctor about the surgical process and risks and complications involved as well so that you can well prepared for any emergencies. You must also be ready with the necessary precautions if any that will help in averting complications like infection in the site of surgery, breaking of stitches, pain, etc.\nOpen the next page to continue reading…\n4. The day of the surgery\nThe day of the surgery could be a stressful period for most pet owners, especially if the surgery is a complicated one. Tests could be scheduled before the surgery as well based on the requirement. Your pet will then be given a sedative for relaxation and intravenous aesthetic and gas anesthetic will be administered based on his size. The airway will be protected by an endotracheal tube. Continuous monitoring of the heart rate, heart beats, oxygen levels in the blood etc. will be monitored. Once the surgical process is complete, your pet will be taken off anesthesia and the monitoring will be continued until he becomes normal. Intravenous fluids and pain medications will be administered as well.\nThe care that you give after the surgery decides how fast your pet recovers. Make sure that the medications are given on time and the diet plan given by the doctor followed strictly. Ensure that the wounds are dressed well and care is taken to prevent infections. Take proper care if sutures are there and be with him at the time of defecation and urination as your pet might require help for a few days.']	['<urn:uuid:ea8ef49d-77a9-4b53-a96d-241e076fbb65>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	16	64	517
52	help me understand old mexican villages why did people leave rural areas for cities	People began abandoning Mexican rural villages for cities primarily due to economic factors following the Mexican Revolution. After the Constitutionalists engineered peace, they maintained upper class control over most of the country's wealth while only distributing enough land to villages to buy their support. As wealth became increasingly consolidated in cities under the new government, the rural population found it necessary to abandon their villages in search of greater economic opportunities in urban areas. This migration from rural Mexico continued steadily, leading to the depopulation of many villages.	"[""Though Pedro Páramo is notable for marking a break from the social realism that defined much of Mexican literature in the 20th century, it is still grounded in Mexican history and the culture of its time. The novel's dream-like progression and expressionistic atmosphere are best understood in terms of two significant events that changed Mexican society – the Mexican Revolution of 1910 and the Cristero War of 1926-1929.\nBoth the causes and goals of the Mexican Revolution remain a subject of debate, but what is certain is that the country was overcome with a fervor for change. Before the Revolution, Mexico operated under a quasi-feudal structure, in which large landowners controlled most of the property that was farmed by the country's peasants, who mostly inhabited small villages like Comala. One class that was particularly overlooked in this system was the country's bourgeoisie (middle class), and it was this class that initiated protests against the country's dictator, Porifio Diaz, in the early 20th century. Though Diaz had taken power in the 1850s via a military coup, he oversaw a stabilization of the Mexican state and an expansion of its economy. The latter effect both empowered the bourgeoisie (through allowing for a greater educated class and also encouraging new economic opportunities) and enraged them since most of the wealth and land stayed in the hands of the oligarchy - the select few that Diaz favored.\nAs the election of 1910 approached, a northern landowner, Franciso Madero, idealistically appealed to the bourgeoisie to support his candidacy in hopes that he could ensure a more even distribution of opportunity and a lessening of the military state. Diaz's victory in the election, engineered through unabashedly corrupt means, would historically have led the liberal faction to disintegrate, but Madero surprised the government by calling upon the Mexican people to lead an armed revolt on November 20, 1910.\nIt was then that the Revolution truly began. Now that the common mass - mostly illiterate farmers tired of being overworked without receiving their share of the new wealth - was mobilized, Diaz's government found its control less assured than it had believed. The revolutionaries were less inspired by any liberal or progressive philosophy than they were by a nostalgic hope of reclaiming the local control of their own land and villages, a control that was lost under Diaz. Their passion and knowledge of their own countryside led to a guerrilla war that caused Diaz's resignation and Madero's inauguration by May 1911.\nHowever, the energy of the masses was not easily quelled, and when Madero's liberal reforms were quashed by the landowning class, Madero was overthrown and assassinated in 1913. Bloody revolution reigned for over a decade, as rulers were overthrown and local rulers – Emiliano Zapata and Pancho Villa foremost among them - ran Mexico in pieces. Ultimately, the peasants lost their zeal for a battle that produced no national results, and began to return to their villages. The peace was finally engineered by a party known as the Constiutionalists, shrewd politicians who distributed enough land to villages to buy their support while still maintaining upper class control on most of the country's wealth. The peasants who had empowered the revolutions were easily subdued, and as wealth became consolidated in cities under the new government, this common population found it progressively necessary to abandon their villages in favor of greater opportunity in those cities. Thus began a steady migration from rural Mexico, a migration that helps to explain the historical factors that are implicit in Rulfo's depiction of Comala as a near ghost town.\nThe common fervor had apparently died down by the mid-1920s, but the Cristero Rebellion sprang up in 1926, another event alluded to in Pedro Páramo. The rebellion, which was centered in western Mexico, was encouraged by the clergy but fought by the peasants, who called themselves Cristeros for the religious signification of the word. The traditional account is that the wealthy landowning classes, whose prominence was challenged by the liberal constitutional reforms, used the clergy to inspire an attempted overthrow. Other arguments suggest that the rebellion was less about the economy than the government – as the latter grew more central and socialized, it saw a need to battle the Church, which held most authority in rural areas, for control. By this argument, the Church merely directed a common discontent into a series of armed skirmishes that were finally quelled by a 1929 agreement between the government and the Church, negotiated without any input from the peasants who fought. Though a much shorter-lived conflict, this rebellion deepened the resentments on both sides of the social divide, while also making rural society more irrelevant and thereby encouraging more migration to the cities.\nThis brief history of 20th century strife in Mexico is key in understanding the elegiac tone of Pedro Páramo. Not only does it provide some real-world context for the depraved state of Comala, but it also elucidates the context of the novel's main themes: nostalgia, longing, death, and loneliness. Rulfo's work is entirely modern and universal, but it is also very much a work inspired by and dedicated to his people and country.""]"	['<urn:uuid:a263ed82-43e5-4070-a560-da0b72d4ef5d>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	14	88	860
53	What are the key differences between traditional credit cards for everyday expenses and specialized insurance options for protecting against both medical emergencies and financial crises?	While regular credit cards can be used for everyday purchases like clothes and meals, an 'emergency' credit card serves as a financial safety net specifically for unforeseen costs. For emergencies, the ideal card should have a substantial credit line (at least $5,000), universal acceptance (preferably Mastercard or Visa), and be a revolving credit account rather than a charge card to allow incremental payments. Meanwhile, medical travel insurance offers a different type of protection, specifically covering healthcare expenses during travel. Unlike regular trip insurance that covers lost luggage or canceled flights, medical travel insurance focuses on emergency medical care, dental costs, and medical evacuation if needed. It's particularly important since most domestic insurance policies don't extend to international travel, and it's typically more cost-effective than traditional trip insurance, often costing just a few dollars per day.	"['Dear Opening Credits,\nContinue Reading Below\nWhat is the best emergency credit card to have? I had a card, but it\'s closed. I don\'t use credit at all right now. I was told that I needed to have one for emergencies.\nA credit card that you can tap into during or after a true financial crisis is a wonderful thing, but not a requirement. Plenty of people march through life without any kind of plastic and do just fine. Nothing bad ever happens or if it does, they have (or find) the funds to deal with it. Then again, countless others are grateful they have had a credit line to draw from because it can act like an insurance policy against formidable and unforeseen costs.\nThe fact is, some problems require a great deal of money to solve. For example, let\'s say you or your child gets into an accident and needs critical medical care. Even with health insurance, you could still be responsible for a portion of the bills, which can be deep into the thousands. Without that much cash in the bank ready to go, what would you do? You could ask a friend for a loan or sell some valuables, but those two options may either not exist or be wildly unattractive. Tragically, it\'s not uncommon for even prepared people to wind up in bankruptcy court in such circumstances.\nContinue Reading Below\nEnter the ""emergency"" credit card. These products are not any different than other cards. It\'s a title that you, the cardholder, bestow upon it. Rather than charge everyday items such as clothes, meals and electronics, you hang onto the card and charge only when absolutely necessary.\nAs for the best card, there is no one perfect one that you\'d use for emergencies. It just has to have the following few qualities:\n- A substantial credit line. You\'ll want enough borrowing power to meet the crisis. A credit limit of at least $5,000 should do it, but the exact amount will depend on what the credit card issuer will lend you. What do you think you may need as ""just in case"" money?\n- Universal acceptance. General purpose cards that use MasterCard and Visa payment systems are generally accepted everywhere; Discover and American Express less so.\n- Make sure it is a credit rather than a charge card. Charge cards are great for large purchases that you can pay off in about 30 days. They don\'t work for balances that you can\'t pay off right away, though, so be sure it\'s a revolving credit account that allows you to pay incrementally.\nTo find the card that has all of the above, you can use CreditCards.com\'s CardMatch. You\'ll need to know what kind of credit score you have first, so if you don\'t know, find out. Pull your credit reports and access your credit scores via AnnualCreditReport.com (for free once a year from each of the big three credit bureaus) and MyFICO.com (about $20), respectively. Then, apply for the best card that you\'re most likely to qualify for.\nI would recommend you look for a low-interest, no-annual-fee card. Also, if you aren\'t approved for a card the first time you try, wait six months before trying for another card. You might have luck going to your local bank or credit union to see what kind of credit cards are offered there.\nWhen you have the credit card, be sure to use it every once in a while and pay off the balance in full every month before the due date. If you don\'t, the issuer may close the account for lack of use.\nOtherwise, keep it for economic emergencies -- those times when something really bad could happen if you don\'t pay for a service or item. I hope that will never happen, but if it does, you\'ll be covered. Of course, to avoid having to put anything on plastic, it is ideal to have an emergency fund of about six to 12 months\' worth of living expenses, but sometimes even that won\'t cover the cost of a disaster.\nWhen you do put the price of the crisis on your card, be cognizant that in about a month you\'ll also have to come up with at least the minimum payment to keep the account in good standing. However, deleting the balance within a year (at the most) is ideal. Let the debt linger and the card that saved you can be the one that leads you into another disaster.', 'Travel medical insurance is an essential coverage that protects policyholders from unexpected medical costs while traveling. Unlike trip insurance, which focuses on issues such as lost luggage or canceled flights, medical travel insurance is designed to address healthcare expenses during travel.\nBy giving travelers a safety net in case things go wrong while they’re away from home, travel medical insurance provides peace of mind. For example, medical travel insurance allows senior travelers to relax and enjoy their trip, whether it’s relocating to a new home, going to a family reunion or taking a long trip.\nUnderstanding Medical Travel Insurance\nMedical travel insurance is a specialized policy that offers financial protection for medical emergencies during travel, particularly for those traveling internationally. Many travelers opt for medical travel insurance, giving them peace of mind that they are covered in case the unexpected happens.\nBecause most domestic insurance policies do not extend coverage to international travel, having dedicated travel medical insurance becomes a necessity. It’s only valid while traveling, but can cover the cost of medical care required while out of the country.\nWhile it typically only covers costs associated with emergencies, it also may cover the costs of non-emergency medical transport, such as being transferred from one caregiver to another or hiring NEMT services to travel with you on your flight home.\nCoverage Offered by Non-Emergency Travel Insurance\nMedical travel insurance provides comprehensive coverage for various medical situations during a trip. Some of the essential coverage includes the following.\nEmergency medical care. Medical travel insurance covers the cost of emergency medical treatment in case of accidents or unforeseen illnesses that may require immediate medical attention.\nEmergency dental costs. If a traveler experiences a dental emergency while abroad, medical travel insurance will cover the necessary dental treatments.\nMedical evacuation. In the event of a medical emergency in a remote area where adequate medical facilities are unavailable, travel medical insurance can arrange for emergency medical evacuation to the nearest suitable medical facility.\nMedical travel insurance is indeed a cost-effective alternative to traditional trip insurance. It’s important to distinguish between the two types of insurance to avoid any confusion. Unlike trip insurance, which is priced based on the total cost of the trip, medical travel insurance premiums are determined by factors such as age, trip duration, and coverage amount. As a result, daily premiums for medical travel insurance are significantly lower, often as little as a few dollars a day.\nIn contrast, trip insurance can be much costlier, mainly because it covers different aspects of travel, such as trip interruptions or cancellations. However, for travelers who prioritize comprehensive coverage for potential medical expenses while on a trip, medical travel insurance emerges as an appealing option that provides financial protection without breaking the bank.\nHow to Choose the Right Medical Travel Insurance\nWhen selecting a medical travel insurance policy, it is essential to consider several crucial factors beyond cost.\nFirst, the policy should cover medical expenses equivalent to or exceeding domestic health insurance coverage. This ensures you won’t have to bear out-of-pocket medical costs.\nIt’s also important to verify that the policy includes adequate coverage for medical transportation expenses. Travelers should also look for a reputable insurance provider offering round-the-clock customer service. This way, you can seek assistance and file claims regardless of your travel destination’s time zone.\nMedical travel insurance is a fundamental safety net for individuals embarking on international journeys. It offers invaluable financial protection against unexpected medical expenses and ensures that travelers can access quality healthcare during their trip. While similar to trip insurance in some respects, travel medical insurance has distinct coverage and serves a specific purpose. When purchasing medical travel insurance, it is crucial to read the policy’s fine print and select a plan that aligns with your travel needs and provides comprehensive medical coverage. By investing in non-emergency medical travel insurance, you can travel with confidence, knowing that your health and well-being are safeguarded, wherever your travel takes you.']"	['<urn:uuid:b2186bf4-ec16-479d-af68-0c721fbd8c6d>', '<urn:uuid:e61ae991-3615-41ec-90bc-6086ef1091fe>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	25	135	1411
54	What techniques and tools are recommended for safely removing wire from a bonsai tree to prevent damage to the bark?	A specialized bonsai wire cutter is the recommended tool for removing wire from bonsai trees. Due to its special construction, it prevents damage to the bark during cutting, which is a significant advantage over regular hardware store side cutters. In cases where wire has become ingrown, the best approach is to cut it into small pieces and try to pull it out laterally through the wire channel.	"[""Bonsai unwire: How is it done ? ✅ When does it need to be removed? ? ✅\nAlmost more important than the correct wiring of the bonsai is the unwireing. Many mistakes can be made. These mistakes can quickly and significantly degrade the quality of a bonsai.\nWhen should the bonsai wire be removed ?\n- Once a branch holds the position without wire. This can be the case in some, quickly woody deciduous trees (Spindle tree, Azaleas, Privet bonsai) after a short time. Young shoots of the Spindle tree are often stable 6-8 weeks after wiring and need no more wire.\n- When the bruise / contusion become too deep and then stay visible for a long time. Especially in trees with very smooth bark (Japanese maple bonsai) the case.\n- If parts of the branch could die off due to the pressure of the wire.\n- Often branches are wired at the end of the growing season. In many cases, consider removing the bonsai wire before budding. Without leaves, this is much easier. And during the stormy spring growth, the wire quickly grows in.\nBonsai wire cutter\nBonsai unwire - How is it done ?\nOf course, after a bonsai has been wired it will continue to grow. That is also desired. Only then will new wood be formed, the wired branch will thicken and later on the new position can be held without the help of bonsai wire.\nThe thicker the branch becomes, the more the wire pushes in. It leaves clearly visible traces.\nThe bonsai wire pressure on a pine branch is clearly visible\nAs long as the wire pushes into the bark only slightly, that's no problem. In most bonsai tree species (for example, larch bonsai, white pine bonsai), the pressure points quickly disappear after the wire was removed. Only in case of bonsai with a very smooth bark you must be careful when the wire pushes in to much. On smooth bark, traces of wire are visible for a very long time.\nIf a wire pushes harder (picture above) then the time is ripe to remove it. For this a bonsai wire cutter is used.\nRemoval of bonsai wire on a Linden tree: wire cutter in use\nDue to the special construction of these wire cutters, the bark is not damaged during cutting - a great advantage over e.g. a side cutter from the hardware store.\nPressure points after removal of the wire\nIn case of a pine tree these contusions are no longer visible in a year.\nFor many bonsai with very soft wood (such as most conifers), new wire often needs to be applied after unwireing. Otherwise the branch would soon take the old position again.\nNew wired branch\nThe wire was applied against the previous direction. So the old pressure marks can disappear and the branch is held in the desired position without danger.\nIt is important to control a wired bonsai often to prevent ingrowth of the bonsai wire. By ingrowth the Bonsai enthusiast understands that the wire is pushed in so far that it can not be removed without injury. This should be avoided as much as possible.\nPartly ingrown wire on a Scots pine\nThe resulting deformations and wounds can be seen for a long time.\nIngrown bonsai wire is difficult to remove. It is best to cut it into small pieces and try to pull it out laterally through the wire channel.""]"	['<urn:uuid:d3012d9f-5958-4ed5-b586-289512306990>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	20	67	575
55	What led to Russia's eventual defeat in World War 1?	Russia's collapse in 1917 was due to multiple factors. Despite initially fielding a huge and well-trained army, Russia's poor infrastructure meant factories couldn't keep up with demand, and insufficient roads and railroads hindered army supplies. By 1917, the armies mutinied, the Tsar abdicated, and a provisional government struggled to maintain control. A final Russian offensive failed when soldiers refused to fight, and civil war erupted as Germans continued advancing. The Bolsheviks took control in November, began negotiations with Germany, and fighting stopped in December, leading to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918.	"['I try to make history readable and interesting, warts and all. We must look to the past to understand the present and confront the future.\nNeglected By The West\nIn the English-speaking world, the Eastern Front during World War One is generally ignored in favor of the Western Front fought in France and Belgium. This is unfortunate since the Eastern Front in Eastern and Central Europe was every bit as horrendous as the war in the West. The Western Front cannot be fully understood without appreciating the effect the war in the East had on it.\nWhat Was Different About The Eastern Front?\nThe fighting on the Eastern Front was mainly between the Central Powers (the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires) and the Russian Empire. Later, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers and Romania joined Russia. There were several factors which changed the nature of fighting on the Eastern Front when compared to the Western Front:\nThe Eastern Front covered a far larger area, stretching at times for over 1,000 miles, basically north-to-south and hundreds of miles east-to-west. A solid trench system similar to the Western Front never materialized because neither side had the manpower to cover such a distance in depth. This resulted in more of a war of maneuver, whereby attackers might penetrate 50 or 60 miles before being stopped.\nThe Russian Empire\nRussia\'s infrastructure was poor. Although Russia initially fielded a huge and well-trained army, her factories could not keep up with demand, and, even when they finally geared up around 1916, there weren\'t enough roads and railroads to keep the army supplied most of the time.\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire\nThe Empire of Austria-Hungary was in decline. Many of her soldiers came from provinces and states that yearned for freedom and thus had little loyalty to the empire. This, combined with poor leadership, resulted in low morale.\nThe German Empire\nThe German Army was trained to fight a war of maneuver, and had strong leaders and a good infrastructure for supply. This enabled them to succeed even when outnumbered.\nOn August 17, 1914, Russia launched its full-scale offensive against Germany by entering East Prussia in the northern part of the front. The Russians were decisively beaten at the Battle of Tannenberg and withdrew.\nFurther south, Russia had much more success against Austria-Hungary, driving the Austrians back across the Carpathian Mountains and occupying the Austro-Hungarian province of Galacia.\nAt the beginning of 1915, the Austrians were unable to do much against the Russians in Galacia. So Germany took over command of the entire Eastern Front and shifted troops to bolster their southern neighbors. In two weeks, the German and Austrian troops launched a major offensive in May and drove the Russians back more than 200 miles from the Carpathian Mountains—an unimaginable feat on the Western Front. The Russians had to make a strategic withdrawal, partly due to the deficiencies of supplies and ammunition, before they managed to make a stand, now back in their own territory. The Central Powers had captured Russian Poland, Lithuania and most of Latvia, and parts of Russian Ukraine.\nBy 1916, things improved for the Russians, who were then better supplied. While Germany was occupied in the west by their massive offensive against the French at Verdun and then fighting for her life against the British Somme offensive, Russia attacked the Austro-Hungarians and, once again, drove into Galacia. In addition, to the south of the Eastern Front, Romania entered the war on the side of the Allies, extending the Eastern Front hundreds of miles south. Instead of first setting up adequate defenses, Romania immediately attacked the west, dreaming of regaining the Transylvanian region of Austria-Hungary. Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire counterattacked against Romania, which collapsed, and the Central Powers gained control of her vast coal and wheat fields.\nRead More From Owlcation\nLate 1916 also saw mutinies and revolts in several countries as soldiers became disillusioned with the war, the way it was conducted and the unimaginable loss of life. Russia, especially, edged closer to revolution.\n1917 was the year of the Russian collapse. Her armies mutinied, the Tsar abdicated, and a provisional government tried to hold things together. A final Russian offensive was tried, but the soldiers wouldn\'t stand for it, and open civil war swept Russia as the Germans continued to advance. In November, the Communist Bolsheviks took control and began negotiations with the Germans and fighting stopped in December.\nOn March 3, 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was concluded, officially ending the war on the Eastern Front. As far as concessions to Germany, its terms didn\'t survive the year, but it did affirm the independence of Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Ukraine. Poland was not included, which caused riots and animosity of Poles toward the Central Powers. This freed up substantial German soldiers to transfer to the Western Front to support the massive German Spring Offensive but still tied up a million Germans till the end of the war. The Spring Offensive made spectacular gains in France, but the arrival of American soldiers eventually offset any German advantage in numbers.\n- The Russians lost from 1.8 million to 2.3 million soldiers killed and from 3.8 to 5.0 million wounded. About 500,000 civilians died in the fighting.\n- Romania lost about 250,000 soldiers killed and 120,000 wounded, with 120,000 civilians killed in the fighting.\nCentral Powers Casualties\nCasualty figures for the Central Powers are not broken down by which front they occurred in, so these are total casualties:\n- Austria-Hungary lost 1.1 million soldiers killed and 3.6 million wounded. About 120,000 civilians died in the fighting.\n- Bulgaria lost about 87,000 soldiers killed and 150,000 wounded.\n- Germany lost about 2.1 million soldiers killed and 4.2 million wounded. Only about 1,000 civilians died in the fighting.\n- The Ottoman Empire lost about 770,000 soldiers killed and 400,000 wounded.\n© 2012 David Hunt\nsherman tank on May 12, 2018:\nI love ww1, stupos\nJohnwin A.

I\'m glad you enyoyed it and got something out of it. Sometimes Hub ""lengths"" restrict us from writing near-book-length articles and I think that\'s generally a good thing.

Voted up awesome, interesting and useful.\nDavid Hunt (author) from Cedar Rapids, Iowa on May 27, 2012:\nThanks for reading and commenting, JKenny and Judi Bee. I felt the same way myself, having no ""personal"" involvement with the Eastern Front (my two grandfathers served in France) and being culturally more attuned to the Western Front. I think part of it is all the ""foreign"" names and cultures we have to learn just to be able to follow the narrative. I imagine that\'s why many don\'t follow World War One anyway-- ""Where\'s Ypers? How do you pronounce it? This is too hard to follow"".\nJudi Brown from UK on May 27, 2012:\nGreat overview Harald - I know very little about the war on the Eastern Front. For my part my ignorance is largely due to there being no ""personal"" involvement, my family all being mainly on the Western front.\nVoted up etc.\nJames Kenny from Birmingham, England on May 27, 2012:\nA very interesting article Harald, and a very useful one too. You\'re right, about it being neglected; we often hear about Verdun, the Somme and Ypres. But we hardly know anything about the Eastern Front, so thank you for writing this.

57	As a biophysicist, why are bacteria interesting for gravity studies?	Bacteria are particularly interesting because they exist at a threshold where gravity's influence is uncertain. They are large enough that gravity isn't completely negligible (unlike viruses), but small enough that Brownian motion almost becomes dominant, placing them in a unique 'gray zone' between convective and diffusive dominance.	"['By sheer strength of numbers, bacteria are by far the most successful life form on Earth. As we\'ve learned over the past several decades of human spaceflight, they don\'t do too badly in microgravity either. For evidence, just look back on the astronauts and cosmonauts who were stricken with infections during their flights. At home, we have long-established and usually effective antibiotic treatments against most harmful bacteria. But previous studies have shown that in space, bacteria can survive and thrive in what would be fatal drug concentrations for them back on Earth. How is that possible?\nThat\'s a question of vital concern not just today, with International Space Station crews living together in confined spaces for months at a time, but for the future astronauts who will embark on long-duration missions to Mars and beyond. For those journeys, a quick emergency return to Earth won\'t be possible. Searching for the answer also helps researchers to understand the inner workings of bacteria as they seek to develop improved treatments for patients on the ground and in space.\nThe Antibiotic Effectiveness in Space (AES-1) investigation, scheduled to launch in January aboard the first contracted Orbital resupply flight to the space station, is a systematic attempt to probe the reasons for antibiotic resistance in space. ""Is the mechanism that\'s allowing this to occur some form of adaptation or drug resistance acquisition within the cell, or is it more of an indirect function of the biophysical environment, the changes due to microgravity and mass transport?"" asked AES-1 principal investigator David Klaus, Ph.D., of BioServe Space Technologies at the University of Colorado in Boulder.\nThe AES-1 investigation consists of 32 separate combinations of E. coli bacteria and various concentrations of a common antibiotic drug, either Gentamicin and Colistin. That experimental set is duplicated four times to provide a total of 128 separate data points for analysis. Upon return, researchers will check the samples for bacterial population growth. The samples will also be subjected to gene expression examinations by BioServe\'s study partner, HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville, Ala.\n""The idea with this first round is to determine whether the cells actually grow in what should be an inhibitory level of drug, and if so, are there any correlations with specific changes in the gene expression?"" Klaus explained. Part of the AES-1 package will return to Earth with the SpaceX-3 mission in February 2014, with the remainder coming back on SpaceX-4 in the summer.\nWhile AES-1 won\'t be too labor-intensive in flight, it does require a certain degree of participation by the station crew. ""A few days into the mission, they\'ll go in and activate the 16 different group activation packs, and then periodically per the timeline they\'ll do a termination step on them,"" said Klaus. ""We\'ve flown various forms of our payload, sometimes essentially completely autonomous and sometimes with direct crew interaction.""\nBioServe is familiar with this type of design flexibility, with experience on 43 prior missions since 1991, including sounding rockets, Mir, space shuttle and space station flights. ""You essentially begin to trade off experimental volume for automation. The more automation you have, the less [experiment volume] you can generally accommodate because of the need for the electronics and supporting systems,"" said Klaus.\nAlthough Klaus and the research team plan to fly other bacterial species on future AES investigations, they decided E. coli was the best choice for this first flight. ""We would ultimately like to fly things that are more clinically relevant, but for this first round, because they\'re so well characterized and we in BioServe have flown a lot of previous work using E. coli, it made sense to stick with this primary line we\'ve been using for a number of years,"" Klaus noted. ""We\'re going to hopefully answer the question fairly definitively in this case of whether they really are able to grow in these normally lethal levels of drugs. That\'s first and foremost, to repeat what\'s been seen in the past, but do so in a more systematic way and with a larger dataset.""\nPerhaps the most fascinating question to be addressed by AES-1 will be the role of the microgravity environment in potentially promoting antibiotic resistance, because bacteria are almost beyond gravity\'s grasp. ""They\'re right on the threshold of being theoretically influenced by gravity directly,"" Klaus explained. ""They\'re so small that Brownian motion [the random motion of tiny particles struck by atoms and molecules] is almost, but not quite dominant. If they were much bigger, gravity quickly becomes a dominant factor, and if they were much smaller, gravity becomes effectively lost in the noise. So these have made interesting models to work with. A virus is a little too small, but bacteria are right in a gray zone of neither being convective nor diffusive dominated.""\nAlready a major problem on Earth, increasingly resistant bacterial strains can be an even greater threat for space travelers, because spaceflight can also compromise the astronaut\'s immune system. Couple that with bacteria\'s ability to grow better and resist antibiotics in space, and as Klaus noted, ""that\'s not the right direction you want to have all those variables stacking up on you.""\nThe hope is that a better understanding of how bacteria fight off drugs can lead to better ways to counter that resistance not only in space but back on Earth. The goal, Klaus said, is to ""use the knowledge gained from observing and characterizing these interactions in the absence of gravity primarily for terrestrial benefit and secondarily for long-term astronaut crew health protection.""\nWe will always be outnumbered by harmful species of bacteria, but we can still prevail by maintaining and improving our arsenal of antibiotic weapons. The AES-1 investigation promises to be an important step in that quest, whether we encounter our bacterial foes on Earth, in orbit, or on future distant space voyages.\nExplore further: CU-Boulder to fly antibiotic experiment, education project on ants to space station']"	['<urn:uuid:938719d4-2b16-41b0-99b4-02093bbbcc4e>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	10	47	986
58	structure meteorite organic matter vs interstellar dust particles	While meteorites contain organic matter that has largely survived unaltered since the Solar System's formation despite harsh conditions, interstellar dust particles collected by Stardust show great diversity in their structure, with some unexpectedly being crystalline rather than amorphous, contrary to previous theories that predicted only 2% would be crystalline.	"['By Helen Briggs\nBBC News science reporter\nMeteorites that have fallen to Earth contain some of the most primitive stuff of life, a new study has found.\nMeteorites have experienced ""harsh and tumultuous conditions""\nContrary to popular belief, they are packed with ancient carbon-rich (organic) molecules that were essential for life to get started on Earth.\nUntil now, it was thought such matter, which was formed before our Solar System came into existence, could only be found in interstellar dust.\nThe Carnegie Institution of Washington study is reported in Science magazine.\nIt challenges the notion that the only way we can investigate our molecular origins is to try to collect samples of unaltered cosmic material from space - the driving force behind missions such as Stardust.\nInstead, the Carnegie team argues that primitive organic materials - essentially unaltered components of the original building blocks of the Solar System - can be found in the pieces of interplanetary rock and metal that land on our planet.\nThe US scientists analysed six carbonaceous chondrite meteorites - the oldest type known.\nUsing new techniques, the researchers looked at the relative proportions of different types (isotopes) of nitrogen and hydrogen atoms associated with the meteorites\' organic matter.\nIt was thought meteorites would contain only altered material\nTheir analysis found regions where there was an excess of the heavier forms of these elements - something also found in interstellar dust grains.\nIt suggested, therefore, that the meteorites contained material that had been largely unaltered since the time when the Solar System was formed from the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula.\n""It\'s amazing that pristine organic molecules associated with these isotopes were able to survive the harsh and tumultuous conditions present in the inner Solar System when the meteorites that contain them came together,"" said Carnegie researcher Conel Alexander.\n""It means that the parent bodies - the comets and asteroids - of these seemingly different types of extraterrestrial material are more similar in origin than previously believed.""\nElusive time period\nThe discovery opens up a new window to study a long-gone era.\n""Before, we could only explore minute samples from interplanetary dust particles (IDPs),"" said the lead author of the Science paper, Henner Busemann.\n""Our discovery now allows us to extract large amounts of this material from meteorites, which are large and contain several percent of carbon, instead of from IDPs, which are on the order of a million, million times less massive.""\nThe scientists believe that further investigation of meteorites may yield enough material to perform experiments that would not be possible with the tiny primitive organic grains from interplanetary dust particles or cometary grains returned by the US space agency\'s (Nasa) Stardust mission.\nUK planetary expert Ian Wright, of the Open University in Milton Keynes, believes we now have the potential to be able to study pre-solar organic molecules in the laboratory.\n""That organic molecules in carbonaceous chondrites are, at least in part, pre-solar in origin, is not a new idea,"" he told the BBC News website.\n""What is presented here are data that show that the distribution of isotopic compositions within the organic complex is [highly varied].\n""I guess it is possible that we could be looking at the remnants of precursor organic molecules, formed in the interstellar medium before the Solar System even existed, embedded in a complex that formed at a later time (perhaps within the solar nebula itself).""', 'The interstellar dust particles from the Stardust mission show great variations in their elemental composition and structure\nThe space between the stars is not empty, but filled with interstellar matter – gas and dust particles. But all dust is not the same: An international team from 33 research institutes, including the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, discovered that the structure and chemical composition of interstellar dust particles collected by the Stardust spacecraft shows a wide diversity.\nStardust on the way through the universe: The unfolded „dust catcher“ of the spacecraft is clearly visible in this illustration. NASA/JPL\n2006 was an important year for the exploration of our solar system: NASA’s Stardust spacecraft brought back to Earth cometary dust as well as smallest amounts of material from the enormous space between the stars, the interstellar space.\nThis material is of scientific significance for various reasons: it refracts the light of stars and allows for conclusions about the size of the universe. It also provides the raw material for the formation of stars and planets and serves as a catalyst for the formation of molecules.\nIn the current issue of the science magazine ‘Science’, an international team from 33 research institutes presents, for the first time, the structure and chemical composition of interstellar dust particles, which were collected by the Stardust space craft.\nThe researchers identified seven particles with a total mass of a few picograms. One picogram is the equivalent of one trillionth of a gram. Even if the number of particles and mass seems very low, the extraterrestrial material is scientific unchartered territory for Peter Hoppe from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry.\n‘This is the first time that we were able to examine contemporary interstellar dust on Earth,’ says the researcher from Mainz. Previously, the extraterrestrial material could only be analyzed by means of spectroscopic observations.\n‘We have found that the size, elemental composition and the structure of the particles differ to a great extent. We did not expect that.’ The term contemporary is relative for astrophysicists such as Hoppe, as the average lifetime of dust particles in interstellar space is around 500 million years; compared to our 4.6 billion year-old solar system this is quite a short period.\nContrary to predictions, two dust particles were found to be crystalline and not amorphous, i.e. without an ordered structure of atoms. ‘We had expected a crystalline structure in maximum two percent of the dust,’ says Jan Leitner, a member of Peter Hoppe’s team. According to previous theories, the majority of crystalline particles in interstellar space is destroyed by high-energy cosmic rays and shock waves or converted into amorphous dust.\nFor the collection of dust particles, the spacecraft was equipped with a special particle collector: On the top of the spacecraft, a tennis racket-sized round grid would protrude into space and catch dust particles on its surface.\nAluminum foil was wrapped around the walls of these sample tray frames. A specially developed aerogel was packed in the aluminum grid, which slowed down the particles on impact, keeping their structure intact.\nThe Stardust mission, which ran a total of six years, was divided into two phases for the collection of cometary dust and interstellar dust. First, the spacecraft collected interstellar dust at the front of the collector, for a period of 195 days. NASA turned the collector by 180 degrees for the subsequent flight through the tail of comet Wild 2, so that the cometary particles landed on the reverse side.\nBack on Earth, spotting the dust particles presented a seemingly impossible task for scientists, as the dust collectors needed to be scanned micron by micron for impact. This would be the equivalent of an analysis of more than 1.5 million photos of the aerogel. Researchers then approached the public in an unprecedented mission and uploaded the photographs to a website.\nThousands of volunteers joined ‘Stardust@home’ and analyzed the images, following a detailed instruction, in order to find the sought-after dust. On the overall, the volunteers made three finds - a great success, which the 66 researchers expressed by naming the ‘30,714 Stardust@home dusters’ in the list of authors of the current issue of Science. Altogether, up to now, four dust particles where found on the aluminum foil and three in the aerogel.\nPeter Hoppe’s team concentrated on the foil. The Mainz team had received a 90 square millimeter piece from NASA. “Searching the foil was a true labor of Sisyphus, as we analyzed approximately 50,000 images. As the dust craters are smaller than a thousandth of a millimeter, we scanned the foil, piece by piece, using an electron microscope,” the researcher Jan Leitner remembers.\nThe team found five particles. However, four of the craters only contained abrasion material from the solar cells of the spacecraft. One sample, however, was in fact extraterrestrial and received the unspectacular name I1044N,3. Chemical analysis revealed that this was a ferromagnesian silicate. Other samples contained iron sulfide and elemental iron in addition to aluminum, chromium, manganese, nickel and calcium. As it was not possible to prove the presence of these forms of iron by spectroscopic investigations from Earth, this was another success of two years of working for the researcher community.\nAlthough only a small portion of the surface of the Stardust collector has been scanned, for the time being, the analysis of the interstellar dust is completed for Peter Hoppe and his team. The remaining samples are now available to scientists around the world for identification and analysis of further particles. Perhaps, these studies will provide some new surprises.

59	What damage can toxic metals do to blood flow?	Heavy metals like chromium, iron, lead and mercury interfere with l-arginine's production of nitric oxide, which disrupts proper blood flow. Without sufficient nitric oxide, the endothelium (the lining of blood vessels) can collapse onto itself and restrict blood flow. This can lead to circulatory problems like cold hands and feet, angina, diminished vision capabilities, and high blood pressure.	['You can ensure life-giving blood is circulating properly throughout your entire body!\nWhen it comes to the cardiovascular system, most people think in terms of the heart, veins and arteries that carry blood throughout the body. And that’s typical. For decades now, modern medicine has focused on the largest components in the cardiovascular system which includes the heart and the large coronary arteries that feed the heart.\nBut have you ever stopped to ask, “If the cardiovascular system feeds the heart, what exactly feeds the cardiovascular system?” The quick answer is, the cardiovascular system itself. You see, it’s the cardiovascular system that carries oxygen from the lungs and nutrients from the stomach throughout the entire body so they can be used by vital organs, like the heart, but also by the cardiovascular system itself.\nAnd that all makes sense. But what many people don’t know is that it accomplishes this by utilizing an incredibly small circulation network called the microcirculatory system.\nYour microcirculatory system\nIf you’ve never heard of your microcirculatory system, you are not alone. As already mentioned, it’s the heart and large coronary arteries, or the “macrocirculatory” system that gets all the attention. When something goes wrong there, a heart attack or stroke is the likely result.\nFor example, we’ve all heard of blockages in the coronary artery, and we all know those are bad. If a doctor tells you that, in the very next sentence he is probably going to send you to a heart surgeon to schedule by-pass surgery.\nBut what caused the blockage and why is it in that particular place? Was it cholesterol? Arterial calcification? If that was the case, shouldn’t the blockage extend the length of the entire artery? Why do these blockages tend to form in just one place in an artery? For years, the explanation given by heart specialists is that these blockages are skip lesions, meaning they skip around and form randomly.1\nMaybe … but the newest breakthrough theory in cardiovascular health appears to make a lot more sense. This theory, which is becoming more and more accepted by alternative health experts, is that arterial blockages form where the minute microcirculation blood vessels that feed the main arteries with oxygen and nutrients, shut down. When these extremely small blood vessels, called vasa vasorum, (from Latin—vessels of the vessels) become clogged and can no longer feed an artery, atherosclerotic lesions or atherosclerotic plaques can form.2\nIt’s these atherosclerotic plaques that eventually choke off healthy arteries, preventing blood flow to and from the heart and to and from vital organs. And they might very well have never formed if the vasa vasorum, the tiny blood vessels that feed the arteries and remove waste, had continued to function properly.\nSo you see, all this focus on keeping the large veins and arteries healthy misses the point. It’s the microcirculatory system, the one that contains upwards of 60,000 miles of capillaries, arterioles, venules, and vasa vasorum that needs to be nourished and protected.\nThreats to your microcirculatory system\nBefore we explain how to nourish and protect your microcirculatory system, let’s first look at what threats these small blood vessels face and how they can be damaged.\nWe know that these small blood vessels, just like the large ones, are really just hollow tubes protected by an endothelial lining called an endothelium. The endothelium is made up of a smooth, thin layer of cells that regulates expansion and contraction of vesicles to allow oxygen and vital nutrients to flow in and out of the bloodstream.\nEndothelial dysfunction is one of the biggest threats to the microcirculatory system.3 Under normal circumstances, the body utilizes the amino acid l-arginine to produce nitric oxide that helps to relax the endothelium and allow sufficient amounts of blood to flow. If the nitric oxide production is interrupted, the endothelium can collapse onto itselfand restrict blood flow.\nStudies show that a build up in the blood of harmful heavy metals like chromium, iron, lead and mercury interfere with l-arginine’s production of nitric oxide, resulting in poor microcirculation.4 It is for this reason that people with high levels of toxins often suffer from circulatory related symptoms like cold hands and feet, angina, diminished vision capabilities, and high blood pressure.5\nOxidative damage caused by free radicals is another threat to the endothelium.6 Free radicals are reactive molecules that are unstable because they are missing an electron. In an effort to replace their lost electron, they frantically bump into and damage the molecules that make up the cells in your body. In the process, they cause oxidation of body tissues.\nWhen a free radical comes in contact with the inner lining of a small capillary, microscopic injuries result. This process is called lipid peroxidation and is recognized as one of the underlying causes of atherosclerosis. Eventually the build-up of fat, cholesterol, toxic metals and other substances at the site of injury narrows the capillary restricting blood flow. The key is to neutralize free radicals before they damage your arteries … and that’s done with antioxidants. Heavy metals are catalysts for free radical oxidation, which is another good reason to remove them before they can set off the chain of events that can harm the endothelium.\nOther threats to small capillaries and vasa vasorum include elevated blood viscosity, improper blood coagulation, and blood vessel calcification. If the blood is too thick, it won’t flow fast enough to deliver oxygen to—and remove carbon dioxide from—vital organs. When there is a problem with blood coagulation, a thrombus or blood clot can develop. In a small blood vessel, a thrombus can completely cut off blood flow, which can result in the death of surrounding tissue supplied by the vessel. And finally, when the body does not properly process calcium and send it to bones where it is needed, it can accumulate in blood vessels resulting in arteriosclerosis, also called calcification or hardening of the arteries.\nNutritional solutions for your microcirculatory system\nEliminating or reducing your risk to these microcirculation threats is the first step toward protecting your overall cardiovascular system, and ultimately your health. Following are a number of nutritional solutions that work both independently and together to keep your microcirculatory system healthy:\nEDTA-based oral chelation\nChelation comes from the Greek word “claw,” meaning “to grab,” which is exactly what EDTA does. When a molecule of EDTA travels through the bloodstream and gets near a toxic metal such as lead or mercury, it grabs the destructive particle and binds tightly with it, pulling it out of the membrane or body tissue it was embedded in.\nEDTA supports normal endothelial function by removing heavy metals that impair nitric oxide function.7 It also prevents the production of free radicals that cause cellular damage in the endothelium and other organs throughout the body.\nHere’s how it works: When metals, minerals and other toxins are in the body, they act as the catalyst for oxidation reactions, including lipid peroxidation. This triggers the production of free radicals. But when EDTA is in the blood, it removes the metals and minerals before they get a chance to catalyze, or start the oxidation reactions.\nThe result? The production of free radicals is dramatically reduced and their destructive influence is prevented. Plus, by removing the lead stores that have built up in the endothelial lining, the production of nitric oxide is restored which allows the blood vessel to expand and contract normally.\nAnd while oral EDTA works hard in the bloodstream to remove heavy metals and prevent oxidation, it also does double duty by chelating toxins in the digestive tract before they are absorbed, preventing them from ever entering your bloodstream.\nEDTA chelation therapy is not new. It’s been around for a long time. In fact, EDTA is the standard FDA approved treatment for lead, mercury, aluminum and cadmium poisoning. The American Heart Association also recognizes chelation therapy as a treatment for heavy metal poisoning. But today, we are finally starting to understand that EDTA oral chelation, by removing toxic heavy metals from the microcirculatory system, is working to keep health problems from forming in the larger macrocirculatory system.8\nOne important note about EDTA oral chelation … while EDTA will chelate toxic heavy metals preferentially, it can also chelate essential minerals as well. Therefore it is important to supplement with minerals while taking an EDTA oral chelation product. Reputable health supplement companies offer companion products that contain vitamins, minerals and other nutrients that enhance EDTA’s effectiveness and prevent mineral deficiency.\nLess reputable companies sometimes combine EDTA with vitamins and minerals in the same capsule. Be wary of these because as soon as you digest the capsule, the EDTA will chelate the minerals included in the capsule, thus defeating the purpose of removing heavy metals from the body.\nVitamin K1 and vitamin K2 provide healthy coagulation and prevent calcification\nVitamin K comes in several different forms. Vitamin K1 is the form used in the liver to activate clotting factors, while vitamin K2 is the form used in the rest of the body to activate other vitamin K-dependent Gla-proteins, which prevent calcification of blood vessels and organs, including the heart and kidneys.9\nBlood must flow freely through our cardiovascular system, unless injury causes a breach in a blood vessel, in which case, blood must clot rapidly to prevent excessive, potentially fatal blood loss. If clots form too readily, however, blood vessels can become blocked, cutting off the delivery of oxygen and nutrients, which rapidly results in tissue and organ death.\nVitamin K-dependent Gla-proteins are responsible for maintaining the delicate balance needed between coagulation and anticoagulation throughout the circulatory system.\nVitamin K also plays an important role in preventing arteriosclerosis or hardening of the blood vessels due to calcium deposits. The elasticity that characterizes healthy blood vessels, be they arteries or the smallest vasa vasorum, is what enables it to accommodate increases in blood flow. Add enough calcium and that pliability is lost; the artery can’t expand and contract, so blood pressure rises.10\nOne of the vitamin K-dependent proteins, matrix Gla-protein (MGP) is the strongest inhibitor of tissue calcification presently known. MGP is produced by small muscle cells in our blood vesselswhere—once activated by vitamin K—it prevents calcium deposits.11\nNattokinase—the natural blood thinner\nNatural nutritional support for normal, healthy blood flow throughout the body, including the microcirculation system, can be found in the enzyme Nattokinase. Nattokinase is a potent fibrinolytic (anti-clotting) enzyme extracted and highly purified from a traditional Japanese food called Natto. Research has shown that Nattokinase supports normal blood pressure and can prevent and dissolve thrombus or blood clots.\nNattokinase is considered extremely useful for those wanting a safe, nondrug, aspirin alternative for healthy blood flow. In fact, Nattokinase is especially useful for keeping the body’s microcirculatory system free of harmful blood clots. Researchers have found that Nattokinase is four times more potent than plasmin, works more effectively than warfarin drugs, and doesn’t produce any side effects.12\nMaybe you have heard of deep vein thrombosis which is a blood clot inside veins found deep in extremities or body cavities. A venous thrombus is a clump of blood cells, platelets, and fibrin (clot) which attaches to the inside walls of veins. If the clot stays localized, it can cause swelling and vein irritation. If part of it breaks off, it can cause blockage downstream, or become an embolus and result in a pulmonary embolus. In some instances, deep vein thrombosis may also contribute to other serious medical problems such as heart attack and stroke.\nNattokinase can prevent deep vein thrombosis and keep your microcirculatory system clear and clean by not allowing the venous thrombus to develop.13\nNattokinase is safe for most people when used according to the recommended dosage. However, some people should avoid Nattokinase. This includes people with bleeding disorders, such as hemophilia, or the group of diseases called hemorrhagic diathesis. Also, people with ulcers, hemorrhoids, or recent major trauma, or those who’ve had neurosurgery or a recent stroke should not take Nattokinase. If you take heparin, Coumadin ® or aspirin, use only under the close supervision of a medical doctor.\nTo sum it up … Nattokinase enhances our body’s natural ability to fight blood clots, even in the smallest microcirculatory blood vessel, and has an advantage over blood thinners because it has a prolonged effect without side effects. The perfect combination for microcirculatory health. So let’s recap … it’s the microcirculatory system that feeds and nourishes the macrocirculatory system, keeping it healthy and keeping your entire body disease free.\nThere are nutritional supplements that can keep your microcirculatory system functioning properly. These supplements include EDTA oral chelation to remove harmful heavy metals and toxins; vitamins and minerals to combat nutritional deficiency and replenish essential minerals; vitamins K1 and K2 to ensure healthy coagulation and combat calcification; and Nattokinase to prevent dangerous blood clots.\nAnd remember, the oral chelation supplement should be taken separately from the companion supplement containing the vitamins, minerals and other microcirculation enhancers. That way, you are maximizing the health benefits of the supplements, and maximizing your circulation system too.\n- Klein RG, Campbell RJ, Hunder GG, Carney JA. Skip lesions in temporal arteritis.

60	need convert 5000 ml to liters and know which blood specimen types available laboratory testing	5000 ml equals 5 L (since 1000 ml = 1 L). For laboratory testing, there are three main types of blood specimens available: serum, plasma, and whole blood. These specimens are collected through different methods including venipuncture and capillary puncture.	"['Have you ever thought while filling a water bottle how much water it can accommodate and when the shape of bottle is changed the quantity of water also changes. Come along we’ll find the answers to these and some other interesting questions.\n- Capacity of any solid or any object can be defined as the maximum amount of liquid or any other pourable substance that can be stored inside the solid without any leakage from the solid.\n- It simply means that just like a glass can contain only a limited quantity of water similarly every other object has a maximum limit to which they can store water.\n- The amount of liquid or any other pourable substance stored in the object or solid is known as quantity of that liquid.\n- Capacity and Quantity have the same standard unit Liter (L) or Milliliter (ml).\nLet’s have an example of water tanks stored at our house to understand these two terms clearly.\nUnits and Its Conversions\nThe capacity and quantity both of the same units as they are the measurements of a pourable substance like amount of liquid inside a solid object.\nSo they are measure either in Liters (L) or Milliliters (ml)\n- The standard unit is L.\n- For measuring small quantities we use the unit milliliter and for measuring large quantities we use the unit Liter.\n- For example for measuring the amount of milk in a glass we will use the unit ml but for measuring the amount of water in a bucket we will use the unit L.\n1 Liter = 1000 ml\n1 ml = 1/1000 L\nExample 1: Convert 12 L to ml.\nSolution: As we know that\n1 L = 1000 ml\nTherefore 12 L = (12 x 1000) ml\n= 12000 ml.\nExample 2: A bucket has a capacity of 20 L. It is half filled with water. Find the quantity of water in the bucket and express it in ml.\nSolution: As we know that 1 L = 1000 ml.\nTherefore 20 L = (20 x 1000) = 20,000 ml.\nHence the capacity of bucket is 20,000 ml.\nSince the bucket is half filled which means\nQuantity of water present will be = 20,000 ÷ 2 = 10,000 ml.\nExample 3: A water bottle has a capacity of 20,000 ml. It is filled to 1/4th of its capacity. Find the quantity of water present in the bottle.\nSolution: The capacity of water bottle is 20,000ml\nAnd 1 ml = 1/1000 L\nTherefore, 20,000 ml = 20,000 x 1/1000 = 20L.\nHence the capacity of water bottle is 20L.\nSince the water bottle is filled with 1/4th of the capacity of water bottle which means\n(1/4 x 20) L = 5L\nHence the quantity of water in the bottle is 5L.\n- If any object is fully filled then in this case capacity is equal to its quantity.\n- Capacity is always about an object or solid whereas quantity is always measured for the pourable substance present inside the object like liquid or gas present inside the object.\nFor Example we always say that the capacity of a water bucket is 20 L or 30 L and the quantity of water in it is 12 L or 18 L.\n- So capacity is related to object or containers whereas quantity is related to the pourable substances like gases or liquids.\n- Quantity will be always less than or equal to the value of Capacity.\nExample 5: If a bucket has 24 L of water in it and another bucket has 12 L of water. Find the total quantity of water present inside the buckets.\nSolution: The total quantity of water will be =\nQuantity of water in 1st bucket + Quantity of water in 2nd bucket\n= (24 + 12) L = 36 L.\nQ1) Convert the following quantities to Litre.\n- 123 ml\n- 5600 ml\n- 4000 ml\nQ2) Convert the following to mililitres.\n- 25 L\n- 2 L\n- 32 L\n- 256 L\nQ3) State True or False:\n- 1 L = 1000 ml\n- 1 ml = 1/1000 L\n- Capacity is less than or equal to Quantity.\n- Water in a can should me measure in Litres.\nQ4) How many 200 ml of bottles can fill a 2 Litre drum?\n- Capacity and Quantity are measurements values.\n- They are always measured in L or ml.\n- 1 L = 1000 ml.\n- Capacity is always greater than or equal to the value of Quantity.\n- For smaller measurements we use the unit ml and for larger we use the unit L.\n- The standard unit is Liters or L.', 'Presentation on theme: ""Many errors can occur during these steps, such errors are considered preanalytical errors and are known to contribute to delayed and suboptimal patient.""— Presentation transcript:\nmany errors can occur during these steps, such errors are considered preanalytical errors and are known to contribute to delayed and suboptimal patient care.\nPHLEBOTOMY AND SPECIMEN CONSIDERATIONS Two classifications of preanalytical variables: 1. Controllable variables relate to standardization of collection, transport, and processing of specimens. 2. Uncontrollable variables are those associated with the physiology of the particular patient (age, sex, underlying disease, etc.)\nPHLEBOTOMY AND SPECIMEN CONSIDERATIONS PHLEBOTOMY The process of collecting blood literally translated means “ to cut a vein ”\nPHLEBOTOMY AND SPECIMEN CONSIDERATIONS 2 main phlebotomy procedures: 1.Venipuncture- blood is collected through a needle inserted in the vein 2. Capillary puncture –blood is collected from a skin puncture made with a lancet or similar device\nindividuals trained in blood collection techniques\nBLOOD COLLECTION PERSONNEL Plays an important role in public relations in the laboratory An assured professional can put the patient at ease and facilitate a positive interaction\nINFECTION CONTROL PPE -lab coats, gloves are required for phlebotomy procedures and during specimen handling -New gloves for each patient -Masks Hand hygiene -most important means of preventing the spread of infection -Hands must be decontaminated frequently, including after glove removal -Alcohol based antiseptic can be used if hands are not visibly soiled Isolation - separates certain patients from others and limit their contact with personnel and visitors -Required precaution is posted on patient’s door\nTHE VASCULAR SYSTEM ARTERIES Have thick walls to withstand the pressure of ventricular contraction, that creates a pulse Normal systemic arterial blood is bright red. VEINS have thinner walls because blood in them is under less pressure Collapse more easily Dark bluish red (oxygen poor) Capillary only one cell Can easily be punctured to provide blood specimen\nVASCULAR ANATOMY (phlebotomy related) 2 basic patterns of the veins\nVASCULAR ANATOMY (phlebotomy related)\nOTHER VEINS: Veins on the back of the hand or at the ankle may be used, although these are less desirable and should be avoided in diabetics and other individuals with poor circulation. Leg, ankle and foot veins are sometimes used but not without permission of the patient’s physician due to potential medical complications\nSOURCE AND COMPOSITION OF BLOOD SPECIMENS ARTERIAL BLOOD Primarily reserved for blood gas evaluation and certain emergency situations VENOUS BLOOD affected by metabolic activity of the tissue it drains and varies by collection site chloride, glucose, pH, CO2, lactic acid and ammonia levels differ may from arterial blood CAPILLARY BLOOD Contains arterial and venous blood plus tissue fluid Capillary glucose is normally higher Calcium, potassium and total protein are normally lower\nTYPES OF BLOOD SPECIMENS SERUM PLASMA WHOLE BLOOD\nVENIPUNCTURE EQUIPMENT Venipuncture can be performed by 3 basic methods I Evacuated tube system (ETS) – most preferred because blood is collected directly from the vein in the tube, minimizing the risk of specimen contamination and exposure to the blood II Needle and syringe – used on small, fragile and damaged veins III Winged infusion set (butterfly ) – can be used with the ETS and syringe Used to draw blood from infants and children, hand veins and other difficult to draw situations\nVENIPUNCTURE EQUIPMENT 1. Tourniquet Applied to a patient’s arm during venipuncture Distends the veins, making them larger and easier to find, stretches the wall so they are thinner and easier to find Must not be left on longer than 1 minute because specimen quality may be affected\nVENIPUNCTURE EQUIPMENT 2. Needles Sterile, disposable and sized by length and gauge Gauge = number that relates to needle diameter or bore Gauge Gauge 21 – considered standard for routine venipuncture\nVENIPUNCTURE EQUIPMENT 3. Evacuated Tube System 3 basic components A. Multisample needle – allows collection of multiple tubes during venipuncture\nThe Vacuum collection needle is pointed at both ends, with one end shorter than the other. The long end of the needle is used for insertion into the vein, the shorter end is used to pierce the rubber stopper of the vacuum tube and usually is covered by a rubber sheath VENIPUNCTURE EQUIPMENT\nThe bevel is the slanted opening at the end of the needle. bevel of the needle must face upward when the needle is inserted into the vein. VENIPUNCTURE EQUIPMENT\nB. Tube holder Plastic cylinder with a small opening for a needle at one end and a large opening for tubes at the other end The tube end has flanges to help place and remove tubes\nVENIPUNCTURE EQUIPMENT C. Evacuated tubes Have a premeasured vacuum that automatically draws the volume of blood indicated on the label Vacuum loss can occur if tubes are stored improperly, opened, dropped or advanced too far onto the needle before draw, or if the needle bevel backs out of the skin during draw Are color coded to identify a type of additive, absence of additive or special tube property\nVENIPUNCTURE EQUIPMENT 4. SYRINGE SYSTEM Syringes are customarily used for patients with veins from which it is difficult to collect blood and for blood gas analysis.\nVENIPUNCTURE EQUIPMENT 5. BUTTERFLY SYSTEM A short needle with butterfly wings and a length of tubing with a Luer fitting for syringe use or a Luer adapter for ETS use Gauge 23 most commonly used During use, the plastic wings are held with the thumb and index finger, allowing the user to achieve the shallow needle angle needed to access small veins\nVENIPUNCTURE EQUIPMENT 6. Tube Additives A.Anticoagulants Prevent blood from clotting and include EDTA, citrates, heparin and oxalates B. Antiglycolitic agents Prevent glycolysis which can decrease glucose concentration by upto 10 mg/dl per hour Sodium fluoride : most common antiglycolitic agent Preserves glucose for upto 3 days, and inhibits bacterial growth C. Clot activators Are coagulation factors like thrombin Glass particles (silica) Inert clays ex. Diatomite (celite) Enhance clotting by providing more surface for platelet activation\nVENIPUNCTURE EQUIPMENT D. Thoxotropic gel separators -inert substances contained near the bottom of certain tubes -during centrifugation the gel lodges between cells and fluid, forming a physical barrier that prevents the cells from metabolizing substances in the serum or plasma\nVENIPUNCTURE EQUIPMENT 7. Trace element free tubes Contamination free Used to collect specimens for trace elements, toxicology, nutrient\nORDER OF DRAW AND ADDITIVE CARRY OVER is a special sequence of tube collection that reduces the risk of specimen contamination by microorganisms Additive carry over Affects chemistry test Occurs when blood in an additive tube touches the needle during venipuncture or during transfer from a syringe\nORDER OF DRAW AND ADDITIVE CARRY OVER COMMON TESTS AFFECTED BY ADDITIVE CONTAMINATION Citrate – ALP, Ca,Phosporus EDTA - ALP, Ca, CK,PTT,K,PT,Serum Iron, Na Heparin – Activated CT, ACP, Ca, PT, PTT Na, Li Oxalates- ACP, ALP, Amylase,Ca, LDH, PT, PTT, K, Red cell Silica (clot activator) – PTT, PT Sodium fluoride – Na, BUN\nSTOP, LIGHT RED, STAY PUT, GREEN LIGHT, GO S (Sterile) L (Light Blue) R (Red) S (Serum Separator Tube) P (Plasma Separator tube) G (green) L (lavender) G (gray)\nVENIPUNCTURE PROCEDURES 1.

61	How long can dehydration affect your thinking in hot weather?	In hot climates, losing just two litres of body fluid can impair cognitive abilities by 25 percent, which can happen in as little as three hours.	['Survival how to: skills in the wilderness\nDon’t be caught off guard on your next adventure into the wilderness - brush up on your bush survival skills.\nYOU ARE STANDING ALONG in 30ºC heat beside your car, bonnet up and a 250 km drive from the nearest town. Your car is loaded with gear for the daywalk you were planning, including four litres of water, lunch, a hat, sunscreen, and a map of the walk. Due to the lure of isolation there’s no phone reception, and the owner’s manual in your glove box is about as useful as your Eclectic Hits of Queen CDs for starting your car. No other vehicles are on the road, and thinking about it now, you haven’t seen one since taking that last turn 80 km back. It is hot, dry, and as quiet as a tomb…\nWhen I first heard of Bob Cooper’s survival courses, held in the bush of Western Australia, I had visions of an ex-army, ration-packed, drinks-his-own-urine boot-camp instructor offering tourists a Mick Dundee/Steve Erwin style experience. I had no idea.\nBob Cooper, however, has been conducting wilderness survival courses since 1980, and to the vast number of outdoor people less ignorant than me, he is Australia’s premier survivalist. He carries no knives, wears nothing more camouflaged that an old broad-brimmed hat, and with his fair, blue-eyed complexion, large frame and white beard, looks more like Santa than the leathery character I was expecting when I sat down for day one of his three-day Basic Outback Survival Course.\nSurvival how to: mind control\nIt is unbearably hot, you hate your phone provider more than ever, you have abandoned your owner’s manual and have resorted to reading the Queen Disc One song list: ‘I Want To Break Free’, ‘I’m Going Slightly Mad’, ‘Under Pressure’, ‘Death On Two Legs’, ‘Dead On Time’. You begin to wonder if you told anyone where you were going, if this minor road was even the correct one, if Australian birds circle their prey before death… “\nThe first word I want you to write down”, says Bob. “is control”. If there is one thing that Bob stresses, after all of his years studying and being involved in survival situations, it is the importance of attitude; that creating and keeping an appropriate outlook can be, and often is, the defining factor between an incident and a tragedy. A survival situation is a fantastic opportunity to put your positive attitude and ingenuity to a new challenge.\nSo you move on to reading Queen’s Disc Two: ‘We Are The Champions’, ‘Hang On In There’, ‘The Show Must Go On’, ‘Don’t Lose Your Head’, ‘It’s A Beautiful Day’. You don your hat and sunscreen, make yourself comfortable in the shade of a tree, and sit down with a pen and paper to think about your situation, what resources you have on hand, and how you can best use them.\nYour priorities should be divided into five main themes: Water, Signals, Shelter, Warmth and Food. As Bob says, “Plans don’t usually fail. But people fail to plan.”\nSurvival how to: stay hydrated\nThe four litres of water you packed for your walk is looking pretty good. In hot environments, the body will rapidly dehydrate if its fluids are not replaced. The vital organs will scavenge whatever water they can find to continue functioning, and one organ at the back of the bodily queue is the brain. The loss of just two litres of body fluid (which can happen in as little time as three hours in hot climates), can impair your cognitive abilities by 25 percent. One quarter of your senses may leave you in the space of half a day if you do not drink.\nBob Cooper has a library of tales of healthy, intelligent people making tragically poor decisions when suffering dehydration dementia: people walking away from roads for help; stripping themselves naked in the blistering sun; abandoning radios and vehicles filled with food and shelter to wander aimlessly through the bush.\nIf your well-constructed positive planning is going to have a chance of success, drink your water. Don’t sip. Drink a cupful at a time, when desired. Your thirst and urine colour will tell you when you need to increase the amount.\nBob’s course teaches at least 15 different methods of procuring fluids in a dry bush environment. Our small group experimented with clear plastic bags tied over transpiring tree branches, digging solar stills to collect evaporated water from impure water, and draining water from plant roots. Other clever methods include:\n- Collecting dew from surfaces, plants and grasses;\n- Following fresh animal tracks to water;\n- Observing the flight directions of seed-eating birds, that will travel to and from water each day (towards the water they will fly in a neat formation; away, they will fly in a haphazard arrangement);\n- Draining the air-conditioning water of your vehicle (if the engine still works) by running the air-con with the windows down and collecting the overflow in a container or bag.\nSurvival how to - Communicate\nFeeling reassured about your water situation, and having quenched your thirst, you begin to assess when someone is likely to start looking for you.\nYou will want to be ready for being accidentally found, as much as deliberately found, and so the first thing you do is raise the bonnet of your car so that you don’t look like you have just stopped for a pee, and block the road with a tripod made of sticks and anything to attract attention as a distress sign. You want to be seen by passing vehicles, planes, walkers, riders, whoever – during the day, as well as throughout the night.\nAccording to Bob, you have approximately two minutes in which to work after first hearing an aircraft, and possibly less for a vehicle. This is your window for attracting attention to yourself and you want to make the most of it...\nSurvival how to - Fire\nDuring the day you will want a contained fire to burn that emits as much smoke as possible. This can be achieved by burning green branches and leaves, or by burning wet branches. You may consider burning parts of your vehicle, such as upholstery or ideally, a spare tyre, as it will signal to the nostrils as much as the eyes. In the night, depending on your position, you will want a fire to signal with its light, and a flaring fire will draw even more attention. Fires positioned at the three points of an equilateral triangle are internationally recognised as a distress signal.\nSurvival how to - Reflection\nOne of your greatest tools for attracting notice will be the reflection of light. Daylight, torchlight, headlights, or firelight – reflections from mirrors can travel over 20 km. Reflective materials you may not have thought to use include:\n• Car mirrors removed\n• Aluminium foil\n• The inside of a drink can\n• A wine cask bladder\n• Reflective patches on jackets, skis and backpacks\n• Space blanket from first aid kit\n• Credit card\n• Eclectic Hits of Queen CDs\nWhen not actively using your reflective tools, you can hang them from dead trees or poles, or a tripod of sticks on the road, so that they may rotate in the breeze and passively signal to potential passers-by.\nSurvival how to: whistles\nIf you have the benefit of a whistle, use it. Universally, three whistle blasts (or light flashes, or flares), means distress.\nSurvival how to: messages\nThe most basic form of written signal is an SOS message. Create your message in any way that you can; using sticks, logs, bright clothing, tape, stones etc. Make it as large as possible, and as square as possible - round letters tend to blend in with other natural organic shapes. Square, right-angled letters are easier to distinguish in natural surroundings, and are more likely to catch the eye.\nIt is imperative that you also create informative notes to rescuers. These might be left on roads (attached to large, colourful tripods of sticks), with your vehicle, at your shelter, or at a water source. Features to note include:\n• The words ‘Emergency’ and ‘Help;\n• Date of your note and other incidents\n• Names, ages and medical details of yourself and your companions\n• Colour of your clothing\n• Reason you are stranded\n• Action you have taken and why\n• Direction you have travelled in (also mark with an arrow on the ground)\n• Your intentions\n• Water and provisions you are carrying\n• The help you want\n• A sketch of your area and plan (do not assume the literacy or language of your rescuer)d']	['<urn:uuid:5e4ef351-bdb7-4b5b-ad69-0e2f30162301>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	10	26	1454
62	What security measures protect both borrowed code and cloud data?	For borrowed code, security measures include validating the source, analyzing complexity, and scrutinizing based on the operating environment - with web server code requiring highest scrutiny. For cloud data, protective measures include encryption before upload, multi-factor authentication, strict access controls, continuous file auditing, and automated policy enforcement. Both scenarios require assuming potential malicious intent and implementing proper security procedures before deployment or data sharing.	"['If you\'ve ever written a lot of code, you\'ve probably found yourself thinking, ""Someone must have already tackled...\nthis problem."" You may even have gone a step further and done a Google search for relevant code that you might be able to incorporate into your project. But have you ever stopped to think about the security ramifications of using this type of code? If not, you should!\nIf you\'re a security administrator, you should take the time to ensure that you know the source of all of the code running on your systems. If your developers are ""borrowing"" code from external sources, you need to be aware of the validation procedure used to vet the code before introducing it into your environment and the risks inherent in reusing code. If you\'re a developer, you need to be clear about the appropriate security procedures to follow when importing code from a third party.\nMORE INFORMATION ON SECURE CODE:\n- Source code security scanners are one option for testing custom-built code.\n- @Stake\'s Chris Wysopal argues that when it comes to secure software, the source of the problem is the solution.\n- In this Guest Commentary, Oracle CSO Mary Ann Davidson argues that there is hope for secure coding.\nOf course, the level of scrutiny that you apply to reused code should vary based upon several factors. Let\'s take a brief look at the factors you should take under consideration:\n- Source – Where did the code come from? Was it a trusted source? If the code was written by a fellow developer within your organization, it probably requires less scrutiny than something downloaded from the Internet.\n- Complexity – The more complex a piece of code, the more scrutiny it will require. Unfortunately, the more complex the code, the less likely developers will be to tear it apart line-by-line looking for security flaws. If the code is simple (such as a template that creates an HTML drop-down box listing the 50 states), you can check it for vulnerabilities in a matter of minutes (if not seconds!). On the other hand, a 4,000 line program takes a lot more reverse engineering.\n- Application – Code that runs on your Web server should undergo much more scrutiny than code running on an internal client. You should analyze the operating environment and take those considerations into account when determining whether it\'s appropriate to reuse code. If you\'re writing an application that facilitates the transfer of funds between accounts for Web users, you\'ll probably want to write the entire thing from scratch. On the other hand, you can probably get away with borrowing portions of a form used to request more information from your company.\nSharing reusable pieces of code is not uncommon. There are entire books and Web sites dedicated to sharing code, either for a fee or at no cost. As paranoid as it sounds, you must assume that any piece of code that you obtain from someone else is designed with malicious intent. After all, as security professionals, it\'s our job to be paranoid!\nAbout the author\nMike Chapple, CISSP, currently serves as Chief Information Officer of the Brand Institute, a Miami-based marketing consultancy.

DLP solutions aim to prevent sensitive data and confidential information from being stored, used, or transferred insecurely.\nCloud DLP solutions specifically protect organizations that have adopted cloud storage by ensuring sensitive data does not make its way into the cloud without first being encrypted and is only sent to authorized cloud applications. Most cloud DLP solutions remove or alter classified or sensitive data before files are shared to the cloud to ensure that the data is protected when in transit and cloud storage.\nBenefits of Cloud DLP\nToday, data is put at risk as organizations move to the cloud and employees work from various locations, accessing corporate files from anywhere and at all hours. Employees also collaborate using the cloud, but they may do so using unapproved services and cloud storage apps – otherwise known as “Shadow IT.” That’s why it’s critical for organizations to protect sensitive data not only on their own networks and devices, but in the cloud as well.\nKey benefits of leading cloud DLP solutions include:\n- Integrate with cloud storage providers to scan servers, identify, and encrypt sensitive data before the file is shared in the cloud\n- Scan data already stored in the cloud and audit it at any time\n- Accurately discover sensitive data in the cloud\n- Continuously audit uploaded files\n- Automatically apply controls (prompt, block, encrypt) to sensitive data in accordance with enterprise policies\n- Instantly alert appropriate administrators and data owners when data is put at risk\n- Maintain the visibility and control needed to comply with privacy and data protection regulations\nChallenges of Cloud Data Protection\nOrganizations that do not implement a cloud DLP solution essentially leave cloud data protection up to their cloud storage providers. Problems can arise, however, when those providers fail to take security measures commensurate with the organizations’ data protection needs – such as not offering cloud encryption, multi-factor authentication, or strict access controls. What’s more, a compromise at a cloud storage provider can lead to a compromise of an organization’s data if the organization hasn’t taken steps to secure it before it was sent to the cloud.\nThere are enough challenges associated with cloud storage providers handling cloud data protection that many organizations choose to be proactive with protecting their data in the cloud by implementing a cloud DLP solution to secure their sensitive and confidential information, rather than placing trust in cloud services providers that their DLP and other security measures are adequate for meeting company security requirements and compliance standards.\nChoosing Cloud DLP Providers\nWhen selecting a cloud DLP solution, organizations should be sure it offers the following key features:\n- Content- and context-aware monitoring and inspection policies\n- Detailed activity logging and reporting\n- Device-level control\n- Auditing, alerting, prompting, blocking, and removing remediation actions\n- Encryption of sensitive data prior to cloud upload\n- API integration with cloud storage providers to extend data security policy enforcement to the cloud\nThe reality is that businesses and their employees need to be able to conduct business in the cloud in order to remain productive. However, cloud adoption can also put data at risk of loss or unauthorized access. This risk has led to the need for cloud DLP solutions, because businesses must be assured their sensitive data is being protected while they benefit from the scalability and efficiency of the cloud. Choosing a cloud DLP solution that is offers exceptional data discovery and visibility in the cloud and delivers the protective controls required for safeguarding cloud data is critical.']"	['<urn:uuid:ec062fb6-39ba-48b7-b5ef-dad74de5ed6b>', '<urn:uuid:70fd4c7b-e3a0-43b4-8153-e2f70cd959a3>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	10	64	1204

It is connected to the Atlantic via Davis Strait and the Labrador Sea. The narrower Nares Strait connects Baffin Bay with the Arctic Ocean. The bay is not navigable most of the year because of the ice cover and high density of floating ice and icebergs in the open areas. However, a polynya of about 80,000 km2 (31,000 sq mi), known as the North Water, opens in summer on the north near Smith Sound. Most of the aquatic life of the bay is concentrated near that region.\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of Baffin Bay as follows:\nOn the North. A line from Cape Sheridan, Grant Land (82°35′N 60°45′W / 82.583°N 60.750°W) to Cape Bryant, Greenland.\nOn the East. The West Coast of Greenland.\nOn the South.

Around AD 1200, the initial Dorset settlers were replaced by the Thule (the later Inuit) peoples. Recent excavations also suggest that the Norse colonization of the Americas reached the shores of Baffin Bay sometime between the 10th and 14th centuries. The English explorer John Davis was the first recorded European to enter the bay, arriving in 1585. In 1612, a group of English merchants formed the ""Company of Merchants of London, Discoverers of the North-West Passage"". Their governor Thomas Smythe organized five expeditions to explore the northern coasts of Canada in search of a maritime passage to the Far East. Henry Hudson and Thomas Button\'s explored Hudson Bay, William Gibbons Labrador, and Robert Bylot Hudson Strait and the area which became known as Baffin\'s Bay after his pilot William Baffin. Aboard the Discovery, Baffin charted the area and named Lancaster, Smith, and Jones Sounds after members of his company. By the completion of his 1616 voyage, Baffin held out no hope of an ice-free passage and the area remained unexplored for another two centuries. Over time, his account came to be doubted until it was confirmed by John Ross\'s 1818 voyage. More advanced scientific studies followed in 1928, in the 1930s and after World War II by Danish, American and Canadian expeditions.\nCurrently, there are a few Inuit settlements on the Canadian coast of the bay, including Arctic Bay (population 690), Pond Inlet (1,315) and Clyde River (820). Those settlements are accessed and supplied by air and annual sealifts. In 1975, a town was built at Nanisivik to support lead and zinc production at the Nanisivik Mine—the first Canadian mine in the Arctic. The mine was closed in 2002 due to declining resources and metal prices. Whereas the town still has a functional seaport and an airport, as of the 2006 census, it has an official population of zero.\nBaffin Bay was the epicenter of a 7.3 magnitude earthquake in 1933. This is the largest known earthquake north of the Arctic Circle. It caused no damage because of its offshore location and the small number of the nearby onshore communities. The northwestern part of the bay remains one of the most seismically active regions in eastern Canada. Five earthquakes of magnitude 6 have occurred here since 1933. The latest strong earthquake occurred on 15 April 2010 and had the magnitude of 5.1.\nGeography and geology\nBaffin Bay is an arm of the Atlantic Ocean bounded by the Baffin Island in the west, Greenland in the east, and Ellesmere Island in the north. It connects to the Atlantic through the Davis Strait, and to the Arctic through several narrow channels of Nares Strait. It is a northwestern extension of the North Atlantic and Labrador Sea. It can also be viewed as a long strait separating Baffin Island and Greenland.\nThe bay is less than 1,000 m (3,300 ft) deep near the coast, where the sea bottom is covered with gravel, crushed stone and sand. In the center, there is a deep pit called Baffin Hollow reaching 2,136 m (7,008 ft) (see depth map), which is mostly covered in silt. Currents form a cyclonic circulation. On the eastern periphery, in summer, the West Greenland Current transports water from the Atlantic Ocean to the North. In its western part, the Baffin Island Current brings the Arctic waters to the south.\nClimate, hydrology and hydrochemistry\nThe climate is Arctic with frequent storms, especially in winter. Average January temperatures are −20 °C (−4 °F) in the south and −28 °C (−18 °F) on the north. In July, the average temperature is 7 °C (45 °F). The annual precipitation is 100–250 mm (3.9–9.8 in) on the Greenland side and about twice as much near Baffin Island.\nThe water temperature at the surface is below −1 °C (30 °F) in winter. In summer, it varies from 4–5 °C (39–41 °F) in the south-east to 0 °C (32 °F) and below at north-west. The salinity exceeds 34‰ (parts per thousand) in winter. In summer, it is 32‰ on the east and 30–31‰ on the west. Deep waters are formed as a result of mixing of Arctic and Atlantic waters; their temperature is about −0.5 °C (31.1 °F) and salinity is 34.5 ‰. In winter, 80% of the bay is covered with continuous ice, floating ice and fast ice. In some winters, the continuous ice stretches from shore to shore. The ice is most abundant in March and least in August–September. In summer, drifting ice remains in the central and western parts of the bay. Numerous icebergs are formed in this period and are brought, together with ice, to the Atlantic Ocean near Newfoundland.\nThe tides are semidiurnal, with an average height of 4 m (13 ft) and the maximum of 9 m (30 ft). Their speed varies between 1 and 3.7 km/h (0.62 and 2.30 mph) hour and the direction by as much as 180°. This variability results in the collision and crushing of fresh, old, and pack ice. Winds are predominantly north-western through the whole year. South-eastern and eastern winds are common in July and August.\nBetween May and July (sometimes April), a significant portion of navigable open water (polynya) forms at the extreme north of the bay, presumably due to the relatively warm Greenland Current. With an area of about 80,000 km2 (31,000 sq mi) in summer, it is the largest polynya of the Canadian Arctic and covers the Smith Sound between the Ellesmere Island and Greenland. This polynya has a stable position and existed for at least 9,000 years. It was first described in 1616 by William Baffin and was named North Water by whalers of the 18–19th centuries.\nThe North Water provides air to ice algae and zooplankton and is characterized by abundant fauna. Of about 20,000 beluga whales living in the Baffin Bay, some 15,000 are concentrated at the North Water. Other abundant animals of the region include walrus, narwhal, harp seal, bearded seal, ringed seal, bowhead whale, rorquals and polar bear. All aquatic mammals crucially depend on the availability of open water; they have very limited ability to maintain breathing holes in ice and are all vulnerable to attacks by the polar bear when breathing at the holes. The seals and walrus occupy areas of fast ice, which is essential for giving birth and raising the pups. Bearded seals feed near the bottom of the bay and therefore are restricted to the shallow waters. Ringed seal is the most common meal of the polar bear. It is also an occasional prey of the walrus and Arctic fox. Most large animals of the bay are being traditionally hunted, but the hunting has been restricted in the 20th century in order to preserve the wildlife population. For example, the quota for polar bears in the bay area is 105 per year.\nThere are about 400 plant and tree species on the bay shores, including birch, willow, alder and plants adapted to salty soils, as well as lyme grass, mosses, and lichens. These serve as food for caribou and rodents, such as lemming. Resident fish species include polar cod, Arctic flounder (Pleuronectidae, Liopsetta), four-horned sculpin and capelin, whereas cod, haddock, herring, halibut, and rattail migrate from the Atlantic. The birds are represented by the little auk, snowy owl, willow ptarmigan, rock ptarmigan, gyrfalcon, Arctic redpoll and guillemots. Most of them migrate to the south during the winter.\nOil and gas\nUS Geological Survey has estimated that at least 13% of the worlds undiscovered oil deposits and 30% of the worlds undiscovered gas pockets are located in the Arctic, with the seas around Greenland potentially holding large amounts of natural gas and lesser amounts of crude oil and natural gas liquids. This has led the Greenland\'s minister and provincial council to offer a large number of off-shore concessions to potential hydrocarbon (oil and gas) extraction. The largest concessions areas are located in seas west of Greenland; primarily Baffin Bay and the Davis Strait, but with several smaller concessions in the Greenland Sea in the east also.\n- Baffin Bay, Great Soviet Encyclopedia (in Russian)\n- Baffin Bay, Encyclopædia Britannica on-line\n- Baffin Bay.

64	Being a specialist in oral infections, I'd like to understand the key differences between how periodontal disease affects bone loss locally in the jaw versus its potential systemic effects on other bones and organs in the body - what does research show?	Periodontal disease has distinct local and systemic effects. Locally, bacteria and the body's immune response break down the alveolar bone and connective tissue supporting the teeth, leading to tooth mobility and potential tooth loss. Systemically, research suggests that periodontal bacteria can enter the bloodstream through gum tissue and affect other parts of the body. These bacteria may travel to heart arteries, potentially triggering inflammation and arterial narrowing that contributes to heart attacks. The systemic complications can include coronary artery disease, respiratory problems, rheumatoid arthritis, and complications with diabetes. Additionally, periodontal disease has been linked to premature, low birth weight babies.	"[""Oral Health and Bone Disease (cont.)\nIn this Article\nSkeletal bone density and dental concerns\nThe portion of the jawbone that supports our teeth is known as the alveolar process. Several studies have found a link between the loss of alveolar bone and an increase in loose teeth (tooth mobility) and tooth loss. Women with osteoporosis are three times more likely to experience tooth loss than those who do not have the disease.\nLow bone density in the jaw can result in other dental problems as well. For example, older women with osteoporosis may be more likely to have difficulty with loose or ill-fitting dentures and may have less optimal outcomes from oral surgical procedures.\nPeriodontal disease and bone health\nPeriodontitis is a chronic infection that affects the gums and the bones that support the teeth. Bacteria and the body's own immune system break down the bone and connective tissue that hold teeth in place. Teeth may eventually become loose, fall out, or have to be removed.\nAlthough tooth loss is a well-documented consequence of periodontitis, the relationship between periodontitis and skeletal bone density is less clear. Some studies have found a strong and direct relationship among bone loss, periodontitis, and tooth loss. It is possible that the loss of alveolar bone mineral density leaves bone more susceptible to periodontal bacteria, increasing the risk for periodontitis and tooth loss.\nThe role of the dentist and dental X-rays\nResearch supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) suggests that dental x-rays may be used as a screening tool for osteoporosis. Researchers found that dental x-rays were highly effective in distinguishing people with osteoporosis from those with normal bone density.\nBecause many people see their dentist more regularly than their doctor, dentists are in a unique position to help identify people with low bone density and to encourage them to talk to their doctors about their bone health. Dental concerns that may indicate low bone density include loose teeth, gums detaching from the teeth or receding gums, and ill-fitting or loose dentures.\nViewers share their comments\nOral Health and Bone Disease - Experience Question: Please describe your experience with oral health and bone disease.\nOral Health and Bone Disease - Concerns Question: What are your particular concerns regarding low bone density in your jaw and dental health issues?\nOral Health and Bone Disease - Periodontal Disease Question: Do you have periodontal disease?

Periodontitis can lead to an increased risk of heart attack or stroke along with other serious health problems.\nPeriodontitis, although common, is largely preventable and is generally the result of poor oral hygiene. Brushing at least twice daily and flossing once daily along with regular dental checkups can greatly reduce your chance of developing periodontitis.\nFactors that can increase your risk of periodontitis include:\n- Poor oral health habits\n- Tobacco use\n- Older age\n- Decreased immunity, such as that occurring with leukemia, HIV/AIDS or chemotherapy\n- Poor nutrition\n- Certain medications\n- Hormonal changes, such as those related to pregnancy or menopause\n- Substance abuse\n- Poor-fitting dental restorations\n- Problems with the way your teeth fit together when biting\nSome complications associated with gum disease include:\n- Tooth loss\n- Coronary artery disease\n- Premature, low birth weight babies\n- Poorly controlled diabetes\n- Respiratory problems\n- Rheumatoid arthritis\nSome research suggests that the bacteria responsible for periodontitis can enter your bloodstream through your gum tissue, affecting your lungs, heart and other parts of your body. For instance, bacteria may travel to the arteries in your heart, where they might trigger a cycle of inflammation and arterial narrowing that contributes to heart attacks.\nDiagnosis of periodontitis is generally simple. Diagnosis is based on your description of symptoms and an exam of your mouth. Your hygienist will look for plaque and tartar buildup and check for easy bleeding.\nTo determine how severe your periodontitis is, your dental hygienist may:\n*Use a dental instrument to measure the pocket depth of the groove between your gums and your teeth by inserting a probe between your tooth and gumline, usually at several sites throughout your mouth. In a healthy mouth, the pocket depth is usually between 1 and 3 millimeters (mm). Pockets deeper than 5 mm indicate periodontitis.\n*Take dental X-rays to check for bone loss in areas where your dentist observes deeper pocket depths.\nThe goal of periodontal treatment is to thoroughly clean the pockets around the teeth preventing further damage to the surrounding bone. Treatment may be performed by a periodontist, a dentist or a dental hygienist. You have the best chance for successful treatment when you commit to a regimen of good oral hygiene along with routine dental maintenance appointments.\nIf periodontitis isn’t advanced, treatment may involve less invasive procedures, including scaling and root planning (a deeper cleaning that is usually performed in quadrants at multiple appointments with local dental anesthesia or “numbing”). Scaling removes tartar and bacteria from your tooth surfaces and beneath your gums. It may be performed using instruments or an ultrasonic device. Root planing smoothes the root surfaces, discouraging further buildup of tartar and bacterial endotoxin. In some cases, Dr. Hughes may recommend using topical or oral antibiotics to help control bacterial infection.

65	Could you explain the molecular transformation that occurs in cannabis as it develops from its early growth stages into a mature plant?	All cannabinoids begin as cannabigerolic acid. As the cannabis plant grows and matures, those molecules undergo synthesis and convert into acidic forms of cannabinoids, such as tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA). Only a tiny percentage remains as cannabigerol in most strains of recreational marijuana, with the bulk of cannabigerolic acid converting to THCA.	['Cannabis DecarboxylationMeet the chemical reaction that gives weed its power.\nIf you’ve ever made your own edibles before, you know better than to grind up raw marijuana leaves and toss them in brownie batter, or even to crumble up dried buds. This would result in a batch of brownies with little to no psychoactive properties. To make brownies that deserve the “special” label, weed must first be heated low and slow in the oven—a process known as decarboxylation.\nDecarbing Cannabis: What’s the Point?\nYou’ve heard a lot about THC, CBD, and the many other cannabinoids found in marijuana. These impressive molecules have become famous for their many psychoactive and therapeutic effects, but many of those effects would not be possible without decarboxylation.\nEarly cannabinoids contain something called carboxylic acid in their chemical structure, making them acidic. Here’s why that matters for you: these cannabinoid acids do not bind to CB receptors in the central nervous system, which is why you won’t get high from munching on raw cannabis leaves.\nDecarboxylation refers to a process of removing carbon dioxide from a chemical structure. Don’t get thrown off by the scientific words: this process is relatively simple. In cannabis, decarbing releases the carboxyl group COOH from the cannabinoid structures. Pulling out these carboxylic acids results in cannabinoids (like THC and CBD) that can better bind to CB receptors—and thus have more potent effects.\nQ: What is decarboxylation?\nA: Decarboxylation is the process of removing carbon dioxide from a chemical structure.\nQ: What is cannabis decarboxylation?\nA: Cannabis decarboxylation removes carboxylic acid from cannabinoid acids in marijuana. Prior to decarbing, cannabis contains acidic precursors to the cannabinoids, such as THCA (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) and CBDA (cannabidiolic acid). Decarbing converts these into THC and CBD, activating their full effects.\nHow Does Decarboxylation Happen?\nHeat and light are the two key ingredients for cannabis decarbing. The decarboxylation process happens naturally while cannabis is stored and fermented, but at a slow rate. Adding a heat source, typically an oven, will speed up that process.\nThe bud you buy at the store has not been decarbed, so it’s technically non-psychoactive. If you prefer to smoke marijuana in joint or bong form, you have actually been decarbing your weed without even realizing it. That’s because when you light up a joint, the high heat decarbs the weed on the spot, and you can enjoy the full psychoactive effects without preheating your oven.\nBut if you want to dabble in making your own edibles, decarboxylation is a process that requires a little more planning. If you simply mix your weed with butter, you’re likely going to be disappointed if you’re looking for a high.\nPrior to using in edibles, your weed needs to be decarbed first (even if the recipe is a baked good, like a brownie). This is often done in the oven. At temperatures between 225°F and 250°F (and no higher than 300°F), you can decarb your weed in about 40 to 60 minutes. Once it cools, it’s ready to be used as your cannabis-cooking heart desires.\nQ: How is cannabis decarbed?\nA: Cannabis is decarbed with time or heat. It naturally undergoes the decarboxylation process during storage, but heating it will decarb it faster. This can be done in a heat source like an oven (before use in edibles) or in a joint or bong (while smoking).\nThe Life Cycle of a Cannabinoid\nWhen you purchase weed, the label usually only tells you how much THC (and sometimes CBD) you can find in that product. However, that marijuana has gone through many changes before that THC percentage was tested.\nAll cannabinoids begin as cannabigerolic acid. As the cannabis plant grows and matures, those molecules undergo synthesis and convert into the acidic forms of all the cannabinoids you’re familiar with, such as tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA).\nAs for the cannabigerolic acid that started it all, only a tiny percentage of it remains as cannabigerol in most strains of recreational marijuana. The bulk of the cannabigerolic acid made the journey to THCA.\nFrom THCA to THC\nRemember: before weed is decarbed, it’s actually non-psychoactive. That’s because the THC is still THCA, or tetrahydrocannabinolic acid. THCA is the acidic precursor of THC.\nTHCA may not be psychoactive, but it’s not void of value. In vitro studies have found that it has many of the same medical benefits as THC, including fighting inflammation. That said, many people turn to THC for its psychoactive effects, which is where decarboxylation comes in.\nWhen THCA is converted to THC via decarboxylation, the activated cannabinoid is linked to many effects, such as:\n• Reduced nausea\n• Reduced pain\n• Reduced inflammation\n• Impaired coordination\n• Altered mood\n• Altered sense of time and sensations\n• Impaired memory\n• And stimulated appetite.\nMost of these effects wouldn’t happen without decarboxylation. However, if the cannabinoids decarb too much, the THC can convert further to cannabinol (CBN). CBN maintains some of the therapeutic effects of THC, but it is no longer psychoactive.\nFrom CBDA to CBD\nSince you can’t get the psychoactive effects of cannabis without decarbing THCA, much of the conversation about decarboxylation often revolves around THC. However, THC isn’t the only cannabinoid to undergo decarbing.\nCBDA (or cannabidiolic acid) is the acidic precursor to CBD. On its own, CBDA does have pain-reducing and anti-inflammatory effects, according to a 2018 study from Psychopharmacology. However, CBDA does not bind as well to receptors in the body, resulting in less potent effects.\nCBD is considered an active—but not psychoactive—cannabinoid. Decarbing this cannabinoid helps it bind to receptors better. This activates its full array of benefits, such as:\n• Reduced pain\n• Lowered inflammation\n• Reduced frequency of seizures\n• Lessened anxiety\n• And reduced insomnia.\nThis is true for other active cannabinoids, as well. For example, decarbing helps activate cannabichromene (CBC), cannabidivarin (CBDV), and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV). Different strains of cannabis produce a unique ratio of these cannabinoids (and more) that work in synthesis to produce various effects on you.\nDecarboxylation: The Final Word\nUnderstanding and appreciating decarboxylation can have many benefits, including helping you save money. Decarbing your own weed to make homemade edibles can be a rewarding and cost-cutting project. The terms may be scientific and multi-syllabic, but the process itself is pretty simple.\nBeyond edibles, decarbing cannabis is a vital yet underappreciated process. Decarboxylation is a chemical reaction that you don’t even need to think about while lighting up a joint, yet this process is exactly what makes your bud so enjoyable.\nQ: Can you eat decarbed weed?\nA: Yes. In fact, weed needs to be decarbed in order to make edibles with a psychoactive effect. Once decarbed, cannabis can be used in butters, oils, baked goods, sauces, and more.\nQ: What is the temperature needed to decarb weed?\nA: The ideal range for decarbing cannabis is between 225°F and 250°F. Lower temperatures help preserve the flavor. Going above 300°F is likely to damage vital properties of the cannabis and result in an unpleasant taste.\nQ: How long does decarbing cannabis take?\nA: With the oven set to 240°F, decarbing cannabis should take approximately 40 to 60 minutes. Higher temperatures can shorten the decarbing process, but it may result in a less pleasant and potent product.\nQ: How long does decarbed weed last?\nA: Decarbed cannabis can be stored in an airtight glass container in a cool, dark place. It should last at least a year without losing its potency.']	['<urn:uuid:35b91534-cf47-49be-b4b6-b872fa10298a>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	22	55	1246
66	cities temperature increase causes measurement accuracy	Cities are experiencing temperature increases from two sources. First, global climate change is pushing temperatures higher, with 2023 showing temperatures 1.43°C above pre-industrial levels. Second, urban heat islands cause cities to be 10-15°F warmer than surrounding areas due to dense building materials, dark surfaces that absorb heat, and human activities like energy use. Regarding measurement accuracy, urban weather stations used to track global temperature changes can be 'contaminated' by urban heat island effects, potentially affecting the global temperature record. The ability to fully remove these urban influences remains debated, as changes can occur independently of population and current techniques for removing urban effects may be inadequate.	"['According to the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO), 2023 is likely to be the hottest year on record, with the global mean temperature currently at 1.43 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. ""That is why WMO is committed to the Early Warnings For All initiative to save lives and minimize economic losses,"" added Petteri Taalas, head of WMO. Source: news.un.org\nThe WMO\'s prediction of 2023 being the hottest year on record indicates a significant acceleration in global climate change, which could have major implications for billions of people and numerous ecosystems. The increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events could lead to displacement, loss of livelihoods, and increased mortality rates. However, there is some uncertainty in these predictions, and the impacts of climate change will vary by region. Overall, this report highlights the urgent need for action to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts.\n- Global climate change: The report indicates a significant increase in global temperatures, which could have a substantial impact on the lives of billions of people. This aligns with the \'7-8\' rating criteria as it affects more than a billion people and has major implications for social, economic, and political systems. The rise in temperatures can lead to more extreme weather events, affecting agriculture, water supply, and human health. For example, heatwaves can cause widespread health issues and even death, particularly in regions that are not equipped to deal with such temperatures.\n- Extreme weather events: The increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, heavy rain, and floods will significantly affect millions of people worldwide. This could lead to displacement, loss of livelihoods, and increased mortality rates. For instance, wildfires can destroy homes and farmlands, leading to displacement and food insecurity.\n- Impact on ecosystems: The record low levels of sea ice in the Antarctic could have severe implications for marine ecosystems, affecting millions of species. This could disrupt the food chain and lead to the extinction of certain species, which would have further knock-on effects on other species and ecosystems.\n- Human activities and climate change: The report highlights the role of human activities in exacerbating climate change, specifically through the release of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. This indicates a need for systemic changes in how societies function and interact with the environment, affecting billions of people and future generations.\n- Uncertainty in predictions: While the WMO predicts that 2023 will be the hottest year on record, there is always a degree of uncertainty in such forecasts. Climate models are complex and depend on numerous variables, some of which are not fully understood. Therefore, while the trend is concerning, the exact outcomes may vary.\n- Regional variations: The impacts of climate change and extreme weather events will not be evenly distributed. Some regions may experience more severe effects than others, which could lead to disparities in the impacts experienced by different populations.\n- Potential for mitigation: The article does not discuss potential mitigation strategies or efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If significant steps are taken to address climate change, the predicted impacts could be lessened.', 'Are cities getting hotter? As cities add roads, buildings, industry, and people, temperatures in the city rise relative to their rural surroundings, creating a heat island. These urban heat islands may be up to 10-15°F under optimum conditions. With increasing urban development, heat islands may increase in frequency and magnitude. Los Angeles, California, for example, has been 1˚F hotter every decade for the past 60 years. These heat islands have impacts that range from local to global scales and highlight the importance of urbanization to environmental change.\nWhat is an urban heat island?\nAn urban heat island is the name given to describe the characteristic warmth of both the atmosphere and surfaces in cities (urban areas) compared to their (nonurbanized) surroundings. The heat island is an example of unintentional climate modification when urbanization changes the characteristics of the Earth’s surface and atmosphere.\nAre there different types of urban heat islands?\nThere are three types of heat islands:\n- canopy layer heat island (CLHI)\n- boundary layer heat island (BLHI)\n- surface heat island (SHI)\nThe first two refer to a warming of the urban atmosphere; the last refers to the relative warmth of urban surfaces. The urban canopy layer (UCL) is the layer of air closest to the surface in cities, extending upwards to approximately the mean building height (Figure 1). Above the urban canopy layer lies the urban boundary layer, which may be 1 kilometer (km) or more in thickness by day, shrinking to hundreds of meters or less at night (Figure 1).1 It is the BLHI that forms a dome of warmer air that extends downwind of the city. Wind often changes the dome to a plume shape.\nSchematic depiction of the main components of the urban atmosphere.\nHeat island types vary in their spatial form (shape), temporal (related to time) characteristics, and some of the underlying physical processes that contribute to their development. Scientists measure air temperatures for CLHI or BLHI directly using thermometers, whereas the SHI is measured by remote sensors mounted on satellites or aircraft. 2,3\nWhat are the characteristics of heat islands?\nOverall spatial form (shape) of the heat island\nThe isotherms, or lines of equal temperature, form a pattern that resembles an “island” loosely following the shape of the urbanized region, surrounded by cooler areas (Figure 2). There is often a sharp rise in the canopy-layer air temperature at the boundary of rural—suburban areas, followed by a slow and often variable increase towards the downtown core of the urban area where the warmest temperatures occur. The boundary layer heat island shows much less variability than the other heat island types and a cross-section shows its shape resembles a simple dome or plume with warmer air transported downwind of the city.\nUrban heat island characteristics.\nHeat island intensity\nHeat island intensity is a measure of the strength or magnitude of the heat island. At night, the intensity of the canopy layer heat island is typically in the range of 1° to 3°C, but under optimum conditions intensities of up to 12°C have been recorded.4 The BLHI tends to maintain a more constant heat island intensity both day and night (~1.5° to 2°C). The SHI is usually most distinct during the day when strong solar heating can lead to larger temperature differences between dry surfaces and wet, shaded, or vegetated surfaces.\nSurface characteristics and the heat island\nThe nature of the surface is a strong factor on the spatial patterns of surface and canopy layer air temperature in the city. The temperatures are higher in more densely built up areas, and lower near parks or more open areas (Figure 2). Surface temperatures are particularly sensitive to surface conditions: during daytime, dry, dark surfaces that strongly absorb sunlight become very hot, while lighter and/or moist surfaces are much cooler.2,3 Shading of the surface also helps control the temperature. (For visual examples of the surface heat island, see the “learn more” link, EPA Heat Island Pilot Project, at the end of the article.)\nTemporal form of the heat island\nAll heat islands form because of the differences in the rates of warming and cooling of cities relative to their surroundings.\n- CLHI: the heat island intensity increases with time from sunset to a maximum somewhere between a few hours after sunset to the predawn hours. During the day the CLHI intensity is typically fairly weak or sometimes negative (a cool island) in some parts of the city where there is extensive shading by tall buildings or other structures and a lag in warming due to storage of heat by building materials.\n- SHI: is strongly positive both day and night due to warmer urban surfaces. Daytime SHI is usually largest because solar radiation affects surface temperatures.\n- BLHI: is generally positive both day and night but much smaller in magnitude than CLHI or SHI.\nHow do heat islands form and how are they controlled?\nA number of factors contribute to the occurrence and intensity of heat islands; these include\n- geographic location\n- time of day and season\n- city form\n- city functions\nWeather, particularly wind and cloud, influences formation of heat islands. Heat island magnitudes are largest under calm and clear weather conditions. Increasing winds mix the air and reduce the heat island. Increasing clouds reduce radiative cooling at night and also reduce the heat island. Seasonal variations in weather patterns affect heat island frequency and magnitude.\nGeographic location influences the climate and topography of the area as well as the characteristics of the rural surroundings of the city. Regional or local weather influences, such as local wind systems, may impact heat islands; for example, coastal cities may experience cooling of urban temperatures in the summer when sea surface temperatures are cooler than the land and winds blow onshore. Where cities are surrounded by wet rural surfaces, slower cooling by these surfaces can reduce heat island magnitudes, especially in warm humid climates.5\nTime of day/season: Daytime impacts were discussed in the section called “Temporal form of the heat island.” Seasons play a role, too. Heat islands of cities located in the mid latitudes usually are strongest in the summer or winter seasons. In tropical climates, the dry season may favor large heat island magnitudes.\nCity form comprises the materials used in construction, the surface characteristics of the city such as the building dimensions and spacing, thermal properties, and amount of greenspace. Heat island formation is favored by\n- relatively dense building materials that are slow to warm and cool and store a lot of energy\n- replacement of natural surfaces by impervious or waterproofed surfaces, leading to a drier urban area, where less water is available for evaporation, which offsets heating of the air\n- lower surface reflectivity to solar radiation — dark surfaces such as asphalt roads absorb more sunlight and become much warmer than light-colored surfaces\nCity functions govern the output of pollutants into the urban atmosphere, heat from energy usage, and the use of water in irrigation. Anthropogenic heat, or heat generated from human activities, primarily fossil fuel combustion, can be important to heat island formation.6 Anthropogenic heating usually has the largest impact during the winter season of cold climates in the downtown core of the city.7 In select cases, very densely developed cities may have significant summertime anthropogenic heating that results from high energy use for building cooling.7\nHow do heat islands impact cities?\nHeat islands have a range of impacts for city dwellers,4 including\n- human comfort: positive (winter), negative (summer)\n- energy use: positive (winter), negative (summer)\n- air pollution: negative\n- water use: negative\n- biological activity (e.g., growing season length): positive\n- ice and snow: positive\nSummer heat islands can increase the demand for energy for air conditioning, which releases more heat into the air as well as greenhouse gas emissions, degrading local air quality.8 Higher urban temperatures in the daytime BLHI may increase the formation of urban smog, because both emissions of precursor pollutants and the atmospheric photochemical reaction rates increase.9,10 Heat islands may also directly impact human health by exacerbating heat stress during heat waves, especially in temperate areas, and by providing conditions suitable for the spread of vector-borne diseases.11,12\nBiological solutions for alleviating urban heat islands?\nThe understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying heat island formation provides a basis to develop controls that may promote or alleviate heat islands, but in some cases the application of these controls is difficult. For example, widespread change of the urban surface geometry by spacing buildings is usually not feasible. However, other strategies are possible— for example, using white or other light-colored roofs and pavement.\nA biologically related solution is to use vegetation to reduce urban heat. Vegetation provides important shading effects as well as cooling through evaporation. Some examples include:\n- Planting trees around individual buildings to shade urban surfaces to reduce their temperature, especially roofs and south-, east-, and west-facing walls. The reduction in surface temperature also leads to substantial reductions in energy use for air conditioning.\nTrees can also be used to shade roads and parking lots, which would otherwise become very hot during the day and which store heat for later release at night. Shading of vehicles in parking lots can reduce evaporative emissions from gasoline, which contribute to increased levels of urban ozone.\n“Green roofs” use living vegetation on roofs in order to help reduce heat accumulation of buildings. For example, the city of Chicago has more than 80 municipal and private green roofs as of June 2004, including the first municipal green roof in the country, the City Hall rooftop garden. A green roof is much cooler than a traditional roof because a significant fraction of the absorbed energy is used to evaporate water rather than to heat the roof and the overlying air.\nCreation of greenspace such as parks can be used to assist in cooling of neighborhoods,13,14 and an overall greening of the city can lead to a cooler urban atmosphere.15\nThese strategies can provide cost benefits. A building owner benefits from reduced energy consumption costs. Residents downwind of the urban area benefit from air quality improvements because:\n- pollutants are deposited on trees\n- greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions from air conditioning use are reduced\n- emissions of volatile organic compounds that contribute to urban smog are lessened\n- the rate of ozone formation is potentially reduced\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency has undertaken the Urban Heat Island Pilot Project as part of the Heat Island Reduction Initiative. Pilot cities include Baton Rouge, Chicago, Houston, Sacramento, and Salt Lake City.\nDo urban heat islands affect global climate?\nUrban heat islands themselves are not responsible for global warming because they are small-scale phenomena and cover only a tiny fraction of the Earth’s surface area. However, there are some urban to global scale connections that are worth noting:\nApproximately half of the world’s population currently lives in cities, and this value is expected to increase to 61% by 2030.16 The high rate of urbanization, particularly in the tropics, means that increasing numbers of people will be exposed to impacts resulting from heat islands in the future.\nUrban areas have historically been the site of some of the earliest established observation stations that are used to help construct the global surface temperature record used to document large scale climate changes. The effects of urbanization, and consequently urban heat islands, on these stations over time can lead to some “contamination” of the temperature record. The ability to fully remove these influences remains the subject of some debate since changes can occur independently of population17 and current techniques used to remove urban effects may be inadequate.17-19\nMost greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change come from urban areas. These emissions therefore contribute to both local and global scale weather and climate modification.20 Further urbanization will increase emissions originating from cities. Investigation of the larger scale impacts of urban emissions is seen as an important area of future research.20\nThe climate modifications that have occurred in large cities over the past century show similarities in terms of the rates and magnitude expected with projected future climate changes. Therefore cities may serve as a model for assessing the impacts of, and adaptation strategies to, climate change on both local and global scales.4\nThese factors underscore the importance of urban climates not only to the local environment but also to the state of the environment for the planet as a whole.\n© 2004, American Institute of Biological Sciences.

67	how does mindful meditation improve workplace empathy and what remote work security practices reduce cyber threats	Empathy-based mindfulness meditation, particularly metta meditation practiced for 10-20 minutes over three months, enhances compassion and empathy toward others at work. For remote work security, companies can reduce cyber threats through employee security training, ensuring proper system patching, implementing strong authentication methods, and establishing clear communication channels between employees and security teams.	['Want to create more trust in every corner of your organization? The strategy is simple: Start making more mindful choices.\nBy Kenneth M. Nowack, Ph.D., and Paul J. Zak, Ph.D.\nWe are, by our very nature, social creatures who are biased to feel greater safety with others most like us. Biases are automatic associations that may arise during interactions with others. Even though an association between a group and specific stereotypes may exist, it doesn’t mean you’ll necessarily behave with mistrust or intentional animosity toward others. But biases can and do cause unintentional, unfair, and discriminatory treatment of others.\nTo change behavior in yourself or in others, you need to be aware of biases and blind spots to make decisions and take actions in a purposeful manner. Here then, we offer a new model of bias, explain the neurological origins of many biases, and make evidence-based suggestions for facilitating what we call mindful choices (conscious bias) in the workplace.\nThe Bias Iceberg Model\nOur Bias Iceberg Model (Figure 1) expands on some of our recent research and provides a way to conceptualize the layers of bias that permeate all social interactions we have each day. The first level is activated by brain structures largely outside of conscious awareness and functions automatically, so we use the popular term “unconscious bias.” Its main purpose is to keep you alive and physiologically functioning by heightening defenses against real or imagined threats (e.g., fight-or-flight stress response).\nSign up for the monthly TalentQ Newsletter, an essential roundup of news and insights that will help you make critical talent decisions.\nWe call the second level “preconscious bias,” because while they also function automatically, they can be under our control with awareness, conscious effort, and practice. This can be done, for example, by slowing down your actions to assess if there might be negative consequences if your initial impulse is acted upon.\nFinally, we use the term of purposeful or “mindful choices” when you can reflect and act on the thoughts, feelings, and beliefs you’re aware of to guide interactions with others. Although work and life stressors mobilize a set of neurologic responses that activate automatically, we can nonetheless be more aware and purposeful with decisions and actions we make each day by embracing mindful choices.\nFigure 1: The Bias Iceberg\nUnconscious Bias and Neurobiological Drivers\nTrust and Empathy Bias\nOne of us (Zak) was among the first neuroscientists to demonstrate the neuroactive chemical oxytocin instantiates empathy and promotes prosocial behaviors. Oxytocin (OT) is an evolutionarily ancient molecule that’s a key part of the mammalian attachment system that allows us to form and nurture relationships of all types.\nZak’s group showed in numerous laboratory and field experiments that when you’re trusted, your brain produces OT in proportion to the amount of trust shown. Although there are indeed individual and situational differences, in general, OT reduces the innate bias we typically have when interacting with a stranger, signaling it’s safe and often profitable to engage.\nFurthermore, OT makes it feel good to cooperate with others. It does this by activating brain networks that potentiate the release of dopamine and serotonin, reinforcing the value your brain places on trusting a stranger.\nIntergroup Empathy Bias\nEmpathetic concern for others and empathetic distress when others suffer is biased toward those in your “in-group.” This bias has both genetic and learned components. From an evolutionary perspective, establishing solidarity with your primary social group increases the chances of surviving against predators and successfully reproducing. Today, each of us belongs to various tribes, clans, and groups from which we form “self-identities.” We typically relate well with those most like us and naturally avoid “outsiders” who might pose a physical or psychological threat to us.\nOT infusion studies that prime participants to have an in-group preference or out-group derogation have been published. However, recent investigations by Zak’s lab show individuals who experience an increase in endogenous OT have little or no bias toward out-group members. The exception was those who were strongly religious; their bias was reduced by OT, but not eliminated. The same holds true with OT infusion studies that don’t prime group biases; absent priming, they don’t arise. This finding supports the view that OT reduces in-group biases, especially when taking the perspective of others is required.\nResearch by John Lanzetta at Dartmouth University investigated psychophysiological, behavioral, and psychological effects during interpersonal interactions. His research showed competitive relationships reduce empathy, while cooperative settings enhance compassion. For example, psychophysiological measures indicated participants in his study had little distress when viewing a painful shock of a competitor, but were distressed when seeing the competitor experience joy.\nThis finding is supported by research by David Eagleman at Stanford University, who measured neural responses using fMRI while people watched six hands being stabbed with a needle. This triggered empathetic responses for those in the same, but not different, religious group.\nAs in the Zak study, participants who strongly identified with their religion demonstrated a significantly higher neural response to empathy for the pain of those in their own religious affiliation and a reduced empathetic response to seeing a label identifying the hand as being from another religious group.\nOther studies, such as those by Xiaojing Xu and colleagues from the Department of Psychology at Peking University, have also demonstrated similar neural ingroup/outgroup empathy responses based on race and culture.\nIn addition, there exists evidence for outgroup homogeneity bias. In this bias, we tend to perceive out-group members as homogenous compared to our own in-group members (i.e., we see more variation and appreciate individual differences more in our own in-groups). The open question for leaders of organizations and teams is how to decrease the gap in empathy between in-groups and out-groups that might exist naturally in companies, as well as enhance our understanding and appreciation of the differences within our out-group members.\nPreconscious Bias and Personality Drivers\nThe Playing Well with Others Bias\nIt’s known that two genes, CD38 and CD157, largely regulate the release of oxytocin. Anne Chong and colleagues at the National University of Singapore studied the social skills of 1,300 healthy young Chinese adults. They found individuals with higher gene expressions of CD38 and variations in CD157 displayed greater sociality (e.g., preferring activities involving other people over being alone), had better communication, and showed empathy-related skills compared with other participants.\nThe higher expression of the CD38 gene and differences in the CD157 gene sequence explained 14 percent of the differences in “how well participants played with others.” These findings show social behaviors are truly a mix of nature and nurture. The expression of these genes can be affected by your life events, as can situations that cause oxytocin (and the amounts released), directly influencing empathy and collaboration with others.\nThe Playing Poorly with Others Bias\nPrevious research by one of us (Zak) found that approximately 3 to 5 percent of individuals who were entrusted with money by a stranger failed to have the expected increase in OT. As a result, they didn’t reciprocate by being trustworthy, keeping all or most of the money they had been sent. About half of these unconditional non-reciprocators have quite unusual personality traits. (The other half, meanwhile, are having a bad day; high levels of stress hormones inhibit the release of OT and thereby prosocial actions.)\nThe clinical prevalence of “dark side” personality disorders (characterized as a disregard for right and wrong, persistent lying and expressing cynicism, grandiosity, and disrespect for others) is estimated at 1.5 to 2 percent of the population. Twin studies indicate a genetic influence in the disorder, but childhood trauma is also a contributing factor. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder are seldom remediated, and it’s best to get them out of your organization as soon as possible so the cancer of callousness doesn’t metastasize.\nThe Diversity of Teams and Testosterone Bias\nRecent evidence has shown diverse teams are more productive than homogenous teams. But unconscious bias can still slip into the mix and negate the value of diversity. Modupe Akinola and colleagues at Columbia Business School discovered that testosterone levels of individual team members predicted team success. In diverse groups (culture, background, and age), high testosterone was associated with reduced performance by enhancing conflict and competition.\nHowever, groups that lacked cultural diversity and had high testosterone performed significantly better than lower-testosterone groups as the additional energy of testosterone was focused on reaching group goals. Exercises that build relationships in diverse groups may be able to reduce in-group competition and focus the high-energy of testosterone toward meeting the group’s objectives.\nHow to Overcome Bias and Create High Trust and Empathy Cultures\nInclusion for everyone at work is a necessity, as is reducing bias and increasing diversity. However, some recent studies, summaries, and comprehensive reviews including the Equality and Human Rights Commissionhave highlighted the shortcomings and relative ineffectiveness of diversity and inclusion training to modify attitudes, change behaviors, and enhance trust in teams and organizations. Here are few ways that individuals and organizations can address some aspects of the Bias Iceberg and simultaneously build cultures of high empathy and trust.\nBias-busting tip #1: Become more aware of how fear impacts you. By increasing your own self-awareness about your thoughts, emotions, and reactions to fears, you can begin to modify those evolutionary automatic survival behaviors to those more consciously displayed toward others within the Bias Iceberg levels. Understanding and reflecting on your own learned bias and honestly clarifying the stereotypes you have about others is an important first step to beginning your journey to more mindful and conscious prosocial behaviors with members of your out-group.\nBias-busting tip #2: Practice empathy-based mindfulness meditation. One approach to tame your fears and enhance your compassion and empathy toward others involves the practice of mindfulness meditation. Not all forms of meditation activate the same neural pathways, nor lead to the same outcomes (much like some types of exercise increases aerobic capacity and other types increase strength and muscle mass). The most effective type of meditation to enhance empathy and compassion is known as metta or loving-kindness meditation.\nIn this form of mindfulness meditation, participants are asked to think of someone they love for 10 to 20 minutes for three months and focus on feelings of care, compassion, and affection toward that person. They’re also typically asked to do the same for people they don’t know very well, and for people with whom they don’t get along.\nBias-busting tip #3: Practice empathy-based perspective-taking. It’s thought that by having employees practice taking another person’s perspective (e.g., asking employees to imagine for a moment they’re another person, walking through the world in their shoes, and seeing the world through their eyes), this increased awareness of others will directly translate to improvement in appreciation and caring of others.\nWhen employees are adept at perspective-taking, they’ll treat others more “self-like,” activating areas of the brain associated with self-focus and self-reflection (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex; vMPFC). Exercises focused on perspective-taking appear to blur the distinction between self and others, enhancing empathetic concern and possibly even reducing unconscious bias and overt prejudice.\nBias-busting tip #4: Encourage healthy lifestyle practices in employees. Interventions aimed at enhancing employee psychological health and well-being of employees could also offer some possible ways to impact empathy, collaboration, and caring in organizations. For example, those of us who lack adequate sleep at night lose our capacity to treat others with caring, empathy and kindness. Additionally, fatigued and chronically stressed employees have a neurological handicap, increasing our biases and interfering with sound decision making and judgment in dealing with others.\nWhen faced with perceived injustice from others, current research supports using exercise as a beneficial coping tool. When employees are faced with leaders who lack sensitivity, caring, and empathy, being physically active might be a useful coping technique to minimize the impact of such toxic behaviors on both performance and well-being when few other options exist.\nBias-busting tip #5: Create, reinforce, and support a culture of appreciation. One important interpersonal leadership skill directly associated with perceptions of empathy and trust is appreciation toward employees. Appreciation at work (e.g., communicating that you value someone else; unconditionally acknowledging another person as an individual; acknowledging performance, qualities, or behavior of others) directly affects employee well-being.\nAppreciation is about acknowledging a person’s inherent value rather than focusing on a person’s efforts or accomplishments, and this is something leaders can model and display daily, even with our current work-from-home situation.\nBias-busting tip #6: Create team and organizational empathy-oriented norms. Leaders and teams that create empathy-related norms of behavior enhance greater collaboration, effective communication, and psychological safety. At the organization level, it’s important to share values around empathy and tolerance for differences in the workplace in the initial interview, selection, and onboarding processes with both internal and external job candidates.\nMake the Choice\nWhen your brain produces oxytocin while interacting with others, you’re evolutionarily primed and motivated to cooperate and collaborate with others. Infusing people with oxytocin results in marked reduction in fear-associated brain activity. This generally enhances psychological safety and prosocial behaviors except in people with certain socially maladaptive personality disorders. For most people and situations, oxytocin in the brain increases empathy and facilitates giving and helping behaviors.\nThis explains why we cooperate with those who appear trustworthy and safe, yet our survival instinct means we’re also unconsciously biased toward those who seem different. When people are primed to view others as different, psychological safety is diminished resulting in decreased collaboration.\nRecent research from one of our labs (Zak) has shown that even taking a few minutes to get to better understand and know others can induce your brain to release oxytocin. This melts the self-other divide, increasing both empathy and cooperation. Reflecting on the Bias Iceberg model before you say or do something reflexively can raise awareness that mindful biases promote greater fairness, inclusion, and support of diversity in the workplace.\nKenneth M.

(Nasdaq: CRWD), a Sunnyvale-based firm that now has a $55 billion market cap, started in Orange County where it still has a large local presence. Irvine’s Cylance sold for about $1.4 billion to BlackBerry in 2019 and also counts a base of operations here.\nIn Newport Beach, the ioXt Alliance started by Mobilitie founder Gary Jabara, wants to make sure the interconnections among the various devices used each day—such as cellphones, smart home lighting controls and automotive technology—are also secure.\nUC Irvine’s Cybersecurity Policy & Research Institute studies ways to make the internet and networks safer, including running mock attack drills. Cybercriminals\nIrvine-based Netwrix Corp. is expanding so quickly that it’s made four acquisitions since January.\n“Most organizations did not have time to prepare a transition plan and provide security training to the employees” when they started working from home last year, said Ilia Sotnikov, security strategist and vice president at Netwrix.\n“Hence the increase in reported incidents that included data loss or oversharing.”\nAttackers know that ransomware is arguably the quickest way to get money from a company without breaking into its system, he said.\n“The cybercriminals took advantage of the global pandemic and highly divisive political scene in the U.S. last year,” Sotnikov said. “We’ve seen considerable changes in how the threat landscape evolved over the last couple years with ransomware as a service, more specialized groups.”\nThe Coronavirus Chaos\n“There was so much chaos during the first few months of the lockdown that every CISO will need to go back and review all of the access and changes that happened,” said Bil Harmer, who is the chief information security officer (CISO) and chief evangelist at computer identity security software maker SecureAuth.\n“When there is chaos and change, the threat actors will be there looking for ways in.”\nHe predicted that companies “will begin putting more and more focus on digital identities and a continuous authentication methodology that will allow them to adjust access on the fly as the landscape or the user behavior changes.”\nCisoshare, founded by Gentile, placed No. 21 on this year’s Business Journal list of Best Places to Work in Orange County and No. 2 on last year’s list of fastest-growing companies, both in the small-firm category.\nCompanies who let employees work from their homes face an increasing threat level similar to that of an apartment owner who adds more apartments to a portfolio: the more units there are, the greater the business risks, Gentile said.\n“When employees are working from home, it expands the digital footprint and perimeter of the organization,” Gentile said during a recent interview.\nProviding security also requires using precious resources and talent—both of which are in short supply at plenty of companies, Gentile said.\n“The majority of security risk lives in the cracks when people don’t effectively collaborate and ‘cover all the bases’ when building something,” he said.\nTraining on workstations from which a network is accessed can reduce the risks when employees work from home in a decentralized environment, Gentile said.\nCompanies that opt for a “hybrid” model combining both work-from-home and the office should be wary.\n“Hybrid can be risky due to any time rules change, there is a higher likelihood of mistakes,” Kevin McDonald, the chief operating officer and chief information security officer of Alvaka Networks in Irvine lists 16 points of vulnerability. They include use of bootlegged software, browsing illicit sites, opening infected files that would otherwise be blocked, communicating with unverified individuals and illegal sharing of various contraband such as movies, images, and games.\n“Gambling, pornography, sports, gaming sites, alternative bulletin boards, messengers, even terrorism and extremist sites lead to infections of the host that then connects to the company,” he said.\n“We all suffer from a bit of that-won’t-happen-to-me syndrome. We’re not a target, we don’t have anything they want, we’re not that rich of a company.”\nHe says ransomware attackers are well aware of the potential payoffs: “One hit and you can retire.”\nCompanies are starting to nudge employees into coming to their offices though the daily back-and-forth from the COVID-19 Delta variant makes it difficult to set firm guidelines.\nFor example, data analytics software maker Alteryx Inc. has “voluntarily opened a number of our offices, including our Irvine location for those who are comfortable coming in,” Chief Financial Officer Kevin Rubin said on Aug. 5. “There’s no mandate that they do.”\n“We will more officially begin asking associates to start coming back no sooner than January,” he added.\nSotnikov sees some bright spots.\n“I think many of the WFH (work-from-home) specific dangers were mitigated over the last 12 months, as organizations had a chance to catch their breath, get new budgets in 2021, catch up on trainings for both admins and employees,” he said.\nThe Senate included more than $1.9 billion in cybersecurity funds as part of the roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, The Hill website said on Aug. 10.\nThe funds will go toward securing critical infrastructure against attacks, helping vulnerable organizations defend themselves and providing funding for a key federal cyber office, among other initiatives.\nExperts point to the targeting of Colonial Pipeline and JBS meat packers earlier this year as examples of the dangers of ransomware demands.\nThe picture is acute on the international front, with both Sotnikov and McDonald noting President Joe Biden’s warning last month that a significant cyber-attack on the U.S. could lead to “a real shooting war” with a major power, highlighting the growing threats posed by Russia and China.\n“That is a very aggressive and provocative statement,” McDonald said. He points to China in particular as he surveys global cybersecurity threats to the U.S.\n“I should be worried about China finally deciding it’s time to become the sole world power and using its understanding of our weak infrastructure to show us how much we don’t really have control of the world anymore,” McDonald said.\nAnd the ultimate piece of bad news?\n“Replacements are made in China,” he said.\nDangers, Positive Signs: OC Cybersecurity Experts Look at Internet Risks\nOC Cybersecurity Experts Give the Business Journal These Tips:\nKEVIN MCDONALD, chief operating officer/chief information security officer, Alvaka Networks in Irvine\nSome dangers are “removed or reduced” if the equipment is owned by the employer.\n“Employee-owned computers are far less likely to be patched and kept up-to-date against vulnerability. This includes the operating systems, office applications, third party applications such as Adobe, Internet browsers, etc.\n“Having a system shared with non-employees (of unknown behavior tendency, character, education, intent) means that there is a high potential for risky behaviors that can result in a compromised local computer.\n“Big time execs and powerful people are targets and they’re the most reticent to participate in this whole process.\n“Cryptocurrency is the “primary reason” for the rise in ransomware in which hackers hijack a computer system and demand payment to release it.”\nMIKE GENTILE, founder/chief executive, Cisoshare in San Clemente\nThe biggest risk to work from home or hybrid for security “is that collaboration and effective small team dynamics are hindered when people can’t work together in person.”\n“The good news is that some of the strongest safeguards when a workforce is decentralized is a strong security training and awareness program, as well as a communication system so employees know how to get in touch with the security team and vice versa. Both of these items are highly effective, but also much more inexpensive than almost all technical safeguards.”\nBIL HARMER, chief information security officer/chief evangelist, SecureAuth in Irvine\n“The hybrid model will not go away, there is far too much upside for companies in it. From 48 extra minutes per day per employee in productivity to reduced footprints in the office (desks, power, coffee, etc), this is a model that will continue.\n“Companies will begin moving to Secure Identity as the first line of defense. They will begin putting more and more focus on digital identities and a continuous authentication methodology that will allow them to adjust access on the fly as the landscape or the user behavior changes.\n“This will allow the user to move around the physical world and have their authentication and authorization adjust as they do to keep them within the acceptable risk profile.”']	['<urn:uuid:d8fb3810-4599-4c31-94cb-6de74bc213c2>', '<urn:uuid:ad45c4f6-8fbd-4d17-b17d-404d81708d47>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	16	52	3984
68	terrarium humidity vs hermit crab tank humidity levels differences setup	Terrariums and hermit crab tanks have different humidity requirements and setups. For terrariums, condensation is normal and creates a mini tropical rainforest environment, with water cycling naturally inside. For hermit crab tanks, specific humidity levels of 70-80 percent must be maintained using methods like substrate dampening and air misting. Both environments require monitoring - terrariums show excess moisture through foggy glass that requires opening the container for evaporation, while hermit crab tanks need a hygrometer to track humidity since levels below 70% can cause the crabs to suffocate as their gills dry out.	['If you have a natural skill for gardening but you don’t have enough space to actually do it, you could consider making a terrarium instead. A terrarium offers great benefits. It can humidify air during winter, improve your indoor air quality, give your creativity an outlet and reduce anxiety. Terrariums are easy to create and maintain. They can even turn into a family project.\nThis is a guest post by Melissa Lobo from Project Female, more information on the author can be found at the end of the article.\nWhat You’ll Need For Your Terrarium\n- A clear glass container: It could be anything you like – a mason jar, a rare beauty from an antique store; lidded or open. However, the taller your container, the better. An old coffee pot also makes a great container.\n- Miniature rocks: You could use bagged pea gravel or expanded shale that you can find in plant nurseries.\n- Activated charcoal: You can find it at box stores or nurseries.\n- Peat or sphagnum moss: This can also be found at nurseries and box stores.\n- Potting soil: Consider using high-quality soil that is specially intended for plant containers.\n- A miniature spade\n- A mist bottle\n- Plants: Choose your plants on the basis of your container – open or closed? For an open container, succulents can basically survive anything, so they’re an easy choice for beginners. On the other hand, a closed container needs moisture-resistant plants like small palms, ferns or orchids.\nNow You’re Ready To Set Up Your Terrarium\nStep 1: Prepare Your Container\nClean the container thoroughly, inside and out, and remove any price tags. This is to ensure that there are no chemicals or substances that can hinder the healthy growth of your plants.\nStep 2: Add The Rocks And Pebbles\nAfter preparing the container, place the pebbles and the rocks inside. This will serve as drainage. Water can settle under the rocks and pebbles, thereby preventing flooding. The thickness of the pebbles and rocks will be dependent on your container size. The ideal depth should be half an inch to two inches.\nStep 3: Place The Activated Charcoal Inside The Container\nExpect this part of the process to be a bit messy. Activated charcoal comes in the form of shards or minute granules. Remember that you only need a small amount, just enough to cover the pebbles and rocks. What it actually does is improve the environmental condition of your terrarium, eliminating odor, fungi and bacteria.\nStep 4: Add The Soil\nBear in mind that the type of soil you use in a terrarium depends upon your plants. For instance, if you are using tropical plants, soil from tropical areas is best to use. The depth of the soil should be enough for your plants to take root\nStep 5: Do Some Planting!\nTake out the plants from their pots and make sure that you’re not damaging the roots. Be gentle while you’re doing this. If the roots are too long, you could probably trim them. Position the roots inside the container using a pencil, brush end, spoon or your fingers. Put more soil on the top and compress the soil around the plant base. Continue to add more plants in the container, but do not place plants near the edges as far as possible. This is to prevent the leaves from touching the sides as the plants grow.\nStep 6: Accessorize Your Terrarium\nAfter the plants are positioned inside the jar, you may add some accessories to your terrarium. These accessories can include moss blanket, figurines, unused toys, metal objects, stones, sticks, and rocks. Use accessories to make your own little world in there.\nStep 7: Find A Place For Your Terrarium\nAfter you’re done creating your little garden, it is now time to find the perfect spot for your terrarium. This is a bit challenging, since you need to ensure that the plants receive a good amount of indirect sunlight. For the plants to grow optimally, it is best to choose a location that is near a window that faces the east. Morning light is enough for most plants. Moreover, plant metabolism is more active in the morning. On the other hand, spots near windows that face the north offer poor light, so avoid putting your terrarium there.\nA couple of things you really should keep in mind when you’re figuring out where to keep your terrarium:\n- Don’t keep it near an air vent.\n- Position the terrarium at eye level or higher. You get a much better view of it from the side than from the top.\nStep 8: Maintain Your Terrarium\nAfter a couple of weeks, assess your terrarium to see if it needs more water, or if water is pooling at the bottom. If it’s too dry, add more water. If it is too wet, open the container for a day and allow the water to evaporate. If the interior of your container is foggy, that means that there’s too much water.\nCondensation, however, is normal in a terrarium. In a closed terrarium, the entire water cycle happens in miniature Trapped moisture will condensate inside the terrarium and water will drip inside the glass. Therefore, you have now created a mini tropical rainforest environment.\nAnother thing you need to do in order to maintain your terrarium is to rotate it a quarter turn every week or two so that all plants can receive enough light. This also prevents your plants from growing only in one direction.\nLosing a plant or two inside your terrarium is normal, so don’t be too guilty about it. You can always replace it. Find the same plant again or try something new.\nIf you don’t have access to outdoor gardening, creating an indoor garden that can be placed on your table is a great alternative. The small worlds that are formed by plants, rocks, moss, and other materials inside a terrarium can be both fascinating and inspiring. Terrariums are not just convenient and easy to care for, they’re also a pleasure to look at and admire.\nIf you enjoyed this post, you may also be interested in Turning an Old Tyre into an Amazing Pond.', 'Table of Contents\nHow To Keep Humidity Up In A Hermit Crab Tank? Maintain proper humidity levels in your tank by dampening the substrate and misting the air inside the tank, as needed. Use a hygrometer to keep relative humidity levels at 70 to 80 percent. Proper humidity levels will also help keep your hermit crabs warm.26 Sept 2017\nHow humid should a hermit crab tank be? around 70 to 80 percent\nThey need a relative humidity of around 70 to 80 percent. Because this is so important to the crabs, it is worth investing in a humidity meter, known as a hygrometer, which you can find in the reptile section of the pet store.\nHow do I raise the humidity in my tank? The best way to help keep your cage at the proper humidity levels is to spray the cage once or twice a day with room temperature water. You can used a hand held spray bottle, or a pressure sprayer with a gentle mist. Lightly mist the entire enclosure, including the animal, substrate, and cage walls.\nCan humidity be too high for hermit crabs? Re: Humidity too high\nHow To Keep Humidity Up In A Hermit Crab Tank – Related Questions\nCan hermit crabs eat bananas?\nFoods to Feed\nHow do you check the humidity in a snake tank?\nSo you need to do some research to find out what your particular snake needs.\nNext, you should invest in a quality hygrometer (a thermometer-like device used to measure humidity levels) and put it in the room where your snake cage is located.\nYou might also consider placing a smaller hygrometer inside the cage itself.\nCan mold kill hermit crabs?\nMold is very dangerous to crabs and can kill them.\nWhat is the white stuff in my hermit crab’s cage?\nIt’s likely high humidity from the eco earth causing the growth. Crabs need 70% or more to breathe properly, so it can’t be lowered by much. Moist substrate helps with keeping humidity, but the reason for moistening it is so they can create tunnels and molting caves that don’t collapse.\nHow often should I spray my hermit crab?\nCheck the humidity of your hermit crab enclosure several times a day, and mist at least once per day.\nIs 99% humidity too high for hermit crabs?\nInstall a hygrometer to track humidity, which should be at 70-80%.\nIf the humidity falls below 70%, any hermit crabs in the enclosure will essentially begin to slowly suffocate as their modified gills dry out.\nWhat happens if hermit crab tank is too humid?\nWhile hermits normally can handle high humidity, too high can make it difficult for the hermits too breathe and has the potential to cause gill infection. It can also throw off the delicate balance of shell water and lead to streaking.\nDo hermit crabs like to be handled?\nDon’t pick them up every day\nHow do you know if a hermit crab likes you?\nLand hermit crabs make great and perfect pets and have a personality of their own, just like you. They can be very shy or very friendly. As they get to know you they will warm up to you. Usually they are not mean but if they have been mistreated they can act mean.\nCan hermit crabs learn their names?\nHere’s another reason to invest in a pet hermit crab–they can do tricks! If you are an attentive owner capable of patient training, your hermit crab can respond to the sound of its name, “talk” to you and even walk on a leash! Read on to learn more.\nIs bottled water safe for hermit crabs?\nBoth the saltwater and freshwater need to be treated with water-conditioning fluid to neutralize any chlorine in the water — city water contains chlorine, which is toxic to hermit crabs.\nYou may also choose to use bottled spring water instead of water from your tap to avoid chlorine exposure.\nWhat should you not feed hermit crabs?\nIn general, avoid onion, garlic and citrus. When picking any kind of dried meat it is critical to look at the ingredient list for a pesticide called Ethoxyquin. It is a common preservative in many commercial hermit crab and fish foods and is poisonous to your crabs.\nCan hermit crabs have babies?\nHermit crab babies hatch from eggs. Mama Crab carries them around until they change color from a rusty brown to light blue, at which point they’ve finished developing. Many animals have more than one offspring at a time, but hermit crabs, have many in one effort.26 Sept 2017\nHow often should I mist my snake tank?\nI mist about once or twice a week for my one 20 gal tank, and I mist 2-3 times a day during shed.\nI dont have to mist my racks at all except once a day during shed.\nIs too much humidity bad for a snake?\nSnakes usually live in a more humid, warmer environment. The natural moisture in the air helps their skin and respiratory tract to stay moist. Snakes are far more accepting of too much humidity than too little. But, if a snake’s tank is too moist, this can cause scale rot (blister disease.)\nWhere does the hygrometer go in a snake tank?\nWhen installing a hygrometer in a terrarium you should make sure that it is neither too close to the water basin or waterfalls nor too close to the bottom. The humidity displayed on the hygrometer would be too high in the area of influence of the water, also if you have reptiles that need a humid bottom.\nIs 50 humidity too high for bearded dragon?\nBearded dragons need humidity levels of around 30-40%.\nAnything above 50-60% is too high.']	['<urn:uuid:a844854c-2844-4540-b703-507583c651ec>', '<urn:uuid:4aa9c355-5ca7-45a6-859c-4f1c6eb029f3>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	10	93	1997
69	eye membrane treatment natural healing vs surgical removal what happens	There are two possible paths for epiretinal membrane treatment. In some cases, spontaneous release (natural healing) of the membrane can occur - this was observed in 14 eyes out of 604 patients in one study. The membrane can peel off by itself by contracting and rolling from the inferior side, sometimes aided by vitreous traction. Alternatively, surgical removal through pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) may be necessary, especially when complications arise. During PPV, surgeons use microsurgical instruments to remove the vitreous and peel off the membrane. The choice between watchful waiting versus surgery depends on the severity of the condition and presence of complications like macular holes.	['Long-term evaluation of spontaneous release of epiretinal membrane and its possible pathogenesis\nAuthors Kida T, Morishita S, Fukumoto M, Sato T, Oku H, Ikeda T\nReceived 18 July 2017\nAccepted for publication 11 August 2017\nPublished 1 September 2017 Volume 2017:11 Pages 1607—1610\nChecked for plagiarism Yes\nReview by Single-blind\nPeer reviewers approved by Dr Colin Mak\nPeer reviewer comments 4\nEditor who approved publication: Dr Scott Fraser\nTeruyo Kida,1 Seita Morishita,2 Masanori Fukumoto,1 Takaki Sato,1 Hidehiro Oku,1 Tsunehiko Ikeda1\n1Department of Ophthalmology, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, 2Department of Ophthalmology, Osaka Kaisei Hospital, Osaka, Japan\nPurpose: To investigate the characteristics in spontaneous release of epiretinal membrane (ERM) during watchful waiting and to introduce a possible mechanism of pathogenesis as a photo essay.\nMethods: Records from all patients with ERM were obtained from Osaka Medical College Hospital from January 2001 to October 2012. Visual acuity (VA), fundus photo, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were reviewed using the medical records. For statistical analysis, VA measured with a Landolt chart was converted to the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR). To investigate the pathogenesis of ERM, tryptase activity in vitreous, which plays a role in tissue fibrosis and remodeling, was measured in patients that underwent a vitrectomy for ERM, macular hole, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).\nResults: ERM was observed in 604 patients and spontaneous release of the ERM was observed in 13 patients with 14 eyes (four males and nine females, aged 33–78 years). Among the 14 eyes, mean VA did not change significantly through the release of the ERMs (0.17±0.18 before and 0.24±0.40 after release, P=0.544). Nine eyes showed posterior vitreous detachment or vitreomacular traction on OCT images and five eyes did not. ERM was released in five eyes with no accompanying vitreous traction by OCT during watchful waiting and seems to have peeled off by itself by contracting and rolling from the inferior side. Three eyes with deteriorated VA underwent vitrectomy due to macular hole or pseudomacular hole. Vitreal tryptase activity was significantly higher in patients with ERM compared to those with PDR (P<0.05).\nConclusion: Fundus photos of ERM auto-peeling were taken during long-term follow-up. Spontaneous release of ERM is possibly involved in vitreous traction or membrane contraction. In addition, tryptase may be involved in the development and contraction of ERM.\nKeywords: epiretinal membrane, auto-peeling, contraction, pathogenesis, tryptase, internal limiting membrane\nThis work is published and licensed by Dove Medical Press Limited.

During this procedure, the vitreous is removed and usually replaced with a balance salt solution. Depending on the need for the surgery, the vitreous may also be replaced by either Gas, Silicone oil or a high density Silicone oil. The whole procedure may take between 30 to 90 minutes.\nThe term pars plana, implies that the surgery is performed in the deeper parts of the eyeball i.e behind the crystalline lens.\nTogether with PPV, other procedures may be performed as the need arises. Such procedures are:\n- Membranectomy (peeling) - removal of layers of unhealthy tissue from the retina with minute instruments such as forceps (tiny grasping tools), picks (miniature hooks), and visco-discection (separating layers or tissue with jets of fluid.)\n- Fluid-gas exchange - injection of gas into the eye such as sulphur hexafluoride or perfluoropropane to hold the retina in place or temporarily seal off holes in the retina. These gases disappear spontaneously once they have accomplished their purpose.\n- Silicone oil injection - filling of the eye with liquid silicone to hold the retina in place in a number of cases.\n- Endophotocoagulation - laser treatment to seal off holes in the retina or to shrink unhealthy, damaging blood vessels which grow in some diseases such as diabetes.\n- Scleral buckling - placement of a support positioned like a belt around the walls of the eyeball to maintain the retina in a proper, attached position.\n- Lensectomy - removal of the lens in the eye when it is cloudy (cataract) or if it is attached to scar tissue.\nWhen is Vitrectomy surgery indicated?\nPPV is indicated in the following cases:\n- Removal of scar tissue that may be growing on the vitreous or the surface of the retina. It can pull on the retina and cause a retina detachment.\n- Haemorrhage (blood) that prevents the passage of light through the eye to the retina:\n- Diabetic traction retinopathy – bleeding and scar tissue forming in the eye of a diabetic patient:\n- Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachments:\n- Proliferative vitreoretinopathy – formation of scar tissue following severe retina detachment:\n- Infection inside the eye (endophthalmitis):\n- Epiretinal Membranes:\n- Macular Hole surgery:\n- Intraocular foreign body:\n- Complications following cataract surgery:\n- Trauma related.\nHow is PPV performed?\nPars Plana Vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is usually performed under local anaesthesia. In some severe cases, general anaesthesia may also be needed.\nDuring the procedure, microsurgical instruments will be inserted into the eyeball via 3 small incisions (measuring about 2-3mm) that is made through the sclera (white of the eye). A number of instruments may be used during the procedure to removed the vitreous gel and any scar tissues that may have formed on the retinal surfaces. A laser probe can also be inserted during the procedure.\nDepending on the complexity of the cases, other procedures may be combined with the PPV. Theses includes scleral buckling, cryopexy, and endotamponades (eg Silicone oil or gases).The entire surgery may take up between 45 minutes to 2 hours to complete.\nThe visual outcomes following a PPV is largely depended on the severity and complexity of the case. If your eye problem caused permanent damage to your retina before the vitrectomy, then the improvement following surgery may not be great. Surgery is sometimes performed to save the eye only, rather than to achieve an improvement in vision.']	['<urn:uuid:3d73c973-6218-4edf-bfdd-cfb5c8e9ef32>', '<urn:uuid:c7fce643-0961-4665-81f1-2775cbbdf4b2>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	10	106	1108
70	What role does marine life play in both protecting endangered species and developing nutritional supplements for human health?	Marine life serves dual purposes. For protecting endangered species, there are ongoing projects under EMFAF to protect vulnerable Elasmobranchs (Skates and Rays) species and reduce interaction between net fisheries and wildlife like seals, porpoise, and dolphin. For human health, marine organisms produce unique substances that can be used as food ingredients with health benefits. For example, Bio-marine Ingredients Ireland has developed a soluble protein hydrolysate powder from blue whiting fish that may improve muscular health in elderly people.	['The Marine Institute will be exhibiting at the Irish Skipper Expo on the 24th and 25th February 2023 at the University of Limerick. The Marine Institute will have exhibition stands on shellfish assessment and advice and on research projects to understand and help manage the impacts of seafood production on marine biodiversity. The work in both cases is funded by the EMFF (European Maritime and Fisheries Fund), its successor EMFAF (European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund) and Irish Government.\nThe Shellfish team will showcase to industry the work it carries out on data collection, assessment and advice on shellfish. The newly published Shellfish Stocks and Fisheries Review 2022 will be available in hard copy and online. The industry provides much of the data included in these assessments and it is an opportunity to discuss inputs and outputs into this important programme for the inshore fishing fleet in Ireland. Data are reported for all the major shellfish species that the inshore fishing fleet rely on.\nThe EMFF (European Maritime and Fisheries Fund) Marine Biodiversity Scheme team will showcase to industry research work being undertaken to help support the protection and preservation of marine biodiversity and to contribute to the fulfilment of Ireland’s obligations under EU Natura Directives. Marine Institute staff will be available to assist with information on the implementation of the EMFF and the new EMFAF (European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund) Operational Programmes and the projects they support; NATURA and environmental legislation and biodiversity, fisheries and aquaculture impacts and, species and habitat protection and restoration.\nCompliance with the Habitats and Birds Directives requires ongoing public investment to identify potential risks from fisheries and aquaculture to designated habitats and species in Natura 2000 sites, to reduce those risks through management or other measures and to monitor and report on these mitigation measures and on the status of protected habitats and species. Likewise, the impact of fisheries on species and habitats needs to be more fully understood in order to inform the implementation of effective mitigation measures under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) programme of measures.\nContinuing on from EMFF the new EMFAF has many projects underway, including a project of strategic importance on the management of the crayfish fishery to restore the crayfish stocks and protect critically endangered species. The work programme addresses the by-catch of endangered species, reducing interaction between net fisheries and wildlife (seals, porpoise, dolphin) and contributing to restoration of crayfish stocks so that pot fishing becomes viable.\nSpeaking about the work undertaken by the Marine Institute to support both marine biodiversity and sustainable seafood production, Ciaran Kelly Director of Fisheries, Ecosystems Advisory Services at the Marine Institute said, “Resolving these issues is not only about the protection of biodiversity but also the restoration of the fish stocks. This Project of Strategic Importance to Ireland and the EU aims to provide solutions to developing a management plan reducing pressures on threatened species while protecting a viable crayfish fishery.”\nIreland’s Programme under the EMFAF Biodiversity scheme to date includes projects\nto: Protect and restore vulnerable Elasmobranchs (Skates and Rays) species, to expand Ecosystem data collection on Irish fisheries surveys in support of MSFD, Natura and Habitat mapping; to address data gaps under MSFD indicator 6 on food webs by undertaking Continuous Plankton Recorder plankton analyses. Ireland has also proposed projects to provide appropriate assessments of interactions between aquaculture activities and Natura features (species and habitats) in Special Areas of Conservation. This work underpins the evidence basis for licencing decisions supporting the sustainable development of coastal aquaculture and its interactions with sensitive freshwater habitats and species, such as Atlantic salmon.\nThe EMFAF Marine Biodiversity Scheme is co-funded by the Irish Government and the European Maritime Fisheries & Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) 2021-2027. The Scheme is established under Priority 1 (Sustainable Fisheries) and Priority 2 (Sustainable Aquaculture) of Ireland’s Operational Programme (OP) under the EMFAF.', 'Fish have long been part of the human diet and often considered as ‘brain food’. Recent research in this area suggests that eating fish is good for early brain development and may also prevent many brain-related conditions.\nOur ocean may also offer a vast resource of new substances that could lead to new food products with human health benefits. As marine organisms live in complex habitats and are exposed to extreme conditions, they produce a wide variety of specific substances that cannot be found elsewhere.\nMany marine organisms could be a potential reservoir for chemical compounds that may be used as food ingredients which could offer human health benefits.\nIn 2018, Bio-marine Ingredients Ireland (BII) in collaboration with Dublin College University and University of Limerick, were awarded funding of €200,000 under the Marine Institute’s Industry-Led Awards Scheme to conduct research with the goal of developing a new health supplement based on blue whiting fish protein.\nUnder this research project, BII has produced a soluble protein hydrolysate powder, which may be rich in nutrients and vitamins to improve the muscular health of elderly people.\nDecreased muscular strength and muscle wasting are of concern in the elderly population. Muscle loss can be significant enough to cause weakness, increase fall risk, and limit a person’s independence and decrease quality of life.\nThe next stage of the research project, will include a clinical study at Dublin College University with healthy elderly subjects taking the nutritional supplements alongside an 8-12 week physical exercise program.\nBlood samples will be assessed before and after the clinical study to indicate the level of healthy muscle metabolism. The impact of the soluble protein hydrolysate powder on muscle metabolism will be assessed using human muscle cells at the University of Limerick.\nBII extracts proteins, oil and calcium from fish caught in the Atlantic for use in food ingredients and nutrition products. BII is a joint venture between Irish fishing vessel owners and Norwegian partners who are experts in marine ingredients. In Lough Egish, Co Monaghan, BII have built the most advanced, food-grade, bio-refinery in the world.\nDr Snehal Gite, Senior Research and Development Technologist at BII said, “We are one of the first companies globally to take under-utilised raw fish materials and transform them into powders suited to applications for human nutrition.\n“At BII, we are processing a low value Blue Whiting fish into a high value nutritional ingredient which could offer enormous benefits for skeletal health in older people. The outcome of this research project could see BII enter a valuable global market, which will ultimately benefit Irish fishermen, industry and the associated supply chain.”\nThe successful outcome of this project could see the introduction of a new Irish health ingredient into a global market worth €12.4 billion. In developing value added products from fish biomass, the project can also enhance sustainability in the fisheries sector.\nDr Paul Connolly, CEO of the Marine Institute said, “Supporting research such as these, enables Irish companies to build their research and development capacity and to innovate, creating new business opportunities and jobs. These are key goals of Ireland’s marine plan, Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth.”\nThe Marine Institute’s Oceans of Learning series this week focuses on the ocean and its connection to human health and wellbeing. Oceans of Learning offers videos, interactive activities and downloadable resources which are available at Our Ocean: Our Health and Wellbeing.\nFunding for this research project was provided by the Marine Institute and the Government of Ireland, co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).']	['<urn:uuid:bd2488a1-0f97-4d6e-9d74-8c27e329df97>', '<urn:uuid:4c8ccbc5-a561-4cb9-8751-95a26eabd4aa>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	18	78	1232

In return for their donations, these wealthy citizens were allowed to place small statues of themselves on pedestals mounted at two-thirds of the height of the columns. Inscriptions on these pedestals have provided archaeologists with extensive information about Palmyra's inhabitants and their lives.	"[""If you came to this page directly, you might wish to read an introductory page first.\nMonumental Arch: view from the east\nThe monumental arch across the main street of Palmyra became the symbol of the city as soon as the first illustrations of its ruins were published in England in 1753; although since then the work of the archaeologists has revealed the beauty of other imposing monuments, such as the Temple of Bel, the arch remains the most popular site of Palmyra.\nMonumental Arch: (left) southern lateral arches; (right) northern lateral arches\nThe arch was built at the time of Emperor Septimius Severus, probably to celebrate the Emperor's victories over the Parthians. An unusual aspect of the arch is that it was designed in order to minimize the effect of a 30 degree angle in the long colonnaded street which crossed the town; the lateral arches were duplicated and given a different orientation so that overall the arch seems to be perfectly perpendicular to the street on both sides. The arch has an elaborate decoration, typical of that period, and similar to that which can be seen at Leptis Magna, the hometown of the Emperor.\nMonumental Arch: view from the west; in the background the Temple of Bel\nThe main colonnaded street crossed Palmyra slightly sloping downwards from west to east until it reached the Temple of Bel; although it was flanked by shops and public buildings and facilities, its religious significance as the street along which processions reached the temple was paramount (the street did not link the main gates of the city as at Apamea).\nAs to the honorary inscriptions, they are almost all upon the columns of\nthe long portico where it will appear, that there were statues of the persons named in them, and that the several dates mark the time when such persons received that honour. So that all we can conclude from them, with regard\nto the buildings is, that the portico is older than the earliest of those\nRobert Wood - The Ruins of Palmyra, otherwise Tedmor, in the Desart - 1753\nThe construction of the main colonnaded street, as well as of many other monuments of Palmyra, was financed by donations from its wealthiest citizens on an individual basis or on a collective one (merchants of a certain trade or origin). In return the donors were allowed to place a small statue of themselves on a pedestal placed at two thirds of the height of the columns. Inscriptions on the pedestal have provided archaeologists with a lot of data on the inhabitants of Palmyra and their life.\n(left) Transversal colonnaded street near the theatre; (right) inscription on a pedestal mounted on a column\nPalmyra did not have the rectangular shape of many Roman cities (e.g. Damascus), but it was designed according to an orthogonal grid which was first developed by Hippodamus at Miletus and then copied in other Hellenistic towns; also some of the streets which crossed perpendicularly the main street had a similar decoration based on Corinthian columns which supported small statues; elegant arches decorated the main intersections.\nTetrapylon were monuments which the Romans placed at the intersections of key streets (e.g. at Gerasa); they had four (hence tetra) openings and they were associated with the worship of Janus, the Roman god of gates and doorways (see Arco di Giano in Rome); in some locations (e.g. Oea (Tripoli) - Arch of Marcus Aurelius) they took the form of a triumphal arch.\nThe Tetrapylon of Palmyra (reconstructed with material found in situ) was built in the IInd century and similar to the Monumental Arch it corrected (from a perspective viewpoint) a slight angle of the main colonnaded street; it is one of the rare monuments of Palmyra where granite columns were employed.\nNymphaeum at the side of the Colonnaded Street and in the background the south-western necropolis with its towers\nAqueduct pipes have been found along the main colonnaded street; they supplied water to fountains and public baths which were located alongside the street.

72	What are the main differences between traditional object-oriented development and data-centric approaches when it comes to making changes to software systems over time?	In object-oriented development, making changes requires reading and changing code directly, while data-centric approaches allow changes through declarative data files. This relates to how packages should be structured - the Common-Closure Principle suggests changes should optimally impact only one package, while data-centric design separates data handling (which changes frequently) from data processing (which remains stable), making the system more maintainable throughout its lifecycle.	"['- The Three Rules\n- Red Green Refactor\n- Characterization Tests\n- TDD Smells\n- Ice Breakers\n- Why Test-After Sucks\nFont: Daniel Black\nThanks to Igor Czechowski for suggesting this card.\nAt the core of agile is short cycles of Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA). These steps are also what it means to be scientific in approach, at least per the definition of science that says you are following the scientific method: hypothesize, experiment, evaluate. Those who say agile isn\'t disciplined have not made this connection.\nPlan-Do-Check-Act is echoed in agile practices, particularly TDD. The Plan step is about ""making the expected output the focus,"" per Wikipedia. Writing a test that first fails captures your plan. After observing test failure, Do means you write enough code to make the test pass, and Check tells you to verify the actual results against the expected output. If there are differences you must Act to determine their cause and correct your implementation (or sometimes your expectations). In any case, you must also Act by observing the changes to the environment--the rest of the system--and ""determine where to apply changes that will include improvement,"" which can mean some doing some incremental refactoring.\nThe iterative-incremental development core of agile also follows the cycle:\n- Plan - iteration planning/definition of acceptance tests\n- Do - day-to-day iteration execution\n- Check - verification of results using acceptance tests\n- Act - retrospectives and subsequent planning\nAs with many of the best modern ideas for quality control, PDCA in part comes from Dr. W. Edwards Deming. While Deming credited Walter Shewhart for the original concept of PDCA, Deming gets credit for popularizing the cycle.\nFont is Mechanical Pencil\nSource: Vadim Suvorov, Tim Ottinger\nWhen can we use abbreviations as names in our source code? Can we ever use abbreviations as variable names? Vadim and I explored this issue, and Vadim in his orderly way of thinking enumerated these these principles. I\'m sure that not everyone will find these to his liking, but I think these principles are well-reasoned and sufficient. I think these nest nicely into my naming rules in general, though my preference is to avoid any kind of encodings.\n- Shared, not Personal: the abbreviation should not be something the author has invented, and which other programmers will not recognize on sight.\n- Consistently Used: the abbreviation is not punned, so that it means one thing in one context and another thing entirely in a different context. Note that a very short abbreviation has a greater likelihood of collision (fn = function or filename or ...?).\n- Must Be Justified: If the programmer is to use abbreviations, then he should have clear reasons why the abbreviation is required. If, for instance, the abbreviation helps the reader see the unique part of the name without being distracted by context warts (prefix ofr suffix). My addition here is in the case of parallel names Persistant.User v. Domain.User if only one name is present, then no prefix is justifiable. My partner in this enterprise may not agree (likely with well-considered reason).\n- Special Latitude Given for Domains: in solution domains, some abbreviations are common and it is beneficial for the programmers to know them. If I worked with military jet software and didn\'t know IFF, or in education and didn\'t understand ILT, or if I worked in accounting and didn\'t grasp AP or AR then I would be less effective when communicating with the Business/Customer.\nTo the extent that your team deems to use abbreviations, we recommend these criteria for your consideration. Clean naming is one of the most important factors in writing understandable code, and has no negative effect upon compilation or runtime speed, and so is very precious to me. Yet, in the appropriate context, I am open to sacrificing the ""no encodings of any kind"" rule to appropriate use of well-reasoned abbreviations, with the caveats given above.\nFont: AndrewScript 1.6\nPlanning poker, trademarked by Mike Cohn, is a modernizing of a 50+-year-old estimating process known as Wideband Delphi. Estimating is not far from the dark arts, and attempts to make the process serious and exacting are ill advised. James Grenning devised planning poker as a quick and entertaining way to come to consensus on estimating stories in agile. I\'ve found it can help dramatically minimize the tedium of estimating through a large stack of stories.\nA typical point scale might be 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13. Resist larger scales--toss the higher-value cards. You might replace them with one card that says ""too big.""\nYou might want to include a few additional cards: 0, ? (""I don\'t have clue""), and infinity. The value of adding a 0 card is debatable (nothing is free, and even if development is ""free,"" testing a story is never free), but you may find some usefulness in having it: Sometimes, completing one story automatically includes another. Or, a story might simply represent a milepost achieved.\nThe wikipedia site provides good detail on the steps involved, but I highly suggest you make your own rules and stick to them. The section on anchoring is particularly useful: part of the reason James devised planning poker was to counteract the heavy influence on estimates coming from one individual. Make sure that when people divulge their card selection, they aren\'t watching and waiting on certain other individuals to show theirs first!\nBefore starting the meeting, figure out how long you\'d like to spend estimating. If your backlog of stories looks pretty good, and there\'s a good understanding of the project by most people in the room (obviously not always the case), you might find that 5 minutes per story works well. Appoint a facilitator who can keep time and help keep the estimating session on track.\nIf the product you\'re building is less well-known to the participants, this process will take considerably longer, maybe 10-15 minutes per story. Do the planning poker estimates, regardless, and plan on doing them again during a quicker second meeting. If you feel like you are bogging down on a story, and understanding of it is not ""critical path,"" set it aside, and plan to come back to it after other stories are visited.\nFor a backlog of not-well-understood stories, you will probably want a couple sessions. Some stories will need to be set aside to split or researched offline. Some stories will need to be revisited by the customer. One of the best things to do is give people time to go off and think about things (and having at least one night between sessions is always a good idea).\nStill, you want to avoid investing too much time in estimation. The more time you invest, the higher the expectation that the numbers coming out of it are anywhere near perfect. Estimates are guesses!\nInstead, the estimation meeting is best seen as a way to ensure that we have good, appropriately sized stories that are fairly well understood by everyone involved. The consensus mechanism in planning poker will quickly let you know if this is not the case. Getting confidence from a good ballpark project plan is almost a bonus!\nPost: Tim & Jeff\nSource: Uncle Bob\nFont: Segoe Print\nCoupling and cohesion are the two most important principles guiding the quality of an object-oriented class design. Most programmers learned about these principles in their first week of exposure to OO. The rise of TDD has helped reinforce the value of low coupling and high cohesion (although many programmers still unconsciously and even consciously resist truly small, cohesive classes and methods).\nUncle Bob teaches us that these core OO principles apply equally to packages. The Agile in a Flash card for Principles of Package Coupling covers the dependency side of the dynamic duo--how do you structure packages so as to improve the coupling relationships between them? This card covers the other side--how should you compose a package? What is the definition of ""cohesive,"" as it applies to packages?\n- The Reuse-Release Equivalence Principle (REP) - The REP tells us that classes should be packaged together because they are used together. This seems obvious, but many package structures are instead based around ideas like ""functional areas,"" ""architectural layers,"" or ""originating team."" The result? Users are inconvenienced, for example, by having to recite a litany of import lines at the top of each file. REP tells us to consider the destination instead of the source or even the structure of the code itself. It urges us to group things together for user convenience.\nAn entire system shoehorned into a single package/library would comply with this principle. But if the rate of change in the library was not extremely low, it would suffer from the problems addressed by the remaining principles.\n- The Common-Reuse Principle (CRP) - This almost seems like a restatement of the REP, but the emphasis here is on limiting the impact to consumers. Imagine an API package with two sets of reusable class clusters. A programmer might choose to consume only one reusable component, but changes to the other component necessitate redistribution of the entire package. An unwanted release unnecessarily burdens the consuming programmer, who must re-integrate and re-test the entire library in order to stay current. Where the REP leads us to conglomerate, the CRP leads us to split packages apart. This tension between the principles leads us to find the level of granularity that provides greatest convenience (least negative impact) to users.\nIn spirit, the CRP is a package-level restatement of the Interface Segregation Principle, which says to keep interfaces small and focused for similar reasons.\n- The Common-Closure Principle (CCP) - The CCP is an application of the Open-Closed Principle at the next level up. This principle suggests that you should group your classes around the impact of change. A change should optimally impact only one package; as many other packages as possible should be closed to that change. This varies from the other two principles as it recommends grouping classes around the way the code is maintained, rather than the way it is used. Modules with a high rate of change might need to be grouped by closure rather than by use. Highly stable packages might be better conglomerated (REP).\nThe principles of package cohesion are not absolute. Sometimes a packaging may satisfy all three principles at once, but often the principles represent competing principles. The development team will have to make trade-offs in order to find a balance that works. In general, smaller (and even smaller) packages provide the best chance for adherence to the CCP and CRP principles, although the REP says there is a limit to how small you will want to go.\nFollowing these principles will require occasional re-packaging, which is upsetting to many users. However, correcting less-than-optimal packaging is a single deep cut that can halt the ""death of a thousand paper cuts"" caused when changes ripple across packages, or when users of a package have to deal with frequent irrelevant updates.', ""A Data-Centric Approach to Distributed Application Architecture : Page 3\nThe object-oriented development approach is useful for developing applications in general, but a data-centric approach is better for designing and developing distributed applications.\nby Dr. Gerardo Pardo-Castellote\nMar 28, 2007\nPage 3 of 3\nImplementing Data-Centric Applications\nData-centric applications can be implemented using the precepts of data-oriented programming. In general, the tenets of data-oriented programming include the following principles:\nExpose the data. Ensure that the data is visible throughout the entire system. Hiding the data makes it difficult for new processing endpoints to identify data needs and gain access to that data.\nHide the code. Conversely, none of the computational endpoints has any reason to be cognizant of another's code. By abstracting away from the code, data is free to be used by any process, no matter where it was generated. This provides for data to be shared across the distributed application, and for the application to be modified and enhanced during its lifecycle.\nSeparate data and code into data-handling and data-processing components. Data handling is required because of differing data formats, persistence, and timeliness, and is likely to change during the application lifecycle. Conversely, data processing requirements are likely to remain much more stable. By separating the two, the application becomes easier to maintain and modify over time.\nGenerate code from process interfaces. Interfaces define the data inputs and outputs of a given process. Having well-defined inputs and outputs makes it possible to understand and automate the implementation of the data-processing code.\nLoosely couple all code. With well-defined interfaces and computational processes abstracted away from one another, endpoints and their computations can be interchanged with little or no impact on the distributed application as a whole.\nTable 1 summarizes these and other principles, and it offers a comparison with object-oriented development tenets in order to contrast the two different approaches. The data-oriented approach enforces attention on the data rather than on the processes that manipulate the data.\nObject-Oriented Programming Principles\nData-Oriented Programming Principles\nHide the data (encapsulation)\nExpose the data (with MR format)\nExpose methods code\nHide the code\nIntermix data and code\nSeparate data and code\nMust agree on data mapping, mapping system\nMessages are primary data model or schema\nCombined processing, no restrictions\nStrict separation of parser, validator, transformer, and logic\nChanges: Read and change code\nChanges: Change declarative data file\nTable 1. A Comparison of Data-Oriented and Object-Oriented Programming Principles\nThe data-oriented approach to application design is effective in systems where multiple data sources are required for successful completion of the computing activity, but those data sources reside in separate nodes on a network in a net-centric application infrastructure. For network-centric distributed applications, applying a data-oriented programming model lets you focus on the movement of data through the network, an easier and more natural way of abstracting and implementing the solution.\nData as the Design and Implementation Focal Points\nData-centric design and data-oriented implementation can bring about a more robust and scalable distributed system, and one that is easier to maintain and enhance over time. For real-time distributed applications that are highly dependent upon the movement of data through the system, the advantages of using data as the design and implementation focal points can make the difference for a successful project.\nDr. Gerardo Pardo-Castellote is Chief Technology Officer of Real-Time Innovations, Inc.

73	How did early crystal oscillators compare to modern TCXOs in precision timing?	Early crystal oscillators were less precise than modern Temperature Compensated Crystal Oscillators (TCXOs). While basic crystal oscillators can drift ±25 ppm in the 0°C to 70°C range, TCXOs achieve much better stability of ±1.5 ppm in the same range. This represents a 10-40 times improvement in performance. Historically, this evolution in precision timing is significant - in the 1930s, scientists were transitioning from pendulum clocks to early quartz oscillators, as they needed timing devices that were not dependent on gravitational acceleration. Modern TCXOs use sophisticated compensation networks, often incorporating digital signal processing, to counteract temperature effects on frequency stability.	['I recommend choosing something pre- World War II, as that was the era of hand-crafted, “in your basement”-style science. There’s a lot to learn not only about the ingenuity of researchers in an era when materials were not readily available, but also about the problems and concerns of scientists of that era, often things we take for granted now!\nThese are from 1931, fulfilling the pre-WWII criterion, when you still had individuals engaging in research that were self-financed or supported by a patron and much of the equipment was self-manufactured. The science in this case was largely self-funded, and as for the “basement,” well, it’s a pretty fancy basement as you’ll see, as one might suspect of someone who can fund his own science. But classic nonetheless. There’s a bit to do, and I’m going to break it up into more manageable chunks.\nThe papers in question are from the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 91, published in 1931, and are “The Precise Measurement of Time” by Alfred L. Loomis (p. 569-575) and “Time, Analysis of records made on the Loomis chronograph by three Shortt clocks and a crystal oscillator” by Brown, E. W. & Brouwer, D. (p.575-591). (I, know, I know. They sound like tabloid headlines, don’t they?) The first paper describes various apparati used, and the second describes a particular measurement that was of interest to me.\nThe measurement of interest came about from a question on pendulum clocks. Anyone who has taken introductory physics has seen that the frequency of oscillation depends on gravitational acceleration, and might have done a problem calculating the change in frequency or period for an elevation change. But what of another change in gravitational acceleration — what effect does the varying location and thus pull of the moon have on a pendulum clock? And has it been measured? In order to do that measurement, one has to compare a pendulum clock with another that does not depend on the local value of g. The period around 1930 saw a transition from pendulum clocks to quartz oscillators, and that fits the bill, since the quartz crystal, though sensitive to large accelerations, will not have nearly the sensitivity to this kind of change in g. These papers describe the equipment, measurement and the results.\nThe author of the first paper is Alfred Lee Loomis, a name with which I was not familiar prior to reading these papers, and I’m not sure how that happened. Loomis was a scientist and inventor, and could afford to do these as a hobby, because he was quite rich — he made his fortune in finance in the 1920′s and pretty much exited the stock market before the crash of 1929, so his fortune remained intact and allowed him to buy back on the cheap. He set up a laboratory at his mansion in Tuxedo Park, NY and performed experiments in various fields, including precise time, but also microwave radar. He helped develop that before the defense department was fully behind it, and was appointed to be in charge of the project. The development of radar technology was, of course, a significant factor in winning the war. You can read some more about him here and here.\nThe devices to be described are the two types of clocks that were used, the crystal oscillator and the Shortt pendulum clocks, and the device used to compare and record timing differences between them, the Loomis Chronograph. I’ll get into the technical aspects next.', 'TCXO, Temperature Compensated Crystal Oscillator\n- the TCXO, temperature compensated crystal oscillator is used for providing a much higher levels of temperature stability than are possible with a normal crystal oscillator.\nThe TCXO, Temperature Compensated Crystal Oscillator (Xtal oscillator) is a form of crystal oscillator used where a precision frequency source is required within a small space and at reasonable cost.\nBy applying temperature compensation within the crystal oscillator module, it is possible to considerably improve on the basic performance of the oscillator.\nIn view of their usefulness, a wide range is available from many suppliers in a whole variety of packages from a host of different surface mount varieties through to through hole mounted ones, some of which are compatible with the dual in line format used for many through hole mounted integrated circuits.\nEffect of temperature\nAlthough crystal oscillators offer a highly stable form of oscillator, they are nevertheless affected by temperature. The cut of the actual crystal element from the overall grown crystal can help to minimize the effects of temperature, but they are still affected to some degree. For a crystal cut known as the AT cut, the drift with temperature can be minimized around normal ambient temperature, but the rate of drift will rise above and below this.\nTypical frequency / temperature curve for quartz crystal\nThe effects of temperature are, to a large degree, repeatable and definable. Therefore it is possible to compensate for many of the effects using a temperature compensated crystal oscillator, TCXO.\nA typical comparison of the typical or expected performance levels is given in the table below:\n|Temperature range||Basic crystal oscillator||TCXO|\n|0C to 70C||±25 ppm||±1.5 ppm|\n|-20°C to 70°C||± 30ppm||± 2.5 ppm|\n|-40°C to 85°C||± 40ppm||± 3 ppm|\nNote: These performance figures are very generalised and can only be used for a rough guide. Exact figures will depend upon the item used and figures for these should be gained from the manufacturers datasheets.\nA TCXO adjusts the frequency of the oscillator to compensate for the changes that will occur as a result of temperature changes. To achieve this, the main element within a TCXO is a Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillator (VCXO). This is connected to a circuit that senses the temperature and applies a small correction voltage to the oscillator as shown below.\nBlock diagram for a typical TCXO\nThere are a number of different elements that comprise the overall temperature controlled oscillator:\n- Compensation network: The compensation network is the key to the operation of the whole system. An approximate curve for the temperature frequency response of the oscillator is seen above. The actual curve can be expressed approximately in the form of a 3rd order polynomial expression, although a more accurate representation takes into account some non-linearities and works out to be close to a 5th order polynomial. The compensation network needs to sense the temperature and produce a voltage that is the inverse of this.\nEarly designs would have used analogue circuitry and often directly used a network of capacitors, resistors and thermistors to directly control the frequency of oscillation. This type of circuit included both blocks on the diagram of the compensation network and the crystal frequency pulling block.\nCompensating voltage for TCXO temperature linearisation\nCurrently technologies typically adopt an indirect approach where the temperature is sensed in the compensation network, and a voltage is generated that provides a frequency change that is the inverse of the temperature curve. This can be achieved using analogue components, but current technologies often incorporate some form of digital signal processing to be able to generate a far more accurate response, with the possibility of linearising units separately by programming a ROM with the response of the particular oscillator. The DSP circuitry is often contained within a special ASIC to enable it to be tailored to suit the application without draining too much current.\n- Oscillator pulling circuit: Once the voltage has been generated, this is applied to a circuit that can pull the frequency of the crystal oscillator. Typically this incorporates a varactor diode and some low pass filtering.\n- Crystal oscillator : The oscillator circuit is normally a standard circuit, but one that is designed to give the operating operating conditions for the crystal with ideal drive levels, etc.\n- Voltage regulator: In order to prevent external voltage changes from introducing unwanted frequency shifts, the overall TCXO should incorporate a voltage regulator which itself should not introduce unwanted temperature effects.\n- Buffer amplifier: A buffer amplifier is required to give the increased drive to the output. It should provide isolation to the crystal oscillator from any external load changes that may be seen.\nAdditionally TCXOs normally have an external adjustment to enable the frequency to be reset periodically. This enables the effects of the ageing of the crystal to be removed. The period between calibration adjustments will depend upon the accuracy required, but may typically be six months or a year. Shorter periods may be used if very high levels of accuracy are required.\nSome of the main performance figures are summarised below:\n- TCXO PPM performance: The TCXO temperature performance is better than that of a normal crystal oscillator. Typically figures of between 10 and 40 times improvement can often be seen. Typical figures are given in the table above for the different temperature ranges. Figures of better than ±1.5 ppm over a 0 to 70°C temperature range are difficult to achieve as they then fall into a high precision category where costs increase significantly.\n- Power dissipation: The power dissipation of a TCXO will be greater than an ordinary oscillator in view of the additional circuitry required. Additionally the cost is greater. It should also be remembered that it will take a short while after start up for the oscillator to stabilize. This may be of the order of 100 ms, or possibly longer, dependent upon the design.\n- TCXO package: TCXOs can be supplied in a variety of packages dependent upon the way they have been designed and the requirements of the end user. The most common form of construction is to construct the circuit on a small printed circuit board that can be house in a plat metal package. This is then suitable for mounting onto the main circuit board of the overall equipment. As the crystal itself is sealed, this means that sealing of the overall TCXO package is not critical, or even required for most applications.\nPackage sizes such as 5x3.2x1.5 mm or 5x3.5x1 mm are widely used for TCXOs and smaller packages available if required.\n- Output format and level: With many TCXOs being used for driving digital circuits, most of the small oscillator packages produce what is termed a clipped sine wave. This is suitable for driving a logic circuit, although in many cases it is wise to put it through a logic buffer to ensure it is sufficiently square. Often the output is an open collector circuit. If a sine wave output is required, then this must be chosen at the outset and it will limit the choice available.\n- Power requirements: The actual power requirements will depend upon the particular device. Many operate from supplies of 3 V, and may draw as little as 2 mA, although this will depend upon the general type, the manufacturer and the particular device chosen.\nAlthough temperature compensated crystal oscillators are normally referred to in this manner, occasionally more detailed descriptions are used. This has resulted in the variety of techniques that can be used to provide the temperature compensation.\n- ADTCXO: This is an Analogue Digital TCXO. This form of TCXO has been widely used in cell phones. This uses analogue technology to provide temperature correction to the oscillator. It has the advantage that changes take place slowly and no phase jumps are experienced as occurs with some all-digital types.\n- DTCXO: As may be guessed, this is a digital TCXO. It uses a temperature sensor and then logic and mathematical functions use digital circuitry along with a look up table. The resulting digital correction figure is converted to an analogue signal using a digital to analogue converter, DAC.\n- DCXO: This is a form of oscillator where any correction is calculated by the host processor within the equipment. In this way, the TCXO is not a separate entity, but the processing is incorporated within that of the overall equipment. This can help save costs in some instances.\n- MCXO: This form of TCXO uses a microprocessor to provide a considerably increased level of processing to provide more accurate compensation under a variety of circumstances. While performance is a little better, costs are above those of the other forms.\nTCXOs are widely used where accurate frequency sources are needed. They are less expensive and smaller than oven controlled oscillators, as such they offer an ideal solution for many portable units requiring a reasonably accurate source.\nBy Ian Poole\nWant more like this?

74	How do digital editing tools help create focused photos, and what should someone watch out for when taking turmeric with other medicines?	Digital photo editing software can create selective focus effects using depth of field tools and contrast adjustments, with techniques like focus stacking to combine multiple images taken at different focus distances. Regarding turmeric and medications, it can interact with blood thinning medicines, diabetes medications, and stomach acid reducing medicines, potentially causing increased levels of these drugs in the bloodstream which may produce toxic effects over time.	['Understanding Selective Focus\nSelective focus is an editing technique that can be used to make specific objects stand out in a photograph. Without selective focus, this task can be tricky, but the selective focus technique makes it very easy. This is a standard technique for professional photographers. It will keep the selected object sharp and in focus, while the rest of the shot will have blurred edges and appear to be out of focus.\nHow to Achieve Selective Focus\nThere are several different ways in which this selective focus can be achieved. Find an element in the photo that can be used to be strongly out of focus. A telephoto lens is best, as the telephoto will bring the object into focus and everything else out of focus. A wide aperture size, or f stop, can help achieve this technique. A large aperture size and fast shutter speed will ensure that as much light as possible gets into the film. Angling to the subject can take some practice, but is an excellent way to achieve this effect. Choose a shooting angle so that the foreground and background of the shot are further apart. This makes the background be very out of focus.\nDepth of Focus\nUltimately, selective focus is how the depth of field and brightness is used. If you are having difficulties achieving this with the camera, then digital photo editing software can create the same effect by working with the depth of field and the contrast. Most advanced editing programs will have an internal camera that can be used to change the depth of field. In fact, most programs will have a depth of field tool.\nThere are several digital techniques that can be used to achieve this effect. Focus stacking will combine several images that were taken at different focus distances. This provides a much greater depth of field than an individual photo. Wavefront coding can be used to create optical transfer functions that produce point spread functions for the images and light. These are needed to alter the distance and depth of field in a photo. A plenoptic camera will capture 4D light. This 4d light changes the distance and can be used to create selective focus.\nSelective focus is frequently used with nature photographs. These photos are challenging because of the narrow depth of field, and yet to achieve selective focus, the depth of field must be large. Digital cameras makes it easy to see if the chosen shooting options create a selective focus shot or if something should be changed. When taking a close up photo, even a small change can make a very large difference. Try experimenting with your camera until you find the best settings to achieve this effect. Each camera will be different.\nIt is really the lenses that are important. Several SLR lenses have been created specifically for selective focus shots. These lenses will have flexible barrels so that it can be bent, pulled or pushed to create the dynamic image over the very narrow focus plane. This is much faster than creating the same type of image using Photoshop.', 'Turmeric, the golden spice obtained from the turmeric plant (Curcuma longa) is commonly used in Asian cooking to add color and flavor to food, especially in curries. In fact, it is an indispensable ingredient in many Indian dishes. The spice mainly consists of carbs, fiber, various plant compounds and other nutrients.\nHowever, the most important element that has made turmeric so popular is a bioactive compound called Curcumin, which has numerous healing and medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-microbial, analgesic, anti-cancer and anti-diabetic properties. Curcumin is responsible for most of the health benefits of turmeric and for giving the spice itsrich golden-yellow color.\nEver since the healing properties of curcumin were discovered, turmeric came to be used as a natural remedy for curing and preventing several health problems, particularly conditions involving inflammation.\nAlthough turmeric is a natural substance, many people are concerned about the possible side effects it may cause, when used for medicinal purposes. Turmeric has been used in India and many other countries for thousands of years. It is generally safe to take turmeric and it does not cause significant side effects. However, some people may experience problems like nausea, dizziness, stomach upset, or diarrhea. It has been found that most incidents of turmeric side effects are connected to turmeric supplements, when people consume more than their recommended doses.\nHow Safe is Turmeric?\nAccording to researchers and scientists who have conducted countless studies on this spice, turmeric is very safe unless consumed in excess quantities. Excess of anything, including water is likely to cause health problems. The same goes for turmeric as well. Turmeric in judicious quantities is considered safe for anyone who is generally healthy.\nDose Escalation Study of Curcumin\nThe “Dose escalation of a curcuminoid formulation” isone of the most famous studies conducted by Lao et. al on the safety profile of turmeric.\nAbout 24 healthy participantstook part in the study in which they were given 95% standardized curcumin doses ranging from 500mg to 12,000 mg. After the study, it was found that no curcumin was spotted in blood serum at doses from 500-8000mg. However, at doses of 10000 and 12000mg, the blood serum of two individuals contained low levels of curcumin.\nOut of the 24 participants, seven individuals experienced side effects, which most of the of researchers suggest was not related to high doseof curcumin. The side effects experienced by the seven people are as follows:\n- 1 individual experienced diarrhea at a dose of 1000mg.\n- 1 individual experienced headache at a dose of 4000mg.\n- 1 individual experienced rash at a dose of8000mg.\n- 1 individual experienced yellow stool at a dose of 8000mg.\n- 1 individual experienced yellow stool at a dose of 10000mg.\n- 1 individual experienced headache at a dose of 10000mg\n- 1 individual experienced diarrhea at a dose of 12000mg\nSince all these side effects were not so serious and were of grade one toxicity, it was concluded that curcumin has an outstanding safety profile and is generally well tolerated by people.\nIf you are concerned about the side effects of turmeric, a good idea would be to start using small doses and then slowly increase the dose.\nWhat Causes Turmeric Side Effects?\nMost of the side effects related to turmeric intake may be due to the following reasons:\n- Excess Consumption – As with everything else, moderation is the key, when it comes to food. Low doses of turmeric are safe whereas high doses are likely to cause side effects.\n- Quality – When you buy turmeric, always make sure to choose organic turmeric. In the case of turmeric powder or turmeric supplements, choose products that are manufactured by reliable and popular brands. When it comes to commercial turmeric powders, not all of them are pure. Some may contain highly toxic ingredients, some of which may even cause diseases like cancer.\n- Duration of Use– Consuming high doses of turmeric for a long duration is another factor that may cause side effects.\n- Form of Turmeric – Turmeric is available in many forms, including fresh root, turmeric powder, turmeric capsules, extract and tincture. Of these different forms, the consumption of turmeric capsules has been found to cause most of the side effects because it’s easier for people take more than the recommended doses of the supplement.\n- When and How You Take Turmeric – Although you can take turmeric any time, people who are on medication should take care not to take the spice close to their medicine intake time. Also, consuming turmeric on an empty stomach is likely to cause side effects in some people.\nHow Much Turmeric is Safe?\nThe amount of turmeric you can take safely per day depends on various factors, such as your age and overall health. If you have any concerns about how much turmeric is safe for you, it’s best to consult your doctor.\nAccording to various sources, here are the recommended doses of different forms of turmeric for adults:\n- Fresh Turmeric: 1.5g – 3 g per day\n- Dried and powdered root: 1g – 3 g per day\n- Standardized powder (curcumin) or Curcumin supplements: 400mg – 600 mg, 3 times per day\n- Fluid extract (1:1) 30 – 90 drops per day\n- Tincture (1:2): 15 – 30 drops, 4 times per day\nIf you’re taking turmeric for various health problems such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis or dyspepsia (upset stomach), here are the doses:\n- For rheumatoid arthritis: 500mg,two times a day of BCM-95®, Arjuna Natural Extracts, India, which is a specific formulation of curcumin.\n- For osteoarthritis: 500 mg twice a day ofMeriva, Indena, which is a specific turmeric extract. 500 mg four times a day of a non-commercial product is also used for treating this condition.\n- For dyspepsia (upset stomach): 500 mg of turmeric four times a day.\nWhat are the Side Effects of Turmeric?\nNow, let’s look at some of the possible side effects associated with turmeric:\nOne of the most common side effects associated with turmeric is upset stomach. Although the spice is a great remedy for digestion and various digestive issues like constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease and bloating, turmeric overdose can sometimes lead to irritation and stomach discomfort. A few participants who took part in the studies about the effect on turmeric on cancer had to quit because the spice affected their digestion in a negative way.\nThe following are some of the reasons why you might be experiencing these side effects:\n- Taking turmeric for the first time – The anxiety or concern about taking a totally new spice for the first time may affect your digestion process.\n- Taking turmeric on an empty stomach may trigger acid reflux. The spice is best digested when it is combined with oil or food.\n- Consuming excess quantities of turmeric\nRisk of Bleeding\nCurcumin, the bioactive compound in turmeric has anti-coagulant properties. While this property is beneficial for reducing the risk of blood clotting and heart problems, it can increase the risk of bleeding in people having bleeding disorders. So, in case of surgery, cuts or wounds, people with this condition may experience excessive loss of blood.\nTo avoid such problems:\n- Do not take turmeric or curcumin supplements if you have a bleeding disorder.\n- If you wish to take turmeric, first consult your doctor, who can advise you on the doses.\n- If you’ve decided to take turmeric, make sure to start with small doses.\n- If you’re on anti-clotting medications, avoid taking turmeric close to the time of taking the medicines.\nIf you are allergic to ginger, chances are that you are allergic to turmeric as well. In such cases, it is better to avoid taking turmeric in any form.\nGall Bladder Problems\nPeople with gall bladder problems, such as gall stones or bile duct obstruction are advised not to use turmeric because the spice can make the condition worser. Turmeric can cause the gall bladder to contract, causing extreme pain and discomfort.\nAccording to some sources, turmeric contains compounds called oxalates that may increase the risk of gall stones.\nItching and Rashes on the Skin\nThese side effects may be due to allergic reaction to turmeric. As mentioned earlier, sometimes the turmeric that we buy from the market contain additives and toxic substances, which can cause allergy in people. The best way to avoid this is to take organic turmeric. However, if you find the condition becoming worse, its better to stop taking turmeric altogether.\nHot Flashes and Night Sweats\nIf you experience hot flashes, night sweats and face flashes after taking turmeric, may it’s because the spice is regulating your hormones. In this case, what you can do is reduce the dosage of turmeric or try using another brand of the spice.\nYellowing of Skin, Nails and Stool\nTurmeric overdose may be the reason behind the yellowing of skin, sweat, nails and stool. If you’re experiencing this problem, try reducing the dose of turmeric and see if there’s any change.\nSome people who take turmeric regularly has reported body odor as a side effect. If you experience this symptom, try adding cinnamon to the golden paste.\nNausea and Vomiting\nHigh doses of turmeric may cause nausea and vomiting in people, probably because they’re not accustomed to the taste of the spice.\nPeople with iron deficiency should take turmeric with caution because high doses of this spice can prevent the absorption of iron by the body.\nPeople trying to have a baby are recommended to use turmeric with caution. In men, the spice may cause lowering of testosterone levels and decreased sperm movement, which may lead to infertility.\nPossible Interactions with Drugs\nWhen taking turmeric with certain medications, it can cause an increased amount of the medicines in the blood stream, which may produce a toxic effect in the long run. According to the University of Maryland Medical Centre, turmeric may have drug interactions with blood thinning medicines, diabetes medications and stomach acid reducing medicines.\nAs with any kind of food, minor side effects may occur while using turmeric as well. But, when you look at the bigger picture and consider all the health benefits this amazing spice offers us, you’ll understand that the benefits of turmeric undoubtedly outweigh the side effects.\nSo, give turmeric a try and see how it improves your overall health and well-being!']	['<urn:uuid:f0b0c030-8217-479d-a580-4e349b340673>', '<urn:uuid:dc61fe85-0244-4da0-9fad-358a7e14ae62>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	22	66	2251
75	What's the most destructive hailstorm that's ever hit Australia and what kind of damage did it cause?	Australia's worst hailstorm occurred in Sydney on April 14, 1999. Cricket ball-sized hailstones hit the city at speeds over 200km/h, affecting 85 suburbs. The storm damaged 20,000 houses, including windows, roofs and skylights. It also damaged more than 70,000 cars and 25 commercial planes. Emergency services received calls for help every 10 seconds at the storm's peak. The total damage bill reached $1.7 billion, making it the most expensive natural disaster in Australian history.	['A freak* and furious hailstorm has turned an Australian beach into a winter wonderland*.\nHeavy hail came down in the coastal town of Cape Paterson in Gippsland, Victoria on Friday and transformed the sandy shoreline into a sea of white. It also turned horse paddocks into icy fields and tennis courts into surfaces more suitable for ice hockey.\nIt made for an unusual sight and got us wondering here at Kids News, what causes hail?\nHere are some answers:\nWHAT CAUSES HAIL?\nHail is created when small water droplets* are caught in the updraught* of a thunderstorm. These water droplets are lifted higher and higher into the sky until they move way above the freezing level and they form into ice. Once they become too heavy for the updraught to support, they will start to fall as hail.\nHailstones are actually clumps* of layered ice.\nHailstones start as small ice balls (called hail embryos*) if they come into contact with tiny particles in the air, such as a speck* of dust or dirt, or a salt crystal.\nGrowth into a full hailstone happens in the hail growth zone, where the updraught air temperature is -10 degrees Celcius* to -25 degrees Celcius. Here, hail embryos collide with super-cooled water droplets, causing them to freeze on impact. Once the hailstones have collided with enough of these droplets, building up in size, they become heavy enough for gravity* to take over, and begin to fall.\nHail can only form in thunderstorms or Cumulonimbus clouds*.\nHOW BIG CAN HAILSTONES GET?\nHailstones can be as big as the size of a cricket ball.\nTheir size depends on the strength and size of the updraught. Most of the time hailstones are smaller than 25mm which is about the size of a 10c piece. However, in very intense thunderstorms, the upward air motion inside the updraught is so strong that even larger hailstones are suspended or fall very slowly. In these storms, hailstones have more time to collect even more super-cooled water droplets and grow to larger sizes, such as golf-ball or cricket-ball size.\nAUSTRALIA’S WORST HAILSTORM\nOn April 14, 1999, Sydney experienced Australia’s worst hailstorm in history.\nHailstones the size of cricket balls hit the city at more than 200km/h. The storm hit 85 suburbs, causing damage to 20,000 houses, including windows, roofs and skylights.\nMore than 70,000 cars had windscreen and panel damage and 25 commercial planes were affected.\nWhen the storm was at its worst, emergency services received a call for help every 10 seconds.\nWhen it was over, the damage bill came to $1.7 billion, the most expensive natural disaster in Australian history.\nMOST COMMON TIMES FOR HAILSTORMS IN AUSTRALIA\nHail can occur at any time of year, but large hail is most common in Australia during spring and early summer when temperatures are warm enough to promote the development of strong thunderstorms and the upper atmosphere is still cool enough to support growth of stronger storms.\nSource: Bureau of Meteorology\n- freak: unusual, not normal\n- wonderland: a place full of wonderful things\n- droplets: a very small drop of liquid\n- updraught: upward movement of air\n- clumps: bunch\n- embryos: at an early stage, such as a seed\n- speck: a tiny spot\n- Celcius: measurement of heat\n- gravity: downward force\n- Cumulonimbus clouds: rain clouds\n- What is the air current called that lifts droplets to become hail?\n- What is a hail embryo?\n- How big can hailstones become?\n- Where was Australia’s worst hailstorm in history?\n- What was the damage bill for that disastrous storm?\nLISTEN TO THIS STORY\n1.

76	melbourne declaration education goals what are they	The Melbourne Declaration includes two main educational goals: 1) Australian schooling promotes equity and excellence, and 2) All young Australians become successful learners, confident and creative individuals and active and informed citizens.	"[""ACARA is committed to the development of a high-quality curriculum for all Australian students, one that promotes excellence and equity in education. All students are entitled to rigorous, relevant and engaging learning programs drawn from a challenging curriculum that addresses their individual learning needs.\nTeachers will use the Australian Curriculum to develop teaching and learning programs that build on students’ interests, strengths, goals and learning needs, and address the cognitive, affective, physical, social and aesthetic needs of all students.\nThese materials are presented as a resource for principals, schools and teachers. They are intended to:\n- help ensure that all students are able to access and participate in the Australian Curriculum\n- provide advice as to how the three-dimensional design of the Australian Curriculum may be used to address the learning needs of all students\n- provide specific advice with regard to meeting the learning needs of students with disability, gifted and talented students, and students for whom English is an additional language or dialect\n- provide examples illustrating how students with diverse needs can access and participate in the Australian Curriculum.\nAn Australian Curriculum for all students\nThe Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians (MCEETYA, 2008) (Melbourne Declaration) provides the policy framework for the Australian Curriculum. It includes two goals:\nGoal 1: Australian schooling promotes equity and excellence.\nGoal 2: All young Australians become successful learners, confident and creative individuals and active and informed citizens.\nThe ways in which the Australian Curriculum has been designed to address these goals are detailed in The Shape of the Australian Curriculum Version 4 (ACARA, 2012). The propositions that shape the development of the Australian Curriculum establish expectations that the Australian Curriculum is appropriate for all students. These propositions include:\n- that each student can learn and that the needs of every student are important\n- that each student is entitled to knowledge, understanding and skills that provide a foundation for successful and lifelong learning and participation in the Australian community\n- that high expectations should be set for each student as teachers account for the current level of learning of individual students and the different rates at which students develop\n- that the needs and interests of students will vary, and that schools and teachers will plan from the curriculum in ways that respond to those needs and interests.\nThe Melbourne Declaration emphasises the importance of knowledge, understanding and skills from each learning area, general capabilities and cross-curriculum priorities as the basis for a curriculum designed to support 21st-century learning. The Australian Curriculum is formed by these three dimensions, and it is the relationship between these dimensions that provides flexibility for schools and teachers to ‘promote personalised learning that aims to fulfil the diverse capabilities of each young Australian’ (MCEETYA, 2008, p. 7).\nThe online format of the Australian Curriculum provides flexibility in how the curriculum can be viewed: by learning area, by multiple year levels or by year level across learning areas. The curriculum may also be filtered to show where general capabilities and cross-curriculum priorities are embedded in learning area content. While the general capabilities and cross-curriculum priorities are embedded in learning area content descriptions, they can also be viewed separately.\nThe relationship between the three dimensions (learning areas, general capabilities and cross-curriculum priorities) provides teachers with flexibility to cater for student diversity through personalised learning. Teachers can help meet individual learning needs by incorporating specific teaching of the general capabilities or cross-curriculum priorities through the learning area content (for example, teaching targeted literacy skills through a history lesson, providing opportunities to explore sustainability in a science lesson, or scaffolding language specific to mathematics).\nThe following flowchart has been developed to illustrate the process for using the three-dimensional design of the Australian Curriculum to meet the learning needs of all students. The process applies to all students, regardless of their circumstances, progress in learning or the type or location of school they attend. The process reinforces every student’s entitlement to rigorous, relevant and engaging learning experiences across all areas of the curriculum and ensures that all students have the same opportunities and choices in their education.\nMore detail in relation to applying this process can be found under the sections Students with disability; Gifted and talented students; Students for whom English is an additional language or dialect and Illustrations of Personalised Learning.\nUsing the Australian Curriculum to meet the learning needs of all students\nTeachers refer to the Australian Curriculum learning area content that aligns with their students’ chronological age as the starting point in planning teaching and learning programs.\nTeachers take account of the range of their students’ current levels of learning, strengths, goals and interests, and personalise learning where necessary through adjustments to the teaching and learning program, according to individual learning need, by:\n- drawing from learning area content at different levels along the Foundation to Year 10 sequence to personalise age-equivalent learning area content\n- using the general capabilities and/or cross-curriculum priorities to adjust the learning focus of the age-equivalent learning area content\n- aligning individual learning goals with age-equivalent learning area content\nTeachers assess students’ progress through the Australian Curriculum in relation to achievement standards. Some students’ progress will be assessed in relation to their individual learning goals. Approaches to assessment and reporting will differ across the states and territories.\nThe purpose of this section is to support teachers in meeting their obligations to ensure equity of access to the Australian Curriculum for all students and to promote excellence.\nThe flowchart Using the Australian Curriculum to meet the learning needs of all students broadly outlines the process teachers follow in meeting their obligations and is applicable to every student across all educational settings and contexts, without exception.\nStarting with learning area content that aligns with students’ chronological age enables teachers to:\n- plan dignified teaching and learning programs that are respectful of their students’ age\n- develop rigorous teaching and learning programs that will challenge and engage all students\n- ensure that all students progress through the Australian Curriculum.\nPersonalising the teaching and learning program enables teachers to:\n- select age-equivalent content that is meaningful and respects students’ individual needs, strengths, language proficiencies and interests\n- provide stimulating learning experiences that challenge, extend and develop all students\n- use their knowledge of students’ individual needs, strengths and interests to ensure access to the teaching and learning program.\nPersonalised learning may involve one or a combination of approaches in relation to curriculum, instruction and the environment. Detailed examples can be found under the Illustrations of personalised learning.\nPersonalised learning using the curriculum\nApproaches may include:\n- drawing from learning area content at different levels along the Foundation to Year 10 sequence to personalise age-equivalent content (for example, some Year 6 students will be able to plan and conduct a specific investigation making decisions about variables, while others may take part in the same investigation but at a less complex level by exploring and answering questions)\n- drawing from and emphasising specific aspects of one or more of the general capabilities to adjust the learning focus in a particular learning area (for example, teaching targeted numeracy skills or ethical understanding through a science lesson)\n- drawing from and emphasising specific aspects of one or more of the cross-curriculum priorities to adjust the learning focus of a particular learning area (for example, providing opportunities to examine historical perspectives from an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander viewpoint)\n- aligning individual learning goals with age-equivalent learning area content (for example, incorporating communication goals into a problem-solving task in a maths lesson).\nIn all of these examples, the integrity of the learning area content must be retained.\nPersonalised learning using instruction\nApproaches may include:\n- scaffolding student learning through guided practice and support\n- modelling and demonstrating skills, knowledge and cognitive strategies\n- explicit and systematic instruction\n- identifying key vocabulary for explicit instruction\n- organising and connecting knowledge, skills and values to promote generalisation\n- motivating students through engagement with personal interests\n- levels of prompting\n- modelling problem solving\n- providing opportunities for the student to think aloud (verbalisation)\n- providing feedback and correction\n- using cross-curricular and naturally occurring learning opportunities to enhance individual learning goals\n- providing alternative representations of teaching and learning materials (for example, using multimedia, Braille, illustrated texts, simplified texts or captioned video)\n- providing alternative opportunities for students to represent their learning (for example, using technology and augmentative and alternative communication systems)\n- frequent cumulative review\n- providing opportunities for generalisation and maintenance\n- providing opportunities for the student to work at a faster pace (acceleration, compacting), at greater breadth (enrichment) and in more depth (extension).\nPersonalised learning using the environment\nApproaches may include:\n- providing peer assistance (for example, using buddy systems, peer-assisted learning and peer tutoring)\n- use of support personnel\n- scheduling (for example, a sequence of events)\n- use of technology and augmentative and alternative communication systems\n- providing access to alternative equipment and furnishings\n- providing physical access to the teaching and learning environment\n- changes to buildings and classrooms.\nIllustrations of personalised learning are short videos of authentic educational practice that bring the student diversity advice materials to life.

77	depression treatment combining therapy animals antidepressants together	The documents indicate that combining treatments can be beneficial. Animal-assisted therapy can be used as a complementary treatment alongside other interventions. For severe depression cases, a combined treatment approach is often suggested, typically using medications plus a form of psychotherapy. However, when using antidepressants, caution is needed as combining certain medications (particularly SSRIs or SNRIs) with other treatments can lead to complications like serotonin syndrome.

It damages individual’s personal and family relationships also job adjustments and public health. Depression influences your emotional state and changes the functioning through your mood. Common depressive moods are feelings of guilt, decrease in energy, and interest in daily activities, difficult in communication and withdraw from others (Ferizi). The most common causes of depression are genetics, brain chemistry imbalance, poor nutrition, physical health issue, drugs, and stress(schimelpfening). Depression is no piece of cake, if you fail to get treatment it can lead to some serious consequences.Therapy and antidepressants medications are solutions to depression that can lead to a better quality of life.\nThere are many forms of psychotherapy like CBT, IPT, “that were found to be superior to the outcomes achieved by the control group, with effect sizes ranging from .57(50%) to .87(87%) (Hunsley).” Cognitive Behavioral Therapy was developed in the 1906s and became a widely known and form of short-term psychotherapy. CBT focuses on specific problems using goal-oriented approach, “CBT helps patients reduce or eliminate thinking styles and behavior patterns that contribute to suffering. Typically, a therapist and patient work together to replace dysfunctional patterns with those that promote health and well-being (COX).” CBT help set goals and identify healthy strategies to incorporate in daily living. Interpersonal psychotherapy is also another short-term psychotherapy, it is an effective therapeutic approach in reducing symptoms of depression, that focus on structure, context and interpersonal skills. IPT reduces depressive symptoms in which effect a person’s by increasing communication skills, social skills, social performance, emotional expressiveness, and having a good level of social functioning (Ferizi).\nAntidepressant “is a psychiatric medication used to alleviate mood disorders (Van Leeuwen).” Antidepressant medication are one of the major approach’s to treating depression. The effects of antidepressants are not fully understood but it is known to restore the brains chemicals balance. Many different antidepressants are used to approve the symptoms that depression cause. For example, older antidepressants like Tofranil (imipramine) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as Nardil (phenelzine). Also, the newer ones like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Effexor, Serzone, and Remeron. These medications can usually control the symptoms of depression. It can last for four to eight weeks, but there are patients that stay on antidepressants for six months to a year (Nordenberg). Studies have shown that “around 60% of people respond by about two months to the drugs with about 50% reduction in their symptoms and improvement in mood, better sleep and so on. But he said, ‘about 80% of people stop antidepressants within a month (Boseley).”\nEven though antidepressant medication is just as effective as psychotherapy to improving quality of life. I would recommend the psychotherapy because the negative effect of antidepressants out way the negative downsides of going to therapy. Negative effects to watch out for when taking antidepressant medication are serotonin syndrome, hyponatremia, suicidal thoughts, allergic reaction, and mania are effects that are pretty much life threatening. There are other symptoms to these effects like weight gain, fatigue, blurred vision, insomnia, nausea, anxiety, confusion, agitation, muscle twitching, sweating, shivering, diarrhea, high fever, seizures, irregular heartbeat, and unconsciousness. Serotonin syndrome happens when neurochemicals in the brain are to high. It happens when SSRI or SNRI medication is combined with another medication that effects also effects serotonin. Too much serotonin is not good, it is like an overdose of meds.Hyponatemia is a condition where sodium, or salt levels in the blood decrease abnormally, this can cause dangerous amounts of fluid can build up inside the body’s cells which comes with its own cases of symptoms (Schimelpfening). Also, there a negative effect if you immediately stop taking your medication. These symptoms include electric shock sensations, tingling, vivid dreams, hallucinations, sweating, muscle pain, blurred vision, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, agitation, upset stomach, and fatigue(schimelpfening). Please consult your doctor before deciding to immediate stop taking your meds to prevent the negative effects.\nWhat are the downsides to talking about your feelings to a psychotherapist? Some of the downside to psychotherapy is that it is not a quick process, it takes time to figure out the hidden causes to your depression. Depending on the diagnosis on your depression whether is mild or severe is a factor that can determine the effects. If suffering from severe depression, then there will be a treatment that is suggested to gives results faster like medications. If that happens the treatment would be medication plus a form of psychotherapy. If it is a mild case of depression psychotherapy would probably be the choice of treatment. Another downside is the cost of the therapy sessions. If you don’t have enough money to pay that can render, you from getting the kind of therapy you do need.\nDepression is a mental illness that effects one’s behavior and emotions, it is a lack of feeling, lack of energy, sense of hopelessness, loss of interest, not able to do day-to-day activities. It is hard to deal with depression, but there are many well-known treatments for this mental illness. Cognitive Behavior Therapy, Interpersonal Psychotherapy are two psychotherapies that can reduce the symptoms of depression as well as antidepressants. CBT encourages and focuses on solutions to change the way you think and behave. Improving quality of life, emotional expressiveness and social skills. IPT focuses on ways to improve patients’ personal relationships and social functioning. Antidepressants are medications that is fast acting to improve the symptoms of depression. Psychotherapy and Antidepressants have the same effectivenessbut there are downsides to both treatments. So, personally I would go with the psychotherapy because therapy is better than unwanted side effects that medication brings when taken. When dealing with depression, therapy and antidepressants are treatments to better enhance the quality of life.\nCox, Darcy., et al. “Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy with older adults.” British Columbia Medical Journal, Sept.2011, Vol.53, Issue7, p348-352. 5p.

78	I work on spaceship propulsion and I'm curious about nuclear photonic rockets and their acceleration capabilities - what are their limitations with current technology, and how do they compare to newer laser-based propulsion systems?	Nuclear photonic rockets face significant limitations with current technology. They can only achieve very slow acceleration of about 0.1 mm/s² (10^-5g) using current fission reactor designs that generate up to 2.2 kW per kg of reactor mass. The power-to-thrust ratio is quite poor, requiring 300 MW of power per Newton of thrust. In comparison, newer laser-based propulsion systems like DE-STAR show much more promising thrust capabilities - they can achieve around 100 micronewtons per watt (10 kilowatts per newton), making them more efficient in power-to-thrust conversion. Additionally, laser propulsion systems allow for photon recycling techniques that can multiply the thrust force by bouncing photons back and forth, with current implementations achieving a 5x force multiplication factor.	"['- Nuclear photonic rocket\nIn a nuclear photonic rocket, a nuclear reactor would generate such high temperatures that the blackbody radiation from the reactor would provide significant thrust. The disadvantage is that it takes a lot of power to generate a small amount of thrust this way, so acceleration is very slow. The photon radiators would most likely be constructed using graphite or tungsten. Photonic rockets are technologically feasible, but rather impractical with current technology.\nEnergy requirements and comparisons\nThe power per thrust required for a perfectly collimated output beam is 300 MW/N (half this if it can be reflected off the craft); very high energy density power sources would be required to provide reasonable thrust without unreasonable weight. The specific impulse of a photonic rocket is harder to define, since the output has no (rest) mass and is not expended fuel; if we take the momentum per inertia of the photons, the specific impulse is just c, which is impressive. However, considering the mass of the source of the photons, e.g., atoms undergoing nuclear fission, brings the specific impulse down to 300 km/s (c/1000) or less; considering the infrastructure for a reactor (some of which also scales with the amount of fuel) reduces the value further. Finally, any energy loss not through radiation that is redirected precisely to aft but is instead conducted away by engine supports, radiated in some other direction, or lost via neutrinos or so will further degrade the efficiency. If we were to set 80% of the mass of the photon rocket = fissionable fuel, and recognizing that nuclear fission converts about 0.10 % of the mass into energy: then if the photon rocket masses 300,000 kg then 240,000 kg of that is atomic fuel. Therefore the fissioning of all of the fuel will result in the loss of just 240 kg of mass. Then 300,000/299,760 kg = an mi/mf of 1.0008. Vf = ln 1.008 × c where c = 300,000,000 m/s. Vf then may be 240,096 m/s which is 240 km/s. The nuclear fission powered photon rocket may accelerate at a maximum of perhaps 1/10,000 m/s² (0.1 mm/s²) which is 10−5g. The velocity change would be at the rate of 3,000 m/s per year of thrusting by the photon rocket.\nIf a photon rocket begins its journey in low earth orbit, then one year of thrusting may be required to achieve an earth escape velocity of 11.2 km/s if the vehicle is already in orbit at a velocity of 9,100 m/s, and 400 m/s additional velocity is obtained from the east to west rotation of the earth. The photon thrust will be sufficient to more than counterbalance the pull of the sun\'s gravity, allowing the photon rocket to maintain a heliocentric velocity of 30 km/s in interplanetary space upon escaping the Earth\'s gravitational field. Eighty years of steady photonic thrusting would be then required to obtain a final velocity of 240 km/s in this hypothetical case. At a 30 km/s heliocentric velocity, the photon ship would recede a distance of 600,000,000 miles (1 Tm) from the Sun per year.\nIt is possible to obtain even higher specific impulse; that of some other photonic propulsion devices (e.g., solar sails) is effectively infinite because no carried fuel is required. Alternatively, such devices as ion thrusters, while having a notably lower specific impulse, give a much better thrust-to-power ratio; for photons, that ratio is 1 / c, whereas for slow particles (that is, nonrelativistic; even the output from typical ion thrusters counts) the ratio is 2 / v, which is much larger (since ). (This is in a sense an unfair comparison, since the photons must be created and other particles are merely accelerated, but nonetheless the impulses per carried mass and per applied energy—the practical quantities—are as given.) The photonic rocket is thus wasteful when power and not mass is at a premium, or when enough mass can be saved through the use of a weaker power source that reaction mass can be included without penalty.\nA laser could be used as a photon rocket engine, and would solve the reflection/collimation problem, but lasers are absolutely less efficient at converting energy into light than blackbody radiation is—though one should also note the benefits of lasers vs blackbody source, including unidirectional controllable beam and the mass and durability of the radiation source.\nFeasible current, or near-term fission reactor designs can generate up to 2.2 kW per kilogram of reactor mass. Without any payload, such a reactor could drive a photon rocket at nearly 10−4 m/s² (10−5g; see g-force). This could perhaps provide interplanetary spaceflight capability from Earth orbit. Nuclear fusion reactors could also be used, perhaps providing somewhat higher power.\nA design proposed in the 1950s by Eugen Sänger used positron-electron annihilation to produce gamma rays. Sänger was unable to solve the problem of how to reflect, and collimate the gamma rays created by positron-electron annihilation; however, by shielding the reactions (or other annihilations) and absorbing their energy, a similar blackbody propulsion system could be created. An antimatter-matter powered photon rocket would (disregarding the shielding) obtain the maximum c specific impulse; for this reason, an antimatter-matter annihilation powered photon rocket could potentially be used for interstellar spaceflight.\n- Application of nuclear photon engines for deep-space exploration by Andrey V.

Hughes. DE-STAR initial objective is to deflect asteroids.\nThe DE-STAR system could be leveraged for many other uses, such as stopping the rotation of a spinning asteroid and achieving relativistic propulsion.\nTests simulated space conditions. Using basalt — the composition of which is similar to known asteroids — they directed a laser onto the basalt target until it glowed white hot — a process called laser ablation, which erodes material from the sample. This changes the object’s mass and produces a “rocket engine” using the asteroid itself as the propellant. In space, this would be powerful enough to alter its course.\nThe team simulated a spinning asteroid using basalt to determine whether they could slow, stop and change its rotation direction. They used magnets to spin the basalt and then directed the laser in the opposite direction to slow the rotation.\n“Our video shows the basalt sample slowing down, stopping and changing direction and then spinning up again,” said Brashears. “That’s how much force we’re getting. It’s a nice way to show this process and to demonstrate that de-spinning an asteroid is actually possible as predicted in our papers.”\nLab measurements have shown that in terms of thrust, the conversion of laser energy to force through this method is about 100 micronewtons per watt, which works out to 10 kilowatts per newton\nAccording to Lubin, a professor of physics at UCSB, manipulating the speed of a spinning asteroid offers another important possibility in space: the ability to explore, capture and mine asteroids. This is something NASA aims to do with its Asteroid Redirect Mission. The mission — which remains theoretical — is intended to visit a large near-Earth asteroid, collect and return a boulder from its surface and possibly redirect the asteroid into a stable orbit around the moon.\nPictures of Wafer Scale Spacecraft with laser on reflector. Includes fiber optic cables for cloaking\nand wafer as the payload. The red depicts the laser light.\nIn addition, the students explored photon propulsion, which is key to the group’s latest project, DEEP-IN, or Directed Energy Propulsion for Interstellar exploratioN. The DEEP-IN concept relies on photon propulsion, whereby thrust from photons emitted from the laser array could be used to propel a spacecraft. This allows for the possibility of relativistic flight — speeds approaching the speed of light — for the small spacecraft required for future interstellar missions.\nThe team also tested a photon recycler, a device that reuses photons from the laser by shining them on a reflector cavity. “We have a second mirror at some distance away that bounces the photons back and forth like a ping-pong ball onto the spacecraft reflector.” Brashears said. “In effect, we’re recycling these photons to achieve a force multiplication that allows the vehicle to go even faster. So far, with a simple implementation, we have achieved an amplification factor of five. Much more is possible with refinement. This works as predicted, though implementing it into the full flight system will be complex.”\nLaser pushed roadmap\nDirected Energy Interstellar Propulsion of WaferSats Getting to 25% of lightspeed will be over 4000 times faster than Voyager 1.\nResearchers propose a roadmap to a program that will lead to sending relativistic probes to the nearest stars and will open up a vast array of possibilities of flight both within our solar system and far beyond. Spacecraft from gram level complete spacecraft on a wafer (“wafer sats”) that reach more than ¼ c and reach the nearest star in 15 years to spacecraft with masses more than 100,000 kg (100 tons) that can reach speeds of near 1000 km/s such systems can be propelled to speeds currently unimaginable with our existing propulsion technologies. To do so requires a fundamental change in our thinking of both propulsion and in many cases what a spacecraft is. In addition to larger spacecraft, some capable of transporting humans, we consider functional spacecraft on a wafer, including integrated optical communications, optical systems and sensors combined with directed energy propulsion. Since “at home” the costs can be amortized over a very large number of missions. The human factor of exploring the nearest stars and exo-planets would be a profound voyage for humanity, one whose non-scientific implications would be enormous. It is time to begin this inevitable journey beyond our home.\nThey assume a slightly futuristic sail with thickness of 1 µm for many cases and 10 µm (thick even for todays sails). Future advancements in sails thickness down to 0.1 µm and below can be envisioned but are NOT assumed. They will only make the conclusions even more optimistic. The density of all sails we consider is about the same, namely ρ ~1,400 kg/m3\nWafer Scale Spacecraft\nRecent work at UCSB on Si photonics now allows us to design and build a “spacecraft on a wafer”. The recent (UCSB) work in phased array lasers on a wafer for ground-based optical communications combined with the ability to combine optical arrays (CMOS imagers for example) and MEMS accelerometers and gyros as well as many other sensors and computational abilities allows for extremely complex and novel systems. Traditional spacecraft are still largely built so that the mass is dominated by the packaging and interconnects rather than the fundamental limits on sensors. Our approach is similar to comparing a laptop of today to a super computer with similar power of 20 years ago and even a laptop is dominated by the human interface (screen and keyboard) rather than the processor and memory. Combining nano photonics, MEMS and electronics with recent UCSB work on Si nano wire thermal converters allows us to design a wafer that also has an embedded RTG or beta converter power source (recent LMCO work on thin film beta converters as an example) that can power the system over the many decades required in space. Combined with small photon thrusters (embedded LEDs/lasers for nN thrust steering on the wafer gives a functional spacecraft. While not suitable for every spacecraft design by any means, this approach opens up radically new possibilities. In addition the power from the laser itself can add significant power to the spacecraft even at large distances.\nThe laser sail is both similar to and fundamentally different than a solar sail. For small sails, even with low powers the flux can easily exceed 100 MW/m2 or 10000 Suns. This requires a very different approach to the sail. For the small reflectors we propose using a pure dielectric reflection coating on ultra-thin glass or other material. Spherical (bubbles) sails are an option for testing. The loss in fiber optic quality glasses allows loss in the ppt(10-12)/μm (of thickness) which is even better than we need. This is an area we need to explore much more. The flux at the tip of high power single mode fiber optic exceeds 10 TW/m2, higher than we need. Rather than the typical 1/4 reduced wavelength anti reflective (AR) dielectric coating, we will need to design a 1/2 wave reflection coating for the sail.\nThermoelectrics show the greatest promise for energy for the wafercraft in the near future. Plutonium-238, the traditional fuel source for radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) produces 560 mW/g of heat in its pure form, and 390 mW/g of heat in its fuel pellet form (Plutonium Dioxide). Current RTG technology (NASA’s Multi-Mission RTG, or MMRTG for short) has an electrical conversion efficiency of 6-7%. Assuming 6.5% efficiency from thermal to electrical conversion we get about 25 mw (electrical)/g. In order to generate 5 mw we need about 0.2 g.\nStirling engines are much more efficient with about 30-50% efficiency for the temperatures we can get BUT there are no chip scale Stirling engines and no 20-100 year lifetime Stirling engines currently exist even without the extreme requirement of chip level system. MEMS equivalents may be possible but this is a research item yet to be explored. This leaves open the possibility of much more power (by a factor of 5-10) that may be achieved. This would greatly expand our data rates as well as sensor suite possibility for the small systems\nG-Forces on Small-Scale Spacecrafts\nPossibly the greatest benefit of our wafer scale design is the high speeds our spacecraft can reach. We have discussed the ability of our ship to be accelerated to about 0.25c in ten minutes. This is an acceleration of roughly 10,000 g’s, an acceleration that could put a formidable strain on our delicate wafer. However, this may not be as big of a problem as it may seem. Many present day weapons systems incorporate electronic components into their artillery shells to correct trajectory mid flight. During launch, these electronic components must be able to sustain accelerations of at least 10,000 g’s, sometimes ranging to even higher than 15,000 g’s depending on the system. Upon muzzle exit, the artillery shells are subject to substantial pressure changes, resulting in significant shocks and vibrations. Our spacecraft would not be subject to such volatile environment, as our acceleration takes place over a period of at least ten minutes, rather than a fraction of a second. Many methods have been successfully developed to house electronic components during launch, most involving some sort of shock absorbing material such as foam or gel. It is reasonable to think that a similar method could be used for our spacecraft.\nPhoton recycling for larger thrust and efficiency\nThe efficiency of the photon drive can be improved by reusing the photons reflected by the spacecraft reflector in an effective optical cavity mode to get multiple photon reflections. This is known as photon recycling. It is not a new concept but may be of some use for some of our applications.\nFree space phase control over large distances during the acceleration phase will be a critical enabling capability. This will require understanding the optics, phase noise and systematic effects of our combined onboard metrology and off-board phase servo feedback. Reflector stability during acceleration will also be on the critical path as will increasing the TRL of the amplifiers for space use. For convenience we break the roadmap into several steps.\nOne of the critical development items for space deployment is greatly lowering the mass of the radiators. While this sounds like a decidedly low tech item to work on, it turns out to be one of the critical mass drivers for space deployment. Current radiators have a mass to radiated power of 25 kg/kw, for radiated temperatures near 300K. This is an area where some new ideas are needed. With our current Yb fiber baseline laser amplifier mass to power of 5kg/kw (with a likely 5 year roadmap to 1 kg/kw) and current space photovoltaics of less than 7 kg/kw, the radiators are a serious issue for large-scale space deployment.\nMass and speed with 100 GW laser\n1 gram 24% of lightspeed 10 grams 14% of lightspeed 100 grams 7.8% of lightspeed 1 kg 4.3% of lightspeed 10kg 2.4% of lightspeed 100kg 1.4% of lightspeed 1000kg 0.77% of lightspeed 10 tons 0.43% of lightspeed 100 tons 0.24% of lightspeed\nSOURCE – UCSB\nBrian Wang is a Futurist Thought Leader and a popular Science blogger with 1 million readers per month.

79	How does Humanium Metal create change and measure success?	Humanium Metal creates change through a multi-step process that combines business operations with community development. They first understand the local context and conduct collaborative planning, followed by concrete actions like weapons collection and recycling. This leads to community and system changes that modify both protective and risk factors in the environment. Success is measured through multiple outcomes: business metrics (over $5 million in product sales), community reinvestment ($1.2 million channeled to partners), and improvements in distant outcomes like reduced violence and increased employment. This aligns with community development principles that recognize how multiple factors affect outcomes and how changes in one area interconnect with other concerns.	"['SIRU 2.0 Case: Humanium Metal\n""The Most Precious Metal on Earth""\nCase Author: Mark Edwards Opens in new window.\nThis case presents the case of the social innovation Humanium Metal and its parent organization, Individuell Människohjälp or IM Swedish Development Partne External link, opens in new window.r, and two IM entrepreneurs who were intimately involved in the founding and development of the Humanium Metal venture. The case materials were collated from online sources and from interviews with two IM entrepreneurs Simon, Business and Innovation Manager for Humanium Metal and Jaqueline, Program and Advocacy Lead for Humanium Metal. From our analysis of these sources, insights are developed into how the leaders overcome obstacles to express their core values in powerful and persuasive ways. The case provides insights into the alignment between personal commitment and organizational purpose and mission.\nHumanium Metal is a social innovation begun by its parent organization IM which is a Swedish international development organization working in the fields of poverty elimination, social inclusion, and sustainability. It was founded by the Swedish social entrepreneur and politician Britta Holmström in 1938 as a response to the growing humanitarian crisis in Europe. IM grew rapidly during and immediately after World War II and provided support for the many refugees and victims of that tumultuous conflict. Since then, the work of IM has concentrated on collaborative projects and the individual worth of every person as a counter to the oppression and violence that often results from ideological conflict and systemic corruption. IM works with all levels of society to create social, economic, and environmental initiatives that target the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Currently, IM has established operations in many regions of the world including Central America, the Middle East, South Asia, and Southern Africa.\nHumanium Metal (HM) is a social business enterprise initiated by IM. HM’s mission is to reduce gun violence by recycling weapons into metal products and using the revenues for peace-building and justice programs. The purpose of HM is to:\n[E]mpower and support survivors of violence, giving them strength, knowledge and confidence in themselves to stand up against violence. Youths reclaim public spaces as violence-free zones and mobilize their communities to unite against violence. (Humanium Metal, 2020)\nIn effect, HM’s mission is to transform violence into beauty, to recycle gun metal into something that communicates peace through aesthetics and artistic design. Gun violence is a destructive and terrorizing force in both advanced and impoverished countries. Gang warfare, illegal militias, and organized crime syndicates can cause immense harm in communities where guns are easily available. Sometimes governments implement weapons destruction programs, gun moratoriums and seizure programs in affected regions and stockpile the gathered weapons. HM breaks down these stockpiles of weapons, extracts the metal, called Humanium Metal, and transforms it into metal ingots and metal powder. It then engages with businesses, entrepreneurs, designers, and artists to develop products such as watches, jewellery, machines, and works of art. HM products are designed and marketed as “commodities for peace” so customers are informed of the HM mission and can feel that they are contributing to its mission.\nHM was first produced in 2016 in El Salvador, with firearms seized by the Salvadoran government. El Salvador was chosen as a pilot-region for the business, as the country is heavily affected by high levels of armed violence. There is also strong support at many levels of society to address this issue to achieve inclusive socio-economic development in the region. In 2018 HM expanded further into Zambia and the United States of America. Humanium Metal offers a strong voice against armed violence in the USA, where access to weapons is often seen as the simple solution to complex problems. IM believes that access to weapons is one of the fundamental problems facing all communities especially those in developing nations. Figure 1 shows the basic outlines of the HM circular business model. The most common method for producing Humanium Metal is through government seizure programs. Illegal firearms are “destroyed” and the metal melted down and turned into ingots, wire, or pellets. The metal is sent to Sweden and reduced to a powder that can be more easily used in the 3D printing production of metal products. Examples of products using Humanium Metal in their manufacturing include watches, pens, spinning tops, buttons, bracelets, and headphones.\nThe income generated is re-invested into communities affected by gun violence and so aims to break the vicious cycle of violence and poverty. Host community activities funded from the business’s profits include supporting survivors of armed violence with income generation, empowering communities to reclaim public spaces as violence-free zones, empowering youths to choose violence-free paths, and supporting communities to advocate for legislation that prevents gun violence. The revenues flowing from the overall sale of HM products have exceeded 5 million US dollars since the beginning of the enterprise. The income generated for societal change has now exceeded 1.2 million US dollars with all this money being channelled to HM community partners. The business activity of upcycling a commodity used for violence and killing into consumable goods for peace creates a platform for a global movement for peace and security.\nThe HM Business Model and Circularity\nWith such intense human justice, community safety and physical security issues in play, ethical dilemmas and opportunities frequently arise in the HM workplace. Figure 1 shows that multiple stakeholders are intimately involved in the social-ecological value network of the HM business model. One interesting feature of the circular nature of their value network is that HM aims to reduce the need for guns in the same neighbourhoods where they come from. HM is investing in a process they hope will result in a diminishing supply of the essential input material, that is, metal from guns. This goal will, of course, disturb the organized system of violence and illegal economy that currently impacts the communities where guns are collected. For some, fewer guns will mean diminished power and that can cause conflict. So, working with HM is not without its risks and this is even more true for the local coordinators and volunteers who are actively involved in the community reinvestment programs.\nThere has been a terrible parade of contributing factors to the ongoing community violence that harms local community life. The postcolonial impact of institutionalized violence, decades of government neglect, lack of economic stability, geopolitical trickery, violent foreign intervention, political instability, the ready availability of firearms and more recently the destabilizing effects of climate change combine to produce a deadly cocktail of destabilizing intimidation and violence. Even amid all this however, communities are still full of life and demonstrating resilience to partner with local and international agencies to seek solutions. Breaking the cycle of violence with the recycling of gunmetal, however, challenges the established power order and can therefore upset the organized centres of corrupt political and gang power. But the benefits are so transformative that local groups, affected families, courageous individuals, and community leaders are willing to take the risks and work with HM to create the social benefits that flow from the HM business model. This is a powerful form of social regenerativity. Regenerative sustainability goes well beyond reducing carbon emissions of harming the environment and actively seeks to revitalize natural systems through innovative and restorative practices. Social regenerativity aims to do that for human communities.\n We use social-ecological value network as a more accurate term for the web of human and ecological relationships that all companies are immersed’. The usual jargon of “supply chain” simply does not capture the profound interpenetration of biophysical systems that underpins all elements of economic production and consumption. The systems that HM is working with are not just about mechanical chains of supply and demand pressures. The human and the ecological are intimately interconnected in multilayered networks, not linear chains. The environmental, communal, and ethical factors involved in their work are complex and inclusive of all kinds of emotional, ecological, intellectual, physical value that cannot be reduced to the economic forces of linear supply and demand models.\nThe notion of regenerative sustainability takes on profound meaning in the context of the HM circular business model. Take the case of David from Central America. David was a boy of twelve getting up early to go to work one day when, just as he stepped onto the street outside his family home, he was shot. No rhyme or reason to it, just pure, purposeless violence. The gun was there, the perpetrator’s unknown story of abuse and violence was there, and David was left in the street hanging grimly onto his life. The gunshot had torn through his spinal cord and left David with paralysis in his lower body. With the support of his family and community and financial support from HM, David slowly recovered and went home to learn how to live with his wheelchair. But David has immense courage and spirit and soon began to work towards his dreams and put his entrepreneurial business skills to work. He sells street wares in the local towns from his wheelchair and is now saving money for his further education and business ventures. HM supports the victims of gun violence like David and his family. They provide funding but also training and skills development to help families recover from violence and lead lives that they are proud of. All this takes creativity and determination, qualities that characterize all the HM staff.\nSocial dilemmas as motivating opportunities\nWhile there will be strong alignment for many of the views and goals of the many different actors involved in HM’s social-ecological value network, conflicts will always arise. There can also be confounding problems in the multiple goals that HM aims to achieve. For example, one area that has been difficult for HM staff is the contentious issue of the environmental impact of the smelting of weapons. Turning the gun metal into something that can be of value for crafting high-quality jewellery is a costly and energy-rich process that consumes a lot of energy and produces copious amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. Even when alternative energy sources can be found the environmental impact of the manufacturing, transportation and packaging processes can be significant. HM staff work actively to minimize these aspects of the HM value networks and uses these constraints as motivation for further innovation. The occasional misalignment between environmental and social sustainability spurs her towards finding solutions.\nHM and the Three Pillars of Regenerative Sustainability\nThe HM enterprise and the entrepreneurs that lead and direct its activities, portray the social sustainability side of regenerativity. Regenerativity has typically been presented in the sustainability literature as having a predominantly environmental focus. This is not surprising given the heightened awareness and increasing urgency of environmental issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss and impending tipping points in crucial Earth biophysical systems. HM, however, places its focus on regenerating human communities by removing weapons and reinvesting in neighbourhood security, education, and employment. This is usefully seen as a social form of regenerative sustainability. Interestingly, IM, HM’s parent organization, supports sustainable farming and community gardening programs in these same communities to improve food security, nutrition, and skill development. The aim is to have regenerative impacts on both human and ecological communities. HM presents an interesting case where the three pillars of sustainability – the economic, the social and the environmental – are each treated from a regenerative perspective. The social regeneration of communities drives the three pillars of the sustainability transition process (see Figure 2). Regenerating communities’ social well-being results in all those social benefits that flow from greater neighbourhood security including education, gender issues, increased personal freedom and political empowerment. This social regenerativity drives economic regeneration through improved security and freedoms allowing economic activity to expand, people can move and work more freely, and offering alternatives to the destructive problem of young people being drawn into lives of violence, corruption, and organized criminality. Finally, social regenerativity drives the environmental regeneration that comes when people can move safely to tend to their neighbourhood gardens and produce food locally. Figure 4.2 depicts these dynamics that flow from HM’s focus on social regenerativity. The cascading benefits that accrue economically and environmentally would not occur without the circular social regenerativity that the HM business models enable.\nBeing a regenerative entrepreneur in this social context of ‘three pillar circularity’ means that personal stories, histories, and purposes can be drawn on to create multiple forms of benefits that restore the resilience of natural and social systems. Circularity is frequently portrayed as a technical strategy for developing sustainability, but in this example, we see the power of social circularity and the kinds of sustainability and ethical competencies for building the social infrastructure of a very innovative form of circular business model.\nThe HM business model not only injects regenerative social sustainability into the communities it works with, but it also brings a regenerative and revitalizing balance to all the stakeholders who are involved in the enterprise. Working in the international development and sustainability fields can be a draining if not exhausting vocation. While this is true of the HM enterprise, there is also a rejuvenating side to the work that restores faith in people and in the power of community resourcefulness. Regenerativity is not only about revitalizing the exterior worlds of ecologies, communities, and economies. It is also about regenerating the interior qualities that power personal inspiration and commitment.\nHM places a big emphasis on developing staff’s “self-leadership” capacities. For staff to define and develop “their own priorities and goals” these objectives ultimately become the orienting framework to work towards. These interior goals become as, or even more, important than the formal organizational goals of KPIs. The regenerative power of the work of HM operates at all levels from the specific task objectives and program goals to the business strategies and business models through to the guiding values and overall mission and purpose of the enterprise. Figure 3 draws attention to how the entrepreneur’s personal backgrounds invigorated each of these work levels.\nEmancipation, Regenerativity and Entrepreneurship\nEntrepreneurship has been likened to a form of emancipation that frees people from the constraints of the status quo. For example, Rindova, Barry and Ketchen (2009) take the perspective that:\nViewing entrepreneurial projects as emancipatory efforts focuses on understanding the factors that cause individuals to seek to disrupt the status quo and change their position in the social order in which they are embedded (Rindova et al., 2009, p. 478)\nThe HM enterprise can be seen as disruptive not only related to the violent systems of corruption and criminality that characterize the suburbs and towns that it operates in. It is disruptive of the culture of weapons manufacturing, the geo-political causes of community violence and the flow of drugs, illegal financial proceeds and human trafficking that cut across international borders. Ultimately HM is disruptive of the feeling that problems always lie elsewhere and that we are not intimately connected. The global nature of the HM circularity model disrupts the view that the economy sets the contexts and priorities for society. For example, extractive economies not only instrumentalize nature and ecological systems, that is, consider them as resources for making a profit, but they also instrumentalize ‘human resources’. In Triple Bottom Line terminology, extractive economies, whenever it is legally possible, prioritize profits over people and the planet. The social regeneration model of HM flips these priorities. It does not leave profit or financial responsibilities out of the picture but sets human communities as the benefit to be priorities. The socially and ecologically extractive approach that underpins a significant proportion of international trade is disrupted by HM’s offer of socially regenerative forms of renewal. This injection of regenerativity extends stakeholders’ sense of connection and responsibility towards other individuals, other communities, towards future generations, irrespective of where in the circular loop of regeneration they might be.\nHumanium Metal.

Austin, Texas: Greenleaf.', 'Tool 1: Principles, assumptions, and values that guide the work of building healthy communities\n- Community health improvement involves the population as a whole, not merely individuals at risk for specific physical, mental, or social conditions.\n- Community health requires changes in both the behaviors of large numbers of individuals and the conditions or social determinants that affect health and development.\n- A healthy community is a local product with priority issues and strategies best determined by those most affected by the concern.\n- Freedom and justice require reducing income disparities to promote optimal health and development for all.\n- Since health and development outcomes are caused by multiple factors, single interventions are likely to be insufficient.\n- The conditions that affect a particular health or development concern are often interconnected with those affecting other concerns.\n- Since the behaviors that affect health and development occur among a variety of people in an array of contexts, community improvement requires engagement of diverse groups through different parts of the community.\n- Statewide and community partnerships, support organizations, and grantmakers are catalysts for change: they attempt to convene important parties, broker relationships, and leverage needed resources.\n- The aim of support organizations is to build capacity to address what matters to people over time and across concerns.\n- Community health and development involves interdependent relationships among multiple parties in which none can function fully without the cooperation of others.\nTool 2: Using this model of change--""Building capacity for community change""\n1. Community Context and Planning\nThe first step in the process is understanding the context in which people act. By the context, we mean people\'s experiences, their dreams for a better life, and what makes them do what they do.\nWith an understanding of the context, the group can move forward with planning. Collaborative planning is a critical and ongoing task of a successful organization. It brings together people and organizations with different experiences and resources. Together, they clarify or develop the group\'s vision, mission, objectives, strategies, and action steps. In doing so, they can bring about changes in the community.\n2. Community Action and Intervention\nThe planning process should be followed by action--going out and doing what was outlined. Sometimes, there is serious resistance to efforts that will need to be overcome.\n3. Community and System Change\nThe goal of planning and action is to bring about community and system changes. Bringing about these changes is an important step towards achieving your organizational goals. By community change, we mean developing a new program (or modifying and existing one), bringing about a change in policy, or adjusting a practice related to the group\'s mission. system changes are similar to community changes, but take place on a broader level.\n4. Risk and Protective Factors and Widespread Behavior Change\nOur belief is that when these community and system changes occur, they should, taken together, change the environment in which a person behaves. This is sometimes referred to as increasing protective factors and/or decreasing the risk factors that community members face.\nRisk and protective factors are aspects of a person\'s environment or personal features that make it more likely (risk factors) or less likely (protective factors) that she will develop a given problem. Often, risk and protective factors can be considered flip sides of the same coin. The intended effect of environmental change is widespread behavior change.\n5. Improve More Distant Outcomes\nImprovements in more distant outcomes, such as reducing violence or increasing employment rates and family incomes, are the ultimate goals of collaborative partnerships. By reducing the risk factors (and enhancing the protective factors) for the issue you are trying to address, you will affect the bottom line. Data on community-level indicators can help you determine just how much progress you have made towards your ultimate goals.']"	['<urn:uuid:4009bb54-16f2-4991-aa44-caaa2783bc46>', '<urn:uuid:95b126cb-6274-477a-98ab-d87b2e85d593>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	9	106	3332
80	What are some famous historical performers who have entertained audiences along the Rhine River cruise route and at the Tabor Opera House, and how were these venues built to provide exceptional entertainment experiences?	Both venues hosted renowned performers in their history. The Rhine River cruise features classical music performances including works by Haydn, Schumann, Bach, and Mozart, with concerts both aboard and in venues like St. Thomas church in Strasbourg. Meanwhile, the Tabor Opera House welcomed celebrated artists like John Philip Sousa, Oscar Wilde, Sarah Bernhardt, and Anna Held, and even hosted a circus with tigers. Regarding construction, the Rhine cruise ships feature outside staterooms and dedicated performance spaces, while the Tabor Opera House was impressively built in just 100 days in 1879 using materials transported by wagon. The opera house was constructed with 16-inch thick brick walls, decorated in red, gold, white and sky blue colors, and illuminated by 72 gas lights, making it the finest theatre between St. Louis and San Francisco at the time.

Please check back for news of the 2022 season.\nHistory and Revitalization\nThe Tabor Opera House was built in 1879 by silver mining magnate Horace Austin Warner (HAW) Tabor. In its heyday, the Tabor hosted conductor John Philip Sousa, British wit Oscar Wilde, actress Sarah Bernhardt, performer Anna Held, and more celebrities. Even a circus with tigers has paraded across the stage.\nAround the turn of the century, 150 opera houses graced the state. Today, only eight stand as a proud monument to Colorado history. The City of Leadville purchased the Tabor Opera House in 2016. Now, the city and the Tabor Opera House Preservation Foundation are working to revitalize this magnificent brick theater. The future Tabor will be a cultural hub and economic driver for Leadville.\nHow the Tabor Opera House was Built\nThe Tabor Opera House was built in 1879 by Horace Austin Warner (HAW) Tabor, one of Colorado’s most well known mining magnates. It was one of the most costly and most substantially built structures in Colorado history. The construction materials were not available in Leadville, so HAW Tabor ordered that they be brought up by wagons… a tedious task. Nevertheless, the Tabor was completed in only 100 days from the date of ground-breaking, which was a record time.\nThe massive three-story opera house was constructed of stone, brick, and iron, and trimmed with Portland cement. Its solid brick walls stand 16 inches thick. The color scheme used was red, gold, white, and sky blue, lit by 72 jets of brightly burning gas lights. This substantial construction has weathered the test of time.\nEvelyn Livingston Furman\nEvelyn Livingston Furman, who sold Maytag wringer washers, bought the Tabor Opera House from the Elks in 1954 and personally ran it until she was 84 years old. Along the way, Evelyn wrote three books that tell the story of the Opera House, Augusta Tabor, and Silver Dollar Tabor. Eventually, she turned the controls to her daughter Sharon Furman Bland and her husband Bill.\nTabor to Become a Cultural Hub\nIn November 2016, the City of Leadville purchased the Tabor Opera House. Now, the city and the Tabor Opera House Preservation Foundation are revitalizing this grand old building to become a center for diverse arts and culture in the heart of Leadville.\nThe first major rehabilitation of the Tabor since 1879 started in the spring of 2020. The only other building repair on this scale was a remodel led by the Elks in 1902. Phase I of construction will fix the most fragile west and south walls. Completion is expected in 2021.\nThe $1.5 million cost was funded by the Colorado Department of Local Affairs (DOLA) ($830,000), National Park Service ($500,000), and the City of Leadville ($20,000). In addition, Tabor fans in Colorado and nationwide won $150,000 for the project in the Leadville Main Street Program’s Partners in Preservation campaign in 2018. Supporters voted online over six weeks and won the Tabor first place in a national contest.\nThe Tabor has been named a National Treasure by the National Trust for Historic Preservation and an Endangered Place by Colorado Preservation, Inc.

81	regular pathologist forensic pathologist main difference purpose examination	The main difference is their purpose - regular pathologists examine tissue samples to diagnose diseases and assess tumors in living patients, while forensic pathologists perform autopsies on deceased individuals to investigate medico-legal aspects of death such as determining cause of death and interpreting injuries.	"['A pathology report is a medical document written by a pathologist. A pathologist is a doctor who diagnoses disease by:\nExplaining laboratory tests\nEvaluating cells, tissues, and organs\nThe report gives a diagnosis based on the pathologist’s examination of a sample of tissue taken from the patient’s tumor. This sample of tissue, called a specimen, is removed during a biopsy. Learn about the various types of biopsies.\nBy looking at and testing the tumor tissue, the pathologist is able to find out:\nIf the tissue is noncancerous or cancerous. A cancerous tumor is malignant, meaning it can grow and spread to other parts of the body. A noncancerous, or benign tumor, means the tumor can grow but will not spread.\nOther specific details about the tumor’s features. This information helps your doctor figure out the best treatment options.\nYour doctor will receive these test results as they become available. It may take a few days to a few weeks to receive the full report. The timing depends on the testing needed. You are allowed by law to receive a copy of your pathology report. But you should expect the report to contain highly technical medical terms. Ask your doctor to explain the results in the pathology report and what they mean.\nParts of a pathology report\nDifferent pathologists use different words to describe the same things. But most pathology reports include the sections discussed below.\nPatient, doctor, and specimen\nThis section lists the following items:\nPatient\'s name, birth date, and other personal information\nAn individual number assigned to the patient to help identify samples\nThe pathologist’s and oncologist’s contact information, as well as the laboratory where the sample was tested\nDetails about the specimen, including the type of biopsy or surgery and the type of tissue\nGross, or obvious, description\nThis section describes the tissue sample or tumor as seen with the naked eye. This includes the general color, weight, size, and consistency.\nThis is the most technical section of the report. It describes what the cancer cells look like when viewed under a microscope. There are several factors noted in this section that affect diagnosis and treatment.\nWhether the cancer is invasive. Tumors of many types may be noninvasive (in situ, which means “in place”) or invasive. Invasive tumors can spread to other parts of the body through a process called metastasis. Although noninvasive tumors do not spread, they may grow or develop into an invasive tumor in the future. For invasive tumors, it is important for the pathologist to note how much the tumor has grown into nearby healthy tissue.\nGrade. Grade describes how the cancer cells look compared with healthy cells. In general, the pathologist is looking for differences in the size, shape, and staining features of the cells. A tumor with cells that look more like healthy cells is called ""low grade"" or ""well differentiated."" A tumor with cells that look less like healthy cells is called ""high grade,"" ""poorly differentiated,"" or ""undifferentiated."" In general, the lower the tumor’s grade, the better the prognosis. There are different methods used to assign a cancer grade for different types of cancers. Learn more about grading for specific cancer types.\nHow quickly cells are dividing, mitotic rate. The pathologist usually notes how many cells are dividing. This is called the mitotic rate. Tumors with fewer dividing cells are usually low grade.\nTumor margin. Another important factor is whether there are cancer cells at the margins, or edges, of the biopsy sample. A “positive” or “involved” margin means there are cancer cells in the margin. This means that it is likely that cancerous cells are still in the body.\nLymph nodes. The pathologist will also note whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs. Lymph nodes are tiny, bean-shaped organs that help fight disease. A lymph node is called “positive” when it contains cancer and “negative” when it does not. A tumor that has grown into blood or lymph vessels is more likely to have spread elsewhere. If the pathologist sees this, he or she will include it in the report.\nStage. Usually, the pathologist assigns a stage using the TNM system from the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). This system uses 3 factors:\nThe size and location of the tumor (Tumor, T)\nWhether cancer cells have spread to the lymph nodes located near the tumor (Node, N)\nWhether the tumor has spread to other parts of the body (Metastasis, M).\nPathologic stage, along with the results of other diagnostic tests, helps determine the clinical stage of the cancer. This information guides a person’s treatment options. Learn more about the stages of cancer.\nResults of other tests. The pathologist may perform special tests to identify specific genes, proteins, and other factors unique to the tumor. The results of these tests may be listed in a separate section or in a separate report. These additional tests are especially important for diagnosis because choosing the best treatment option may depend on these results.\nThis section provides the ""bottom line."" You may find this section at the beginning or the end of the report. If cancer has been diagnosed, the section may include the following:\nThe type of cancer, such as carcinoma or sarcoma\nLymph node status\nAny other test results, such as whether the tumor has hormone receptors or other tumor markers\nSynoptic report, or summary\nWhen the tumor was removed, the pathologist will include a summary. This lists the most important results in a table. These are the items considered most important in determining a person’s treatment options and chance of recovery.\nSometimes, a cancer may be difficult to diagnose or the development of the cancer is unclear. In these situations, the pathologist may use the comments section. Here, he or she can explain the issues and recommend other tests. This section may also include other information that can help the doctor plan treatment.\nSometimes, the pathology report for a biopsy may be different from a later report for the entire tumor. This happens because the features of a tumor can sometimes vary in different areas. Your doctor will consider all of the reports to develop a treatment plan specific to you.\nQuestions to ask your health care team\nTo better understand what your pathology report means, consider asking your health care team the following questions:\nWhat type of cancer do I have and where did it start?\nHow large is the tumor?\nIs the cancer invasive or noninvasive?\nHow fast are the cancer cells growing?\nWhat is the grade of the cancer? What does this mean?\nWas the entire cancer removed? Are there signs of cancer cells at the edges of the sample?\nAre there cancer cells in the lymph vessels or blood vessels?\nWhat is the stage of the cancer? What does this mean?\nDoes the pathology report specify the tumor characteristics clearly? Should we get another pathologist’s opinion?\nDo any tests need to be done again on another sample or in another laboratory?\nGetting a second opinion\nIt may be helpful to talk with more than one doctor about your diagnosis and treatment plan. This is called a second opinion. It is important to get a copy of the pathology report and any other medical records.\nIf you choose to get a second opinion, you will want to share these with the second doctor. Some doctors work closely with their own pathologists and may want their own pathologist\'s opinion too. Other tests can also be done on the biopsy sample if needed. The tissue sample is kept for a long time and is available upon request. Learn more about getting a second opinion.', ""what is forensic pathology?\nForensic pathology is a sub-specialty of histopathology, and is concerned with the application of pathological principles to the investigation of the medico-legal aspects of death.\nForensic pathologists are medically qualified doctors who perform autopsies (postmortem examinations) on those who have died suddenly, unexpectedly, or as a result of trauma or poisoning.\nThe forensic investigation of death is a multi-disciplinary activity, involving the collaboration between pathologists, crime scene investigators (CSIs), forensic scientists, and other specialists, such as anthropologists, entomologists, odontologists (dentists) and many other experts.\nAutopsy findings are combined with the results of other investigations, including the microscopic examination of organs and tissues removed at autopsy, toxicological analyses (of blood and urine, for example), and correlated with the available clinical or medical history of the deceased, as well as the circumstances of their death, in order to answer questions relating to their death.\nThe issues raised by a death may include:\n- identification of the deceased,\n- the medical cause of death,\n- the interpretation of injuries, and\n- the manner of death (in some jurisdictions), i.e. accident, suicide or homicide\nThose who have dissected or inspected many bodies have at least learned to doubt, while those who are ignorant of anatomy and do not take the trouble to attend to it, are in no doubt at all.\nGiovanni Morgagni (1682-1771)\nTaceant colloquia.

Introduction and Preliminaries\nThe applications of mathematics in other disciplines, for example in informatics, play a key role, and they represent, in the last decades, one of the purposes of the study of the experts of hyperstructures theory all over the world. Hyperstructure theory was introduced in 1934 by a French mathematician Marty , at the 8th Congress of Scandinavian Mathematicians, where he defined hypergroups based on the notion of hyperoperation, began to analyze their properties, and applied them to groups. In the following decades and nowadays, a number of different hyperstructures are widely studied from the theoretical point of view and for their applications to many subjects of pure and applied mathematics and computer science by many mathematicians. In a classical algebraic structure, the composition of two elements is an element, while in an algebraic hyperstructure, the composition of two elements is a set. Some principal notions about hyperstructures and semihypergroups theory can be found in [1–7].\nThe Theory of ideals, in its modern form, is a contemporary development of mathematical knowledge to which mathematicians of today may justly point with pride. Ideal theory is important not only for the intrinsic interest and purity of its logical structure but because it is a necessary tool in many branches of mathematics and its applications such as in informatics, physics, and others. As an example of applications of the concept of an ideal in informatics, let us mention that ideals of algebraic structures have been used recently to design efficient classification systems, see [8–12].\nThe study of LA-semigroup as a generalization of commutative semigroup was initiated in 1972 by Kazim and Naseeruddin . They have introduced the concept of an LA-semigroup and have investigated some basic but important characteristics of this structure. They have generalized some useful results of semigroup theory. Since then, many papers on LA-semigroups appeared showing the importance of the concept and its applications [13–23]. In this paper, we generalize this notion introducing the notion of LA-semihypergroup which is a generalization of LA-semigroup and semihypergroup, proposing so a new kind of hyperstructure for further studying. It is a useful nonassociative algebraic hyperstructure, midway between a hypergroupoid and a commutative hypersemigroup, with wide applications in the theory of flocks etc. Although the hyperstructure is nonassociative and noncommutative, nevertheless, it possesses many interesting properties which we usually find in associative and commutative algebraic hyperstructures. A several properties of hyperideals of LA-semihypergroup are investigated. In this note, we define the topological space and study the topological structure of LA-semihypergroups using hyperideal theory. The topological spaces formation guarantee for the preservation of finite intersection and arbitrary union between the set of hyperideals and the open subsets of resultant topologies.\nRecall first the basic terms and definitions from the hyperstructure theory.\nDefinition 1.1. A map is called hyperoperation or join operation on the set , where is a nonempty set and denotes the set of all nonempty subsets of .\nDefinition 1.2. A hyperstructure is called the pair , where is a hyperoperation on the set .\nDefinition 1.3. A hyperstructure is called a semihypergroup if for all , , which means that\nIf and are nonempty subsets of , then\nDefinition 1.4. A nonempty subset of a semihypergroup is called a sub-semihypergroup of if , and is called in this case super-semihypergroup of .\nDefinition 1.5. Let be a semihypergroup. Then is called a hypergroup if it satisfies the reproduction axiom, for all , .\nDefinition 1.6. A hypergrupoid is called an LA-semihypergroup if, for all ,\nEvery LA-semihypergroup satisfies the medial law, that is, for all ,\nIn every LA-semihypergroup with left identity, the following law holds: for all .\nAn element in an LA-semihypergroup is called identity if . An element 0 in a semihypergroup is called zero element if . A subset of an LA-semihypergroup is called a right (left) hyperideal if and is called a hyperideal if it is two-sided hyperideal, and if is a left hyperideal of , then becomes a hyperideal of . By a bi-hyperideal of an LA-semihypergroup , we mean a sub-LA-semihypergroup of such that . It is easy to note that each right hyperideal is a bi-hyperideal. If has a left identity, then it is not hard to show that is a bi-hyperideal of and . If denotes the set of all idempotents subsets of with left identity , then forms a hypersemilattice structure, also if , then . The intersection of any set of bi-hyperideals of an LA-semihypergroup is either empty or a bi-hyperideal of . Also the intersection of prime bi-hyperideals of an LA-semihypergroup is a semiprime bi-hyperideal of .\n2. Main Results\nProposition 2.1. Let be an LA-semihypergroup with left identity, a left hyperideal, and a bi-hyperideal of . Then and are bi-hyperideals of .\nProof. Using the medial law (1.4), we get also Hence, is a bi-hyperideal of . we obtain also Hence, is a bi-hyperideal of .\nProposition 2.2. Let be an LA-semihypergroup with left identity and two bi-hyperideals of . Then is a bi-hyperideal of .\nProof. Using (1.4), we get\nBy the above, if and are nonempty, then and are connected bi-hyperideals. Proposition 2.1 leads us to an easy generalization, that is, if are bi-hyperideals of an LA-semihypergroup with left identity, then are bi-hyperideals of , consequently the set of bi-hyperideals forms an LA-semihypergroup.\nIf is an LA-semihypergroup with left identity , then and are bi-hyperideals of . It can be easily shown that , , and . Hence, this implies that and . Also, , , , , and (if is an idempotent), consequently . It is easy to show that .\nLemma 2.3. Let be an LA-semihypergroup with left identity, and let be an idempotent bi-hyperideal of . Then is a hyperideal of .\nProof. By the definition of LA-semihypergroup (1.3), we have and every right hyperideal in with left identity is left.\nLemma 2.4. Let be an LA-semihypergroup with left identity , and let be a proper bi-hyperideal of . Then .\nProof. Let us suppose that . Since , using (1.3), we have . It is impossible. So, .\nIt can be easily noted that .\nProposition 2.5. Let be an LA-semihypergroup with left identity, and let be bi-hyperideals of . Then the following statements are equivalent: (1)every bi-hyperideal is idempotent, (2),(3)the hyperideals of form a hypersemilattice , where .\nProof. (1)⇒(2). Using Lemma 2.3, it is easy to note that . Since implies , hence .\n(2)⇒(3). and . Similarly, associativity follows. Hence, is a hypersemilattice.\nA bi-hyperideal of an LA-semihypergroup is called a prime bi-hyperideal if implies either or for every bi-hyperideal and of . The set of bi-hyperideals of is totally ordered under the set inclusion if for all bi-hyperideals either or .\nTheorem 2.6. Let be an LA-semihypergroup with left identity. Every bi-hyperideal of is prime if and only if it is idempotent and the set of the bi-hyperideals of is totally ordered under the set inclusion.\nProof. Let us assume that every bi-hyperideal of is prime. Since is a hyperideal and so is prime which implies that , hence is idempotent. Since is a bi-hyperideal of (where and are bi-hyperideals of ) and so is prime. Now by Lemma 2.3, either or which further implies that either or . Hence, the set of bi-hyperideals of is totally ordered under set inclusion.\nConversely, let us assume that every bi-hyperideals of is idempotent and the set of bi-hyperideals of is totally ordered under set inclusion. Let and be the bi-hyperideals of with and without loss of generality assume that . Since is an idempotent, so implies that , and, hence, every bi-hyperideal of is prime.\nA bi-hyperideal of an LA-semihypergroup is called strongly irreducible bi-hyperideal if implies either or for every bi-hyperideal and of .\nTheorem 2.7. Let be an LA-semihypergroup with zero. Let be the set of all bi-hyperideals of , and the set of all strongly irreducible proper bi-hyperideals of , then forms a topology on the set , where and : Bi-hyperideal preserves finite intersection and arbitrary union between the set of bi-hyperideals of and open subsets of .\nProof. Since is a bi-hyperideal of and 0 belongs to every bi-hyperideal of , then , also which is the first axiom for the topology. Let , then , where is a bi-hyperideal of generated by . Let and , if , then and . Let us suppose , this implies that either or . It is impossible. Hence, which further implies that . Thus . Now if , then and . Thus and , therefore , which implies that . Hence is the topology on . Define : Bi-hyperideal by , then it is easy to note that preserves finite intersection and arbitrary union.\nA hyperideal of an LA-semihypergroup is called prime if implies that either or for all hyperideals and in .\nLet denotes the set of proper prime hyperideals of an LA-semihypergroup absorbing 0. For a hyperideal of , we define the sets and .\nTheorem 2.8. Let be an LA-semihypergroup with zero. The set constitutes a topology on the set .\nProof. Let , if , then and and . Let which implies that either or , which is impossible. Hence, . Similarly . The remaining proof follows from Theorem 2.7.\nThe assignment preserves finite intersection and arbitrary union between the hyperideal and their corresponding open subsets of .\nLet be a left hyperideal of an LA-semihypergroup . is called quasiprime if for left hyperideals of such that , we have or .\nTheorem 2.9. Let be an LA-semihypergroup with left identity . Then a left hyperideal of is quasiprime if and only if implies that either or .\nProof. Let be a left hyperideal of . Let us assume that , then\nHence, either or .\nConversely, let us assume that , where and are left hyperideal of such that . Then there exists such that . Now, by the hypothesis, we have for all . Since , so by hypothesis, for all , we obtain . This shows that is quasiprime.\nAn LA-semihypergroup is called an antirectangular if , for all . It is easy to see that . In the following results for an antirectangular LA-semihypergroup , .\nProposition 2.10. Let be an LA-semihypergroup. If are hyperideals of , then is a hyperideal.\nProof. Using (1.4), we have also which shows that is a hyperideal.\nConsequently, if are hyperideals of , then are hyperideals of and the set of hyperideals of form an antirectangular LA-semihypergroup.\nLemma 2.11. Let be an antirectangular LA-semihypergroup. Any subset of is left hyperideal if and only if it is right.\nIt is fact that . From the above lemma, we remark that every quasiprime hyperideal becomes prime in an antirectangular LA-semihypergroup.\nLemma 2.12. Let be an anti-rectangular LA-semihypergroup. If is a hyperideal of , then .\nProof. Let , then . Hence . Also, .\nAn hyperideal of an LA-semihypergroup is called an idempotent if . An LA-semihypergroup is said to be fully idempotent if every hyperideal of is idempotent.\nProposition 2.13. Let be an antirectangular LA-semihypergroup, and, be hyperideals of . Then the following statements are equivalent: (1) is fully idempotent, (2),(3)the hyperideals of form a hypersemilattice where .\nThe proof follows from Proposition 2.5.\nThe set of hyperideals of is totally ordered under set inclusion if for all hyperideals either or and denoted by hyperideal.\nTheorem 2.14. Let be an antirectangular LA-semihypergroup. Then every hyperideal of is prime if and only if it is idempotent and hyperideal is totally ordered under set inclusion.\nProof.

When two spiritual objects have similar qualities they are close, while opposite qualities make them distant from each other.	['Preface to the Science of Kabbalah (Pticha).\nItems 13-16, summary:\n13. Similar to how corporeal objects are separated by space, spiritual objects are separated by a difference in qualities. Two people whose views are similar are close, whereas two people whose views are opposite are far. And even if they’re in close physical proximity, they still feel distant from one another. So spiritual objects are close or far from one another only through their qualities: A difference of qualities separates them from one another, while similarity of qualities brings them closer, leading to adhesion.\nThe desire was created by the Creator, and is neither good nor bad. The creature’s state isn’t determined by the desire, but for whose sake the desire is used. The Creator bestows, and therefore when the creature uses the desire “for the sake of bestowal,” it is similar and close to the Creator. On the other hand, a creature that uses the desire “for its own sake” (for the sake of reception), is opposite to the Creator and hence distant from Him.\nFor the sake of brevity, in Kabbalah we use the terms: “will to receive” and “will to bestow,” but both allude to the usage of the same desire:\n- “For one’s own sake” is called “to receive,” and\n- “For the sake of the Creator (or for a friend)” is called “to bestow.”\nHowever, one should never forget that the desire to bestow does not exist in nature. There is only the desire to receive (to receive fulfillment, pleasure). However, if this desire is used “for the Creator’s sake,” then it is absolutely equivalent to bestowal.\n14. The fourth phase, which feels that it is opposite to the Creator, stops receiving the Light. This action is called Tzimtzum Aleph (the First Restriction). As a result, the desire remains empty. It then decides that it will only receive if this will please the Giver, the Creator.\n15. Thus arises a new condition of reception – to receive only for the sake of the Creator. In so doing, the creature attains equivalence of form to the Creator. For example: a person comes to his friend’s house, who offers him to stay for dinner. Naturally, the guest will refuse the food, no matter how hungry he is, because he doesn’t like feeling like a receiver who doesn’t give anything in return (as he would in a restaurant, for instance). However, the host urges and persuades him, saying that the guest will please him greatly by receiving his food. When the guest feels that this is truly so, he agrees to receive the food, because he no longer feels that he is a receiver; on the contrary, he feels that he’s pleasing the host and doing him a favor by agreeing to receive from him.\nIt follows that despite the guest being hungry and unable to receive on account of the shame of receiving, the host’s persuasion and the guest’s refusal gave rise to a new condition: reception turned to bestowal. This happened due to a change in the guest’s intention. The guest receives, but his intention has changed. It is precisely the force of repulsion of the food, and not the feeling of hunger which is the actual desire, that became the basis for receiving the food.\n16. We see that instead of using the desire directly, it is used in an “opposite” manner: the pleasure runs into refusal – the Screen, which stands in the Light’s way to the desire. Then the Reflected Light emerges – the desire to receive for the sake of the host. And only to the extent of this intention – the Reflected Light, the Direct Light is allowed to enter the desire. This reception of the Light is called “Zivug de Hakaa” (striking interaction) – first the strike, then the interaction.\nThe desires to receive for the Creator’s sake are called “pure” (from egoism). The desires to receive for their own sake are called “impure” (mired in egoism). They cannot receive the Upper Light and hence they are called “spiritually dead.”\nDownload PDF version of Pticha']	['<urn:uuid:643e4c76-f8af-4489-86c5-ae36a3d57aac>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	7	37	685

In dance, performers create movement phrases based on elements like body, space, time and energy, while in piano duets, performers can either play traditionally on keys or create sounds by manipulating the strings directly, with one performer sometimes playing the keys while the other plays the strings.

It’s mostly a series of simple machines, pulleys and levers. Press a key, a felt covered hammer strikes a high tension length of wire, and sound is produced. Of course that doesn’t begin to describe the wide range of sounds and colors a fine piano is capable of producing, nor does it describe the almost symbiotic relationship that some people develop with this device. It borders on the magical.\nUsing the keys to create notes is only part of the instrument’s capabilities, as composer and pianist Federico Garcia-De Castro stated to the audience after Thursday’s concert. He argues that the strings and resonant box of the piano, and the performer’s ability to play them, are just as much a part of the instrument as the “traditional” manner of playing it.\nThe technique of playing inside the piano is credited first to composer Henry Cowell, whose Aeolian Harp was published in the early 1920s. His student John Cage zealously took up the idea with his development of the prepared piano (1940s) in which various objects are inserted between the strings. The result is to place a percussion orchestra under the fingers of a single pianist.\nFor the first performance in the 2014-15 CSA series, the underlying theme was the range of possibilities for both “inside-outside” duo piano playing. Mr. Garcia-De Castro was joined onstage by Daniel Pesca, a fine pianist originating from the Eastman School. Two pianos were on stage, lids removed and lit from within, in an otherwise stark theater setting.\nThe concert began with Mr. Garcia-De Castro’s arrangement of Au Convert (At the Convent) by late 19th century Romanticist Alexander Borodin. Originally a work for solo piano, this arrangement (or reimagining?) of the piece sets each player off the other, each producing notes and sounds in both the traditional method of fingers on keys, and a variety of less traditional techniques directly on the strings themselves. The results dramatically increased the color palette of the two pianos, giving the piece and even more impressionistic feeling than the original.\nFollowing this work was Interference by Simon Eastwood, for two performers on one piano. Rather than the “piano four hands” with both players sitting at one keyboard, in this piece Mr. Pesca played only the keys of the instrument, and Mr. Garcia-De Castro played only on the open strings. Many of the sounds were created by muting the strings with palms of the hands, strongly emphasizing the percussive side of the instrument and recalling John Cage’s prepared piano. A particularly novel effect was to have the string player mute the strings and move his hands along their lengths; when played on the keys, a string of moving harmonics was produced. That effect is easily produced on guitar or bowed strings, but very rarely heard on piano.\nThe latter portion of the concert was devoted to Federico Garcia-De Castro’s compositions. His Rendering for solo piano was a beautifully (modern) impressionistic work, mercurial in its fleeting ideas. It occurred to me: Borodin, as a latter-19th century composer, is pushing at the limits of traditional tonality. Garcia-De Castro, as a living composer, writes chromatically and densely at times but is unafraid to “thin out the clouds” and compose passages that arise as being more-or-less tonal in nature. Borodin is on the outside of tonality looking out, Federico is on the outside looking in. It was a treat to here the premiere performance of this work, sympathetically played by Mr. Pesca.\nThis led to the centerpiece of the concert, the Livre Pour Deux Pianos (Book for Two Pianos). Split into five movements, this work more than any other on the program explored the possibilities of two pianos. At times melodic material was passed from one player to the other. Sometimes the events were short, chopped, and full of silences; at other times, the two pianos created dense polyrhythmic webs of sound. The final movement was dramatic and demonstrated the full dynamic range possible of two pianos played simultaneously. One audience member commented that this movement would have felt at home in a work by Modest Mussorgsky, again recalling late 19th century Russian Romanticism.\nThroughout the concert, the pianists played with both accuracy and passion, on music that was quite difficult at times. The sound in the Hazlett works well with concerts of this nature, and the clarity of the details came through beautifully. The pianists’ efforts were clearly appreciated by those in attendance. It was a great start to a promising CSA season!']"	['<urn:uuid:7d1d8fc3-75b3-4e39-ac1c-613f5d4505c5>', '<urn:uuid:ff828c8c-75c3-4100-a001-9bc8d72099f0>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	11	47	1509
85	how did demosthenes and churchill deal with threats to their nations what were similarities	Both leaders warned their nations about impending threats: Demosthenes persistently warned Athens about Philip II of Macedon's expansionist ambitions, while Churchill drew direct parallels to this situation by casting himself as Demosthenes and Hitler as Philip II in the years leading up to World War II. Both used powerful oratory to alert their countrymen - Demosthenes through his Philippics speeches warning about Macedonian invasion, and Churchill through his mastery of rhetoric, notably using vivid imagery like the 'Iron Curtain' to describe threats to freedom.	"[""Demosthenes (c. 384 - 322 BCE) was an Athenian statesman who famously stood against Macedonian king Philip II and whose surviving speeches have established him as one of the greatest patriots and powerful orators from ancient Greece. He is not to be confused with the 5th century BCE Athenian general of the same name.\nEarly Life & Works\nBorn in c. 384 in Athens, Demosthenes’ parents died while he was still only seven years old, and so he then lived under guardianship. Famously, at the age of 18, he prosecuted his guardians for wasting his inheritance, delivered his own speeches in court, and won the case. Studying under Isaeus and working as a speech writer (logographos) like his master, his first experience in court was as a prosecutor’s assistant. We also know that in 358 BCE he was a grain-buyer (sitones). Then, from c. 355 BCE, he came to wider attention when he started to deliver his own speeches in the assembly of Athens.\n61 speeches of Demosthenes - both public and private - have survived, along with the rhetorical openings (prooimia) for around 50 speeches and 6 letters. Probably, some of that number were speeches given by another orator by the name of Apollodorus but it is, nevertheless, a substantial amount of material. That is, even if, Demosthenes would have given many more speeches than that in his long and illustrious political career. Those that survive show a speaker who could use plain language and lucid argument to devastating effect. He was a master of metaphor but never overused it and, perhaps his greatest and most enduring quality, his work shows an absolute and convincing sincerity.\nDemosthenes Against Philip II of Macedon\nDemosthenes aimed his oratory in the assembly at one particular target – Philip II of Macedon who seemed intent on conquering all of Greece. The four surviving speeches by Demosthenes on this topic are referred to as the Philippics and date to 351, 344 and 341 BCE. In them, he proposed that Athens prepare for invasion by forming two armies – one of citizens and another of mercenaries. The former would be put on standby while the latter would directly engage with the Macedonians in the north of Greece. The assembly did not take his advice and preferred, instead, the more passive approach of Demosthenes’ great political rival Aeschines. The latter once disparagingly described Demosthenes’ as, ‘the pirate of politics, who sails on his craft of words over the sea of state’ (Kinzl, 425)\nDemosthenes went on two embassies to Philip’s court c. 347 BCE but did not get on well with the Macedonian king or even with his fellow delegates. Returning to Athens Demosthenes’ persistently passionate pleas and stark warnings of the dire consequences of rule under Philip were ignored. In one speech he states the threat to Athenian democracy in the following terms,\nDo you not see that Philip has titles which are irreconcilable to this? King and tyrant are all enemies of freedom and are the opposite of law. Will you not be on your guard lest in seeking to change from war you find a despot? (3.20)\nIt was not until his 346 BCE speech On the Peace that the city took a more aggressive stance against Macedon, following the realisation of the ineffectiveness of the Peace of Philocrates. In 344 BCE Demosthenes was sent to Argos and Messene in the Peloponnese to dissuade them from forming an alliance with the dangerous and ambitious Philip. In c. 342 BCE war seemed inevitable and Demosthenes was charged with forming a Hellenic league to withstand the Macedonian army. Demosthenes also pushed the Athenians to ask Persia for assistance and to form an alliance with Byzantium.\nThese political manoeuvres were all to no avail, though. In 340 BCE Philip declared war. As Demosthenes had already warned, Philip had been allowed to build a state of such power that the Greeks were soundly beaten at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BCE. The Athenians lost their independence and Demosthenes fled the city in fear of reprisals from Philip. However, when time passed without any action from the Macedonian king, Athens invited Demosthenes to give a funeral speech (epitaphios) in honour of the fallen at Chaeronea. The speech survives and is the last made by Demosthenes to do so, even if he made several more important speeches during the reign of Alexander the Great.\nDemosthenes was far from finished, though. When Philip was assassinated in 336 BCE, Demosthenes was said to have been so delighted with the downfall of his old enemy that he went dancing in the streets of Athens, decked out in his finest clothes and wearing a garland. However, as Plutarch points out, this was said of Demosthenes by his number one critic Aeschines. Indeed, the whole city of Athens staged official celebrations but there was to be no respite from the Macedonian threat.\nThe Harpalos Affair & Exile\nIn 324 BCE Demosthenes’ political reputation suffered a major blow when he was accused of taking bribes from Alexander the Great’s treasurer, a man called Harpalos. The great orator had already been subjected to long-standing accusations of accepting bribes from Persia. Put on trial Demosthenes was found guilty and exiled. A year later, though, Demosthenes was pardoned and allowed to return to Athens after he had made clear just whose side he was on when he advised several Greek city-states to take advantage of the death of Alexander and re-establish their autonomy by force. Yet again, though, the Greeks were no match for the Macedonians, and in 322 BCE Demosthenes once again had to flee his defeated city. This time he was not let off and the Macedonians followed him to Calauria (modern-day Poros) where, rather than be captured, Demosthenes committed suicide. According to Plutarch, on hearing news of Demosthenes' death his home city erected a bronze statue in his honour with the following inscription,\nIf only your strength had been equal, Demosthenes, to your wisdom.\nNever would Greece have been ruled by a Macedonian Ares.\nDemosthenes may have been reassessed by modern scholars as a little more opportunistic than the traditional picture of him as a confirmed patriot and it is much debated whether the policies of his political opponents might have better served his city in the end but, certainly, his reputation as a great orator endures. Demosthenes’ speeches show the full range of rhetorical technique and were admired in the ancient world as much as they are by modern historians. Cicero, the great Roman politician and orator, famously titled his speeches given in the Roman senate against Mark Antony, the Philippics in honour of his illustrious Greek predecessor. Another admirer was Winston Churchill who, in the years leading up to WWII, cast himself as Demosthenes and Hitler as Philip II.\nBelow is a selection of extracts from Demosthenes’ work:\n[Aeschines] bids you be on your guard against me, for fear that I should mislead and deceive you, calling me a clever speaker, a mountebank and a sophist and so forth. (Kinzl, 425)\nEvery deed of violence [is] a public offence. (21.44-5)\nThe private citizen should not be confused and at a disadvantage compared with those who know the laws, but all should have the same ordinances before them, simple and clear to read and understand. (20.93)\nWhere is the strength of the laws? If one of you is wronged and cries aloud will the laws run up and stand at his side to assist him? No. They are only writings and could not do this. Wherein then lies their power? In yourselves, if only you support them and make them all-powerful to help whoever needs them. So the laws are strong through you and you through the laws. (21.224)"", 'Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill, famed British Prime Minister during World War II, was not only a noted statesman, but also a gifted student of oration and history.\nChurchill wrote numerous pieces on history, the English language, and how to develop the skills necessary to develop a mastery of rhetoric. So gifted was Churchill that he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953:\n“…for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values.”\nChurchill was a lifelong student of the study of rhetoric and the art of public speaking. He was so talented that phrases and imagery that he used last to this day.\nChurchill’s speech, “The Sinews of Peace,” in which he invokes the imagery of “an Iron Curtain” to describe the descent of Communism that was dividing Europe in the aftermath of World War II, is perhaps the most notable example of his mastery of rhetoric and effective communication.\nBut before Churchill was Prime Minister, before politics and war, Churchill wrote what he believed were the 5 principle elements of effective persuasive speaking. They were collected in an unpublished essay entitled: “The Scaffolding of Rhetoric” in 1897.\nChurchill pulled these elements from a study of classical Greek works to Shakespeare and Lincoln (who was himself a masterful student of rhetoric). These elements remain as true and as effective as ever. You need to master them if you want to find success as a public speaker.\nI. Correctness of Diction\nThere is no more important element in the technique of rhetoric than the continual employment of the best possible word. Whatever part of speech it is it must in each case absolutely express the full meaning of the speaker. It will leave no room for alternatives…\nThe unreflecting often imagine that the effects of oratory are produced by the use of long words. The error of this idea will appear from what has been written…All the speeches of great English rhetoricians–except when addressing highly cultured audiences–display an uniform preference for short, homely words of common usage–so long as such words can fully express their thoughts and feelings….\nSelection of language is of paramount importance. When speaking, or writing, make sure each word carefully selected to convey your exact meaning.\nChurchill notes too that flowery and verbose language actually detracts from attempts to directs communicate and persuade. The focus of communication should be what you are trying to convey – don’t detract from that by muddling the message with complicated prose.\nThe great influence of sound on the human brain is well known. The sentences of the orator when he appeals to his art become long, rolling and sonorous. The peculiar balance of the phrases produces a cadence which resembles blank verse rather than prose. It would be easy to multiply examples since nearly every famous peroration in the English language might be quoted.\nEffective public speaking has a tempo all its own. As Churchill notes, any famous text or quote that you know by heart likely flows along its own unique rhythm.\nLyricism in language is a lost art in most of the modern world. But mastery of the establishment of rhythm in your speech and writing will lead to easier digestion by its audience.\nIII. Accumulation of Argument\nThe climax of oratory is reached by a rapid succession of waves of sound and vivid pictures. The audience is delighted by the changing scenes presented to their imagination. Their ear is tickled by the rhythm of the language. The enthusiasm rises. A series of facts is brought forward all pointing in a common direction. The end appears in view before it is reached. The crowd anticipate the conclusion and the last words fall amid a thunder of assent.\nKnow where you are going. You have to be headed somewhere – and your audience should pick up on it. Effective communication builds like a crescendo in music – constantly growing and building upon itself, working its way to a grand finale.\nBy the time the finale is reached it should be palpable to the audience. They know it is coming and are eager for the experience.\nThe ambition of human beings to extend their knowledge favours the belief that the unknown is only an extension of the known: that the abstract and the concrete are ruled by similar principles: that the finite and the infinite are homogeneous. An apt analogy connects or appears to connect these distant spheres. It appeals to the everyday knowledge of the hearer and invites him to decide the problems that have baffled his powers of reason by the standard of the nursery and the heart.\nHelp people develop connections. A well developed analogy – “an Iron Curtain” – can be more powerful than thousands of words.\nThe most effective communicators are masters of analogy. A good analogy makes the foreign, familiar and the clouded, clear. A well tuned analogy may win over a more technically sound argument because while theory and logic should prevail, most people are prone to be swayed by emotional appeal instead.\nV. Wild Extravagance\nA tendency to wild extravagance of language–to extravagance so wild that reason recoils is evident in most perorations. The emotions of the speaker and the listeners are alike aroused and some expression must be found that will represent all they are feeling. This usually embodies in an extreme form the principles they are supporting. Thus Mr. Pitt wishing to eulogise the freedom possessed by Englishmen:\n“The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown. It may be frail; its roof may shake: the wind may blow through it; the storms may enter, the rain may enter–but the King of England cannot enter! All his forces dare not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement.”\n…The effect of such extravagances on a political struggle is tremendous. They become the watchwords of parties and the creeds of nationalities. But upon the audience the effect is to reduce pressure as when a safety valve is opened.

86	Living near a valley, I'm comparing different heating options. How far can smoke from wood heaters travel, and what health risks do air pollutants pose to nearby residents?	Smoke from outdoor wood boilers can affect homes over a quarter mile away, particularly in valleys where smoke can travel downhill and collect during calm weather conditions. The health risks from outdoor air pollution include heart attacks, asthma, strokes, cancer, and premature death. Fine particles from wood smoke are tiny enough to enter the bloodstream, causing breathing and heart problems. In Washington State alone, an estimated 1,100 people die each year due to outdoor air pollution.	"[""Purchasing an Outdoor Wood Boiler? Items to Consider\nTypical Outdoor Wood Boiler\nSmoke Plume from an Outdoor Wood Boiler\nOutdoor wood boilers (OWBs) are a type of wood-fired hydronic heater. Hydronic heaters heat water that is circulated through pipes to heat exchangers in the home such as radiators, baseboard units and radiant floor tubes to provide heat when needed. Outdoor wood boilers can produce a lot of smoke that contains high levels of particulate matter, carbon monoxide and other chemicals that can cause health problems. Smoke can affect your family's health and the health of your neighbors. If you are thinking about purchasing an outdoor wood boiler, consider the information provided below.\nThere are two types of wood-fired hydronic heaters available, outdoor wood boilers and dual-stage wood gasification boilers. Both types of units can also provide domestic hot water. Gasification boilers will operate more efficiently, especially when used with a heat storage water tank. Before making a purchase, consider your particular site and whether central wood heating is right for your setting.\nOWBs may cost less initially, but they produce much higher levels of smoke pollution than a wood gasification boiler. This is an important issue in areas where there are neighboring homes and can be especially important in settings such as valleys where smoke can affect you and homes over a quarter mile away because during calm weather conditions, smoke can travel downhill and collect in narrow valleys.\nSmoke from OWBs has caused neighbor complaints. Some OWBs have been shut down by regulatory agencies and others have been the cause for private legal actions. OWBs smolder and dense visible smoke is often present. When operated during the non-heating months, OWBs smolder most of the time due to the low heat demand and the smoldering smoke odor can deteriorate outdoor air quality. Along with the smoke, OWBs use considerably more fuel than dual-stage wood gasification boilers for heating similar space because they burn less efficiently.\nDual-stage wood gasification boilers are the most efficient firewood burning units available on the market today. They can be installed indoors or in a structure close to the home. They are called dual-stage because the smoke and gasses are burned in a hot secondary chamber with temperatures much hotter than an outdoor wood boiler. This high efficiency design results in much less smoke, however, they also have more exacting fuel wood requirements. They work best with very dry wood and will not operate with poorly seasoned wood. They also work best when operated with an auxiliary heat storage water tank since this allows the entire charge of wood to be burned continuously, further improving efficiency. The stored heat is then used over time depending on demand. When operated during the non-heating months with an auxiliary heat storage water tank, gasification units only require a fire about every four to seven days depending on how much hot water you use.\nHeat storage water tanks are insulated water storage tanks used to store heat, allowing a boiler to operate most efficiently by burning the firewood hot and fast. The stored heat can then be used for heating your home as needed. Heat storage water tanks work well with gasification boilers, and can also be used for solar heat storage. They are rarely used with OWBs.\nIf you decide to buy an OWB, you should follow the manufacturers guidelines and/or EPA's best burn practices.\nTo summarize, if you are in an area where others might be affected by your woodsmoke, stick with your oil or gas heating system or get a high efficiency dual-stage wood gasification unit. Wood gasification boilers may cost more initially, and may have more exacting firewood fuel requirements, but they do not smoke like outdoor wood boilers and are much more efficient requiring less wood.\nThe New York State Department of Environmental Conservation provides information on outdoor wood boilers, including regulations for OWBs in New York State.\nThe New York State Energy Research and Development Agency provides information on up to date biomass heating technologies.\nThe New York State Attorney General's report Smoke Gets in Your Lungs, Outdoor Wood Boilers in New York State provides more information on polluting outdoor wood boilers.\nEPA provides information on the cleanest outdoor wood boiler models available.\nCornell Cooperative Extension provides up to date information on wood burning technology."", 'Air Pollution & Your Health\nOur long-term vision is for all people to benefit from clean healthy air all the time, everywhere.

87	How does product search work in online stores, and what different ways can customers find products?	Product search in online stores can handle over 10 million objects with 100 attributes per product and deliver results in under 0.25 seconds. Customers can find products through multiple channels including Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and email campaigns. These channels can be credited differently for sales through various attribution models like linear attribution (equal credit to all channels), first-click attribution (credit to first channel), or last-click attribution (credit to final channel that led to purchase).	['Case study Karcher Design: organizing variant-rich door fittings with PIM\nWho is Karcher Design?\nKarcher GmbH is a medium-sized manufacturer of design fittings such as door handles, window handles, protective fittings and push handles. Karcher consistently places the most fashionable design and refined function with the highest quality at the focus of its product development – which aligns perfectly with the long-standing trends in building equipment towards better quality and better design.\nA decisive factor of Karcher’s success is that the company has long pursued the strategy of providing partners and end customers with all relevant information for sales, purchase, installation and maintenance of Karcher products. The combination of the quality of the products, the ability to deliver and the best possible data quality ensure the steady growth of the business.\nWhy did they opt for Sepia Alterra::PIM?\nThe product range distributed by Karcher is characterized, on the one hand, by its enormous variety and, on the other hand, by the possibility to combine individual elements. Therefore, when maintaining products in the new PIM system, one should not maintain products individually, but create components that can be combined with each other depending on the product. This modular system for data management should keep the products completely redundancy-free and thus reduce the maintenance effort.\nWhen comparing PIM systems, it quickly became apparent that only a few providers have designed their software in such a way that it easily allows for the granular decomposition of products into their components and a maintenance based on these smallest logical units of a product. Karcher was therefore happy when they came across Alterra::PIM, a system that exactly met these objectives in terms of structure and function – and comes combined with highly knowledgeable implementation consulting.\nSynchronous product data in ERP and PIM\nA PIM system like Alterra::PIM can be easily connected to any ERP system. One advantage is that the complex product structure is completely relocated to Alterra::PIM and the ERP system primarily performs functions for which an ERP system is originally intended – namely for enterprise resource planning, i.e. procuring, storing, processing and selling resources, and not for representing complex product interrelationships in marketing, sales and eCommerce.\nOutput media under control\nFor the successful distribution of their products, Karcher GmbH has to operate several output media that present the products from different angles and with different objectives in mind. For this purpose, it is helpful that products are maintained in individual parts in such a way that parts can be exchanged or products completely reassembled, if necessary. For the presentation of their products, Karcher in particular uses the following media:\n- BMEcat exports, individually for dealers\n- Price lists as PDF and in printed form\n- Web pages with display of all available products\n- Tender texts\n- eCommerce functions\nA database and a comprehensive set of rules for data output\nIf you decide to keep your product information as redundancy-free as possible, you have to break products down into reusable information modules. This can mean breaking down a product into its individual technical parts. However, it can also be that parts of products are interchangeable from a marketing point of view, e.g. because they share the same feature is involved or an aspect of use is always described in the same way.\nIn order to implement such product maintenance, it is advisable to plan very astutely and, if necessary, to obtain expertise from outside. Sepia employs professional teams to provide advice and assistance to customers at this point. Using a set of rules that can be stored in Alterra::PIM, it is possible to define conditions for the display of products. This ranges from simple variant creation to extensive combinations of partial products.\nIsabel Karcher (Managing Director of Karcher GmbH): “With the help of Alterra Pim software, we have optimized and digitized the basic marketing processes of our company. Today, we find it hard to imagine product management without Alterra-Pim.”\nExample: Model “KOS”\nLet’s look at the data maintenance for the Karcher’s model “KOS”. A configuration envelope is created for the product in the PIM system. As information stored here, it is sufficient to give the model a unique name or number. What data is output in connection with the model depends on which “components” are assigned to this configuration envelope. In our example, the product looks like this:\n- Model: KOS, 3-piece, round\n- Component 1: KOS handle\n- Properties, files, translations\n- Component 2: Door handle rosette, fire protection\n- Properties, files, translations\n- Component 3: Profile cylinder rosette, fire protection\n- Properties, files, translations\n- Component 4: Screws\n- Set of rules for configuration and output to model: KOS\nEach of these components has its own set of product characteristics, including technical data and marketing statements, as well as image data, technical drawings, documents, and 3D data.\nThe external representation for the entire model “KOS” can now be automatically merged using the data from the individual components. In addition, a set of rules can be stored in order to generate specific model variations or to tailor the composition of the partial information precisely to the output medium.\nLast but not least, this basic data can be used for the operation of a product configurator (CPQ = Configure Price Quote). The product configuration can be used by the own sales department or on the website by potential customers.\nProducts on the Web: the Alterra::Sales Portal is 100% cloud-ready\nAn optional add-on to the Alterra software suite is the Alterra::SalesPortal, which publishes the products stored in PIM on the company’s website. The Alterra::SalesPortal is 100% cloud-ready and can be rolled out in Azure or AWS. A particularly advantageous function of the SalesPortal is the integrated faceted search via ElasticSearch, on the basis of which both targeted products can be found and precisely configured.\nPerformance of the product filter of the Alterra::SalesPortal\nTo get an impression of the performance of the product filter, here are the actual measured values for the product search in the SalesPortal:\n- Search for over 10 million objects (products)\n- Attributes (product properties) per product: 100\n- Search result: <= 0.25 seconds.\nThe hardware requirements (virtualized) for this are simple:\n- HD: SSD\n- RAM: 24 GB\n- CPU: 4x vCore AMD with 3GHz each\nThe product filter is included “out of the box” with an easily customizable web layout in the SalesPortal, but it can also be integrated into any system (CMS, WebShops – e.g. Shopify). These interfaces are available for integration into other systems: REST, ODATA, GraphQL. In addition, documents generated by the system can be delivered directly via an Azure Service Bus. This ensures full integration with MS Dynamics 365.\nAlterra::PIM, the pertaining possible product configuration, and Alterra::SalesCloud opened up completely new possibilities for Karcher GmbH to process product information in a rational way. For a medium-sized company that does not have unlimited human resources, a software like Alterra::PIM that enables such a high degree of automation in media production is a real blessing. And the direct use of data on the web without prior manual intervention, without copy & paste efforts, also brings enormous advantages for sales and marketing. With the Alterra Software Suite, Karcher Design is well prepared for the “cloud age”.\n3D-Configurator for Furniture\nExample: dining table.

Dynamic price calculation.', 'A Complete Guide to Multi-channel Attribution for Marketers\nFor the growth and development of any business, the organization must provide the best products and services to its customers. The organization needs to use a proper channel for the marketing of their business to attract more customers to their products and services. Marketing creates a proper base for launching and advertising the products and services thus enhancing the sale. It also allows interacting with the customers.\nWhat is Multi-Channel Attribution?\nThe organization needs to track the marketing tactics used for the sale of its products. An organization relies on several channels for the marketing of its products. Multi-channel attribution is a type of process used by the organization for tracking the various marketing channels for the sales of the product.\nThe marketing members use a set of rules that allow them to allocate appropriate values for each of these marketing channels based on their contribution to the sales cycle. These help the marketers in generating high-quality leads for managing the budget in areas of potential revenues.\nThe Importance of multi-channel attribution\nThese multi-channel attributes play a very important role and help in evaluating the effectiveness of the marketing. The different beneficial gains of this multi-channel marketing include:\nThis helps to reach out to a larger and potential audience. Using this multi-channel marketing technique, there are increased chances of interacting with customers to convert them into potential customers\nUsing multiple channels allows having communication without any interruption. Increased modes of communication keep the customers engaged.\nReach out to the customers\nThe customers do not have to wait for their favorite brands to communicate with them. Having increased channels allows them in noticing brand awareness and attract customers.\nMulti-channel Attribution Model Types\nThe multi-channel attribution allows the organization to create a set of rules based on the buyer experience and the sales funnel. It helps to efficiently manage the different marketing and sales channels to gain revenue. There are different types of multi-channel attributions to select from. These include:\n1. Linear Attribution\nIt is one of the most common types of attribution. Mostly the seller who likes to have a clear picture over their customer prefers this. This attribution assigns equal credit to the different channels engaged by the customer before making the purchase. Using linear attribution, the targeted advertising gets equal attribution for the sale of the product.\nExample: If the customer visited the product website through different sources like Instagram, email for or even through YouTube, etc, then each of these channels will get paid for the advertising of the product. All the channels involved in the customer’s product journey will get paid.\n2. First-Order Attribution\nFor this type of attribution, the entire credit is given to the first channel that encourages the customer in purchasing for this sale as well for all future sales. For first and the subsequent purchases, the attribution that helped in connecting the customer, gets paid for the same.\nExample: If the customer at first visits the product website through Instagram but does not make a purchase. Later if he visits the website through YouTube and then makes the purchase. In this case, as the customer visited the website for the first time through the link via Instagram, it will be paid for the purchase as it was the first to encourage the customer for the product purchase.\n3. First-Click Attribution\nThis attribution gives all the credit for the sales to the channel that helps customers to connect to the product. This does not concern how the customer purchased the product. The first click on the advertisement done by the attribution gets paid for the sales.\nExample: If the customer has come across the product website through multiple channels say 3 different channels Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook respectively, the first one that prompted the customer to visit the product site to view the product will get the credit. As in this case, Instagram will get the credit for the purchase.\n4. Last-Click Attribution\nAs the name of this attribution suggests, then click on the type of attribution that the customer clicked just before purchasing the product and get the credit for the sale of the product.\nExample: If the customer comes to the product website through multiple channels like Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook respectively; the last channels used by the customer to reach the product website before making the product purchase will get paid for the sale of the product. As in this case, Facebook gets the benefit.\n5. Position-Based Attribution\nThis attribution is similar to the linear attribution model and it assigns the credit to all the channels that are included in the customer’s entire journey for the product. It gives proportional credit to all the attributes based on the touchpoint falls. The first and the last touchpoints get 40 % of attribution while the others get the 20 %.\nExample: If the customer has come across the product website through multiple channels, say 5 different channels, then the first and the last channel will get 40% attribution each, while the remaining 20% will be distributed amongst the remaining 3 channels.\n6. Time-Decay Attribution\nThis attribution is similar to the position-based model. It gives credit to all the channels that are involved in the customer’s journey for the product purchase. More attribution is provided to the channels that are close to the point of purchase. If there are 2-3 different channels responsible for getting the customer to the product website, the channels that encouraged the purchase, get the maximum credit.\nExample: If the customer has come across the product website through multiple channels like Instagram, YouTube, and the campaign email. If they click on the email to make the purchase, then under this attribution, 50% credit is given to the email followed by Instagram and YouTube.\n7. Algorithmic Attribution\nThe most commonly used method for attribution is algorithmic attribution. This is gaining popularity and is more feasible for eCommerce retailers. It uses advanced technology to track sales metrics. It analyses all the touchpoints to determine the channel that is more predictive for sales. This attribution is useful for businesses that use many channels and campaigns for marketing and have a complex customer journey.\n8. Custom Attribution\nOne of the above-mentioned attributions doesn’t need to be best for the business. The seller can design their attribution model that will be specific for their sales cycle. It can be a combination of 2-3 attributions based on their requirement.\nThe Challenges of Multi-Channel Attribution\nMarketing attribution is very important for the sales of the products and services. Proper strategy and tools should be incorporated while selecting the multi-channel attributions. The different challenges to the multi-channel attribution include:\nMost consumers still prefer the traditional forms of communication. They prefer face-to-face and telephonic conversation before taking the final purchasing decisions. Marketers lack the tools and facilities to connect to the customers via online and offline touchpoints. Online attributions help in tracking all the details and proper documentation. It becomes impossible to import the data and correlate the offline data with the website usage.\nThe 90-day window for attribution\nGoogle Analytics supports and has a look-back window of 90-days. This causes an issue for businesses that have a long and complicated sales cycle. It only considers the channels reflecting in this 90-day window for assigning the credits to the channels for the sales of the product.\nLack of data conversion\nGoogle Analytics allows tracking the conversions for observing the marketing activities. tracking the conversion goals helps in understanding the website performance but does not consider the growth.\nGetting started with multi-channel attribution\nThe seller at first needs to decide the type of multi-channel attribution that is best suited for their product. Once the attribution is set, then they have to follow some steps for preparing the data and the business. The step-to-step guide to set up the multi-channel attribution includes:\nStep 1: Defining the questions\nThe seller has to think rationally and then define the questions that will help in gathering the required details. They should think about the customer journey, sales funnel, and other details regarding the channels for sales and marketing. There are different questions for the different business types. These questions will help to define methods to increase their sales and revenues. Some examples of the potential questions that the seller needs to define include:\n- What revenue share comes from different channels in the omnichannel strategy?\n- When should the customer be encouraged to purchase the buyer journey? which channels suit best for encouraging the customer?\n- How many offline customers are influenced by online campaigns?\nStep 2: Finding relevant data\nOnce the set of potential questions are ready, the next step is to answer these by collecting the relevant data. This data can be achieved using different sources, platforms, and tools. The relevant data can be collected from various advertisement platforms like Google Ags, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, mobile analytics system, email marketing platform, call tracking, CRMs, etc.\nStep 3: Choosing a multi-channel attribution model\nOnce the potential questions are defined and the relevant data is compiled, the next step is the selection of the best suitable multi-channel attribution model. The seller can select the best suitable model from the available models. If none of the models is a good fit, then based on the sales cycles the model can be custom designed for the best fit.\nStep 4: Tracking results\nThe next step includes collecting the data from the selected multi-channel model. It becomes easy to track the pattern and observe the performance and check the working of the approach or strategy selected. The multi-channel attributes generate a lot of data and that needs to be organized properly and analyzed to make it useful.\nStep 5: Acting on the results and iterate\nThe data obtained from the multi-channel attribution should be turned into revenue-boosting value. It is important to analyze the data to obtain the results and iterate in improving the sales and revenue.\nHow PIM System Becomes Essential for Business Using Multi-Channel Attribution?\nProduct Information Management (PIM) helps in collecting, managing, and enriching the data essential for the development of the product catalog for its sales and distributions through the eCommerce channel. Not every business needs to always have a PIM, but at a certain stage, PIM will be helpful for the business. For multi-channel marketing, the product will have a bigger catalog with a larger database and extensive details. For the management of all these details, PIM will help inadequately organize all these details.\n1. Exchanging product information In Formats and Structures\nThe data required for the PIM should be relevant and consistent with the whole process. The organization contains various departments and it is essential to compile all the data efficiently. Using the PIM system, different departments within the organization come together to collate accurate data.\n2. Challenges over the diversity of Product Information Standards\nThe organization has diverse products and that leads to the collection of diverse product information. Collection of the data from various sources leads to the collection of data in different formats. While exchanging the data with the suppliers, partners, and customers, their format and data structure may be completely different. PIM will help in sorting the diverse data and compiling it through data mapping. This will help to sort the data in the required format.\n3. Method of Exchanging Information\nThe exchange of information can be done using different techniques like using text, voice data, visitor ID, visitor comment data, barcode system, etc. For sharing the different data, the PIM system comes in handy in managing all types of data from a different source. PIM holds the product-related details in the standard format and can be easily shared or exchanged in a consistent data format.\nBy considering the types of multi-channels attributes for the marketing, an organization can select the best possible type for the marketing of their product. The organization should also consider the different challenges they have to overcome to get their product in the market in the best possible manner and increase their sales.']	['<urn:uuid:1d2d5afc-d0fc-4450-9dcd-696125d72bdf>', '<urn:uuid:b52f146b-7341-425d-94f2-c4145f6414ef>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	16	74	3244
88	How do the expansion capabilities of medieval folding almanacs compare to the Codex Gigas in terms of their portability and practical use?	The folding almanacs and Codex Gigas represent opposite ends of the spectrum in medieval book design. Folding almanacs were specifically designed for portability, expanding up to six times their original size while remaining small enough to carry. In contrast, the Codex Gigas (Devil's Bible) was extremely unwieldy, weighing about 165 pounds and requiring at least two adults to carry it. The almanacs were practical tools used by physicians for diagnostics and calendar information, while the Devil's Bible served as a comprehensive repository of medieval knowledge, including both testaments and secular works. Both demonstrated medieval bookmaking innovation, but with very different approaches to accessibility and use.	['It’s a mysterious book that in its day was believed to contain all human knowledge. But why did medieval people believe that the author sold his soul to the devil to be able to write it?\nThe “Devil’s Bible,” a behemoth volume weighing in at 165 pounds, believed to have been produced by a single monk over the course of decades in the 13th Century, is the focus of a documentary that was featured on the National Geographic Channel.\nA complete Old Testament and New Testament, and a collection of a number of secular works besides, the Devil’s Bible is an encyclopedia of medieval knowledge. But it has also been haunted by dark speculation, including that its writing was guided by the devil’s hand.\nDevil’s Bible Photo open on the page of the picture showing Satan © MHP\nIt got its name “Devil’s Bible” from the illustration of the devil on page 290 (in the photo above). It is believed to be the only bible of its era that depicts Satan. There the devil is, looking more like a cartoon character in an ermine diaper, rather than evil incarnate.\nDevil’s Bible (Codex Gigas) manuscript © MHP\nWhat makes the Devil’s Bible such an object of fascination is the back story associated with it. According to the TV show, which I watched when it premiered, the legend about the Devil’s Bible was that it was written by a monk in a single night.\nCompact with the devil\nThe story goes that such a feat was possible only because the monk had made a compact with the devil. The implication is that the devil himself wrote this bible, which is why his portrait adorns it.\nHowever, if the devil inspired the book then there is nothing in it that appears to cast Satan in a good light, at least not that I can find by searching for information on the Web about the Devil’s Bible. (It is more properly known as Codex Gigas, or “Giant Book.”)\nCodex Gigas manuscript © MHP\nThe television show combined the story and the extraordinary history of this giant book with modern forensic science to see what can be established about the Devil’s Bible. The manuscript was definitely produced by one person, according to analysis of the ink and penmanship.\nMost likely the producer of the Devil’s Bible was a monk whose name is mentioned in the index and who probably devoted many, many years to the task, perhaps as a form of penance. The Devil’s Bible was written by one person, but it was not written in a single night.\nDevil’s Bible (Codex Gigas) manuscript © MHP\nPortraits of the Devil are common in medieval art, but this one in the Codex Gigas may be unique in books for showing him alone and occupying a whole page. The Heavenly City (photo on the left) and the Devil Portrait are the only full page pictures in the Codex Gigas.\nThe provenance of this extraordinary book and its unlikely story as well as its journey across centuries, passing through a succession of monasteries and royal palaces to its current destination, the National Library of Sweden, is a legitimate story for National Geographic to cover. And it makes good television too.\nExorcism and Magic Spells in the Devil’s Bible\nThere are also two magic spells, both with specific instructions on how to identify and catch a thief.\nPossession by demons was commonly thought during medieval times to be the cause of many illnesses.\nThe church had specific rituals to exorcise evil by casting demons out of an afflicted person’s body.\nIn the name of Jesus\nAccording to the Christian New Testament, Jesus gave his disciples the power to cast out evil spirits, which is why scholars believe the medieval exorcists commanded demons to leave an afflicted person’s body “in the name of Jesus Christ.”\nThe incantations for exorcism would not be out of place in the Devil’s Bible, appearing after this picture of the devil.\nDevil’s Bible facts:\n- The 310 parchment leaves (620 pages) of the Devil’s Bible are made of vellum, from the processed skins of 160 animals, most probably donkeys. Some pages of the Devil’s Bible are thought to have been removed, and no one knows what happened to them.\n- The entire Devil’s Bible is written in Latin. The calligraphy is lavishly luminated throughout.\n- Including its wooden case, which is ornamented with metal, the Devil’s Bible is so heavy (about 165 pounds) that it requires at least two adults to carry it.\n- The portrait of the devil faces a picture of the “City of Heaven,” the only other image in the Devil’s Bible.

That is to say, unlike the Incredible Hulk, they do not normally expand beyond the limits of their own physicality. This post will challenge your beliefs if you agree with this statement. It draws attention to types of medieval books that do expand beyond their physical limits: with a flick of the finger or a gesture of the hand the dimensions of these special objects increased dramatically, up to ten times their original size. As if defying the laws of nature, this miraculous expansion increased the available writing space in objects that were principally designed to be small and portable. The examples in this post suggest that this given of “doing more with less” was an important drive behind the clever design of expandable books.\n1. The folding almanac\nIf you are a frequent reader of this blog, you are no stranger to small books made for portability. The same goes for the almanac seen in Fig. 1. Produced in England in 1415-1420, it contains a calendar as well as astrological tables and diagrams. The information was used by physicians to diagnose and prognosticate, while the calendar provided information about feasts. Most of these almanacs, some thirty of which survive, look more scruffy than the pretty specimen in the Wellcome Library, which may not have seen much practical use (more here).\nFolding almanacs were especially popular in late-medieval England, assuming surviving specimens form an accurate representation. The objects are particularly interesting from a material point of view. During production the folding almanacs looked very much like a regular book: the scribe filled regular pages with text. However, in a completed state, when the binding was added, the pages were folded in a very clever way, giving the object an “unbookish” look. The precise manner of folding differed, as Figs. 1-2 show. Both fold in three steps, but the folding sequence is different. The leaves ‘sit’ different too. The specimen in Fig. 2 seems more prone to damage than the other almanac, because the expanding part (the four zones that are slightly lighter) are attached to the actual book by means of a delicate hinge.\n2. The accordion book\nBoth almanacs above provide six times more writing/reading space in their expanded form, which is quite amazing. However, this is still considerably less than another type of expandable manuscript: the accordion book. Fig. 3 shows illustrated specimen (a calendar) made in Denmark in 1513. While in its folded state the object is as small as a matchbox, it expands to a full page of considerable proportions, comparable to a regular-sized medieval book (more information here, facsimile here). Curiously, the calendar has a most unusual way of unfolding: sections of the sheet expand independently, like little flaps from a pop-up book (note the “incisions” on the right half of the object, as seen in Fig. 4 – full image here).\nThe Copenhagen accordion book is a very small portable object. Even though in its expanded state it became much larger, due to the limited size of the object in its folded state, the expansion produced a relatively small writing/reading surface. The remarkable thing about accordion books, however, is that their surface space could be considerable, even when the actual object (in its folded state) was still of modest proportions. My own Leiden University Library owns a copy from fourteenth-century Russia which is only 120 mm in height. The whole thing resembles the dimensions of an iPhone (Fig. 5). In expanded state, however, the book becomes no less than 3750 mm wide, meaning that the surface actually increases by an astonishing factor of ten.\nIt is hard to say what the upside is of this book format. After all, if the same pages had been bound in a regular (non-accordion) fashion, it would accommodate the same amount of text. Perhaps the format was favoured because of a certain ease of use? It is easier, for example, to access the information in the book without using one’s hands. Also, without flipping any pages, the reader had access to a great deal more than the usual two pages of a book opening, which may perhaps have been handy in certain modes of use.\nWhat looks like a cigar, is actually the most common and oldest expandable bookish object: the roll (Fig. 6). This object probably held the most information in relation to its dimensions. Rolls had been in use for a long time when the book finally came around in the fourth century (see my post What is the Oldest Book in the World? and more information on rolls here). During the Middle Ages the roll format remained in use longest in administration. It was not until the late thirteenth century, for example, that cities in North-West Europe switched to the book form to write down their income and expenses – the city of Bruges still used rolls for this purpose in the 1280s.\nRolls can be quite long. One of the longest that survives from the medieval period is a mortuary roll that was carried to 253 monasteries, nunneries and cathedrals across England and France during the 1110s (source). Mortuary rolls were produced to commemorate the death of a prominent person, in this case Abbess Mathilda of Holy Trinity Abbey in Caen. Like writing a joint birthday card today, clerics in France would add their say to the roll, which grew and grew, until it finally reached a length of 22 meters (72 feet). Genealogical rolls could also be quite long (Fig. 7), though not as exceptionally long as the mortuary roll made for Abbess Mathilda.\nFrom time to time unusual rolls are encountered, like the one seen in Fig. 8. This one is special because the fourteenth-century object comes rolling out of a book (of slightly later date), which functions as its sleeve. The end of the roll (again holding a calendar) is simply pasted onto the book. The full roll measures an astonishing 130 cm (a little over 4 feet). One wonders whether the owner created this remarkable hybrid because it allowed for easy storage on the book shelf. A book placed among its peers, albeit with an unusual content.\nWhat the Incredible Expandable Books in this post share is an effort to hold a lot of text in an object that occupies a modest amount of space, usually in one’s pocket. When there is a dire need to take information with you on the go, medieval readers were quite inventive, as my post Bag it, Box it, Wrap it shows. Interestingly, the expandable information carrier lives on in our own day. Not only are there still book designers who produce accordion books in the medieval fashion (like Peter Thomas, whose recent email correspondence inspired this post), but the expandable almanac at the outset of this post has actually become ubiquitous in the form of pocket maps, displaying such things as the layout of cities and underground stations.\nEchoing the roll hidden in a book, some of these maps hide in (and take on the form of) an actual book, like the 1886 edition that shows the location of oil wells (Fig. 9). As with their medieval peers, ease of use and portability are the driving forces behind getting a lot of information in an object with a tiny footprint. “Doing more with less” is clearly a universal urge.']	['<urn:uuid:e7617951-1ff1-457f-a108-69d7ff8c4044>', '<urn:uuid:1c63bcc5-04e2-43b0-a9a6-75c48e086701>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	22	105	2231
89	first commercial lithographic printing shop united states name company	Barnet and Doolittle was the first commercial lithographic printing shop to be established in the United States.	['AAS’s The Children’s Friend: A New Year’s Present is one of just two known copies of the 1821 pamphlet. Fifteen centimeters tall and eight pages deep, the paper-covered volume stood little chance of survival in the hands of generations of American children. But there was one family fastidious enough for the task, and by chance they would be among AAS’s most important benefactors.\nThe Salisbury family provided AAS, notably, with two of its presidents, 67 boxes and an additional 100 bound volumes in manuscript materials, and the land for the library’s current home. In 1897 the Society also received the childhood book of one of those presidents, Stephen Salisbury III. Six-year old Stephen received The Children’s Friend in 1841 as a gift from Kitty Lawrence.\nWhat makes this little book so important? Put simply it is believed to be the first American Christmas picture book. But we asked Laura Wasowicz, Curator of Children’s Literature, and Gigi Barnhill, Director of CHAViC for a few more details.\n- ~The publishing location, New York City, is important. The brick chimneys visible as “Old Santeclaus” lands his sleigh indicate an urban environment.\n- ~The pamphlet falls within a set of attempts by well-to-do New Yorkers to domesticize the holiday from a time for rowdy alcohol-infused parties and mob revelry to a safe, family-focused holiday. The Children’s Friend joined efforts by New York Historical Society founder John Pintard and Clement Clarke Moore (author of the poem “A Visit from St. Nicholas” first published in 1823).*\n- ~The story offers the first visit by St. Nicholas on Christmas Eve (instead of his Saint’s day December 6th), as well as the first appearance of his reindeer.\n- ~While the “long, black birchen rod” left for parents with naughty sons might seem a harsh ending to modern readers, it was in keeping with the parlance of the day. In a time when a children’s book might conclude with a child burned to death for playing too close to the fire, The Children’s Friend is in fact a gentle cautionary tale.\n- ~The Children’s Friend is considered the first American example of a completely lithographed book. Lithography (the practice of drawing on limestone with waxy crayons to create a master image that absorbed ink) was introduced in the United States in the early 1800s.\n- ~Unlike engraving, lithography did not require the same high level of skill to execute and could make up to 100,000 impressions with one stone. But the technology did require special equipment and a specific type of printing press.\n- ~Barnet and Doolittle, the firm that likely lithographed the pamphlet, was the first commercial lithographic printing shop to be established in the U.S.\n- ~The publishers used lithography as an inexpensive alternative to engraving and avoided the expense of multiple presses by lithographing both illustration and text (you can see that the text looks handwritten).\n- ~The color, added by hand after printing, suggests the pamphlet was expensive to buy.\n*Historian Stephen Nissenbaum discusses The Children’s Friend and explores the transition to a family-oriented holiday in The Battle for Christmas (New York, 1996). Nissenbaum did much of his research at AAS as a long-term fellow.']	['<urn:uuid:070a4041-6175-4fb5-9e46-f11448c17b08>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	9	17	530
90	compare changes over time prescriptivism descriptivism language evolution	Both prescriptivism and descriptivism offer different perspectives on language evolution. Prescriptivists try to uphold rules that preserve a 'correct' form of language, believing in a 'golden age' where language was used 'correctly'. In contrast, descriptivists welcome change and adaptation, describing how people actually use language. This relates to the broader concept of linguistic drift, where language moves in a current of its own making, seeking poise and following a trajectory toward iconicity (alignment between form and meaning). For example, while prescriptivists might oppose changes like using 'literally' for emphasis, descriptivists would point to how meanings naturally adapt over time, supported by evidence like the Oxford English Dictionary's updates.	['Lewis Turner explores the dilemma of shifting word senses and whether the original meaning is the ‘true’ meaning.\nI’m sure we’ve all heard someone exclaim something along of the lines of “I literally could not keep my eyes open during that lecture”. However, we all know that they physically\ncould and, in reality, they were just a bit bored. This utterance would make some people figuratively want to explode. This is an issue of semantics as the problem lies in a misunderstanding of word meaning. Any dictionary would tell you that the adverb ‘literally’ refers to ‘a truthful representation of an event’. However, as previously exemplified, it is now commonly used for emphasis or exaggeration. The perceived misuse of ‘literally’ has become one of semantics’ largest controversies; just see Jamie Redknapp’s ‘Foot In Mouth Award’ win for his very ‘nonliteral’ use of the word (Plain English, 2010) – e.g. “These balls now – they literally explode off your feet.” At the heart of this issue is the debate between prescriptivism and descriptivism.\nPrescriptivists try to uphold rules that preserve and impose a ‘correct’ form of a language whereas descriptivists attempt to describe how people actually use language and are welcoming of change and adaptation (Curzan, 2014, p. 14). Hitchings (2011) summarises this as “one says what ought to happen, and the other says what does happen” (p. 23). People’s fears over their own language usage has helped prescriptivism become a potentially large market for authors. So much so that books that purport to teach ‘proper English’, such as Gywnne’s Grammar (2013) and Heffer’s Strictly English (2010), can often be found amongst the bestseller lists. Semantics is usually a key issue in prescriptivism because, as Heffer argues, inaccurate usage of a word “can leave […interlocutors] understanding something quite different” from what we intended (2010 p. 136). He describes these types of mistakes as “vulgarities” (p. 183). This links to a belief held by many prescriptivists: that there was a ‘golden age’ for the English language where everyone used English ‘correctly’. An example that Heffer says shows the drop in modern standards is the misuse of the word ‘dilemma’. He argues that as it originates from the Greek term for ‘two propositions”, it therefore cannot be used to refer to a choice between three-or-more possibilities (p. 143).\nOn the other hand, a descriptivist would argue that such an assertion is completely pedantic as very few people actually know the etymology (the linguistic origin) of words. I think it’s pretty likely that none of us would bat an eyelid if someone told us that they were facing a ‘dilemma’ over what to buy their friend for Christmas, or where they wanted\nto go on holiday, or anything else with more than two possible solutions. As Trudgill (1998) argues, comprehension is hardly ever affected by semantic change as people are either able to use contextual clues to work out what is meant or never knew the original meaning in the first place (p. 5). Instead of tracing back to original roots, most people’s understanding of lexical items comes from how they hear other speakers use them in real life. This is supported by the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) who notes that due to popular usage, dilemmas can now refer to choices with “several” options (OED online, 2019) and who in 2011, added the ‘improper’ emphatic meaning of ‘literally’ to their dictionary (Gill, 2013). Regarding the so-called ‘golden age’, descriptivists would point out that more people than ever are able to read and write and the evidence used to support the golden age belief is usually anecdotal with no qualitative evidence (Milroy, 1998. p. 61).\nPersonally, I’m not sure if I could call myself purely a descriptivist or prescriptivist. I think words do need rules that dictate some agreed meaning or effective communication would be impossible. However, I certainly think that meanings are not set in stone and should be allowed to adapt with the times, otherwise I would have to argue that ‘nice’ could still only refer to its original meaning of ‘foolish’ (Trudgill, 1998, p. 2).\nSo, when Jamie Redknapp describes a footballer as being “literally a greyhound” this Super Sunday should we just ignore it because we all understand he is using it for emphasis? Or does this make him look too ‘nice’ (in the original sense)? All I know is that it’s an issue about which I’m literally going to sit on the fence!\nLEWIS TURNER, English Language undergraduate, University of Chester, UK\nNB: this blog was originally published on the Language Debates website on 14 May 2019', 'Why don’t languages just stay the same? Why does each generation of speakers introduce changes even though a steady state would seem to have served the communicative goals of a language adequately? These are questions to which answers are to be found by considering language as a semeiotic, a system of signs.\nAs indicated in an earlier post (“The Telos of Linguistic Change,” April 7, 2013), one’s first recourse in a productive approach to understanding the rationale of language change should be to thinking about change in a broader framework, to wit:\n“[U]nderlying all other laws is the only tendency which can grow by its own virtue, the tendency of all things to take habits…. In so far as evolution follows a law, the law or habit, instead of being a movement from homogeneity to heterogeneity, is growth from difformity to uniformity. But the chance divergences from laws are perpetually acting to increase the variety of the world, and are checked by a sort of natural selection and otherwise…, so that the general result may be described as ‘organized heterogeneity,’ or, better, rationalized variety” (Charles S. Peirce, Collected Papers 6.101; emphasis added).\nThis quotation from the modern founder of the theory of signs is to be combined with what the prominent interwar theoretician of historical linguistics, Edward Sapir, characterized as “drift” (both passages are from his Selected Writings, p. 382):\n“Language moves down time in a current of its own making. It has a drift…. The linguistic drift has direction. In other words, only those individual variations embody it or carry it which move in a certain direction, just as only certain wave movements in the bay outline the tide.”\n“Wherever the human mind has worked collectively and unconsciously, it has striven for and attained unique form. The important point is that the evolution of form has a drift in one direction, that it seeks poise, and that it rests, relatively speaking, when it has found this poise.”\nPresent possibilities with greater or lesser powers of actualization exist at any given historical stage of a language. Innovations that come to be full-fledged social facts, i. e., changes, must have something about their form that enables them to survive. The aggregate of such innovations-become-changes is what constitutes the drift of a language.\nBeyond such broad generalizations, what is needed in order to understand individual linguistic changes is the principle whereby drift is further defined as what might be called “the triumph of the iconic.” In other words, the trajectory of change, in the long run, follows an arc leading toward iconicity, which is the alignment between form and meaning. In the working out of this trajectory, the form-meaning alignment is regularly aided by a real tendency of change from the marked to the unmarked member of the linguistic units and categories involved.\nHere is an example from contemporary American English. For some time now, the adjective fewer in the colloquial variety of speech has been replaced by less, so that the normative (and more conservative) “fewer people” comes out as “less people,” etc. The norm requires fewer whenever the noun quantified is a so-called count noun, and less when it is a so-called mass noun. The directionality of the replacement of fewer by less even when the noun modified is a mass noun is clear in one distinct respect: the shorter of the two adjectives is winning out in the drift of the language over the longer one. The semiotic upshot of this drift is equally clear: the meaning of lesser number is better fitted to the form that is shorter, i. e., to less rather than to fewer, since the latter is one syllable longer than the former. Here we have the establishment over time of the iconic principle, understood in this case as the triumph of uniformity over variety.\nMarkedness also plays a role in this development collaterally. The marked is defined as the conceptually more restricted than the unmarked, a principle that can take several hypostases. Here the adjective fewer, applying as it does normatively to count nouns, is the marked member because individuation (as in counting) is marked vis-à-vis non-individuation (as in sets or groups). The drift away from fewer toward less is thus an instantiation of the semiotic principle that dictates the change from marked to unmarked in the long run.']	['<urn:uuid:404ab2a3-a8b3-461a-87d8-dd4cd8e4a60e>', '<urn:uuid:ceb2d9ff-937e-4b02-bf25-7aa040b74fe7>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	8	108	1492
91	I'm Italian - what do we call still life paintings?	In Italy, still life paintings are called 'natura morta', which translates to 'dead nature'.	"['In France they\'re called ""nature morte."" In Italy, they\'re known as ""natura Morta."" The Dutch call them ""still-leven,"" which may account for the English designation, ""still-life."" It\'s interesting that the French and Italian terms translate to ""dead nature,"" while in Northern Europe, the emphasis is on life, albeit still life. Nineteenth century academic tradition had it that this painting genre occupied the lowest levels of esteem in the painting hierarchy beginning with history painting and migrating downward. The feeling was that, while such paintings were art (just barely), they were utterly devoid of creative capital, the work of imitators and copyist--any artist with a modicum of technical know-how and a bit of patience and eye-hand co-ordination to spare. Yet as a type of painting, Pliny, writing in the first century CE, indicates that this same artistic genre dates back almost to the very beginnings of art in the Western world--at least as far back as ancient Greece.\nFor this we have more than just the Romans\' word for it. We also have their efforts at imitating this most imitative of painting genre. Thanks to a certain hyperactive volcano and no small amount of its lava ash, archaeologists have discovered still-life renderings in the frescos of Pompeii almost 2000 years old. Writings indicate that they were ""in the Greek manner"" in which case, it would seem that from the very beginning, ""tromp l\'oeil"" was their primary aim and the standard upon which they were valued as art. Roman wall paintings often featured illusionistic shelves laden with fresh fish, or nails from which hung dead fowl not unlike the nineteenth century work of American artists, William Harnett or Frederick Peto. Roman art also records similar efforts in rendering decorative plant life, marble and wood grain, as well as carved architectural features.\nAt the dawn of the Renaissance, along with the rediscovery of the Roman knowledge of one-point perspective, came the peripheral, often symbolic, use of various inanimate objects in religious works. The apple stood for original sin. The gourd was a symbol of the resurrection. Carlo Crivelli\'s The Annunciation with St. Emidius, from 1486, despite its religious aims, is an exquisitely decorated (if somewhat cluttered) showcase for both his perspective and still-life talents. He seems also to have rediscovered tromp l\'oeil.\nBut as with so much in art, it took the Dutch, and their groundbreaking switch from religious to secular patronage for the development of what we now think of as modern still-life painting. What the church eschewed as materialism, the merchant Dutchmen seemingly embraced as enthusiastically as life itself. Transitionally, Flemish painter, Jan Brueghel, usually remembered for his domestic genre scenes, in 1606 painted for the Archbishop of Milan (but not his church) an incredibly detailed floral bouquet that may well be the oldest ""modern"" still-life in existence. Painted over the period of a year, it contains flowers from various seasons, apparently added as earlier blooms faded. And though they seem to have gained their lowly placement in the hierarchy of painting about this time, the Dutch still-life, whether flowers, food, or valuable objects, occupied the time and efforts of a sizeable number of professional artists, and seem to have become the primary emphasis for many Dutch female painters such as Anne Valleyer-Costa. Her 1767 Still Life with Ham, Bottles, and Radishes looks appetising even today.\nIt wasn\'t until the latter part of the nineteenth century with the Impressionist and Postimpressionist rebellion against all things academic, including their damnable painting hierarchy, that the still-life began to take on a new life of its own. Renoir explored them, and more prominently, Cézanne, Matisse, and Picasso, reversing the common perception that such art was merely the ""imitation of life."" Their work, such as Cézanne’s Still Life with Plaster Cupid, painted in 1895, sought not to imitate nature, but to use objects and their natural shapes, colours, and textures as a means to explore art design and composition. The result was a natural bridge from the real world into the exciting, but frightening frontiers of abstraction. That road lead eventually, not just to painting still-life objects, but to collage, and using them as a part of the still-life painting itself.\nLater in the twentieth century, Audrey Flack merged Dutch vanitas elements of still life with Cézanne’s design emphasis, Picasso\'s collage sensitivities, and the hyper-realistic gifts proffered by photography into a type of brightly coloured still-life painting light years beyond Brueghel, Cézanne, or Picasso. Her World War II (Vanitas), from 1967, layers what appear to be magazine cut-outs (painted) next to shiny, tromp l\'oeil still-life treasures, over a painted black and white photo of starving holocaust survivors. The result is a sort of merger of traditional ""dead nature"" and ""still life"" elements into an art that is neither. It\'s an art, like all the best art, combining aesthetic beauty with a consummate mastery of medium and message.']"	['<urn:uuid:549770a3-4f02-44b7-b1ff-623dd382664a>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	10	14	812
92	How did the women working at Abbots Cliff House on the White Cliffs of Dover contribute to protecting British pilots during World War II?	At Abbots Cliff House, German linguists, primarily young women, collected Very High Frequency (VHF) communications from Germany that were directing aircraft and E-boats in the English Channel. This was the first time voice communications had been intercepted in this way. The tactical information these women collected daily helped protect British pilots and sailors, including helping to save British pilots who had been downed over the Channel from being captured by German forces.	['From five unlikely locations across the UK, including a farm-house outside London and a manor on the White Cliffs of Dover, GCHQ carried out top secret operations, including:\n- Identifying and deciphering secret communications between Adolf Hitler and his field marshals;\n- Intercepting a fax for the first time in British intelligence history to help prevent Japanese fighter pilots getting the better of our America allies; and\n- Mounting our Cold War efforts against the Soviet Union, by pioneering the interception of communications from its army, navy and air force.\nWe have revealed the work done at these little-known sites to provide an insight into signals intelligence over the course of our 100-year history.\nThese locations, dotted around the UK, have long since closed down – to be replaced by the organization’s better known sites in Cheltenham, Bude and Scarborough, and the National Cyber Security’s offices in Victoria, London.\nAs Director GCHQ Jeremy Fleming has said, the past century has seen GCHQ “save countless lives, given Britain an edge, and solve and harness some of the world’s most complex technological challenges”.\nFrom a quiet farm house in Kent to a discreet office block in Mayfair, our 100-year history is full of ordinary people working together to solve extraordinary problems. That work continues today at and around secret locations across the UK.\nIvy Farm: Intercepting Hitler’s orders\nOperational in the Second World War, Ivy Farm, Knockholt Kent was the home to the Headquarters for the Foreign Office Research and Development Establishment, which sits within GCHQ in Cheltenham today. Staff numbered between 60-100.\nOperations: Rather than monitoring voice or Morse Code, for the first time in UK Intelligence history staff at Ivy Farm investigated what is known as “noise” – sound which does not carry human communications. Some of the UK’s brightest technologists were brought in to work at this site, including from the Post Office (where Tommy Flowers, who made the world’s first computer started work on Colossus). This noise carried the secret to Adolf Hitler’s most secure communications with his field marshals across Europe. It used encrypted teleprinter technology, which was many more times secure than Enigma.\nInteresting Fact: Staff successfully intercepted and isolated this “noise” which was passed onto Bletchley to decipher, and ultimately lead to the creation of the world’s first computer Colossus. The site was also responsible for the first-ever UK interception of fax. A Japanese press attaché in Berlin had sent a fax, featuring details of US bomber squadrons and formations, to a Tokyo-based press agency intended for the Japanese military so they could better attack the US air force. This information was passed to US allies so they could adapt their tactics accordingly.\nAbbots Cliff House: Women protecting the White Cliffs of Dover\nOperational between 1940 and 1945, Abbots Cliff House at Capel le Ferne had between 50- 60 people working there.\nOperations: This base collected Very High Frequency (VHF) communications from Germany directing aircraft or fast moving E-boats in the English Channel. VHF has a very short range which meant that German linguists, mainly young women, were sent to the front line to live log the communications.\nInteresting Fact: This type of interception had never been done before for voice communications and the tactical nature of this job meant that every day the information collected by these young women was helping to protect British pilots and sailors. German forces would try to capture British pilots downed over the Channel and information from Abbots Cliff House would have helped to save some British pilots during the war.\nToday: Abbots Cliff House is still there today, with views across to France.\nChesterfield Street: The start of Cold War operations\nOperational between 1944-1953 the site in Mayfair, London, started with around 10 people before hosting up to 60 at capacity.\nOperations: This office block was the start of what became GCHQ in the Cold War. All soviet targets were worked on from this office and the first interception of army, navy and air force was achieved here. The office stayed open until 1953 when the recently avowed Palmer Street office near St James’ Park was opened to consolidate all of our London offices\nInteresting Fact: Bill Bonsall joined as one of the 10 people in 1944, mainly working on German Airforce intercept. He later went onto become Director GCHQ in 1973.\nToday: It is now the site of the High Commission of The Bahamas which was first established in the 1970s.\nMarston Montgomery: The first woman commander\nThis site, in Marston Montgomery, Derbyshire, made up of a series of wooden huts in a remote location, was set up in 1941 and closed in 1947. Around 100 people were based here.\nOperations: Set up as an outstation of RAF Cheadle, the Head Office for RAF Sigint, Marston Montgomery was the home of technical radio and operator fingerprinting. Staff would be listening to at least 25 different operators each, identifying individual radio signals – for example by the speed that people would tap out Morse code. Once enemy operators were identified this information could be used to piece together troop movements.\nInteresting Fact: This was the first GCHQ base to have a woman commander, 2nd officer Pamela Pigeon.\nToday: The site was dismantled after the war.\nCroft Spa: Farming for enemy signals\nLocated just south of Darlington this site was operational between 1940- 75 and was home to up to 20 operators.\nOperations: Croft Spa was a direction-finding station – which meant it worked in conjunction with other sites to pinpoint the location of enemy signals from ships in the North Sea.\nInteresting fact: This tiny rural station, on the edge of a military facility, was the perfect place to locate a listening station due to the low noise floor. However, when agriculture became more mechanised, the staff frequently had to ask local farmers to stop their work (but not told why) so noise from the machinery did not interfere with the collection of important communications.']	['<urn:uuid:aa7fc1a4-37d2-40cd-9662-7ec768854b8b>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	24	72	997
93	brain exercises keep seniors sharp	Seniors can stay mentally active through activities such as playing board games, working on puzzles like Sudoku and crosswords, writing, reading books, playing musical instruments, exercising (including yoga and tai chi), and taking classes. Many colleges now offer free courses to seniors.	['Updated April 25, 2021 – When you think of your elderly parents or grandparents, you want to picture them happy, fulfilled, and enjoying life. However, as they age, many factors in their lives can change. Problems with physical or health-related challenges, as well as decline in cognitive function all can put elderly at greater risk of losing their quality of life.\nWhat are the top factors affecting the quality of life of elderly adults?\n1. Health Care Issues\nQuality of life in anyone, including elderly adults can be severely impacted if they are in chronic pain or undergoing medical treatments and also if they are dealing with depression, anxiety or other psychological problems.\n2. Social Issues\nMany seniors find themselves in social isolation because of mobility issues or they are aging in place in a home that does not have easy access to community events and activities or many other factors that could contribute to their isolation.\nAlthough it’s hard to measure social isolation and loneliness precisely, there is strong evidence that many adults aged 50 and older are socially isolated or lonely in ways that put their health at risk.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nThese issues can greatly impact an older adult’s quality of life.\n3. Home Environment\nLiving in a home environment that is unsafe and/or uncomfortable can easily create or contribute to depression, anxiety, social isolation and of course – injury.\nMany older adults try their best to age in place in their own home but they neglect to modify the home or consider the location of the home and how that will impact them in their later years.\nI have a friend who retired to a small town in New Mexico. She and her husband enjoyed their first few years there but as their health began to decline they found themselves having to travel hours to a hospital for proper medical care.\nIt’s important to consider these issues when deciding where to spend the rest of your years. After all, being comfortable in your lifestyle will go a long way to giving you a wonderful quality of life.\nWhat Factors Determine A Good Quality Of Life?\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines “quality of life” as “an individual’s perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards, and concerns.”\nA good quality of life is more than just an arbitrary number. It’s about the things that make you happy, fulfill your needs and desires, and bring meaning to your existence. However, not everyone will agree on what makes a good quality of life.\nThe factors that determine a good quality of life for older people are different for each person – it could be anything from being able to take care of yourself without help to having physical or mental freedom. Some people might value family time and relationships while others might focus on their career or even hobbies outside the home. The important thing is figuring out what matters most in order to live as well as possible with any limitations you may have in mind.\nMany different factors determine the quality of life for each person. Some of the concepts essential to figuring out someone’s positive and negative life aspects can include:\n- Overall health and wellness\n- Sleep Quality\n- The person’s belief system (religion, faith, ideals, culturally, etc…)\n- Their psychological state of mind\n- Levels of activity and regular exercise – both physical and mental\n- Social relationships, as well as their relationship with themselves and their environment\nFurther, a study published in the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health by Khaje-Bishak, et al, noted that “poor economic, cultural, educational and health care conditions and also inadequate social interactions can result in poor quality of life in elderly people.”\nEvery person’s quality of life is determined based on their situation. The elderly population are often faced with different challenges than other age groups because they have less mobility and more health issues.\nHowever, this doesn’t mean that they don’t enjoy some aspects of living in retirement homes or assisted living facilities – many find it comforting to live among people who share similar struggles and experiences as themselves.\nHow Is Age Related To Quality Of Life?\nOne study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, suggests that our happiness and life satisfaction peaks around age 68. Other studies show similar results.\nThese studies are based on hundreds or thousands of adults, and there will always be outliers and people who do not fit that mold.\nInstead, age-related quality of life is more of a guideline to show what national and international averages look like from a purely statistical and data-driven point of view.\nAge is not a particularly interesting subject. Anyone can get old. All you have to do is live long enough.Groucho Marx\nWhen an older adult can find that fulfilled groove or a way to improve their quality of life, it can be seen as a new chapter. This is a positive and healthy way to view the next “X amount” of years.\nWhen you look at it in this way, satisfaction with life becomes less about the science behind the age and more about how the person approaches their advancing age and the time they have left.\nHow Can The Quality Of Life Be Improved In The Elderly?\nThere are a few ways that the quality of life in older adults be improved.\n- Getting regular medical check ups and care\n- Getting regular physical exercise\n- Providing them with transportation options\n- Utilizing tools and services to make life safer and easier\n- Making their own homes / living environments more accessible and comfortable\n- Ensuring they have positive social interactions and are involved in activities\nNo matter our age, we all need a sense of purpose. It moves our days forward, provides us aspirations to strive for, and it just feels good. Most humans like knowing that we’re needed or can help out in some way. Being useful can make a huge difference in one’s sense of self which impacts their quality of life.\nIt follows that when people retire, finding an activity in which we can feel useful is typically the first step toward finding a new purpose in life. But factors such as mobility issues and cognitive impairment can make that task much more difficult\nHowever, this phase of life can also be an exciting time for the elderly because they have the chance to spark new passions, learn new skills, and find ways to feel useful through things like volunteering.\nWhen a senior finds that sense of purpose, it improves their overall health and well-being. People who find no meaning in life or feel useless have a much harder time being active and working to maintain good health.\nSo how can the elderly feel useful and find further purpose?\n- Start with small goals: Each day, look for little tasks or goals that are meaningful to you. Instead of broad strokes, think smaller – even little things can make an impact. When you can check something off a list, that “win” helps to keep you motivated.\n- Find activities that positively affect others: Maybe this means planting some flowers where fellow neighbors or members of the community can see them and smile. Maybe it’s helping to take care of a friend or family member’s pet while they are at work. Anything that offers a helping hand or helps improve someone else’s day will, in turn, improve your day as well. Along those lines, volunteering is a great way to stay active and feel a sense of purpose and passion.\nAs you can imagine, there will not be a one-size-fits-all answer to how to give the elderly a purpose. Seniors need to explore what is most meaningful to them and what they would like to accomplish in their golden years.\nDoing this will help them find true purpose rather than a cookie-cutter solution that may not feel as fulfilling to them as it does to others.\nPreventing Social Isolation In The Elderly\nIf we can agree that loneliness is a problem for everyone, then it seems like older adults may be especially susceptible to social isolation and the problems associated with it such as health issues, depression, memory loss, and even early death.\nOne study found that lonely seniors who were socially isolated for more than three weeks had increased risk of death by 28%. Since this can be so detrimental, it’s important to find ways to prevent social isolation in the elderly.\nHere are some great tips for preventing that pitfall of elderly social isolation:\n- Transportation: Figure out a system for elderly friends and family to help them with their transportation needs. Offering to go to the store for them is great, but if they are physically capable, helping them get out and into a social atmosphere is even better.\n- Family meals: Encourage family meals and outings with the senior. Mealtime is ideal for getting everyone together. And for the elderly who may not have as much social interaction every day, a simple dinner with family can brighten their entire week.\n- Find specific social activities: It’s one thing to get dragged to a group activity like a book club at simply because there is nothing else to do. It’s another to go because the person loves arts and crafts and wants to meet other people and possible new friends who enjoy these activities too. Finding those specific activities that speak to the older adult will make it more encouraging to attend and be social.\nHow To Keep Seniors Mentally Active\nIt’s a dangerous thing when our minds become inactive. Boredom and lack of stimulation can easily lead to depression and further cognitive decline.\nBeing mentally active and being challenged daily with a variety of brain games will help an elderly person stay sharp and in a better state of mind.\nHere are some great ideas for seniors who need a boost in mental stimulation:\n- Play board games or work on puzzles, such as Sudoku and crossword puzzles\n- Write down the book that’s been rolling around in your head for years, or journal about your life, current events, or wisdom you’d like your heirs to know.\n- Read the books you have always wanted to read, but never got around to.\n- Play an instrument (or learn a new one).\n- Exercise and stay strong with core exercises for seniors, yoga, tai chi, dance, or whatever you love. The University of Arizona has produced studies showing how exercise is not only crucial to our physical health, but also our mental well-being.\n- Take classes – many colleges and universities now offer free courses to seniors (or finish that college degree you’ve always wanted to obtain).\nFor more ideas for staying mentally active, check out our article on keeping elderly minds sharp.\nQuality Of Life In Seniors\nThe phrase, “quality of life in seniors,” will mean different things to each elderly person. This is because we all have different perspectives, depending on our culture, overall health, social relationships, and beliefs.\nThe main thing to remember is that there are so many ways to help improve that quality of life.\nFinding purpose by being of service to others, being socially engaged, getting regular physical activity and engaging in challenging mental activities will help seniors to find and maintain a fulfilling life for years to come.']	['<urn:uuid:e5fa2b6a-fe5d-4dc4-a62c-9435c6204a20>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	5	42	1938

Use these tools to further develop your technique and understanding of the sous vide cooking method.\nHistory of Sous Vide\nWhile sous vide is a relatively new form of cooking, the fundamentals of sous vide cooking are ancient. Most cultures have traditional dishes in which the food is tightly wrapped and cooked at a low temperature for a long time.The modern era of sous vide began in the early 1970s when food researchers and chefs in France searched for a way to reduce product loss when cooking foie gras. They found that by cooking foie gras sous vide, much higher yield and improved texture could be achieved. Since then, chefs have been inspired to step back and thoroughly re-evaluate at which time and temperature to handle ingredients while preserving maximum of its integrity, flavor and color.Today sous vide has become standard in top kitchens worldwide. Food lovers have long admired the amazing flavors and textures that gourmet chefs achieved with sous vide cooking. With equipment and education being now more accessible for home chefs, the idea of guaranteed perfect and repeatable results with very easy steps has made sous vide extremely attractive for home chefs as well. It will add a new dimension to cooking for many aspiring chefs.']	['<urn:uuid:faadc43f-3205-406c-91d1-5225d4ae81da>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	7	34	930
95	Does COTSbot or RangerBot have more advanced features?	RangerBot represents an advancement over COTSbot, significantly extending its capabilities. While both use vision systems to detect crown-of-thorns starfish, RangerBot adds additional features like monitoring reef health indicators, water quality, and mapping. It was also designed for single-person deployment from any vessel size with an intuitive tablet interface developed using stakeholder feedback.	"['If news bulletins explaining how climate change has devastated parts of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef leave you feeling impotent and depressed, maybe getting involved in one of several citizen science projects up there could help.\nResearchers from Brisbane-based university QUT run several programs that are turning everyone from secondary school kids to tourists into marine scientists.\nStatistician Erin Peterson, for example, designed the Virtual Reef Diver project to drive a new approach to monitoring and managing the Great Barrier Reef.\nMembers of the public can log on to the website and work through the collection of photographs, classifying the images as they go.\nLess “virtual” divers and snorkellers can submit underwater images they have taken while out on the Reef for others to classify.\nThis work is vital.\n“The main challenge that we were trying to address is that the Great Barrier Reef is huge,” says Peterson. “It costs a lot to monitor it all.”\n“But there are more than 65 different organisations out there collecting data on the reef – specifically images – all the time.\n“Plus we have all these citizens out snorkelling or scuba diving, and everybody has an underwater camera now.\n“And so the idea was, can we bring together these image-based data from all these different sources, and learn more about what’s going on to get an estimate of coral cover.”\nOnce the data is in and classified, data scientists such as Peterson design statistical models to create a predictive map across the whole of the Great Barrier Reef. Thanks to ordinary lay people, the information is as up-to-date as possible.\nMeanwhile, reef researcher Brett Lewis, at QUT’s Science and Engineering Faculty, has his sights set not on the Great Barrier Reef but its smaller cousins in Moreton Bay, near Brisbane.\nHis work focusses on reefs in inner Moreton Bay to see how they cope with climate stress, and what that can tell us about the larger ecosystem to the north.\nApart from climate, the bay reefs face challenges from sediments spilling from the Brisbane River. This is where Lewis’s work holds relevance for studying the effects of dredging on the Great Barrier Reef.\n“One of the easiest things for us to do, and one of the most beneficial for the local area, is to understand how the corals are surviving sedimentation from the Brisbane River and this turbid environment,” he says. “And I have the techniques to be able to carry this out.”\nFor much of his work, Lewis uses time-lapse videography and other visual media to capture, in detail, the changes in corals.\nWhen Iona College in the Brisbane bayside suburb of Wynnum reached out to see if he would help the students develop a marine science project, he said “yes” immediately.\nTo start with, Lewis gave students in years 9, 10 and 11 a crash course in scientific observation. Then, after helping them set up aquariums with corals, he gave them a project: create time-lapse videos of how corals deal with different forms of sedimentation, coarse and fine.\nNot only did students get to run the experiments, they got to report on the results, learning to present at conferences.\n“I wanted them to see the impact that their research can have rather than me saying that their research is going to have impact,” says Lewis. “They can visualise it for themselves and see that, yeah, it’s important that we also communicate.”\nQUT’s Matthew Dunbabin and his team keep watch on the Great Barrier Reef – and other reefs around the world – using technology. He and his team last year launched RangerBot, an underwater drone that can monitor marine health and even take direct action – by identifying and destroying the devastating crown-of-thorns starfish.\nRangerBot’s high-tech vision system allows it to “see” under water, a system that helped it win the 2016 Google Impact Challenge People’s Choice prize when it was still under development.\nHaving “trained” the RangerBot to take on the crown-of-thorns, QUT researchers are teaching it new tricks. In April they took it to the Philippines to help in reseeding reefs destroyed by dynamite fishing.\nThe project won Dunbabin and Southern Cross University’s Peter Harrison the Great Barrier Reef Foundation’s $300,000 Out of the Blue Box Reef Innovation Challenge.\n“We’re looking at a large-scale spreading of the coral spawn,” Dunbabin says.\n“At the moment it’s a manual task, but we attach different payloads that hold bags of concentrated coral spawn after they’ve [been] reared and fertilised.”\nOnce that project has been assessed, Dunbabin will head back to the Great Barrier Reef for a similar project at the end of the year.\nAnd there’s room in RangerBot’s work for the citizen scientist, too.\n“We’ve set it up so that it can be used as a citizen science program,” he says. “We have a citizen science portal where we upload data that’s been collected and lay scientists can help identify crown-of-thorns starfish, helping to verify what the robot thought it saw.”\nThey are also working on another project they call the “coral point count” to engage the public where they can upload their own data from their own observations in a similar way to the Virtual Reef project.\n“We’ve developed that with schools,” Dunbabin says. “We were lucky enough to get some money from the Lord Mayor’s Charitable Fund in Melbourne and the Dalio Foundation to engage high schools and other stakeholders.”\n“High schools where students studied marine science were asked to use the technology and give us feedback on what they liked and how we can make it a useful tool.\n“So they actually helped guide the development of the interface for the robot and got an understanding of the technology, and used it as part of that assessment,” he said.\nProfessor Dunbabin says it is vital to keep people engaged so they don’t give up hope of keeping the reef vibrant.\n“I think everybody has a role that can help protect the Reef,” he says. “People can actually be part of the science, where they’re analysing the data that helps them contribute to the protection of the reef.”\nRead science facts, not fiction...\nThere’s never been a more important time to explain the facts, cherish evidence-based knowledge and to showcase the latest scientific, technological and engineering breakthroughs.

I am known for my research into field (environmental) robotics and their application to large-scale environmental monitoring, management and change quantification, particularly in marine and aquatic systems.\nI received a B.Eng in Aerospace Engineering from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and a PhD from QUT. I started my professional career in 1995 as a project engineer at Roaduser Research International. Following my PhD I joined the CSIRO Autonomous Systems Laboratory in 2001. As a Principal Research Scientist at CSIRO I held various roles including project leader and the Robotics Systems and Marine Robotics team leader before moving to QUT in 2013.\nI have wide research interests including vision-based navigation, vision-based learning and classification, adaptive sampling and path planning, cooperative robotics, and visual and acoustic stealth. A detailed bio is on my QUT profile.\nI undertake a range of robotics research particularly focused around vision-based navigation and control, adaptive sampling, associative learning, and image-based habitat mapping and change quantification. This fundamental research is typically applied to help solve challenging environmental science problems. Below is a summary of current (2018) projects.\nRangerBot Autonomous Underwater Vehicle\nThe RangerBot Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is a novel vision-based robotic tool that has been developed to provide coral reef managers, researchers and community groups extra ‘hands and eyes’ in the water to help monitor and manage various threats on the Great Barrier Reef. This includes monitoring reef health indicators like coral bleaching and water quality, mapping and inspection, and the monitoring and control of pests like the Crown-Of-Thorns Starfish (COTS). The RangerBot AUV significantly extends the capabilities of its predecessor, the COTSbot AUV, and exploits real-time on-board vision for navigation, obstacle detection and management tasks. The RangerBot has been developed for single person deployment and operation from any size vessel or shoreline with an intuitive tablet-based interface created using feedback from key stakeholders. This project is in collaboration with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation with support from the Google Impact Challenge.\nThe official public release of RangerBot will be mid-August 2018. Stay tuned!\nFor more information check out the GBRF RangerBot page here.\nVision-based multi-robot formation control & docking\nThis project is developing scalable vision-based formation control algorithms that allow multiple AUVs to conduct novel swath bathymetry and benthic imagery surveys in complex coral reef environments. Using customized RangerBot AUVs, the approach exploits their on-board vision capabilities of the AUVs for a V-formation ""follow-the-leader"" approach to ensure complete coverage without the need for inter-robot wireless communications. A key challenge is to ensure complete minimally overlapping coverage over complex 3D benthic terrain at relatively low attitudes above the seafloor (< 2m).\nIn addition to the vision-based formation control algorithms, new approaches to scalable docking (deployment and retrieval) of multiple AUVs are being developed and experimentally evaluated using the RangerBot AUVs and a customized Inference ASV. This work has built on previous vision-based AUV and ASV docking research for at surface (paper) and underwater water (paper) retrieval and cooperative underwater robotic systems (paper). The overall goal is to allow a single ASV to deploy and retrieve up to 4 AUVs at sea to demonstrate large-scale autonomous benthic surveying capabilities.\nAutonomous Underwater Lander (Mission orientated perception)\nThe Autonomous Underwater Lander (AUL) project is focused on developing advanced real-time vision systems that allows an underwater robot to automatically select benthic landing locations during its decent. The approach uses multi-resolution and multi-sensor classification which upon selection of a region of interest from multi-beam sonar maps (e.g. Halimeda bioherms), the AUL starts to descend and continuously classifies the benthos to guide the robot to a landing site which has the desired characteristics for sampling. The goal is to maximize the likelihood of obtaining relevant benthic and pore-water samples in previously unmapped scientifically relevant locations. This project is in collaboration with Mardi McNeil and Alistair Grinham who are developing the physical sampling system for the AUL (a customized RangerBot AUV).\nAutomated marine pest population monitoring & management: COTSbot\nThis project is developing advanced image processing techniques and underwater robotic platforms to detect, count and map the distribution of a range of marine pests. It expands previous research into automated marine pest classification for Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (Acanthaster planci) and Northern Pacific Sea Star (Asterias amurenis), with the goal of improving detection rates and providing tools for accurately measuring their spatial and temporal distribution. The results will assist marine scientists and authorities in understanding pest movement dynamics, their impact, and in managing threats. This project is in collaboration with Feras Dayoub with financial support from QUTbluebox.\nFor more information check out the COTSbot project page here.\nLarge-scale aquatic greenhouse gas quantification\nThis project is developing novel techniques for the large-scale temporal quantification of greenhouse gases (particularly methane) from inland waterways. It is uniquely combining persistent robotic platforms, image-processing, sensor networks, and automated sensors. The techniques and sampling paradigms developed in this project are providing limnologists and ecologists the ability to accurately quantify methane flux rates, improving model development and fundamental process understanding. This work is in collaboration with Alistair Grinham from The University of Queensland.\nSome of the latest publications are:\nRobots for Environmental Education\nThis project focuses on engaging primary and high-school students with robotic technology to raise awareness on key environmental issues and to encourage broader on-the-ground action to help mitigate these issues. In 2017, in collaboration with ManuelaToboaba and Tim Williams from the QUT School of Design we developed the “Plastic Waste Elimination Challenge”, an interactive technology-based activity for engaging and educating the public of the impact of plastic waste/litter on waterways. It was first showcased at the 2017 QUT Robotronica event which attracted over 22,000 people. A refined version was showcased at the 2018 World Science Festival Brisbane in collaboration with The Great Barrier Reef Foundation.\nAnother project, completed 2017, has focused on evaluating how non-tech savvy community groups can upscale Crown-of-Thorns Starfish control programs funded by the Dalio Foundation and the Lord Mayors Charitable Fund.\nInference: Robotic adaptive sampling\nThis project has created and is demonstrating new scalable adaptive sampling capabilities to enable large-scale monitoring of the environment, including dynamic and extreme events (e.g. floods, cyclones, fires) using multiple, persistent robotic sensors. To facilitate algorithm development, a novel persistent robotic system has been developed called Inference. The system consists of multiple networked robotic boats which provides an open architecture allowing researchers to evaluate new sampling algorithms on real-world processes over extended periods of time.\nThe Inference ASVs are currently being used in collaboration with Sara Couperthwaite for water sampling at Mount Morgan, and Alistair Grinham for large-scale green-house gas sampling on inland waterways.\nHigh-speed Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) control in narrow waterways\nThe goal of this project is to develop novel adaptive controllers and vision-based perception and trajectory planners for high-speed ASV\'s in narrow and cluttered waterways. Target operating scenarios include previously unmapped creeks and high flow-rate flooded rivers with limited and/or unreliable GPS localization to perform tasks such as sample collection and help with swift water rescue operations. A prototype jet powered ASV has been developed with a maximum speed of 22 knots. It has on-board cameras and LiDAR for situational awareness and a computer for real-time processing and control.\nThe latest conference paper describing an experimental evaluation of an adaptive receding horizon controller for the high-speed ASV can be found here.\nMaritime RobotX Challenge\nThe Maritime RobotX Challenge is an international student competition with the goal of significantly advancing the autonomy capabilities of Autonomous Surface Vehicles on a range of complex real-world tasks. The RobotX Challenge started in 2014 and is held every two years. QUT was selected as one of three teams to represent Australia at the Maritime RobotX Challenge that took place in Singapore in 2014. The Challenge sponsors provides all competing teams with a WAM-V USV manufactured by Marine Advanced Research Inc., however, they are supplied with no propulsion, power, sensors or computing hardware. TeamQUT has fitted their platform with an electric propulsion system and various localization and perception sensors, as well as high-performance computing and communication hardware. TeamQUT consists of a group of enthusiastic students studying a range of engineering majors, including mechatronics, electrical, and computer and software systems. The team has developed and continually refine a set of novel vision-based target detection systems, as well as LiDAR and Radar based mapping and path planning systems which allowed them to place 3rd overall in Singapore (2014) and place 2nd overall in Hawaii (2016). The next RobotX Challenge will be held in December 2018 with TeamQUT fielding a new team with improved hardware and software systems.\nFor more information check out TeamQUT\'s 2018 official website.\nArchive: TeamQUT 2016 Journal Paper\nArchive: TeamQUT\'s 2014 official website.\nVisual and Acoustic Stealth\nTracking dynamic targets without being detected requires not only visual but also acoustic stealth. Our goal is to significantly extend both these concepts by uniquely combining visual and acoustic stealth to maintain continuous line-of-sight observation to a moving natural object of interest, such as wild animals, in outdoor environments without being detected. We have demonstrated the combined acoustic and visual stealth approach for covertly tracking a moving target and more recently extended this for the robot to recognise and use shadows as more discreet vantage points (paper). This work is in collaboration with Ashley Tews from CSIRO.\nExtreme Robotics: Robots vs volcano\nSometimes it can be fun to push robotics to the extreme. Since 2014, in collaboration with Alistair Grinham and Simon Albert from The University of Queensland, we have developing very low-cost (essentially disposable) imaging and robotic sampling systems to explore one of the most active submarine volcanoes in the South Pacific called Kavachi. Initially this was just a fun activity to blow up some robots in a volcano, but from the data we collected, we discovered some amazing things such as sharks living in one of the most hostile places on earth. We were lucky enough to team up with explorers from National Geographic who produced a number of cool YouTube videos on what we were finding. The next trip is planned for late 2018 with some even cooler robotic tech.\nVideo: Robot vs Volcano\nAlso there is a journal paper on the latest findings: Exploring the “Sharkcano”: Biogeochemical observations of the Kavachi submarine volcano (Solomon Islands).\nRobots Past and Present\nOver the last 14 years I have developed and built many field robot platforms for the sea, land and air domains. Particular emphasis has been on applying them to undertake complex tasks and answering specific questions particularly relating to environmental science.\nRobots developed and used since joining QUT in June 2013.\nThese are the many robots I worked on and developed whilst working at the CSIRO Autonomous Systems Laboratory.\nComplete publication list and citation analysis is available from Google Scholar.\nYou can also access most of my publications at the QUT ePrints repository.\nDunbabin, M. and Grinham, A.

96	Do Mars and Earth both have liquid water today?	No, while Earth has abundant liquid water covering 71% of its surface, Mars is desiccated and frozen with an average temperature of -55°C. Any surface water on Mars would evaporate immediately due to its thin atmosphere, though some water may remain as subsurface permafrost or polar ice.	"['- it exists in a narrow Goldilocks Zone,\n- it was given a huge heat boost by a collision from a large planetoid, and\n- its crust was given a lot of water from impacting comets that allowed it to be less solid, more flexible, and have an ocean of liquid water.\n- Photosynthesis then started early and gave this planet an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, and finally\n- The Earth\'s magnetic field lasted a very, very long time.\nTuesday, June 24, 2014\nThere is another version of the Anthropic Principle, one that applies only to the planet Earth. We may be more alone, or unique, in this universe than the Drake Equation - the calculation of the possibility of other life out there in the universe - may have led us to believe.\nThe deepest hole ever drilled into the Earth\'s crust reached down to about 7.6 miles (12 km) below the Kola peninsula of northern Russia. The technology available to humankind cannot get below that depth (and that depth took 24 years of drilling and billions of Rubles to achieve). The rocks are so hot and plastic with overlying rock pressure at those depths that the hole closes in on the drill bit - and partially fills the shaft back in from the sides as the bit is drawn back to the surface to be replaced. So... the maximum depth achieved by humanity\'s best effort is less than 1/10,000 the Earth\'s diameter, or the distance of a short commute on a Monday morning. We actually know more about galaxies, comets, and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn than we do about what lies below our feet on our own planet. No matter how you look at it, we cannot really touch virtually all of the world beneath our feet.\nIn other words, everything we think we know about the interior of the Earth is obtained by very indirect means, and a lot of this is from mathematical modeling.\nTo see below the depth of the Kola well, we must rely in electrical geophysical methods like magnetotellurics (which is one of the things that I ""do"" as a geophysicist; it can detect resistivity layering down to perhaps 50 km or so), and on earthquakeseismology. For nearly a century seismologists have traced the powerful vibration signals from very large earthquakes as these signals propagate and refract through the Earth. By comparing the time of arrivals elsewhere around the planet - and whether just P-waves, or P-waves and S-waves together make it - they can discern contrasts in density and other physical parameters as these change with depth. P-waves (or primary waves) are pulses of energy, momentarily compressing the material they pass through. It\'s the blast wave from an explosion expanding outward. S-waves (or secondary waves) are shear waves, oscillating material back and forth, sideways, as they pass through the material. Think of how you would move your hands forward and backward to tear a piece of paper. A key feature of S-waves is that they cannot propagate through a liquid. Think of trying to use your hands to tear water. By the 1920\'s seismologists had used the initial earthquake seismic information and some density calculations to conclude that there is a solid iron core to the Earth, surrounded by an outer liquid iron part of the core. The outer liquid core is overlain by a hot and plastic Mantle, and finally by a relatively thin crust serving as a very thin solid shell above them both. All living things live on or just beneath the top of that crust.\nThe methodical genius who first figured all this out was a quiet Danish lady named Inge Lehmann, who died in 1993 at 104 years of age.\nSeismology and magnetotellurics show us the layering in the Earth with depth. Indirectly we also know that the center of the earth is very hot. After all, there are volcanoes and fumaroles, and the deeper you mine in places like South Africa the hotter it gets. Nearly everywhere scientists have measured temperature in wells, a thermal gradient exists: deeper means hotter. But we also know there is a lot of heat below us for several other reasons, including plate tectonics. SOMETHING has to be powering whole continents to be able to wander around. And then there\'s the magnetic field of the earth.\nWhat distinguishes Earth from Mars and the Moon? A magnetic field, an atmosphere, liquid water - and life. The last requires the first three in our limited observations so far. Without a magnetic field to deflect it, Solar radiation would sterilize the Earth and disrupt any attempt for life to gain a foothold. Solar radiation would also strip away any atmosphere, which is apparently why Mars doesn\'t have much atmosphere left to speak of. Mar\'s atmosphere is only a few percent of the density of our own atmosphere - though there is evidence of much more at one time in the distant past.\nWhat distinguishes Venus from the Earth? Venus has an atmosphere, but it has fallen under a runaway Greenhouse Effect - too hot for water and in fact so hot that raw sulfur is a liquid on its surface. The Earth lies in what is sometimes called the ""Goldilocks Zone"" where it\'s not too hot and not too cold, between roasting Venus and frigid Mars. Water on Earth not only exists, but can exist in all three states (solid, liquid, and gaseous). This is not so for Mars or Venus, neither of which has a magnetic field, nor plate tectonics, nor significant water.\nIt has been apparent for quite awhile that the Earth\'s magnetic field is the reason why life exists on our planet. A magnetic field, however, requires some sort of dynamo to create and sustain it. How to power this? Well, if there are enough radioactive elements - or sufficient heat from the collapse of the proto-planetary disk to form our planet - well then maybe there is enough energy to drive a dynamo. However, this requires a lot of assumptions that scientists cannot test - they can\'t drill deep enough.\nThere is another problem: hot things tend to cool when surrounded by colder things... like interplanetary space. A magnetic field driven by an internal dynamo cannot last forever.\nHot things cool in two ways: by conduction and/or by convection. Conduction is like the metal pot you cook your cream of wheat in. Heat transfers from a hot source beneath to a cooler part above without any motion of particles involved. With convection, however - the bubbling cream of wheat - the heat is transferred by particles moving in three-dimensional loops called hydrothermal cells. You see them as bubbles driven by steam in the sauce pan. A hotter particle of the wheat from the bottom, in contact with the metal pan, rises because it is hotter (and thus less dense) than the particles above it, thus transferring heat from the bottom to the top of the cream of wheat. If the stuff cannot convect - if it\'s not liquid enough - then it will get hotter and hotter until it burns. It not only tastes terrible, but the sauce pan is a bear to clean up afterwards. In the same way, the solid iron core can only conduct heat out; like the metal sauce pan it cannot convect heat. However, the liquid iron outer core and the hot and plastic mantle above it can convect heat - and these convection cells of highly conductive material must be the source of the magnetic dynamo. The convection cells in the mantle are also what\'s driving whole continents around across the face of the Earth.\nRemnant magnetization in rocks 3.5 billion years old, however, proves that the Earth\'s magnetic dynamo has existed for at least that long. The oldest known life is found in stromatolites - clumps of cyanobacteria - just about that old. This is not a coincidence. If there was no protective magnetic field, the stromatolites and then algae (and Earth\'s atmosphere) would not have survived Solar winds and radiation. But 3.5 billion years is a long time for something to stay hot enough to drive a magnetic-field-producing dynamo. Older computer models based on relatively low thermal conduction assumptions for iron seemed to suggest that it would take awhile for the solid iron core to give up its heat. This could conceivably sustain a dynamo lasting that long. According to these older models, the heat from the core would take billions of years to conduct out to the outer liquid core and Mantle where a different form of heat transfer - the much faster convection - takes place.\nIn the last several years, however, scientists have been forced to re-evaluate what they think they know about the center of the earth. Several years ago, another piece of information became available from some Japanese extreme-high-pressure experiments. Iron at pressures and temperatures we calculate must exist in the center of the Earth has a far higher thermal conductivity than anyone had thought could be possible. According to milecular orbital theory, if you smash material together hard enough, it frees up electrons and changes its conductivity. This means that the Earth\'s heat-driven dynamo should have burned out billions of years ago. In other words, the Earth\'s magnetic field would have then died, and the atmosphere and any nascent life would have all disappeared before most of the geologic record could even take place. Think of dead Mars.\nSpeaking of geology, fluid and gas inclusions in ancient rocks tell us that around 2.5 billion years ago the Earth\'s primordial atmosphere of CO2 and nitrogen transitioned to an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. The world as we presently understand it began then. In part we can blame this on the stromatolites and photosynthesizing plant life that was expanding at that time.\nIn the 1970\'s a few scientists offered what seemed like a ridiculous idea: the Moon formed well after the Earth formed. It formed in its current size and shape when a large Mars-sized planetoid crashed into the proto-Earth and splattered material into space around the Earth. That material blasted into multiple orbits then coalesced to form the Moon, leaving a very different - and very hot - planet Earth behind. Computer models show that this is easily feasible. If so, then the Earth would have glowed like a small star from the massive infusion of heat from all the kinetic and potential energy of the collision. This idea is now taken seriously for several reasons, but mainly because the rocks on the Moon are sooooo much like the rocks on the Earth, and sooooo different from rocks on Vesta, Ceres, Mars, and Venus. We can discern these by optical spectroscopy, coupled with sampling meteors that the spectroscopy says must come from those places.\nCould that ancient impact hold the answer for why we have such a long-lasting magnetic field around our planet? That seems to be the best explanation at this time. If so, then life exists on this planet because of some pretty amazing circumstances:\nThose are a lot of things that had to come together at just the right time for life to form and evolve here.\nThere are so many coincidences - like the Anthropic Principle that allows molecules - and thus life - to exist. It seems remarkably like our Earth has its own local version of the Anthropic Principle: just the right features and additions at just the right times to allow life to form and evolve over an extended period of time.\nBruce Buffett, a geophysicist at Berkeley puts it this way: ""The more you look at this and think about it, the more you think it can\'t be a coincidence. The thought that these things might all be connected is kind of wondrous."" (Discover, July/August 2014, p. 41)\nWith all the exoplanets being found in solar systems nearby in the Milky Way Galaxy, what is the likelihood that one of them could have all these coincidences? Since Galileo, humanity has been humbled to know that it isn\'t the center of the universe.\nHowever, it appears that we certainly are unique.\nFriday, June 6, 2014\nQ: Thank you very much. Your answer was more than adequate. Not only did you answer my primary question but also preemptively answered some follow-up questions I may have come up with.\nMy only remaining question is how the extremely deep oil reservoirs they are finding were formed. I\'ve read some of the oil is at depths that would seem to pre-date the Carboniferous age.\nI\'m a plumber but I love pondering things such as this during my frequent ""windshield time "". I appreciate you taking the time to explain this to me and to do so in a way I can understand.\nThank you very much,\n- Patrick D\nA: You can call yourself a ""Plumber"" if you want, but you are clearly and instinctively a natural scientist. That\'s the only definition that would apply to someone who ponders the world around them to such a deep extent during ""windshield time"" as you call it. I was involved on an expedition that crossed the Empty Quarter desert in Saudi Arabia and had two formally-designated scientists (we had PhD\'s). However, most of the other 15 expedition members got deeply into what we were trying to map at the Wabar asteroid impact site (Gene Shoemaker and I published this in an article in the November 1998 Scientific American). Our expedition companions first started asking questions, then offering ideas - and as a scientific TEAM we did the partial crater excavations and the surface mapping of the site. There were 17 people on that science team.\nTo answer your other question, there was carbon on this planet from its original formation. Some is magmatic in origin - things like carbonate volcanoes, or crystallized carbonate magma more commonly called ""carbonatites"". This is primordial carbon that is thought to come from the mid-to-upper mantle. There is a carbonatite in southwestern Afghanistan that stands out from the surrounding rocks both chemically and structurally like a big red flag. There is another, a real monster, in southern Venezuela (Cerro Impacto is ~10 km across, but is NOT an impact feature). These things often have unusual levels of Thorium and Uranium in them, often in concentric zones. There are also Kimberlite Pipes - these are generally but not always tubes that carry diamonds up to the surface from the upper Mantle.\nHowever, most oil & gas deposits come from sedimentary deposition of swamps and their occupants during ages that reach back as far as life existed. The carbon in the vegetation and animal life was buried to increasingly greater depths by later sediments, sequestering it and getting it out of the atmosphere. This usually happened in large basins, and the accumulating weight of these sediments often caused the basin to bow and get deeper in the middle. As an example of how fast this accumulation can happen, I was visiting an ancient mine site in the western Arabian peninsula. This was one of ~862 small ancient mines that provided King Solomon with his gold about 3,500 years ago. In that 3,500 years, dust and sand blowing across the Red Sea from the Sahara have buried the original mine site in nearly 4.5 meters (14 feet) of loess, silt and dust that we now have to dig down through to access the original shaft. And this accumulation was on flat ground! When surrounded by eroding mountains, a basin’s sedimentation can build up much faster than this.', 'Water, water, every where,\nAnd all the boards did shrink,\nWater, water every where,\nNor any drop to drink.\nThis well-known stanza from Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s poem “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” expresses the strange paradox familiar to all sailors—being surrounded by an abundance of water yet unable to drink it. A human will die within just a few days without fresh, salt-free water. What a strange irony that someone could die of thirst in the middle of an ocean full of water.\nAs we’ve seen throughout this series’ preceding segments, water reveals astonishing design. Water is not merely exceptional—it is unique in many ways that are critical for supporting life. And water’s exceptionality doesn’t end there. The abundance of liquid water on Earth is further evidence for the design of our planet and solar system.\nThe Abundance of Liquid Water on Earth\nEarth is uniquely and distinctively the water planet. Oceans and seas cover almost 71 percent of the planet’s surface to an average depth of 2.3 miles—that’s over 12,000 feet and deeper than most mountains are tall! If we add lakes, rivers, glaciers, and icecaps, then water covers almost 75 percent of Earth. In total, the Earth contains approximately 1.368 billion cubic kilometers (more than 332 million cubic miles) of water.1\nAs Coleridge’s poem demonstrates, water lies at the heart of a galactic paradox. Water is the third most abundant molecule in the universe2—yet liquid water is exceptionally rare! Earth, on the other hand, is so blessed with liquid water that we take it for granted, even waste and squander it. How do we account for this amazing abundance?\nA Tale of Two Planets\nIn some ways, Venus and Mars are Earth’s near-identical twins (see figure 1). Venus’ diameter is only 5 percent smaller than Earth’s, while Mars’ mass is about one-tenth of Earth’s mass. Their orbits are similar to Earth’s, though Venus is 30 percent closer to the Sun and Mars 50 percent farther from it. Given these factors, one might expect these two planets to share Earth’s ability to sustain liquid water. Indeed, until just a few decades ago, many people assumed Mars was a paradise filled with intelligent life.3 However, actual probes revealed that both planets are devoid of liquid water and life. Is water-rich Earth the galactic rule, and Mars and Venus the exception—or is the reverse true?\nFigure 1: Size comparison of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars in true color.\nImage credit: Wikimedia Commons/Scooter20 based on Mercury (NASA/JPL); Venus (NASA/Image processing by R. Nunes; Earth (NASA); Mars (NASA and The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA)\nScientists now know that, in its youth, Venus contained water and experienced a more temperate climate. Today it is a dry, scorching world.4 Its crushingly-dense atmosphere has air pressures 90 times those on Earth. This thick, heat-trapping atmosphere causes temperatures on Venus’ surface to reach 480°C (900°F). So what transformed a Cinderella planet into an ugly stepsister? While scientists are still searching for a complete answer to this question, runaway overheating and loss of water due to the thick atmosphere presents one possible explanation.\nGiven Earth’s larger mass, its atmosphere should have been even thicker than Venus’—which would have prevented Earth from supporting water or life. However, the collision event that resulted in the Moon’s formation stripped away early Earth’s Venus-like atmosphere.5 The atmosphere that emerged afterwards is forty times thinner than what we find on Venus, thus allowing Earth to remain cool and wet.\nLike Venus, Mars started with liquid water. Its surface today, however, is desiccated and frozen. Mars’ distance from the Sun and almost nonexistent atmosphere (stripped away as a result of the planet’s smaller mass and closer proximity to Jupiter) led to runaway freezing, with the average surface temperature sitting at a frigid -55°C (-67°F).6 The lack of atmosphere also means that any surface water on Mars would evaporate immediately. Some water may remain, but only as permafrost trapped beneath the surface or as ice near the poles. Liquid water may occasionally burst forth (e.g., due to volcanic heating) and create erosion patterns, but such water would not last long.7 Without any long-standing water, Mars will remain devoid of life.8\nOur Solar System\nThe rest of the planets in our solar system are even more hostile to life. Closest to the Sun, Mercury can reach a scorching 427°C (800°F)—much too hot for liquid water. In the other direction, we have Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, all far too cold. Even if they do contain water, it would be as solid ice only.\nCuriously, the one other known place with liquid water in our solar system is not a planet at all, but Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons (see figure 2).9 Europa’s surface temperature is -162°C (-260°F), but tidal heating of its core (caused by Jupiter’s gravity) keeps a subsurface layer of water in a liquid state. Current estimates indicate Europa possesses a shell of ice about 10 miles thick with 50 miles of ocean beneath it.10 This data has inspired some people to speculate about the possibility of life on Europa, but, while there are significant arguments against this notion, no real evidence exists to support it.11\nFigure 2: Jupiter’s moon Europa\nImage credit: NASA/JPL/DLR\nFrom this analysis of our solar system we see the basis for a well-known principle—planets too close to their star will be too hot for life, while those too far away will be too cold. In our solar system, only Earth lies in the “Goldilocks” region between these two hostile extremes where liquid water can remain over much of the planet’s surface. Astronomers refer to this region as the “habitable zone” because planets outside it cannot maintain liquid water and, thus, cannot support life.12\nThe habitable zone’s location depends primarily on the star’s brightness (or star type). For example, the cooler and dimmer the star the closer the habitable zone will reside. A variety of other factors, such as the nature and the thickness of the planet’s atmosphere, also modify the habitable zone.\nHowever, because each star’s brightness varies over its lifetime (the Sun has brightened by 30 percent over the last 4.5 billion years) the habitable zone changes accordingly.13 For example, if the star brightens, the habitable zone will move farther out. To maintain liquid water and life, a planet must reside inside the habitable zone throughout its lifetime. The range of distances for which habitability remains feasible is called the continuously habitable zone (CHZ); consequently the CHZ is far narrower than the habitable zone in general.\nWhen the search for extrasolar planets (exoplanets) began, researchers expected to find many warm, watery Earth-like planets based on early models that suggested most planetary systems should be similar to our own.\nThe first positive detection of an exoplanet came in 1995; since then hundreds more have been found. Currently (these numbers increase frequently) there are 861 confirmed exoplanets in 677 planetary systems as well as 2,740 planet candidates. However, contrary to expectations, this sampling of exoplanets has failed to find any solar systems with a planet capable of hosting any life-forms. Many scientists are still optimistic that such planets will be found, but none have been found to date.14 For example, many possess Jupiter-like planets orbiting very close to their stars, a situation that would disrupt small rocky planets within the system.15 These data strongly underscore Earth’s uniqueness.\nRetaining Liquid Water\nWater retention is undesirable in people, but critical for a planet’s habitability. Typically, planets start with a quantity of water and may gain additional amounts from the influx of comets. This was certainly true of our neighbors Venus and Mars, yet today they are both dry and dead. So why has Earth maintained a copious supply of water?\nA planet’s temperature and surface gravity determine its ability to retain water and other gases for billions of years. Together these factors decide which molecules have enough energy to escape the planet’s gravity and dissipate into space. Because a planet’s mass is the main determinant for its surface gravity, smaller planets’ surface gravity is too low to retain water (e.g., Mars and perhaps Venus) while more massive planets retain too many gases (e.g., Jupiter and Saturn).\nEarth, on the other hand, demonstrates a remarkable degree of fine-tuning. Its surface gravity is high enough to preserve its water (molecular weight 18), yet low enough to allow methane (weight 16) and ammonia (weight 17) to dissipate into space. (Both of these greenhouse gases are toxic to life.) Earth’s mass and surface temperature must be just right, within a few percent, to retain our oceans and not suffocate life-forms with methane and ammonia.16\nBut Not Too Much Water\nSurprisingly, the well-known expression “the more, the merrier” may not always apply to the amount of water a planet holds. Even given how beneficial water is, too much would be detrimental to habitability. Dry land and shoreline areas are critical niches for life, while deep oceans are comparable to deserts (in terms of biodiversity). If Earth were a water world with all the continents submerged, its capacity to support diverse life would be severely limited.17 Advanced life like human beings would certainly have been impossible.\nAstronomers have discovered that such a fate was a real possibility for Earth. The solar nebula that gave birth to our solar system contained a lot of water that was incorporated into the formation of planets. If we assume Earth received the nebula’s average concentration, our planet would have had 1,000 times more water than it does now.18 Though much of that water was lost during Earth’s formation stage, it still would have retained far too much. However, the same Moon-forming collision that helped thin early Earth’s atmosphere also stripped away most of the excess water.19 That event had to be extremely fine-tuned to remove just enough water to allow for the formation of large continents while still allowing the planet to keep an abundance of the vital fluid.\nDespite water’s ubiquitous abundance throughout the galaxy, significant quantities of liquid water, retained for cosmically significant periods of time, are extremely unlikely. Specifically, the planet must:\n- Orbit its parent star at the right distance (i.e., be located within the CHZ);\n- Have the right atmosphere—not too thick or too thin;\n- Have gravity high enough to retain liquid water yet low enough to allow other light gases to escape the atmosphere; and\n- Maintain these conditions at relatively constant levels for at least several billion years.\nLiquid water’s rarity demonstrates that Earth is truly an extraordinary jewel. It also poses a serious dilemma for those searching for life on other planets since liquid water is essential to supporting life. (We hope to address the possibility of life existing without water in a future set of articles.) For Christians, however, water is just one more reason to praise the Creator who designed our habitat for our benefit.\nDr. John Millam\nDr. John Millam received his PhD in theoretical chemistry from Rice University in 1997, and currently serves as a programmer for Semichem in Kansas City.\nMr. Ken Klos received his MS in environmental studies from the University of Florida in 1971, and worked as an environmental/civil engineer for the state of Florida.\nDr. Iain D.

Ideally, this person knows the business, understands in general how the ERP system works, and can facilitate a project that will involve the project team for at least several months. If you don’t have someone in-house with those skills then bring in an outside consultant with experience selecting and implementing systems.\nDefine ERP Objectives\nDiscuss the objectives for the system with the project team. Properly implemented ERP systems should support your strategic plan and may include:\n- Hitting your sales and profit targets\n- Shipping product or delivering service to customers on time\n- Generating sufficient cash to grow your business\n- Provide the infrastructure necessary to grow your business and its value\n- Support compliance with external requirements like the need to trace serial numbers or lot numbers\n- Reduce the risks of upsetting customers by missed shipments or poor quality due to rushed production\n- Minimize the risk of ordering too much inventory\nThe project team should be charged with managing the project, while keeping top management up-to-date on its progress and apprised of any roadblocks they encounter.\nIn one of my ERP implementation projects, the president selected her team and appointed the CFO as the project manager. At the kickoff meeting she told the group that they had been selected because they represented the best from each part of the company and explained the objectives of the project along with how it fit with the company’s strategic plan. She asked to be kept informed of the progress of the project and of any roadblocks the team encountered and then left them to get started. It was one of the most complicated implementations I worked on and the team did one of the best jobs implementing the system that I have seen.\nDefine the Issues with the System\nNext, gather the issues that you and the users have with the current system and drill down to causes. For example, missing shipments to customers can be caused by stocking the wrong inventory items. This in turn can cause lower sales and lower profit margins thereby impacting cash levels. Inventory turns that are lower than the averages for your industry can indicate poor forecasting, inaccurate physical counts, inaccurate bills of material and so on. Identifying the issues and causes can help define the costs and focus the efforts on the most important areas.\nIdentify the Costs Caused by the Issues\nEach of the issues will have costs. It may be missed opportunities as with missed shipments. Or it may be reduced productivity resulting from the inefficiencies in how the staff is using the system. Whatever the issue, work to quantify the costs involved.\nAs soon as the project team has a clear idea of what the objectives and issues are, they should have a good foundation to continue on in the decision making process. The next post will cover which questions to ask as you consider investing in improving your current ERP system or looking for a new ERP solution.']	['<urn:uuid:fe906d3b-d0b5-49f3-8202-f36963ba8d18>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	7	53	583

From a circadian perspective, research examines clock-controlled genes in adipocytes and uses white adipose tissue-specific knockouts to understand how circadian regulation affects fat metabolism, with implications for diabetes. The distribution of adipose tissue is also critical for insulin resistance, with women having more subcutaneous adipose tissue (203 vs 128 cm2) and less visceral adipose tissue (63 vs 117 cm2) than men, affecting their respective waist circumference thresholds for predicting insulin resistance.	['Our long term goal is to describe in the language of genetics and biochemistry the feedback cycles and pathways that comprise intracellular circadian systems - how they work, how they are synchronized with the environment, and how time information generated by them is used to regulate the behavior of cells. This proposal focuses on the model system Neurospora, as well as on the mouse and mammalian cell lines, to understand the paradigms underlying circadian control of cell physiology and metabolism. We also continue a longstanding effort aimed at understanding circadian photoreception and photobiology in Neurospora and use this to break new ground on a salient fungal pathogen.\nIn Specific Aim 1, we will carry out a global analysis and description of the circadian output network in Neurospora, using RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and bioinformatics to describe the regulatory hierarchy governing circadian regulation of transcription in a cell. Then, using the exceptional background of biochemical genetics available in Neurospora, we will track the metabolic activities carried out by the proteins encoded by clock-controlled genes, and as foci of clock-controlled activities emerge, we will begin to lay the spectrum of clock-controlled processes on the Neurospora metabolic map to see how the clock regulates metabolism and physiology.\nIn Specific Aim 2, we will exploit recent atomic level structure analysis of the photoreceptive domain to determine the biological significance of photocycle kinetics. We will extend analysis of photobiology to the important fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus where we can envision a way to exploit our understanding of fungal photobiology to enable a new treatment for hundreds of thousands of patients with aspergillosis.\nIn Specific Aim 3, we will use RNA sequencing to determine the circadian profile of clock-controlled genes in adipocytes of wt and RIP140 knockout cells, and will use chromatin immunoprecipitation of RIP140 in adipocytes to begin to dissect the role of this co-activator/co-repressor in the circadian biology of this important cell type. We will look for physical association of RIP140 with known clock proteins and transcription factors involved with circadian output, and will generate white adipose tissue-specific knockouts of the clock to probe the significance of circadian regulation to fat metabolism in the mouse, hoping to gain insights into diabetes and metabolic syndrome. These projects are complementary and mutually enriching in that they each rely on genetic and molecular techniques to dissect, and ultimately to understand, the response of cells to their environment and the organization of eukaryotic cells as a function of time.\nBiological clocks work in all cells of the human body to regulate metabolism. By studying cells of mice and humans, as well as cells of a fungus, we can understand how clock control works, how its malfunction leads to diseases like diabetes and mental illness, while also suggesting a therapy for life-threatening fungal infections.\n|Dekhang, Rigzin; Wu, Cheng; Smith, Kristina M et al.

Curr Genet 61:275-88|\nShowing the most recent 10 out of 51 publications', 'Background To lower the risk of diabetes and heart disease in Africa, identification of African-centred thresholds for inexpensive biomarkers of insulin resistance (IR) is essential. The waist circumference (WC) thresholds that predicts IR in African men and women have not been established, but investigations recently conducted in Africa using indirect measures of IR suggest IR is predicted by WC of 80–95 cm in men and 90–99 cm in women. These WC cannot be used for guidelines until validated by direct measurements of IR and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Therefore, we determined in a group of African-born black people living in America (A) the WC, which predicts IR and (B) the influence of abdominal fat distribution on IR.\nMethods The 375 participants (age 38±10 years (mean±SD), 67% men) had IR determined by HOMA-IR and Matsuda index. VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were measured by abdominal CT scans. Optimal WC for the prediction of IR was determined in sex-specific analyses by area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) and Youden index.\nResults Women had more SAT (203±114 vs 128±74 cm2) and less VAT than men (63±48 vs 117±72 cm2, p<0.001). Optimal WC for prediction of IR in men and women were: 91 cm (AUC-ROC: 0.80±0.03 (mean±SE)) and 96 cm (AUC-ROC: 0.81±0.08), respectively. Regression analyses revealed a significant sex–VAT interaction (p<0.001). Therefore, for every unit increase in VAT, women had a 0.94 higher unit increase in SAT and 0.07 higher unit increase in WC than men.\nConclusion Working with a group of African-born black people living in America, we accessed technology, which validated observations made in Africa. Higher SAT at every level of VAT explained why the WC that predicted IR was higher in women (96 cm) than men (91 cm). For Africans to benefit from WC measurements, convening a panel of experts to develop evidence-based African-centred WC guidelines may be the way forward.\n- waist circumference\n- insulin resistance\n- visceral adiposity\nThis is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited, appropriate credit is given, any changes made indicated, and the use is non-commercial.

99	fastest lap jordan benetton drivers hungary 1991	Bertrand Gachot in the Jordan achieved the fastest lap at the 1991 Hungarian Grand Prix, while the Benetton team that year was driven by Nelson Piquet, who would later win the Canadian Grand Prix.	['Bonhams announced the Canadian 1991 Grand Prix winning Benetton B-191-02 Formula 1 car driven by Nelson Piquet and Michael Schumacher for the Spa sale.\nA 1991 Benetton B-191-02 Formula 1 car is likely to be one of the highlights of the Bonhams Spa Classic 2017 car sale in Belgium in May. This racing far was famously raced to victory by Nelson Piquet in the Canadian 1991 Grand Prix and also driven by Michael Schumacher during his debut year in Formula 1. The pre-sale estimate is €750,000-900,000 ($806,000-967,000).\nBonhams Spa Francorchamps Sale 2017\nBonhams will hold its Spa Classic sale on 21 May 2017 at the legendary Spa Francorchamps circuit in Belgium.\nEarly highlights announced for the Spa sale include a collection of 12 classic motorcars that has been unearthed in a Swiss Schloss and will be offered, all without reserve. This continue the recent fad of including “collections” at classic car auctions and “Swiss” never hurts when mentioned in the same phrase as classic car.\nNelson Piquet’s 1991 Benetton Formula 1 Racing Car\nThe 1991 Benetton B-191-02 Formula 1 (€750,000-900,000) driven by Nelson Piquet and Michael Schumacher during the 1991 Grand Prix season will be on offer at the Bonhams Spa 2017 classic car auction. The car was introduced for the third Grand Prix of the 1991 season, and made its debut at San Marino with Roberto Moreno at the wheel, before he was replaced as driver by three-time World Drivers’ Champion Nelson Piquet.\nNelson Piquet drove this Benetton to a famous victory in Montréal. The 1991 Canadian Grand Prix was, to say the very least, dramatic. Nigel Mansell led from the start in his Williams, whilst Berger, Prost, and Senna all retired with various mechanical problems. By the final lap, Mansell still led Piquet, Modena, de Cesaris and Gachot. Slowing down at the L’Epingle hairpin to give the crowd a premature celebratory wave, Mansell forgot to change down which resulted in stalling his Renault V10 engine, allowing Piquet to zoom past and snatch a surprise victory!\nThe car later finished 5th in the British GP and 8th in France before it was handed over to Schumacher for the last two races of the season, in Japan and Australia. The car was retired in both races.\nAfter the season closed, with the legendary Ayrton Senna clinching his third and final World Championship title, and Piquet sixth in the table, the car became a museum exhibit.\nPiquet and Schumacher at Spa 1991\nEarlier in the season,Nigel Piquet also drove the Benetton at the Spa 1991 Grand Prix race where the future seven-time Formula One World Champion Michael Schumacher made his F1 debut in a Jordan at the legendary Belgian track in 1991 to immense acclaim. It is testament to his skill as a driver that he was able to qualify seventh in the race, despite having had to learn the track on two wheels rather than four. Schumacher cycled the famously tricky circuit on a fold-up bike which he had brought with him after his team mate Andrea de Cesaris was caught up in contract negotiations and unable to show him the course in time for the race.\nFinishing just one place ahead of the young Schumacher was the Brazilian Nelson Piquet, racing the car on offer by Bonhams at the Spa 2017 sale.\n1991 Benetton B-191-02 Formula 1 Racing Car\nCapable of 650hp at 13,000 rpm, the 1991 Benetton B-191-02 was designed by John Barnard and Mike Coughlan. It is powered by a 3.5-litre Ford Cosworth HB V8 engine, has a moulded carbon-composite monocoque chassis and weighs in at just 505 kg.\nIn 2016, it underwent a complete rebuild by an F1 specialist team, including an overhaul of the engine, gearbox, chassis and safety equipment. It has been completely restored to its original condition, with the sole exception of updated security features in accordance with FIA regulations.\nPresented in excellent running order, this is an opportunity to own a genuine, ‘on the button’ Grand Prix winning car driven by two of the greatest drivers ever to have taken to the tarmac.\nBonhams previously announced a 1958 Mercedes Benz 300 SL Roadster and a 1921 Rolls-Royce 40/50hp Silver Ghost Double Phaëton as part of a Swiss “castle find” collection that will be on offer without reserve at the Spa 2017 sale.', 'A quarter of a century ago, one driver’s mistake opened the door for the beginning of a legend.Jaap Grolleman explains the story of Bertrand Gachot, Michael Schumacher and the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix.\nTwenty five years ago, the paths of two promising talents intertwined. The career of the one who seemed destined for greatness halted, while that of the unknown sparked and ignited into an even bigger greatness. It then seemed an unfortunate matter of circumstance, but connecting the dots in hindsight, the month of August 1991 was monumental in the era of modern Formula One.\nBertrand Gachot, a twenty-eight-year-old Belgian, finally got his Formula One act together in the summer of 1991, after two miserable seasons with Onyx and Colini. The Luxembourg-born Gachot was still considered a hot prospect after impressing in his two rookie seasons in British Formula Three and Formula 3000.\nIn his third Formula One season he drove the Jordan 191, designed by Gary Anderson, which was a beautiful and nimble machine. After the Irish team, fresh to the sport, solved its reliability issues, Andrea de Cesaris and Gachot started to reel in points regularly from the fifth race onwards. Gachot was almost in the top ten of the standings, and between the German and Hungarian Grand Prix he won the 24 Hours of Le Mans, together with Johnny Herbert and Volker Weidler.\nAt the Hungarian Grand Prix of the season – in a field that included Ayrton Senna, Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, and Nelson Piquet – the young Belgian raised more praise, as he snatched the fastest lap of the race.\nGachot in Hungary, 1991 – Copyright © The Cahier Archive\nGachot’s star seemed on the rise, but he had already ruined his chances the previous year, yet neither him or anybody else knew about it.\nIn December of 1990 on London’s Hyde Park Corner, a taxi driver by the name of Eric Court filtered through traffic, until he collided with an Alfa Romeo. Behind the wheel was Bertrand Gachot, with his girlfriend in the passenger seat. It was a minor accident, but a heated debate followed. Gachot grabbed his CS gas canister as a repellent, but when Court came closer, the canister was discharged on Court’s face. For Gachot it was a clear case of self defence and he didn’t think much of it. That was until the matter went to court in between the Hungarian and Belgian Grand Prix of 1991. The judge ruled harshly, and Gachot was sentenced to two years in prison.\nEddie Jordan, 1991 – Copyright © The Cahier Archive\nEddie Jordan, who was on a tight budget with his team, was suddenly without a driver for the #32 machine. Because Gachot’s verdict was smeared all over the press, the vacancy for the promising team was well known.\nIt was rumoured that Keke Rosberg was interested, and Stefan Johansson and Derek Warwick were considered. Yet all three wanted payment, so Jordan looked elsewhere. A young Brit named Damon Hill was also in the frame for the seat.\nIn an alternative storyline in that 1991 Le Mans Race, a Mercedes powered Sauber prototype car was driven to fifth place, with the team of Karl Wendlinger, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Michael Schumacher behind the wheel. Schumacher had achieved success in German Formula Three, but had taken the unconventional route towards Formula One via prototype racing, and thus the young German was relatively unknown.\nAs soon as Gachot’s verdict was delivered, Schumacher’s manager, Willi Weber, was on the phone with Eddie Jordan. Jordan was interested – especially when it appeared the Schumacher could bring money – but also voiced concerns. This was Spa after all; the longest and most challenging circuit of the calendar, and Schumacher had never driven a Formula One car. Jordan asked Weber whether Schumacher had ever driven any car at Spa, which Schumacher hadn’t. Weber didn’t lie exactly, but merely deflected the question: “He’s born and brought up only fifty miles away from the track, what do you think?”\nJochen Neerpasch, Mercedes’ motorsports manager, brought forward the £150,000 needed for Schumacher’s one-off drive, with help from sponsors Dekra and Tic Tac. Neerpasch was already planning to go to Formula One with Sauber, with Mercedes supplying the engine, and he desperately wanted a talented German to drive it.\nThe deal was done and Schumacher tested the 191 on the south variant of the Silverstone track. Within a few laps, Schumacher matched the pace of the regular drivers. The team brought him in, urging him to slow down to not have a crash. Schumacher replied he wasn’t pushing at all. When Schumacher was sent out again, Trevor Foster, the team manager, turned to commercial manager Ian Phillips and said, “Phone Eddie, and tell him we’ve found a star.”\nSchumacher in the Jordan 191 – Copyright © The Cahier Archive\nThe Belgian Grand Prix of 1991\nWhile Gachot was sent to the high-security Brixton prison, Schumacher arrived at Spa. Jordan’s lead driver Andrea de Cesaris would show the twenty-two year old around the track, to show the braking points, the racing lines, etc. But when it appeared the Italian wasn’t going to make time for, Schumacher borrowed a mountain bike and did two laps around the circuit to learn it himself.\nOn Friday, the Belgian Formula 3000 driver Pascal Witmeur, feeling the penalty was too harsh, started the ‘Free Gachot’ campaign. There were flags, posters and t-shirts, which many drivers, including Alain Prost, wore around the paddocks. On several places on the track, fans sprayed graffiti messages of support for Gachot on the circuit.\nSchumacher, 1991 – Copyright © The Cahier Archive\nThat was one tale of Friday. The other was about Schumacher, who had slept in a youth hostel because no accommodation was provided by Jordan. As soon as he was in the Jordan, the paddock was transfixed on the timing screens. Schumacher eclipsed De Cesaris and ended the day as the fastest Jordan driver, eight fastest overall. And in Saturday’s qualifying, Schumacher was over half a second faster than De Cesaris, with a neat seventh place.\nJordan’s Mark Gallagher stated: “Obviously, de Cesaris is no slouch, but for Michael to arrive at a driver’s circuit like Spa and do such a good job, that’s terrific.” De Cesaris was furious: “There must be something wrong with my car.” But there was nothing wrong with the car. Come Sunday, it was Schumacher’s car who failed, as the German retired after two corners with a broken clutch. By then, he had already passed Jean Alesi and Nelson Piquet.\nMichael Schumacher had arrived.\nTotal focus from Schumacher – Copyright © The Cahier Archive\nSchumacher only had a contract for one race, but landed a seat at Benetton for his stellar performance at Spa, ousting Roberto Moreno, who took the vacant Jordan seat. Schumacher took points in Italy, Portugal and Spain, ending the season in fourteenth place, one behind Gachot.\nSchumacher’s old team of Sauber, with Mercedes engines, reached Formula One in 1993, achieving respectable results. By then Schumacher was already a race winner and not seeking a midfield drive. Instead, nineteen years and seven titles later, and arguably well beyond his prime, Schumacher would finally drive for Mercedes, claiming a single podium in three seasons.\nBertrand Gachot was released from prison two months after the sentence, as another judge ruled the original sentence to be too harsh. But the damage to his career had been done. Gachot entered the final race of the season with Larrousse but failed to qualify. In 1992 he drove for Venturi, taking one more point scoring finish in Formula One, before racing for the start-up Pacific team in 1994 and 1995.\nGachot focussed on business and marketing after his Formula One career and is now the owner of Hype, an energy drink. Years later, Gachot eventually returned to Jordan; the team was then named Force India, and Gachot no longer a driver, but a sponsor.\nGachot once said of the weekend; “The whole situation was quite an experience as a human being. To find oneself in prison was mentally incredible and it made me stronger as a person. I told myself that once I would be out, I would enjoy every day of my life. As long as me and my family were free and in good health, I would complain about nothing. I learned a lot from it and tried to take the positives from a negative situation. Don’t get me wrong, I’d have preferred to have been at the Grand Prix! I bet that I’d be on pole for the race at Spa. But that’s how it was, and that’s how it is.”']	['<urn:uuid:78f59112-46e6-45b1-8bb7-820a63097d89>', '<urn:uuid:66a8d717-2f3e-4d7c-a060-d1c548bce6ac>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	7	34	2165
100	I'm building a wood shed - how far should timber be off the ground?	For proper air-drying of timber, there should be 15-30 cm space between the ground and the top surface of the bearers, with 30 cm being ideal. This allows for plenty of air movement under the stack.	"['Drying (Seasoning) Timber\nDrying wood is very much an art form, requiring skill, care and understanding to avoid the negative consequences of drying wood too fast or slow.\nKiln drying is usually preceded by air drying to bring the moisture content of the wood down below 30%. This allows for a more gentle kiln schedule to fully dry the timber.\nKiln drying is almost always essential for wood intended for interior uses. This is because it needs to be dried to a lower moisture content than wood will air dry to outdoors.\nMost wood strength properties are improved when wood is dried below the fibre saturation point\nSome softwoods can be kiln dried from green, while most hardwoods and some softwoods should be air dried to fibre saturation point before kiln drying to equilibrium moisture content\nLower density wood generally dries faster than wood with higher density.\nThicker boards should be dried slower.\nAir drying is a low cost and low energy method of drying timber. However conditions must allow the timber to dry slowly and evenly to avoid degrade. If dried to fast checking, collapse and deformation will result. The initial stages of drying are the most important to avoid degrade.\nFreshly sawn timber should not be left block-stacked, especially if the weather is warm. Fungal discolouration of the timber can occur very quickly, especially if sapwood is present. Only durable heartwood can be block stacked for any period of time.\nGreensawn timber should be protected from sun and wind prior to filleting.\nStacking and air-drying of timber requires care and attention to detail for good results. For removeable foundations a perfectly level base of bearers is prepared. There must be sufficient space between the ground and the top surface of the bearers to allow for plenty of air movement under the stack (15 cm may be adequate, 30 cm is ideal). Weeds should be removed. There should be good surface drainage and minimal ground moisture. The two end bearers can each be levelled and a string-line attached between them, from which the rest of the bearers between them are levelled. The ground must be firm/compacted so that it does not sink under the weight of the stack. Spacing between bearers should reflect the type of timber being stacked, but is usually 1 m. For hardwoods the spacing between fillets should be no more than 50cm, with bearers under every second line of fillets, while for softwoods spacing between fillets can be up to 1m between fillets (i.e. with a bearer under every line of fillets). When the timber is stacked the fillets must be lined up vertically\nNote bearer every second line of fillets for hardwood above each other from the bearer below. Before stacking timber a fillet is placed on every bearer.\n|Bases ready for filleting of timber. Once filleted, the base with timber is moved with the forklift and the next base is used. Note the fence which makes it easier for one person to place the boards accurately.|\nBases may be positioned on top of the bearers before stacking timber. These bases may be constructed much like ""extended"" pallets, to allow easy forklift handling of stack sections. This way a forklift can keep adding stack sections to the stack, and to a height that can be safely handled by the forklift. If a stack isn\'t separated into sections it will not be possible to handle the weight of the whole stack with a forklift.\nPrevailing wind may need to be taken into consideration when building the stack. If shelter cannot be provided the end of the stack (rather than the side) should face the prevailing wind.\nBuilding the stack\nFillets must align vertically, directly over each other\nThese fillets are not directly over each other! to hold the weight of the stack above them. Timber of a consistent length is easier to stack. Where timber shorts produce a space above a fillet, short sections of fillets of the same thickness as the timber being stacked can be used to fill the gap, thus keeping the stack level.\n|Forklift: Essential piece of equipment for an operation of any scale.|\nAttention needs to be paid to keeping the width of the stack consistent and without any lean. Outer boards should be placed first and lined up carefully.\nFreshly sawn ""green"" fillets should only be used if the stack is immediately covered, otherwise there is a risk of fillet-staining.\nFillet size contributes to the speed the timber will dry. Thicker fillets mean more air movement and faster drying. Hardwood is usually dried with 10-19 mm thick fillets, with 20-25 mm thick fillets used for softwood.\nTo aid handling the stack with a forklift, the stack can be divided up into sections. Each section is divided by pre-made bases or alternatively 100 x 50 fillets (""gluts"") to allow forks easy entry. Each section should not be heavier than the forklift can handle. Stacks should never lean, unstable stacks are dangerous\nTimber being air dried must be covered. If the stack is not covered rain wll penetrate into the stack and cause fillet stains and discolouration of sapwood leading to decay. Often sheets of corrugated iron are used but these must not leak. Drying sheds are expensive but effective. What must be prevented is water penetrating into the centre of the stack where air-movement is minimal and the timber will stay wet. Covers will need to be restrained to prevent uplift.\nCovering the stack also allows the timber to dry evenly. Timber nearer the top of the stack is more likely to dry too quickly and thus requires a higher level of protection from sun and wind. Covering the sides with hessian or shadecloth may help to slow the airflow. Building a group of stacks in close proximity also reduces airflow.\nWeighting the stacks helps reduce distortion in the top layers of timber. Weighting must hold down the timber evenly over the top surface of the stack. Waste slabwood can be used or special\nThis concrete weight can be easily moved with a forklift can be made.\nSeasonal weather differences should also be taken into account when drying timber. Drying can take place too fast in summer and too slow in winter. In summer heat can build up under the cover and dry the top layers of timber too fast causing warping, splitting and checking. It is advisable to weight the stack well and use a layer of buffer material such as slabwood on top of the stack and under the iron. The top two or three layers of boards should be lower quality seconds. Overhead shading is beneficial for summer drying, such as that provided under trees. Shadecloth can be used for the sides of the stack to slow airflow and drying. During winter drying of timber is slowed, but provided the stack is covered well so that rain does not penetrate and there is reasonable air-flow through the stack, the timber will not deteriorate.\nSome durable timbers can be left stacked in the weather and in fact can be ""conditioned"" this way in order to slow the drying process. In general, however, sun and rain are not conducive to drying of timber.\nDetermining moisture level\nTimber will continue to lose moisture until it reaches an equilibrium with the environment around it, at which point it neither gains nor loses moisture. This is called the equilibrium moisture content\nOnce the moisture is below 30% the timber can be kiln-dried. If air-dried to 20% MC the timber can be block-stacked indoors without risk of decay. Measuring moisture levels can be undertaken with a resistance meter which measures conductivity between two probes shoved into the wood. For accurate readings wood must be clean, with no decay. A general rule of thumb for air-drying is ""one year for every inch of thickness"".\nThe rate at which timber is dried in a kiln must be carefully controlled by air temperature, humidity and air flow. To avoid excessive evaporation from board surfaces the air in the kiln must be kept relatively humid.\nGenerally speaking, difficult species should be dried slowly because higher rates of drying will develop greater stresses in the timber which may cause cracking and distortion. Moderate temperatures and adequate humidity levels allow timber to dry more slowly. Higher temperatures and higher levels of moisture extracted mean faster drying but with a higher risk of degrade.\nOnce below 30% MC ( fibre saturation point\nIf the outer layer of wood (the case) dries more quickly than the inner wood (the core), issues encountered include:\n- Shrinkage of outer layers is restricted by the moist inner wood. As this outer wood shrinks it begins to crack. This is called surface checking.\n- Case hardening can occur. The surface of the board dries and shrinks which compresses the moist interior and does not allow the internal moisture to escape. Case-hardened boards when resawn will warp because the surface is in compression and the centre is in tension.\n- In the final stages of drying when the core shrinks and the case is being pulled inwards, this core stress can be sufficient to rupture the inside of the board. This is known as internal checking.\n- Individual cells become flattened, known as collapse or washboarding. This occurs above fibre saturation point. A drying temperature which is too high before reaching fibre saturation point aggrevates collapse. Surface and internal checks can be induced by differential shrinkages arising from collapse.\n|Charge of timber in dehumidifier kiln|\nTimber drying kilns are usually conventional, dehumidifier or solar.\nConventional kilns use heat exchangers, fans and vents. The heat exchanger may utilise wood as the primary heat source to run a boiler. Cool, lower-humidity air is introduced at one end of the kiln and warm humid air is expelled at the other end. Steam reconditioning of timber can take place in the same kiln. Humidity is raised by generating steam. Humidity is reduced by discharging humid inside air and introducing dry outside air through outlet and inlet vents usually in the roof. Conventional kilns operate at reasonable costs and are used for larger installations.\nDehumidification kilns utilise an integral heat pump which supplies heat and also serves to remove humidity. This amounts to an efficient utilisation of electrical energy. However auxiliary heat may also need to be provided. As the capital cost is relatively low, this type of kiln may be attractive for small installations. Dehumidification kilns operate at low temperatures and thus drying rates are slow, producing low levels of degrade. If drying temperatures are too low freezing of the condenser coils results. Mixed species can be dried at the same time. As the timber approaches a lower moisture content their efficiency is reduced considerably because of the low operating temperatures. Because of the long drying period, good insulation is required to prevent heat losses and operating costs can be high. Furthermore, this system does not provide a means for reconditioning of timber.\nSolar kilns are conventional kilns, but heat is provided via solar radiation instead of heat exchangers. Like air drying, the rate at which the timber dries is controlled by climatic conditions.\nMoisture content and schedules\nKiln drying allows for a final predetermined moisture content, usually the equilibrium moisture content\nWith conventional kilns, the rate of drying is carefully controlled with a schedule. The drying is regulated to dry the wood in the fastest possible time, but without resulting degrade. Solar kilns generally take longer to dry wood because the rate of drying is not optimised. However because timber is ""rested"" each night, this form of drying is gentle and can produce good results.\nThe rate of drying is influenced by different species, the way the timber is sawn (e.g. quartersawn or flatsawn) and different thicknesses. The effectiveness of a drying schedule is measured by the level of degrade. Procedures for specifying and verifying the moisture content and quality of seasoned solid timber are set out in AS/NZS 4787:2001 Timber - Assessment of Drying Quality. Drying quality is measured by the moisture content gradient; any presence of residual drying stress (case-hardening); surface, internal and end checks; collapse; distortions; and discolouration caused by drying.\nIt must be kept in mind that timber does not dry at a linear rate over time. More energy is needed to remove each additional unit of water as the moisture content falls.\nSteam reconditioning can be used to offset stresses caused by moisture gradients in drying. A high temperature, high humidity treatment period at the end of drying will relieve such stress (more>>).']"	['<urn:uuid:070d823d-c5d3-4dc0-af5d-e3bd20814efe>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:05:40.266071	14	36	2099
