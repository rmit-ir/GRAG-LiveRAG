1	I've been trying to understand the health effects of different sweeteners - how do artificial sugar substitutes compare to alcohol in terms of their impact on disease risk and oral health?	Artificial sugar substitutes and alcohol have contrasting health impacts. While sugar substitutes are generally safe for dental health and don't encourage bacterial growth (some like xylitol may even inhibit bacterial growth), alcohol poses significant health risks. Any amount of alcohol increases cancer risk, with even light drinking (less than 1 drink/day) being linked to various cancers including mouth, pharynx, and breast cancer. Alcohol is metabolized into the carcinogenic compound acetaldehyde and contains additional carcinogenic substances like arsenic and benzene.	"['VALLEY — We hear constantly that moderate consumption of alcohol, especially red wine, is beneficial for cardiovascular health. However, when it comes to cancer risk, any amount of alcohol is risky. A 2014 report by the International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that there is no safe amount of alcohol when it comes to cancer risk. Alcohol is now considered a cause of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, colorectum, breast, and liver, and is linked to other cancers too.\nSome of red wine’s benefit is thought to be due to resveratrol, a phytochemical in grape skins that has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that may help protect against cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the majority of the reduction in CVD risk is actually from the inhibition of blood clotting by the alcohol. At this point in time it is unknown whether resveratrol provides additional benefits over the anti-coagulation effects. Plus grapes, raisins, blueberries, cranberries, and peanuts also contain resveratrol – red wine is not the exclusive source of this phytochemical. You will get much more health benefit from a cardio-protective diet of phytochemical-rich plant foods than you will from an occasional glass of red wine.\nRegardless of whether resveratrol provides cardiovascular benefit, it is incorrect to think you are doing something good for your health when you drink red wine. Even light drinking increases the risk of several different types of cancer.\nAfter alcohol is ingested, the body metabolizes it into a carcinogenic compound called acetaldehyde.\nThe evidence suggests that even light drinking (less than 1 drink/day) or using alcohol-containing mouthwashes may be risky. Additional carcinogenic substances are present in alcoholic beverages, such as arsenic, benzene, cadmium, formaldehyde, lead, ethyl carbamate, acrylamide, and aflatoxins.\nThis is especially important for women to know, because there are gender differences in alcohol metabolism. The same amount of alcohol causes a greater blood alcohol level to be reached in females compared to males of the same weight. Alcohol consumption may also increase estrogen levels, which could further increase the breast cancer risk associated with alcohol consumption.\nLess than one drink a day increases breast cancer, and more drinking amplifies the risk. Women in the range of 3-6 alcoholic drinks weekly were found to have a 15 percent increase in breast cancer risk compared to non-drinkers, and 3-4 drinks per week is also associated with higher rates of breast cancer recurrence after diagnosis. Increased cancer risk due to light alcohol intake is not limited to breast cancer.\nA meta-analysis of studies on the relationship between light drinking and cancer risk estimated that light alcohol drinking is responsible for 5,000 deaths from oral and pharynx cancers, 24,000 deaths from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and 5,000 deaths from breast cancer worldwide each year. Importantly, the researchers found that this risk was dose-dependent: meaning the more you drink, the greater the risk. For health and longevity, the safest choice is to not drink any alcohol.\nDr. Fuhrman is a #1 New York Times best-selling author and a board certified family physician specializing in lifestyle and nutritional medicine.

It’s believed we universally crave sugar because of the quick energy boost after eating it, or that it also causes a release in our brains of serotonin endorphins, chemicals which relax us and make us feel good.\nBut there is a downside to refined sugars like table sugar or high-fructose corn syrup: too much in our diets contributes to conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and dental disease. On the latter, sugar is a primary food source for oral bacteria; the more sugar available in the mouth the higher the levels of bacteria that lead to tooth decay and gum disease.\nModerating your intake of refined sugars and other carbohydrates can be hard to do, given that many processed foods contain various forms of refined sugar. A diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables helps control sugar intake as well as contribute to overall health. Many people also turn to a variety of sugar substitutes: one study found roughly 85% of Americans use some form of it in place of sugar. They’re also being added to many processed foods: unless you’re checking ingredients labels, you may be consuming them unknowingly.\nSugar substitutes are generally either artificial, manufactured products like saccharin or aspartame or extractions from natural substances like stevia or sorbitol. The good news concerning your teeth and gums is that all the major sugar substitutes don’t encourage bacterial growth. Still, while they’re generally safe for consumption, each has varying properties and may have side-effects for certain people. For example, people with phenylketonuria, a rare genetic condition, can’t process aspartame properly and should avoid it.\nOne alcohol-based sweetener in particular is of interest in oral care. A number of studies indicate xylitol may actually inhibit bacterial growth and thus reduce the risk of tooth decay. You can find xylitol in a variety of gum and mint products.\nWhen considering what sugar substitutes to use, be sure you’re up to date on their potential health effects for certain individuals, as well as check the ingredients labels of processed foods for added sweeteners. As your dentist, we’ll also be glad to advise you on strategies to reduce sugar in your diet and promote better dental health.\nIf you would like more information on your best options for sweeteners, please contact us or schedule an appointment for a consultation. You can also learn more about this topic by reading the Dear Doctor magazine article “Artificial Sweeteners.”\nYour teeth’s hard, enamel coating protects them from environmental dangers or disease. But although it’s made of the hardest substance in the human body, enamel isn’t invincible — prolonged exposure to acid can cause dental erosion, a condition in which the enamel’s mineral content permanently dissolves, a process known as de-mineralization.\nDe-mineralization occurs anytime our mouth environment becomes too acidic due to eating or drinking items with high acid content. Saliva normally neutralizes mouth acid in thirty minutes to an hour after we eat, as well as restores mineral content to the enamel (re-mineralization). Danger arises, though, if the saliva’s buffering action is overwhelmed by chronic acidity, caused mainly by constant snacking or sipping on acidic foods and beverages throughout the day — in this situation, saliva can’t complete the process of buffering and re-mineralization.\nAs a result, the enamel may permanently lose its mineral content and strength over time. This permanent dental erosion leads to serious consequences: the teeth become more susceptible to decay; the dentin becomes exposed, which causes pain and sensitivity to pressure and temperature changes; and changes in the teeth’s size and color can negatively alter your appearance.\nIt’s important to take action then before dental erosion occurs. Along with daily oral hygiene, restrict your consumption of acidic foods and beverages to meal times and cut back on between-meal snacks. Rather than a sports drink after exercising, drink nature’s hydrator — water. You should also alter your brushing habits slightly — rather than brush right after you eat, wait thirty minutes to an hour. This gives saliva time to restore the mouth to its normal pH and re-mineralize the enamel. Brushing right after can remove even more of the minerals in softened enamel.\nIf significant erosion has occurred, there are a number of treatment options we can undertake to preserve remaining tooth structure and enhance your appearance. In moderate cases, we can reshape and cover damaged teeth using dental materials like composite resins or porcelain to fill decayed areas or cover teeth with veneers or crowns.\nThe key of course, is to identify dental erosion through clinical examination as soon as possible to minimize damage. Your enamel plays a critical role in protecting your teeth from disease — so take the right steps to protect your enamel.\nIf you would like more information on protecting your enamel, please contact us or schedule an appointment for a consultation. You can also learn more about this topic by reading the Dear Doctor magazine article “Dental Erosion.”\nGood nutrition is vital for maintaining health and preventing disease, especially for your mouth. A diet rich in whole foods — fresh fruits and vegetables, protein and dairy products — and low in sugar will not only promote strong teeth and gums, but lessen your chances of developing tooth decay or periodontal (gum) disease.\nDiet is also a prominent factor in reducing the risk for another serious mouth disease — oral cancer. While oral cancer makes up only 3% of total cancer cases reported annually, the five-year survival rate is a sobering 50%, much lower than for other types of common cancers. While genetics plays a role in your susceptibility to oral cancer, lifestyle choices and practices present the greater risk factors for the disease.\nOf these lifestyle factors, refraining from tobacco products, moderating your alcohol consumption and avoiding risky sexual behavior are of primary importance in reducing your cancer risk. With that said, you should also take into account the foods that are part of your daily diet — both what you should and shouldn’t eat. As an example of the latter, some foods contain a class of chemicals known as nitrosamines that are carcinogenic (cancer-causing). One such chemical, nitrite, is used as a preservative in meats like bacon or ham, and may also be found in beer, and seafood products.\nOn the positive side, your diet should be rich in foods that supply antioxidants, substances that protect the body’s cells from damaging, unstable molecules known as free radicals. The best sources for antioxidants (more so than dietary supplements) are plant foods rich in fiber and vitamins C and E. Eating more of these may also reduce your intake of nitrates, animal fat and saturated fat.\nAdopting a moderate, nutritious diet, along with exercise, can have a huge positive impact on your general health and quality of life. Along with other lifestyle changes, better dietary choices can also help ensure a healthy mouth and reduce your risk of oral cancer.\nIf you would like more information on the role of nutrition in reducing your risk of oral cancer, please contact us or schedule an appointment for a consultation. You can also learn more about this topic by reading the Dear Doctor magazine article “Diet and Prevention of Oral Cancer.”\nEating is one of the pleasures — and necessities — of life, but people who suffer from temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) may find eating no pleasure at all — and they may not be eating the right nutritional balance of foods.\nTMD is a collection of conditions that affect the jaw joints, connecting muscles and other related facial structures. If you've been diagnosed with TMD, you're probably not only acquainted with severe pain, but also difficulty opening your jaw as widely as normal. This can make it difficult to chew certain foods.\nThere are a number of effective treatments for TMD, including thermal therapy (hot or cold packs), joint exercise, medication or surgery (as a last resort). But these treatments often take time to make a noticeable difference. In the meantime, you may still need to change what and how you eat to ensure you're getting the nutrients your body needs.\nThe overall strategy should be to soften and reduce the chewing size of your food. With fruits and vegetables, you'll want to peel and discard any hard or chewy skins, and then chop the fruit flesh into smaller pieces. Steam or cook vegetables like greens, broccoli or cauliflower until they're soft and then chop them into smaller portions. You might also consider pureeing your fruit (and some vegetables) to make smoothies with ice, milk or yogurt, or vegetable-based soups.\nTreat meat, poultry or seafood in much the same way, especially biting sizes. Besides cooking meats to tenderness, include moisteners like broths, gravies or brazing liquids to further make them easier to chew.\nDairy foods are an important source of nutrition: eat milk-based products like yogurt or cheese as much as you can handle. If you have problems with these or also nut butters, then consider meal replacement beverages like instant breakfast or whey protein beverages.\nAnd don't forget whole grains. Although some can be hard to chew, you can prepare them in hot cereal form (like oatmeal) to tenderize them. You can also prepare thin bread toast and cut into smaller pieces.\nHopefully, your treatment will bring your TMD symptoms under manageable control. Until then (and after, if need be) adjust your diet to eat the foods that keep you healthy.\nMarch is national nutrition month—a good time to look at the connection between diet and oral health. You probably know that sugar is a major culprit in dental problems. This is because bacteria feed on sugars and create acid that can lead to tooth decay and gum disease. Avoiding sugary foods and drinks as much as possible is a good rule of thumb, but there are some food choices that actually benefit your oral health. Here are nutrition tips that will help keep your smile healthy for life:\nSay cheese. Dairy products such as milk, cheese and yogurt contain calcium and phosphorus to build teeth and strengthen the supporting bone. And cheese neutralizes acid in the mouth to help fight cavities and gum disease.\nChoose lean proteins. Lean meats, poultry, fish, milk and eggs help strengthen teeth. They are rich in protein and phosphorous, which is essential for building strong bones and teeth.\nEat a rainbow. Fruits and vegetables provide many key nutrients, including vitamins necessary for healing, bone strength, and healthy gums. Besides being nutritious, fruits and veggies scrub your teeth while you chew and stimulate the production of saliva, which is necessary for neutralizing acid and rebuilding enamel.\nNibble on nuts. Nuts contain protein, fiber and healthy fats. They also contain essential vitamins and minerals to keep teeth strong and gums healthy. Further, chewing nuts stimulates saliva production, lowering the risk of tooth decay.\nGo for the grains. Studies have shown that eating too many refined carbohydrates such as white bread and sweet bakery items can lead to chronic inflammation, which is a factor in gum disease, heart disease, stroke and other conditions. In contrast, eating complex carbohydrates such as whole grains may reduce inflammation in the body.\nWhat you put in your body can play a big role in preventing tooth decay and gum disease, so choose foods that provide the right building blocks for optimal dental and overall health.""]"	['<urn:uuid:fe686df3-5f96-4932-ad43-f56bddbb0ade>', '<urn:uuid:8a0aa93f-90db-4fdc-b730-296c22f85e2f>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	31	79	2479
2	Why are shock absorbers placed at an angle in C-10 trucks?	The angled placement of shock absorbers is a design tradeoff to help tune the weight distribution. This setup allows for a smooth ride while combating wheel hop. The length of the shock also provides a wider range of compression and rebound characteristics, making a mid-level performance shock work like a more expensive adjustable shock.	['How to Achieve Proper Geometry on Your C-10 Rear Suspension\nThe rear trailing arm suspension is definitely one of the best features of mid-year C-10 trucks manufactured from 1963-72. Similar setups are still in use today on many larger model automobiles by many manufacturers; it’s also the go-to choice for NASCAR. Trailing arm suspension has proved to be a wonderful platform for cars and trucks. Known for its excellent stability when cornering while offering a smooth ride, GMs choice to use the system was clear during the company’s heyday.\nAs time went on, though, the cost of raw materials began to climb, and the trailing arm suspension met its demise once it became too expensive to produce. With the new ’73 model makeover, the decision was made to revert to the profitable leaf spring rear setup. Now, just like every engineered item in this world, there is always room for improvements or refinements. As engineers like to say, the trailing arm suspension that General Motors produced was good, but it wasn’t great.\nBy far the biggest mistake GM engineers made in the ‘60s was the shock placement on the trailing arm suspension. But who knew that these trucks were going to be pushed to the limits of performance driving. No Limit found the cure by relocating the shocks outboard rather than inboard of the frame. Your C-10 will become more stable in the turns, and by moving the shocks behind the axle, they complement the ride quality because they can control wheel hop. After we got our hands on No Limit’s kit, we took off the old shocks and the lower mounts by removing the U-bolt nuts.\nStop and think about it for a second. What makes a trailing arm suspension work so well is simple geometry: A triangle formation of arms or link bars is used to gain stability, where the front of the main link bars mount at a front cross member relatively close together then spread out towards the rear at a wide angle directed at each of the tires on both sides. A rear link, or panhard bar, is used behind the axle to help control lateral movement while still offering a good range of vertical motion.\nOn the passenger side of the axle, the lower shock mount shares duty with the panhard bar bracket that we coined the shark fin for obvious reasons. The shark fin and the panhard mounting plate are slid in place through the U-bolt on top of the trailing arm before the arm and the lower shock bracket/axle pad are installed and snugged down.\nWhat complements this triangle of links is where a set of coil springs supports the weight of the frame. Placement of the springs is key to having a steadfast system with inertia control. Mounting the spring to the lower arms, just outside of the frame, allows for a sturdy and secure base no matter the coil springs’ weight rating. This gives the vehicle’s occupants a better ride, provides the driver with cornering confidence, plus it adds more traction, as well.\nA set of shock studs is bolted to the lower shock bracket to create a space for the shock’s mounting eye to rest. Then the upper shock mount is bolted to the frame. If this setup looks familiar, you have a great memory, because this kit can be purchased for a stock frame application. No Limit recommends this system for use with its new back half long to short conversion.\nNo Limit’s panhard kit is a clean and simple way to attain proper geometry, allowing for a tighter more stable feeling while maintaining control under heavy cornering. The frame mount is bolted in place through the fame on the outside and underside of the driver’s frame rail, whereas the fixed end of the thick gauge mild steel tube is fixed to the bracket located on the axle plate.\nThese were all the great things that GM campaigned about the Chevy trucks throughout the ‘60s: 1963-72 Chevy trucks came equipped with trailing arm rear suspension, while the GMC brand had leaf springs. What the designers of those trucks never dreamed was that 45 years later people would view these trucks as performance vehicles, not workhorses. So why were they so bad, and what can the modern enthusiast do to cure the plague of problems that exists with the Chevy trailing arms? In search of answers, we looked into the way that No Limit Engineering outfits its new long-bed to short-bed conversion frame kit that we featured in our October issue (“Some Assembly Required,” Oct. 2012, pg. 30). Let’s take a look at the changes and how the kit is installed.\nThe adjustable end of the bar attaches to the frame bracket underneath the rail where you have a few choices on mounting points. We chose the center, or neutral, setting which is perfect for all around driving. Why is this bar so special compared to the factory? The answer is in the frame mounts’ placement. A longer bar reduces body roll and creates more traction.\nTo round out the install, the shocks are installed by sliding shock’s eyes over the bottom bracket first. Repeat with the supplied bolt and nut on the top. Here’s another example where this kit works so much better than the stock setup: Moving the shocks outboard reduces body roll, and placing them behind the axle enhances ride quality. Some of you reading this may be wondering why the shock is set at an angle, or why it’s so long. It’s a tradeoff to help tune the weight distribution, allowing for a smooth ride while combating wheel hop. The length of the shock also allows from a wider range of compression and rebound characteristics making a mid-level performance shock work like a much more expensive adjustable shock.\nNo Limit Engineering\n455 South D St.\nSan Bernardino CA 92401\nText and Photos by Marcel Venable']	['<urn:uuid:cd869578-e86d-4622-8e46-72bb376d2108>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	11	54	990
3	Being a digital content creator, I often see images online - what's the proper way to identify if an image is copyrighted versus Creative Commons licensed, and what are the consequences of misusing protected images?	To identify if an image is copyrighted, you should look for image credits, contact details, watermarks, check the image's metadata, and do a Google reverse image search. If you use a copyrighted image without permission, you could be liable to pay damages to the copyright owner. However, with Creative Commons licensed images, you can use them as long as you follow the license conditions, but if you violate these conditions, the license automatically terminates and you may be liable for copyright infringement.	"['How to Protect Your Artistic Works With a Creative Commons License\nHow Do You Deal With Infringement?\nA Creative Commons license terminates automatically when its conditions are violated. So, “if a user of a work distributed under a Creative Commons license fails to attribute the creator as required, then the user no longer has the right to continue using the work and may be liable for copyright infringement,” the group explains.\nContent owners, meanwhile, can choose from a variety of approaches to remedy the situation, ranging from a simple request to legal action.\nWhich route to take will depend on the specifics of the chosen license and the type of infringement, but in general, “when you find someone that\'s misusing your material, the most important thing is to start a dialogue,” Duff advises.\nDon\'t get angry or emotional in demanding the immediate enforcement of your rights, he recommends.\n“It can be really hard not to take [violations] personally,"" Duff explains, ""especially when you\'re a small-business owner and this is something you\'ve worked really hard on.”\nMore often than not, however, the infringing party isn\'t aware of what they\'ve done. If you\'re polite, they\'re more likely to respect your rights, so keep your temper in check and make contact, Duff advises.\nThe Benefits of Using a Creative Commons License\nNumerous high-profile authors (including futurist Cory Doctorow), artists, musicians (such as the rock band Nine Inch Nails), and even government agencies and entities (including the White House) use Creative Commons licenses. You\'ll find many more case studies on the Creative Commons site.\nUK-based landscape photographer Steve Gill believes in making art freely available for personal use, and he uses Creative Commons licensing because he believes it supports that philosophy.\n“Most people are honest and are not in the habit of illegally downloading images,” Gill told me. “If they do, they probably just want it for their desktop or personal blog anyway. So long as they are not going to profit by using my image, then I have no problem in them using it.”\nGill hasn\'t seen evidence of any drawbacks associated with using Creative Commons licensing, he says, but he has identified many benefits.\n""The attribution which is required for sharing the image provides a free direct link back to my main image store; the more links back, the wider the audience,” he explains.\nGill sees little value in using watermarks to deter theft. ""If someone is going to steal your images, they will steal it with or without a watermark. Additionally, placing a watermark across the middle of the image will, quite frankly, detract from the image anyway. Who wants to view an image with a watermark across the middle? Placing a small watermark across one of the sides of the image merely allows the unscrupulous to do a simple crop, and the image is theirs,"" Gill says. ""Showing that I am happy for people to download my images gives them more download appeal! By providing a free copy for these purposes, it spreads my art further, which is what most artists want anyway.""\nYou\'ll find additional details of how Gill uses Creative Commons licensing on his website.\nTraditional copyright law worked well for artists who succeeded in gaining the attention of major commercial publishers and distributors. But all too often, the artists paid a steep price for that success, losing control of their destiny.\nThe democratic power of the Internet has stolen the keys from the gatekeepers. These days you can put your own work in front of a worldwide audience, with ease. Using a Creative Commons license will not only protect your work, but also help disseminate it. That alone is no guarantee of financial success, but it does knock down one of the barriers.', 'What is an example of copyright violation?\nA typical example of copyright infringement is the use of music in your videos. But it is a copyright violation to download a movie, TV show, music, software or e-book from a website that is not owned by the creator. Usually, these non-authorized sites also automatically prompt you to share the same material to others.\nAre photos on Google copyrighted?\nYou cannot download or use images from Google without seeking permission from the copyright holder, unless your use falls within one of the exceptions or the work is distributed under an open licence such as Creative Commons. Google Image also offers a tool to filter your search results by usage rights.\nHow do you tell if a photo is copyrighted?\nFive ways to verify an image and identify the copyright ownerLook for an image credit or contact details. If you find an image online, look carefully for a caption that includes the name of the image creator or copyright owner. Look for a watermark. Check the image’s metadata. Do a Google reverse image search. If in doubt, don’t use it.\nHow do I download an image without copyright?\nFollow these simple steps to find royalty free images using the Google Images advanced search.Enter a search term in Google Images search.Click the Gear icon, then select Advanced search.Scroll down and use the usage rights drop down menu to select free to use or share, even commercially.\nHow do you get around a copyrighted photo?\nThe only way to avoid copyright infringement is to create original work or by getting permission to use it. Ultimately the only way to know that you have changed enough of the copyrighted image is to get sued. Once in court, the judge will decide if there was enough change between the original work and yours.\nWhat happens if I use a copyrighted image?\nIf you want to use an image that’s copyright protected, first get a license or permission to use it from the creator. If you commit copyright infringement, you could be liable to pay damages to the copyright owner.\nDo and don’ts of copyright laws?\nDon’t use substantial portions or excerpts that can be considered the “heart” of someone else’s work. Don’t assume any use is fair use just because you’re teaching in a classroom. Don’t repeatedly use other’s copyrighted materials without permission.\nIs it illegal to draw a copyrighted photo?\nYes it is. Any method of making a copy, including freehand drawing, is still making na copy, and is still copyright infringement unless you have permission from the copyright owner, or the source is out-of-copyright (in the public domain).\nIs it legal to sell a painting of a photo?\nThe only person who can give permission for the creation of a derivative work is the owner of the copyright. That’s fine; because you own the copyright on your image. But you would also have copyright over the painting or illustration as it is a “new” work.\nCan I draw a picture of a celebrity and sell it?\nPainting celebrities’ images is not copyright infringement, unless you are copying another painting or photograph of them. However, it can be an infringement of their likeness/personality rights should you sell or publicly display the paintings, at least in many places in the United States.\nCan I draw a picture of Batman and sell it?\nBatman is copyrighted, which means that only the author/rights holder (in this case, DC Comics), has the right to copy, display, distribute, and create derivative works. Fan art can be considered a derivative work, therefore most fan art is an infringement of DC’s copyright.\nCan I draw Disney characters and sell them?\nYou cannot sell your drawings of Disney characters because, by doing so, you would be infringing on The Walt Disney Company’s copyrights and trademarks. These characters are their intellectual property. If you want to sell your Disney artwork, you have to secure a license from them.\nIs it OK to draw from photos?\nFor many subjects, only a photo reference will do. There are many subjects that we just cannot draw or paint from life – a photo is our only choice. If you are of the opinion that photo references should not be used to create a drawing, then you are severely limiting what you can create.']"	['<urn:uuid:c96aa304-7a12-4f49-b1d4-e23672e2d14c>', '<urn:uuid:6488f86a-1c6b-4adb-acb3-2da9f3ed87a3>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	35	82	1351
4	I'm interested in farming sustainability. Between dairy farms and olive orchards, which one needs more cooperation with other organisms or bacteria to be successful?	Olive orchards demonstrate more documented bacterial cooperation. Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi populations form proven mutualistic consortia with non-pathogenic bacteria Erwinia toletana and Pantoea agglomerans, which increases bacterial populations and affects disease symptoms. In dairy farming systems, while there is emphasis on environmental sustainability and nutrient utilization efficiency, the documents don't mention specific beneficial bacterial or organismal cooperation being necessary for success.	['Project Number: 8070-21000-008-00-D\nProject Type: In-House Appropriated\nStart Date: Dec 17, 2012\nEnd Date: Dec 16, 2017\n1: Identify, through experimentation and plant growth and habitat modeling, pasture-based dairy and livestock production systems and management practices that improve food security by enhancing productivity, improving long-term environmental sustainability, and increasing flexibility to adapt to changing environmental and climatic conditions. We will initially delineate current land-use practices for grazing lands in the eastern US and investigate how land use might change in the future (sub-objective 1.A). Primary land use practices to be considered are pasture-based animal agriculture and bioenergy feedstock production systems. Sub-objective 1B will characterize potential changes in forage species distribution and dairy cow grazing behavior in response to climate change (adaptation), and evaluate plant and animal management strategies to mitigate climate change. Sub-objective 1.C will identify conservation practices and animal management strategies that improve nutrient utilization efficiency and reduce sediment and nutrients movement off-farm. 2: Develop best management practices and identify management systems that improve productivity and environmental sustainability of bioenergy production as part of multifunctional agricultural systems. Objective 2 focuses on bioenergy cropping systems and will identify management systems that increase soil C sequestration and reduce N loss and net GHG emissions (sub-objective 2.A) and evaluate the effects of miscanthus production at the commercial scale on C sequestration and GHG intensity (sub-objective 2.B). Sub-objective 2B will also include a life-cycle inventory assessment to profile the energy and GHG emissions associated with miscanthus production. Objective 3. Improve dairy industry production capacity and environmental sustainability to meet the demands of existing and emerging markets, and improve dairy industry resilience to abiotic and biotic stressors while maintaining producer economic viability. Using a comprehensive, systems approach along with existing/new databases and models to identify opportunities and support Livestock GRACEnet, LTAR and Climate Hub efforts to improve the environmental performance of dairy systems across the Northeast, Midwest, and West. The following research focus areas will be prioritized: a) Improve nutrient use efficiency across dairy production, emphasizing the conservation of nitrogen and phosphorus in local and regional crop production and reduction of off-farm nitrogen and phosphorus losses, especially through novel/greater use of forage crops and innovative practices. b) Improve carbon sequestration and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from dairy cattle, production facilities and land application of manure. c) Improve the understanding of pathogen transport and control through water and/or bioaerosol pathways.\nThis research will provide the necessary information for developing decision-support tools that bring together diverse forage production systems, innovative animal management strategies and novel biofuel production practices to build multifunctional farms and landscapes. The purpose is to provide guidance on optimizing the placement and management of pasture and bioenergy crops in ways that are appropriate to the landscape context and that will increase productivity and enhance ecosystem services of farming enterprises. We will initially delineate current land-use practices for grazing lands in the eastern US and investigate the production and environmental consequences of potential future management changes. Primary land-use practices to be considered are pasture-based animal agriculture and bioenergy feedstock production systems. We will provide information on plant and animal adaptation to climate change and on the effectiveness of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation strategies for grazing animals, pasturelands, and biofuel feedstock production systems.

[++]\nPseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi is the causal agent of olive (Olea europaea) knot disease and an unorthodox member of the P. syringae complex, causing aerial tumours instead of the foliar necroses and cankers characteristic of most members of this complex. Olive knot is present wherever olive is grown; although losses are difficult to assess, it is assumed that olive knot is one of the most important diseases of the olive crop. The last century has witnessed a good deal of scientific articles describing the biology, epidemiology and control of this pathogen. However, most P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi strains are highly recalcitrant to genetic manipulation, which has effectively left the pathogen out of the scientific progress in molecular biology that has elevated the foliar pathogens of the P. syringae complex to supermodels. A series of studies in the last years have made significant advances in the biology, ecology and genetics of P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi, paving the way for the molecular dissection of its interaction with other non-pathogenic bacteria and their woody hosts. The selection of a genetically pliable model strain was soon followed by the development of rapid methods for virulence assessment with micropropagated olive plants and the analysis of cellular interactions with the plant host. The generation of a draft genome of strain NCPPB 3335 and the closed sequence of its three native plasmids has allowed for functional and comparative genomic analyses for the identification of its pathogenicity gene complement. This includes 34 putative type III effector genes and genomic regions, shared with other pathogens of woody hosts, that encode metabolic pathways associated with the degradation of lignin-derived compounds. Now, the time is right to explore the molecular basis of the P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi-olive interaction and to get insights into why some pathovars like it necrotic and why some like it knot. Synonyms: Pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi Taxonomy: Kingdom Bacteria; Phylum Proteobacteria; Class Gammaproteobacteria; Family Pseudomonadaceae; Genus Pseudomonas; included in genomospecies 2 together with at least P. amygdali, P. ficuserectae, P. meliae and 16 other pathovars from the P. syringae complex (aesculi, ciccaronei, dendropanacis, eriobotryae, glycinea, hibisci, mellea, mori, myricae, phaseolicola, photiniae, sesami, tabaci, ulmi, and certain strains of lachrymans and morsprunorum); when a formal proposal is made for the unification of these bacteria, the species name P. amygdali would take priority over P. savastanoi. Microbiological properties: Gram-negative rods, 0.4-0.8 by 1.0-3.0 µm, aerobic. Motile by one to four polar flagella, rather slow growing, optimal temperatures for growth of 25–30 °C, oxidase negative, arginine dihydrolase negative, elicits the hypersensitive response on tobacco, most isolates are fluorescent and levan negative although some isolates are non-fluorescent and levan positive. Host range: P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi causes tumours in cultivated and wild olive and ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Although strains from olive were reported to infect oleander (Nerium oleander), this is generally not the case; however, strains of P. savastanoi pv. nerii can infect olive. Pathovars fraxini and nerii differentiate from pv. savastanoi mostly in their host range, and were not formally recognized until 1996. Literature previous to about 1996 generally name strains of the three pathovars as P. syringae subsp. savastanoi or P. savastanoi subsp. savastanoi, contributing to confusion about host range and biological properties. Disease symptoms: Symptoms of infected trees include hyperplastic growths (tumorous galls or knots) on the stems and branches of the host plant and, occasionally, on leaves and fruits. Epidemiology: The pathogen can survive and multiply on aerial plant surfaces, as well as in knots, from where it can be dispersed by rain, wind, insects and human activities, entering the plant through wounds. Populations are very unevenly distributed in the plant, and suffer drastic fluctuations throughout the year, with maximum numbers of bacteria occurring during rainy and warm months. Populations of P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi are normally associated to non-pathogenic bacteria, both epiphytically and endophytically, and were demonstrated to form mutualistic consortia with Erwinia toletana and Pantoea agglomerans that could result in increased bacterial populations and disease symptoms. Disease control: Based on preventive measures, mostly sanitary and cultural practices. Integrated control programs benefit from regular applications of copper formulations, which should be maintained at least a few years for maximum benefit. Olive cultivars vary in their susceptibility to olive knot, but there are no known cultivars with full resistance to the pathogen.

5	I'm going hiking tomorrow in hot weather. How can I prevent heat problems?	To prevent heat problems while hiking in hot weather: avoid direct sunlight between 11 AM and 4 PM, wear loose clothing and a light hat, rest often, stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, and watch for early signs of heat illness like weakness or dizziness. Your body needs 4 days to 2 weeks to adjust to heat, and high humidity can make cooling more difficult by preventing sweat evaporation. Without proper precautions, you could develop heat cramps, heat exhaustion, or the more serious heatstroke.	"['Top of the pageCheck Your Symptoms\nSunlight can help our mental outlook and help us feel healthier. For people who have arthritis, the sun\'s warmth can help relieve some of their physical pain. Many people also think that a suntan makes a person look young and healthy. But sunlight can be harmful to the skin, causing immediate problems as well as problems that may develop years later.\nA sunburn is skin damage from the sun\'s ultraviolet (UV) rays. Most sunburns cause mild pain and redness but affect only the outer layer of skin (first-degree burn). The red skin might hurt when you touch it. These sunburns are mild and can usually be treated at home.\nSkin that is red and painful and that swells up and blisters may mean that deep skin layers and nerve endings have been damaged (second-degree burn). This type of sunburn is usually more painful and takes longer to heal.\nOther problems that can be present along with sunburn include:\nLong-term problems include:\nYour skin type affects how easily you become sunburned. People with white or freckled skin, blond or red hair, and blue eyes usually sunburn easily.\nAlthough people with darker skin don\'t sunburn as easily, they can still get skin cancer. So it\'s important to use sun protection, no matter what your skin colour is.\nYour age also affects how your skin reacts to the sun. The skin of children younger than 6 and adults older than 60 is more sensitive to sunlight.\nYou may get a more severe sunburn depending on:\nPreventive measures and home treatment are usually all that is needed to prevent or treat a sunburn.\nIf you have any health risks that may increase the seriousness of sun exposure, you should avoid being in the sun from 11 in the morning to 3 in the afternoon.\nCheck your symptoms to decide if and when you should see a doctor.\nMany things can affect how your body responds to a symptom and what kind of care you may need. These include:\nYou have answered all the questions. Based on your answers, you may be able to take care of this problem at home.\nSymptoms of infection may include:\nYou can get dehydrated when you lose a lot of fluids because of problems like vomiting or fever.\nSymptoms of dehydration can range from mild to severe. For example:\nSevere dehydration means:\nModerate dehydration means:\nMild dehydration means:\nIf you\'re not sure if a fever is high, moderate, or mild, think about these issues:\nWith a high fever:\nWith a moderate fever:\nWith a mild fever:\nPain in adults and older children\nPain in children under 3 years\nIt can be hard to tell how much pain a baby or toddler is in.\nCertain health conditions and medicines weaken the immune system\'s ability to fight off infection and illness. Some examples in adults are:\nMany prescription and non-prescription medicines can cause the skin to sunburn more easily. A few common examples are:\nSymptoms of an allergic reaction may include:\nSymptoms of heatstroke may include:\nHeatstroke occurs when the body can\'t control its own temperature and body temperature continues to rise.\nBased on your answers, you may need care right away. The problem is likely to get worse without medical care.\nBased on your answers, you may need care soon. The problem probably will not get better without medical care.\nBased on your answers, you need emergency care.\nCall 911 or other emergency services now.\nSometimes people don\'t want to call 911. They may think that their symptoms aren\'t serious or that they can just get someone else to drive them. But based on your answers, the safest and quickest way for you to get the care you need is to call 911 for medical transport to the hospital.\nHome treatment measures may provide some relief from a mild sunburn.\nA sunburn can cause a mild fever and a headache. Lie down in a cool, quiet room to relieve the headache. A headache may be caused by dehydration, so drinking fluids may help. For more information, see the topic Dehydration.\nThere is little you can do to stop skin from peeling after a sunburn—it is part of the healing process. Lotion may help relieve the itching.\nOther home treatment measures, such as chamomile, may help relieve your sunburn symptoms.\nTry a non-prescription medicine to help treat your fever or pain:\nTalk to your child\'s doctor before switching back and forth between doses of acetaminophen and ibuprofen. When you switch between two medicines, there is a chance your child will get too much medicine.\nBe sure to follow these safety tips when you use a non-prescription medicine:\nHome treatment may help decrease pain, prevent infection, and help the skin heal.\nWatch for a skin infection while your blister is healing. Signs of infection include:\nCall your doctor if any of the following occur during home treatment:\nUse the following tips to protect your skin from the sun. You may decrease your chances of developing skin cancer and help prevent wrinkles.\nThe best way to prevent a sunburn is to avoid sun exposure.\nStay out of the midday sun (from 11 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon), which is the strongest sunlight. Find shade if you need to be outdoors. You can also calculate how much ultraviolet (UV) exposure you are getting by using the shadow rule: A shadow that is longer than you are means UV exposure is low; a shadow that is shorter than you are means the UV exposure is high.\nOther ways to protect yourself from the sun include wearing protective clothing, such as:\nYou should start protecting your child from the sun when he or she is a baby.\nIf you can\'t avoid being in the sun, use a sunscreen to help protect your skin while you are in the sun.\nBe sure to read the information on the sunscreen label about the SPF factor listed on the label and how much protection it gives your skin. Follow the directions on the label for applying the sunscreen so it is most effective in protecting your skin from the sun\'s ultraviolet rays.\nSunscreens labelled ""water-resistant"" are made to protect people while they are swimming or sweating. The label will say if the sunscreen will protect you for 40 minutes or 80 minutes.\nRemember that skin that is healing from a sunburn is sensitive to more damage from the sun, so be sure to prevent more sunburn in those areas. The following tips about sunscreen will help you use it more effectively:\nDo not use tanning booths to get a tan. Artificial tanning devices can cause skin damage and increase the risk of skin cancer. If you want your skin to look tan, try a sunless tanning cream or spray that makes your skin look tan. And keep using sunscreen when you are in the sun.\nFor information on sun exposure and vitamin D, see Getting Enough Vitamin D.\nTo prepare for your appointment, see the topic Making the Most of Your Appointment.\nYou can help your doctor diagnose and treat your condition by being prepared to answer the following questions:\nCurrent as of: February 26, 2020\nAuthor: Healthwise StaffMedical Review: William H.

Even experienced trekkers and athletes can fall victim to serious heat-related ailments if they don’t take special precautions. Your body’s built-in cooling system helps it to maintain its normal temperature of approximately 37-37 degrees Celsius when you’re in a hot environment. The evaporation of sweat from the surface of your skin causes cooling.\nIn addition, the blood vessels in your skin dilate (expand) to let more blood flow through them. (That’s why your skin gets flushed from a hard workout.) As your blood circulates through the innermost region of your body, known as the body core, it heats up. When it reaches the blood vessels in the skin, the heat radiates outward.\nThis natural “air-conditioning” system isn’t foolproof, however. If you don’t replace the water that you lose through sweat, you can become dehydrated. Without adequate water, your sweating mechanism can’t work effectively. In the extreme case, this mechanism can shut down completely.\nHigh humidity coupled with warm temperatures can also greatly hamper your body’s ability to stay cool. When it’s humid, there’s already so much moisture in the air that your sweat can’t evaporate as quickly. As a result, your body loses water as it pumps out sweat, yet your body temperature continues to rise.\nAnother important factor in how well your body deals with heat is acclimatization. Your body needs anywhere from four days to two weeks to make physiological adjustments that allow it to\nIf you overdo it in the heat, you can develop a series of problems. There are three major types of heat illness: heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heatstroke. Heat cramps are the least serious and heatstroke is the most threatening. Their symptoms overlap, however, and if proper measures aren’t taken at the first sign of heat injury, heat illness can progress to its most severe form.\nHeat cramps are painful muscle spasms that occur during or after intense exercise. The spasms usually occur in the muscles that are being exercised and may be caused by the loss of water and salt through sweat. The body temperature is usually not elevated. Rest and replacement of fluids can usually help relieve heat cramps.\nHeat exhaustion, also called heat prostration, is a common heat-related illness that occurs most often in people who are not acclimatized to hot weather. It sometimes occurs after excessive perspiration, coupled with inadequate consumption of water to replace lost liquids.\nSymptoms of heat exhaustion include weakness; dizziness; collapse; headache; weak, rapid pulse; cold, clammy skin; and dilated pupils. The victim of heat exhaustion usually has a near-normal body temperature and continues to sweat.\nIf you experience any of these symptoms while walking in hot weather, move to a cool place, rest, and drink plenty of water.\nHeatstroke, also called sunstroke, is the most serious heat-related illness and requires immediate medical attention. Heatstroke occurs when the body cannot get rid of heat fast enough. The body’s cooling system is overwhelmed and simply breaks down.\nSweating usually stops, the circulatory system is strained, and body temperature can rise to 106 degrees Fahrenheit or more. If immediate steps to cool the victim aren’t taken, body temperature will continue to rise and death may occur.\nSymptoms of heatstroke include hot, dry skin; rapid pulse; high body temperature; headache; dizziness; abdominal cramps; and delirium. Often, however, the first visible sign of heatstroke is loss of consciousness.\n- Avoid the direct sunlight and getting sun burnt\n- Make sure you wear a light hat that lets the heat out.\n- Rest often\n- Keep eating and drinking\n- Wear clothing that is lose and cool\n- Walk at your pace']"	['<urn:uuid:e4e48ae4-0044-4248-8bc8-fcb42beaf8bd>', '<urn:uuid:dfa77e05-c996-4c99-8c27-a5acdb893cc7>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	13	85	1944
6	I noticed one of my car's fan blades is bent and I was thinking of just straightening it out - would that be okay to do?	No, you should never straighten bent blades. You must replace the complete fan. Stress cracks and loose rivets in the blades can go undetected and cause a catastrophic failure. If a fan breaks, it can cause serious personal injuries and vehicle damage.	"['TROUBLESHOOTING WATER PUMPS\nBROKEN WATER PUMP BEARINGS OR SHAFTS ARE CAUSED BY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS.\nEXCESSIVE ENGINE ACCELERATION, rapid engine accelerations, particularly in low gear during quick get-aways, place heavy overloads on the bearing. Any minor imbalance can be amplified during rapid acceleration and high speeds, which can result in severe whipping action and sudden fractured.\nDEFECTIVE FAN. Relatively minor fan defects can impose substantial strain on the water pump shaft at 3000 to 5000 RPM. A small piece of fan blade missing can result in tremendous adverse centrifugal force. Fatigue cracks near the rivets can cause blade shift or vibration. Bent fan blades can also cause serious load problems.\nFAN NOT SQUARE WITH SHAFT. It is extremely important that the fan is mounted square to the center line of the shaft. If it is not square, the fan will wobble, causing vibrations to develop. This is particularly important where shaft spacers are used to move the fan closer to the radiator. The mounting bolts, if not properly torqued, will cause the fan to be tilted and may result in permanent deformation of the spacer.\nBENT OR CRACKED PULLEYS. Damaging vibration can result from bent or cracked pulleys. This usually happens then a pulley is improperly handled or installed.\nFAN BELT TOO TIGHT. An overtightened fan belt can overload the bearing, resulting in shorter than ordinary fatigue life. It also causes bending of the shaft. Sudden accelerations cause large unbalanced loads, excessive shaft bending and early shaft failure.\nSHAFT FAILURE CAUSED BY IMBALANCE\nExamination of a failed water pump shaft will reveal the probable cause of failure. Discoloration around the fracture indicated unusually high temperatures caused by centrifugal forced due to imbalance. A small amount of imbalance can result in tremendous pressure on the shaft at operating RPM. The overload is concentrated at one point of the shaft and eventually the shaft snaps.\nLack of discoloration at the break indicated no heat build-up occurred before a sudden vibratory overload of the shaft caused a clean, instantaneous fracture. Rapid acceleration of the engine coupled with imbalance in the shaft is the cause. Small vibrations can be amplified during rapid acceleration and when combined with other engine vibrations can result in an instantaneous shaft fracture.\nPREVENT WATER PUMP FAILURE WITH THESE COMMONS SENSE RULES:\nALWAYS TIGHTEN FAN BELTS PROPERLY. Drive belt tension should be ½"" to ¾"" deflection with light pressure applied midway between pulleys.\nNEVER HAMMER BEARING SHAFT. Often it is necessary to tap the pump to get it properly aligned during installation. It is very important not to tap on the shaft, as this results in ball race and ball damage. This can cause anything from a noisy pump to an early failure and even a fracture of the shaft.\nBE SURE FAN IS SEATED SQUARE WITH THE PUMP SHAFT AND FAN CLUTCH IS NOT DEFECTIVE. Fan wobble during rotation will cause the shaft to vibrate, contributing to bearing or shaft failure.\nALWAYS REPLACE DAMAGED FANS. Never straighten bent blades; replace the complete fan. Stress cracks and loose rivets in the blades can go undetected and cause a catastrophic failure. If a fan breaks, it can cause serious personal injuries and vehicle damage.']"	['<urn:uuid:21d15c4f-c8dc-4c6b-8915-ce8a1d906764>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	26	42	537
7	safety precautions electrical panel work	Essential safety precautions include: standing on a rubber mat or plywood while working, removing all metal jewelry, turning off the main breaker, verifying power is off with a voltmeter, using extreme caution around live main service wires which remain energized even with main breaker off, and ensuring proper lighting with a battery-operated light source.	"[""Adding a new electrical circuit to your home also requires that you add a new circuit breaker to the electrical service panel. This article will explain how to install a breaker switch and connect it to type NM non-metallic sheathed electrical cable.\n1Determine the maximum power that will be drawn on the new circuit. Divide the total number of watts by 120 (or 240 for a 240-Volt circuit). The result is the maximum current, in amperes (amps), for the circuit.\n2Select the proper gauge conductor for the maximum current of the circuit.\n- Select a 14 AWG conductor for a maximum current up to 15 amps.\n- Select a 12 AWG conductor for a maximum current up to 20 amps.\n- Select a 10 AWG conductor for a maximum current up to 30 amps.\n- Select an 8 AWG conductor for a maximum current up to 50 amps.\n3Purchase the correct circuit breaker.\n- You must use a circuit breaker that is approved for use in your service panel. In most cases, you must use a circuit breaker made by the same manufacturer as that of the service panel.\n- Select a circuit breaker with a current rating that does not exceed the rating of the circuit. For example, if a circuit is wired with a 12 AWG conductor, only use a circuit breaker rated for 20 amps or less.\n4Run the electrical cable for the new circuit. Allow for sufficient cable at the service panel to route the cable to the entry point in the box and then from that point to the farthest destination in box. As a rule of thumb, allow for a length of cable that is 2 to 3 times the height of the box.\n5Place a rubber mat or sheet of plywood (or other dry wood) in front of the service panel and stand on it while working in the panel.\n6Open the cover of the service panel and turn off the main breaker.\n7Note the location of unused circuit breaker spaces in the service panel cover. You must install the new circuit breaker to line up with a pre-punched knockout in the cover.\n8Remove the service panel cover.\n9Measure the voltage to verify that the power is off in the service panel. Place one probe of a voltmeter on the neutral bus bar and place the other probe on the supply bus bar (the bus bar to which the existing circuit breakers are attached). If the voltmeter does not read 0, the power in the service panel is not off and you should not proceed.\n10Choose the location in the service panel for the new circuit breaker. Remove the knockout.\n- Use a hammer and screwdriver to bend the knockout. Grasp the edge of the knockout with pliers and bend it back and forth until it breaks loose.\n11Locate a circular knockout on the top, side or bottom of the service panel box that is convenient for entry of the new circuit cable and for routing conductors inside the box to the new circuit breaker location. For safety reasons, select a knockout that is not in close proximity to the live service wires that connect to the main circuit breaker. Remove the knockout.\n12Install a cable clamp in the circular hole in the service panel box with the clamp on the outside of the box. Use a screwdriver to open the clamp as far as possible.\n13Route the cable to the new cable clamp.\n14Identify the location on the cable that will extend approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) inside the cable clamp. Strip off the outer jacket of the cable from this point to the end of the cable.\n- Use a utility knife to carefully cut down the middle of the cable jacket.\n- Peel the jacket apart and pull it off the conductors back to the point where you began your cut.\n- Cut the jacket off with a utility knife.\n- Remove the paper that surrounds the bare copper ground wire.\n15Wrap electrical tape around the ends of the conductors to hold them together. Route the conductors through the cable clamp until 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the jacketed cable extends through the cable clamp. Tighten the cable clamp. Remove the electrical tape holding the conductor ends together.\n16Determine whether your service panel has separate neutral and ground bus bars.\n- Your service panel has separate neutral and ground bus bars if all of the white wires are routed to one bus bar and all of the bare (or green) ground wires are routed to another bus bar.\n- Your service panel does not have separate neutral and ground bus bars if the white and ground conductors are connected to only 1 bus bar.\n17Route the ground conductor to the ground bus bar (or common neutral bus bar, as applicable). Cut off any excess conductor with the wire cutter. Loosen a screw in the bus bar, insert the conductor through the hole and firmly tighten the screw.\n18Route the white wire to the neutral bus bar. Cut off any excess conductor. Use a wire stripper to remove approximately 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) of insulation from the end of the conductor. Loosen a screw in the bus bar, insert the wire in the hole under the screw and firmly tighten the screw.\n19Determine how you will route the black wire to the location for the new circuit breaker. Cut off any excess conductor. Strip approximately 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) of insulation from the end of the conductor. Loosen the screw on the circuit breaker and insert the end of the black wire under it and then firmly tighten the screw.\n- If you are installing a double-pole breaker for a 240-Volt circuit, connect the black wire to either screw connector on the circuit breaker and connect the red wire to the other screw connector.\n20Install the circuit breaker.\n- Set the new breaker switch to the off position.\n- Route the black wire that is connected to the breaker switch from the cable clamp to the location where you will install the breaker.\n- Hold the circuit breaker at an angle and align its connection point with the rail, clip or slot in the service panel.\n- Press the other end of the circuit breaker into place. Some brands will click into place; others will not. To assure that the breaker is properly installed, verify that it is level with the adjacent circuit breakers.\n21Test your installation by first turning on the main breaker in the service panel and then turning on the new circuit breaker. Use a circuit tester or plug in an electrical appliance to test the new circuit.\n22Replace the breaker panel cover.\n- Check local building codes. A building permit may be required to add an electrical circuit.\n- While you are installing the new circuit breaker, the electricity will be off. Before you start, turn off all lights near the service panel, then determine if there is sufficient remaining light in the service panel location. If not, you will need have a flashlight or other battery-operated portable light before you proceed.\n- Installing a circuit breaker that is not approved for use in your service panel may create a hazardous condition.\n- Remove your watch, rings and all other metal jewelry before working near the service panel.\n- Use extreme caution while working inside an electrical service panel. There are live components inside the box, even with the main breaker switched off. The main service wires that enter the box and connect to the main circuit breaker are live. Touching these wires directly or with a metal object can be lethal.\nThings You'll Need\n- Type NM non-metallic sheathed electrical cable\n- Circuit breaker\n- Cable clamp\n- Sheet of plywood or a rubber mat\n- Flat blade screwdriver\n- Voltage tester\n- Utility knife\n- Wire strippers (with wire cutter)\n- Electrical tape\n- Circuit tester""]"	['<urn:uuid:042f5fb4-75ec-4d51-94cf-9a42f8e85463>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	5	54	1331
8	As an archaeologist studying ancient civilizations, what's the discovery timeline for the Baker Nebes statue versus Mohenjo-daro?	The Baker Nebes statue has little known history before the 1930s, while Mohenjo-daro remained undocumented for about 3,700 years until its rediscovery in 1919-1920 by R.D. Banerji of the Archaeological Survey of India.	"['Serving Statue of the Baker Nebes, Egyptian, 5th Dynasty, ca. 2494-2345 B.C.E. Painted limestone, 9 3/4 x 11 x 4 3/8 inches (24.8 x 27.9 x 11.1 cm). The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, Missouri. Purchase: William Rockhill Nelson Trust, 35-17\nThe term “serving"" statue is adopted here, rather than “servant”, to more neutrally reflect the figure’s function without assuming his identity, since it is speculated these types of statues could have represented friends or relatives of the deceased (1-2). Serving statues were placed in the serdab chamber of the deceased’s tomb to aid them in the afterlife and, if representing the deceased’s dependent, to help ensure their dependent’s access as well.\nThe object is a painted limestone serving statue belonging to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (NAMA 35-17).\nThe statue depicts a figure kneeling on a platform, feet tucked behind him, kneading dough and/or forming cakes or loaves.\nIDENTITY & INTERPRETATION\nWith the help of Dr. Ann Macy Roth, an inscription on the proper left side of the platform/base was translated, and the object’s contextual background investigated.\nPreviously interpreted as a generic, nameless representation of a servant kneading dough, the inscription was found to read “Baker Nebes”, identifying the individual by both name and trade.\nRTI - Specular Enhancement\nThe title “baker” is not commonly seen in Egyptian works. There are some examples of named bakers on tomb chapel wall reliefs, though there is no current knowledge of “baker” being inscribed on any other Old Kingdom serving statue. The name “Nebes” has not yet been found in the literature either, however there is a dearth of resources to consult about Old Kingdom names.\nThe Baker Negan and other men shaping dough, from the wall relief in the tomb of Iy-neferet.\nImage: Schürman 1993, fig. 15b\nBaker Ni-meret and Baker Tjenty are named in a large food procession on the east wall relief in the mastaba of Ka-ni-nisut.\nImage: Junker’s Gîza II. Die Mastabas der beginnenden V. Dynastie auf dem Westfriedhof, fig. 20\nParallels & Activity\nIn 1948, James Breasted included NAMA 35-17 in his book, “Egyptian Servant Statues”, describing the figure as “both hands reach forward and seem to be kneading dough” (3). He classified the statue under the category of “Man Forming Cakes or Loaves of Dough”, though similar statues have been interpreted differently.\nThe figure has little known history before the 1930s, but three close parallels coming from large deposits in 5th Dynasty tombs at Giza, lend considerable support for the figure’s origins. Like the parallels, the figure likely came from an Old Kingdom tomb at Giza that contained several other serving statues.\nIn light of the translated inscription on NAMA 35-17, which identifies the individual as a baker, it is doubtful that Parallel #2 (Hassan’s “Fuller”) (4) depicts an individual washing cloth. Similarly, it is unlikely that Munich’s example (Parallel #1, ÄS 4862) is a servant grinding flour, especially since the palette these figures kneel behind is much flatter than those seen in wheat-grinding statues. Their fingers also seem to wrap around the two forms they’re holding, making it unlikely that they are grinding.\nThe best interpretation for NAMA 35-17 seems to be a combination of Breasted’s 1948 classification, and Tooley’s description of OIM 10624: baker kneading dough and/or forming cakes or loaves (5).\nWe\'ve learned that Nebes was a valued baker in the household of the tomb owner, who was an elite in Old Kingdom Giza. The tomb owner likely commissioned this statue, along with several others, to be included in his mortuary cult. Nebes may have been a personal friend, or simply one of several individuals the deceased saw as an asset to his household whom he wished to continue with him into the afterlife.\nMATERIALS & TECHNOLOGY\nThe process of Egyptian stone working began with a cube of stone being roughed out with stone tools, followed by preliminary drawings on all four sides that guided sculptors as they worked.\nEgyptians utilized the geometry of a grid to maintain the figure’s proportions as they methodically worked inward from all sides of the stone. As work progressed, more precise copper/bronze tools were used, especially pointed chisels and drills for details.\nThe statue would have been finished off by polishing with rubbing stones and sand, and finally painted with pigments bound in a plant or animal-based glue (a water-sensitive system) (6-7). The binder rarely survives on painted limestone objects today, but the pigments can remain.\nTool marks evident on NAMA 35-17 include chisel marks on its underside, and abrasion over the surface from rubbing stones.\nPigments remaining on the surface include black, a pinkish white, and brownish reds. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) was utilized at over ten locations on the surface to help characterize the pigments present, and certain trends were observed when spectra were overlaid. Though, as a qualitative method, XRF results will need to be paired with other investigative analyses in the future for proper identification.\nReds were generally red ochre (iron oxides), with realgar (arsenic sulfide) sometimes added to achieve a reddish brown color (6). Analysis at locations with original red pigment showed notably high peaks for both iron and sulfur. All areas of red analyzed contained trace amounts of tin, manganese and zinc, which were absent in readings at the bare stone.\nWhites were often calcium sulfate (gypsum) or calcium carbonate, and pinks could be made by mixing red ochre with gypsum white (6). A spectrum at the pinkish white paint on the figure’s palette had a notable peak for sulfur, which may support the use of calcium sulfate, but overall, the lower iron content of both the pinkish white and black pigments allowed for a greater depth of reading, resulting in compositions and peak heights nearly identical to the bare stone.\nBlacks were almost exclusively made with carbon, which is too light to detect using XRF analysis.\nHover mouse over legend to view annotated map of breaks and approximate extent of previous restoration material.\nOld restoration material, such as plaster, shellac and mismatched paint, was found excessively over the surface of the statue, associated with repairs at 7 break locations, including at the neck, waist, and different points through each arm. These repairs were easily a century or more old and occurred before the statue was acquired by the museum, as determined by the object’s records, old photographs, and the materials and methods employed.\nComputer x-ray radiography revealed metal pins used at many of the joins—a common repair intervention for statues, though unnecessary in this case.\nThese outdated repairs were inadequate, inappropriate, and also posed potential risks:\nThe plaster was a possible source of soluble salts.\nThe shellac was old enough to be at the end of its use-life, at which point the joins could fail or possibly strengthen to a harmful degree.\nLast, if the internal pins were made of iron, they could rust and expand in volume, exerting pressure from within the stone that could cause it to break.\nPresence of Soluble Salts\nThe stone itself was soft—not unusual for limestone, which is calcareous and ranks low on the Mohs scale of hardness (Mohs hardness = 3) (6,8). However, the stone was powdery and excessively soft in many shallow areas of loss, suggesting the presence of harmful salts—common to Egyptian limestone.\nSoluble sea salts, like calcium sulfate (CaSO4) and sodium chloride (NaCl, halite), often became inherent constituents of the limestone as it was formed (9-10). If allowed to cycle in and out of solution in fluctuating relative humidity, the subflorescence of these salts can cause the stone to deteriorate and lose integrity, becoming soft, powdery and fragile. This mechanism likely played a role in the significant loss of paint from the surface.\nWhen the figure was disassembled, the stone and restoration plaster were sampled to be analyzed for ionic species through ion chromatography, in order to assess the presence and potential impact of soluble salts. Analysis was performed and interpreted by Chemist Bruce C. Hamper; results are outlined in Table 1.\nPowdered limestone samples showed an average total salt content around 1% w/w, with CaSO4 and NaCl as the major soluble salts consistently present throughout the stone matrix. The plaster was found to be gypsum plaster (CaSO4·2H2O), such as Plaster of Paris, but additional analysis is necessary to distinguish its influence on the stone’s overall CaSO4 content.\nENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS FOR STORAGE & DISPLAY\nThe potential harm of CaSO4 crystallizing near the surface is contingent on its exposure to a very high percentage of water vapor in the air—around 99% at 70˚F—which is fortunately unlikely to occur in the object’s current, controlled environment. However, the more attainable deliquescence of halite around 75% RH makes the stone’s NaCl content of primary concern (11). The museum currently maintains 50% + 5% RH at 70˚F, which will avoid halite crystallization, and a stable RH was further ensured by using well-sealed enclosures with mitigating quantities of silica gel.\nPrevious restorations were removed and replaced with more appropriate, long-term conservation materials, and repairs were visually integrated to a higher standard. New restoration materials were chosen which both chemically and aesthetically respect the object. Restorations were only added as necessary and were contained to areas of loss, which helped return the piece to a more honest state.\nPreliminary Removal of Old Restoration Materials\nBefore reversing the joins to disassemble the statue, join areas hidden beneath old restoration paint and plaster first needed to be exposed.\nRestoration paint was removed with the aid of an acetone-retaining gel system (10:90 acetone: Poval 5-74). Poval 5-74 is a partially hydrolyzed poly(vinyl alcohol) that was cross-linked with borate ions. This peelable, viscoelastic gel retained the solvent and kept it at the surface of the plaster, introducing it in a more controlled manner. Quantity and spread of the solvent was minimal while it effectively worked to loosen the paint. After removing the gel, pigment easily lifted with minimal solvent (1:1 acetone:mineral spirits) and cotton swabs, which also helped clear the area of any remaining gel residue.\nWhen the bare plaster was fully visible, a scalpel and other tools were used to mechanically break it apart and shave it down. Large areas of preserved, original paint were revealed on the figure, which had been broadly covered by restoration material.\nPulled cotton was packed into narrow spaces between joins, and ethanol was introduced to the point of refusal using a hypodermic needle to dissolve whatever shellac was present. Poultices were regularly changed out, plaster and solubilized shellac removed, and the process repeated. Following this procedure, joins loosened and released after a couple days, leaving the statue in 6 large fragments.\nDisassembly & Cleaning\nSurfaces were cleaned of old restoration materials and the 10:90 acetone: Poval 5-74 gel was used to clean the base, which was dirtied and dark from handling and storage. Fragile areas of pigment were pre-consolidated using 2% w/v Paraloid B-72 in acetone. Overall, restoration materials were successfully removed, if not greatly reduced, though overpainting that was too risky to safely remove remains around join areas.\nManganese dioxide (MnO2) stains observed at break surfaces indicated the statue was in a fragmented state while buried in the ground.\nUnlike the breaks with MnO2 stains, the figure’s proper right arm had been intentionally sawed-off at the top sometime after excavation. The level cut continued through into the pectoral area. It\'s theorized the previous restorer had difficulty aligning the fragments, and resorted to cutting the arm off to more easily manipulate it and compensate for other misalignments.\nAll joins had been misaligned to varying degrees, and the metal pins extracted from 4 of the joins were found to be brass and threaded.\nA judicial amount of 50% w/v Paraloid B-72 in acetone was used to join fragments in their proper positions. A detachable reconstruction was made of the figure’s proper right shoulder, using a piece of high density Ethafoam covered in epoxy putty and shaped using Micro-Mesh®. The epoxy took the impression of the break surfaces as it cured over a barrier of plastic wrap, allowing the piece to tightly fit the topography of the space. The reconstructed shoulder was attached in the same manner as the other fragments, using 50% w/v Paraloid B-72 in acetone.\nAquazol 200 in isopropanol bulked with cellulose power was used for all superficial fills, including applied as a layer over the epoxy shoulder addition. The solubility of this fill material allows it to be removed in the future with minimal to no effect on the joins, since B-72 is only slightly soluble in isopropanol. This material was a pleasing color, easy to use and manipulate, and experienced no shrinkage. Fills were texturized and shaped using a bamboo skewer, micro spatula, files, scalpel, pin-vice, and solvent as needed. In many instances, filing marks were mimicked on the fills to match the surrounding damage in the stone, and “paint losses” were shallowly carved out to imitate the appearance of the adjacent original surface.\nInpainting was performed using QOR watercolors, which are colors bound in Aquazol. This line of watercolors worked very well in matching the stone and the earthy reds of the original pigment. Minimal water was used in their application. Though composed of the same binder as the fills, the inpainting can be easily removed without solubilizing the Aquazol fills, so long as it is not removed with excessive amounts of water or aggressive swabbing.\nOverall, by mimicking paint losses and the disturbed surfaces surrounding losses (overpaint and filing marks from the previous restoration), a balance was achieved that discretely disguises the newly gap-filled areas.\nProper Right Arm\nProper Left Arm\nMaterials & Suppliers\nArt-Sorb—cassettes of pre-conditioned (50% RH) silica gel\n517 Main St., Holyoke, MA 01040\nPoval® 5-74—partially saponified grade of polyvinyl alcohol\nKuraray America Inc.,\n2625 Bay Area Blvd., Suite 300,\nHouston, Texas 77058\nBorate (xPVAc-borate)—lab grade borax sodium tetraborate\n330 W. 63rd Street,\nKansas City, MO 64113\nParaloid B-72—ethyl methacrylate (70%) and methyl acrylate (30%) copolymer\nRohm & Haas Co., Philadelphia, PA\nSupplied by Conservation Support Systems,\nP.O.

Built around 2500 BCE, it was one of the largest settlements of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation, and one of the world's earliest major cities, contemporaneous with the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Minoan Crete, and Norte Chico. Mohenjo-daro was abandoned in the 19th century BCE as the Indus Valley Civilization declined, and the site was not rediscovered until the 1920s. Significant excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. The site is currently threatened by erosion and improper restoration.\nThe city's original name is unknown. Based on his analysis of a Mohenjo-daro seal, Iravatham Mahadevan speculates that the city's ancient name could have been Kukkutarma, the city of the cockerel [kukkuta]. Cock-fighting may have had ritual and religious significance for the city, with domesticated chickens bred there for sacred purposes, rather than as a food source. Mohenjo-daro may also have been a point of diffusion for the eventual worldwide domestication of chickens.\nMohenjo-daro is located west of the Indus River in Larkana District, Sindh, Pakistan, in a central position between the Indus River and the Ghaggar-Hakra River. It is situated on a Pleistocene ridge in the middle of the flood plain of the Indus River Valley, around 28 kilometres (17 mi) from the city of Larkana. The ridge was prominent during the time of the Indus Valley Civilization, allowing the city to stand above the surrounding flood, but subsequent flooding has since buried most of the ridge in silt deposits. The Indus still flows east of the site, but the Ghaggar-Hakra riverbed on the western side is now dry.\nMohenjo-daro has a hot desert climate with extremely hot summers and mild winters. The highest recorded temperature is 53.5 °C (128.3 °F), and the lowest recorded temperature is −5.4 °C (22.3 °F). Rainfall is low, and mainly occurs in the monsoon season that is July to September.\nMohenjo-daro was built in the 26th century BCE. It was one of the largest cities of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, which developed around 3,000 BCE from the prehistoric Indus culture. At its height, the Indus Civilization spanned much of what is now Pakistan and North India, extending westwards to the Iranian border, south to Gujarat in India and northwards to an outpost in Bactria, with major urban centres at Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, Lothal, Kalibangan, Dholavira and Rakhigarhi. Mohenjo-daro was the most advanced city of its time, with remarkably sophisticated civil engineering and urban planning. When the Indus civilization went into sudden decline around 1900 BCE, Mohenjo-daro was abandoned.\nRediscovery and excavation\nThe ruins of the city remained undocumented for around 3,700 years until R. D. Banerji, an officer of the Archaeological Survey of India, visited the site in 1919–20 identifying what he thought to be a Buddhist stupa (150–500 CE) known to be there and finding a flint scraper which convinced him of the site's antiquity. This led to large-scale excavations of Mohenjo-daro led by Kashinath Narayan Dikshit in 1924–25, and John Marshall in 1925–26. In the 1930s major excavations were conducted at the site under the leadership of Marshall, D. K. Dikshitar and Ernest Mackay. Further excavations were carried out in 1945 by Mortimer Wheeler and his trainee, Ahmad Hasan Dani. The last major series of excavations were conducted in 1964 and 1965 by George F. Dales. After 1965 excavations were banned due to weathering damage to the exposed structures, and the only projects allowed at the site since have been salvage excavations, surface surveys, and conservation projects. In the 1980s, German and Italian survey groups led by Michael Jansen and Maurizio Tosi used less invasive archaeological techniques, such as architectural documentation, surface surveys, and localized probing, to gather further information about Mohenjo-daro. A dry core drilling conducted in 2015 by Pakistan's National Fund for Mohenjo-daro revealed that the site is larger than the unearthed area.\nArchitecture and urban infrastructure\nMohenjo-daro has a planned layout with rectilinear buildings arranged on a grid plan. Most were built of fired and mortared bricks, some incorporated sun-dried mud-brick and wooden superstructures. The covered area of Mohenjo-daro is estimated at 300 hectares. The Oxford Handbook of Cities in World History offers a weak estimate of a peak population of around 40,000.\nThe sheer size of the city, and its provision of public buildings and facilities, suggests a high level of social organization. The city is divided into two parts, the so-called Citadel and the Lower City. The Citadel, a mud-brick mound around 12 metres (39 ft) high is known to have supported public baths, a large residential structure designed to house about 5,000 citizens, and two large assembly halls. The city had a central marketplace, with a large central well. Individual households or groups of households obtained their water from smaller wells. Waste water was channelled to covered drains that lined the major streets. Some houses, presumably those of more prestigious inhabitants, include rooms that appear to have been set aside for bathing, and one building had an underground furnace (known as a hypocaust), possibly for heated bathing. Most houses had inner courtyards, with doors that opened onto side-lanes. Some buildings had two stories.\nIn 1950, Sir Mortimer Wheeler identified one large building in Mohenjo-daro as a 'Great Granary'. Certain wall-divisions in its massive wooden superstructure appeared to be grain storage-bays, complete with air-ducts to dry the grain. According to Wheeler, carts would have brought grain from the countryside and unloaded them directly into the bays. However, Jonathan Mark Kenoyer noted the complete lack of evidence for grain at the 'granary', which, he argued, might therefore be better termed a 'Great Hall' of uncertain function. Close to the 'Great Granary' is a large and elaborate public bath, sometimes called the Great Bath. From a colonnaded courtyard, steps lead down to the brick-built pool, which was waterproofed by a lining of bitumen. The pool measures 12 metres (39 ft) long, 7 metres (23 ft) wide and 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) deep. It may have been used for religious purification. Other large buildings include a 'Pillared Hall', thought to be an assembly hall of some kind, and the so-called 'College Hall', a complex of buildings comprising 78 rooms, thought to have been a priestly residence.\nMohenjo-daro had no series of city walls, but was fortified with guard towers to the west of the main settlement, and defensive fortifications to the south. Considering these fortifications and the structure of other major Indus valley cities like Harappa, it is postulated that Mohenjo-daro was an administrative centre. Both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro share relatively the same architectural layout, and were generally not heavily fortified like other Indus Valley sites. It is obvious from the identical city layouts of all Indus sites that there was some kind of political or administrative centrality, but the extent and functioning of an administrative centre remains unclear.\nWater supply and wells\nThe location of Mohenjo-daro was built in a relatively short period of time, with the water supply system and wells being some of the first planned constructions. With the excavations done so far, over 700 wells are present at Mohenjo-daro, alongside drainage and bathing systems. This number is unheard of when compared to other civilizations at the time, such as Egypt or Mesopotamia, and the quantity of wells transcribes as one well for every three houses. Because the large number of wells, it is believed that the inhabitants relied solely on annual rainfall, as well as the Indus River's course remaining close to the site, alongside the wells providing water for long periods of time in the case of the city coming under siege. Due to the period in which these wells were built and used, it is likely that the circular brick well design used at this and many other Harappan sites are an invention that should be credited to the Indus civilization, as there is no existing evidence of this design from Mesopotamia or Egypt at this time, and even later. Sewage and waste water for buildings at the site were disposed of via a centralized drainage system that ran alongside the site's streets. These drains that ran alongside the road were effective at allowing most human waste and sewage to be disposed of as the drains tool the waste most likely toward the Indus River. It is theorized that the job of keeping the pipes clean and from getting piled up was either a job for slaves, or captured enemy soldiers, with others who believe it was a paid job for citizens of the city.\nFlooding and rebuilding\nThe city also had large platforms perhaps intended as defence against flooding. According to a theory first advanced by Wheeler, the city could have been flooded and silted over, perhaps six times, and later rebuilt in the same location. For some archaeologists, it was believed that a final flood that helped engulf the city in a sea of mud brought about the abandonment of the site. Gregory Possehl was the first to theorize that the floods were caused by overuse and expansion upon the land, and that the mud flood was not the reason the site was abandoned. Instead of a mud flood wiping part of the city out in one fell swoop, Possehl coined the possibility of constant mini-floods throughout the year, paired with the land being worn out by crops, pastures, and resources for bricks and pottery spelled the downfall of the site.\nNumerous objects found in excavation include seated and standing figures, copper and stone tools, carved seals, balance-scales and weights, gold and jasper jewellery, and children's toys. Many bronze and copper pieces, such as figurines and bowls, have been recovered from the site, showing that the inhabitants of Mohenjo-daro understood how to utilize the lost wax technique. The furnaces found at the site are believed to have been used for copperworks and melting the metals as opposed to smelting. There even seems to be an entire section of the city dedicated to shell-working, located in the north-eastern part of the site. Some of the most prominent copperworks recovered from the site are the copper tablets which have examples of the untranslated Indus script and iconography. While the script has not been cracked yet, many of the images on the tablets match another tablet and both hold the same caption in the Indus language, with the example given showing three tablets with the image of a mountain goat and the inscription on the back reading the same letters for the three tablets. Pottery and terracotta sherds have been recovered from the site, with many of the pots having deposits of ash in them, leading Archaeologists to believe they were either used to hold the ashes of a person or as a way to warm up a home located in the site. These heaters, or braziers, were ways to heat the house while also being able to be utilized in a manner of cooking or straining, while others solely believe they were used for heating. Many important objects from Mohenjo-daro are conserved at the National Museum of India in Delhi and the National Museum of Pakistan in Karachi. In 1939, a representative collection of artefacts excavated at the site was transferred to the British Museum by the Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India.\nMother Goddess Idol\nDiscovered by John Marshall in 1931, the idol appears to mimic certain characteristics that match the Mother Goddess belief common in many early Near East civilizations. Sculptures and figurines depicting women have been observed as part of Harappan culture and religion, as multiple female pieces were recovered from Marshall's archaeological digs. These figures were not categorized correctly, according to Marshall, meaning that where they were recovered from the site is not actually clear. One of said figures, pictured below, is 18.7 cm tall and is currently on display at the National Museum of Pakistan, in Karachi. The fertility and motherhood aspects on display on the idols is represented by the female genitalia that is presented in an almost exaggerated style as stated by Marshall, with him inferring that such figurines are offerings to the goddess, as opposed to the typical understanding of them being idols representing the goddess's likeness. Because of the figurines being unique in terms of hairstyles, body proportions, as well as headdresses and jewelry, there are theories as to who these figurines actually represent. Shereen Ratnagar theorizes that because of their uniqueness and dispersed discovery throughout the site that they could be figurines of ordinary household women, who commissioned these pieces to be used in rituals or healing ceremonies to help aforementioned individual women.\nIn 1927, a seated male soapstone figure was found in a building with unusually ornamental brickwork and a wall-niche. Though there is no evidence that priests or monarchs ruled Mohenjo-daro, archaeologists dubbed this dignified figure a Priest-King. The sculpture is 17.5 centimetres (6.9 in) tall, and shows a neatly bearded man with pierced earlobes and a fillet around his head, possibly all that is left of a once-elaborate hairstyle or head-dress, his hair is combed back. He wears an armband, and a cloak with drilled trefoil, single circle and double circle motifs, which show traces of red. His eyes might have originally been inlaid.\nA seal discovered at the site bears the image of a seated, cross-legged and possibly ithyphallic figure surrounded by animals. The figure has been interpreted by some scholars as a yogi, and by others as a three-headed 'proto-Shiva' as 'Lord of Animals'.\nSir Mortimer Wheeler was especially fascinated with this artifact, which he believed to be at least 4,500 years old. The necklace has an S-shaped clasp with seven strands, each over 4 ft long, of bronze-metal bead-like nuggets which connect each arm of the 'S' in filigree. Each strand has between 220 and 230 of the many-faceted nuggets, and there are about 1,600 nuggets in total. The necklace weighs about 250 grams in total, and is presently held in a private collection in India.\nSurviving structures at Mohenjo-daro\nPreservation work for Mohenjo-daro was suspended in December 1996 after funding from the Pakistan government and international organizations stopped. Site conservation work resumed in April 1997, using funds made available by the UNESCO. The 20-year funding plan provided $10 million to protect the site and standing structures from flooding. In 2011, responsibility for the preservation of the site was transferred to the government of Sindh.\nCurrently the site is threatened by groundwater salinity and improper restoration. Many walls have already collapsed, while others are crumbling from the ground up. In 2012, Pakistani archaeologists warned that, without improved conservation measures, the site could disappear by 2030.\n2014 Sindh Festival\nThe Mohenjo-daro site was further threatened in January 2014, when Bilawal Bhutto Zardari of the Pakistan People's Party chose the site for Sindh Festival's inauguration ceremony.

9	soft pull vs hard pull credit checks	There are two types of credit report pulls. Soft pulls are used by financial institutions to prescreen applicants and don't affect your credit score. Hard pulls are official credit checks used to determine financing eligibility and can lower your credit score by 2 to 5 points. Your credit report maintains a record of all credit applications from the past two years.	['Some people downplay the importance of good credit, but whether you realize it or not, your credit matters. Your credit score and the information on your credit report matters a great deal. It has a tremendous impact on your financial life. You may already know that banks pull your credit report when applying for loans or credit cards, but you may not realize that other institutions pull your credit as well.\nAs consumers, each of us is entitled to one free credit report from the bureaus each year. You don’t have to pay for these reports, nor do these requests affect your credit score. This is one of the best ways to keep an eye on your credit history and catch fraud early. Get Your Credit Scores & Reports From All 3 Credit Bureaus.\nOn the other hand, when an institution pulls your credit report, it can create a credit inquiry, which can lower your credit score by 2 to 5 points. Your credit report keeps a record of every credit application you’ve submitted over the past two years.\nThere are different types of credit report pulls. A soft pull is used by many financial institutions to prescreen applicants, and these don’t hurt your credit. A hard pull is an official credit check to determine if you’re eligible for financing, and these can hurt your credit. Get your credit and finances on track with Lex OnTrack\n5 Times When Your Credit Matters The Most\nBefore you can keep tabs on who’s checking your credit, you need to understand situations that may justify a credit check.\n1. Opening a bank account\nIf you’re opening a checking or savings account with a bank or credit union, the financial institution may check your credit. They’ll also run your name through ChexSystem to see if you’ve had problems with banks in the past, such as overdrawn accounts you didn’t settle. These checks have nothing to do with your credit. However, if you’re opening a checking account and requesting overdraft protection, this often results in a hard pull.\nOverdraft protection is a credit line received through the bank. If a transaction comes through your checking account and you don’t have enough cash to cover it, the bank will pay the charge using your credit line, and then you pay back the bank. This is an excellent tool to avoid overdraft fees, but you need good credit to qualify.\n2. Test driving a car\nEven if your only test driving a car, a car dealership may request a copy of your driver’s license and your Social Security number to conduct a soft pull on your credit. This is how they prescreen potential car buyers. The dealer is able to see your credit score, which he can use to estimate whether you qualify for a car.\nThis type of credit pull only gives the dealership a snapshot of your credit history. If you decide to proceed with the purchase, a finance department will conduct a hard pull and review your entire credit history to determine if you’re eligible for financing.\n3. Applying for a loan\nWhether you’re applying for a mortgage loan or an auto loan, lenders will check your credit before approving your application. There are several reasons why a bank needs your credit information in addition to your income. Since credit provides a snapshot of your credit history, lenders can gather all the data they need to determine whether you’re a likely candidate.\nYour credit report highlights the length of your credit history, which is important when applying for certain types of loans. Some lenders are hesitant to give mortgages to people with a very short credit history.\nBanks also look at your debts to assess how much you’re currently paying. With any type of loan, you need a manageable debt-to-income ratio. Even if you have a high credit score, too many monthly payments can create a hardship and increases the likelihood of default.\nLenders want to minimize this risk, so they’ll calculate your ratio before approving the loan. The contents of your credit report also help lenders determine your interest rate. If you have no debt, a good payment record and a high score, you’ll qualify for the most favorable rates.\n4. Getting new insurance\nTruthfully, auto insurance has nothing to do with credit. You don’t finance car insurance, and you can cancel your policy at any time — it’s a month-to-month contract. Still, auto insurance providers recognize a connection between good credit and timely payments.\nFor that matter, many insurance carriers check credit scores before determining premiums. If you have a history of timely payments, and no negative activity in your past, such as bankruptcy, foreclosure or a repossession, you can qualify for the lowest premiums.\n5. Applying for a new job\nThe job market is tough, and unfortunately, you’ll have an especially tough time if you have a low credit score. Not all jobs check credit but depending on the nature of the assignment, the employer may look for someone who’s responsible with finances.\nThis might be the case if you’re applying to work as a lender, a banker, or if you’re seeking another position in finance. If you can’t manage your own money and credit, the company may feel you’re not the right person to manage its finances.\nIf you borrow money for a new home or a new car, you understand the importance of your credit score. Having a good credit score can mean the difference between a great interest rate and one that is so high that it will cost you thousands of extra dollars in interest.\nBut, what kind of interest rates can you expect based on the credit score that you have? If you have not checked your credit score in while, my financial planners and experts highly recommend that you check your credit score and credit report at least once a year. You can win the credit score game. It is possible!\nWhat Is A Good Credit Score?\nEach lender that you apply to borrow money from has set criteria as to what makes a great credit score. Many lenders start raising your interest rates if your FICO score has dropped below 720. So, any score above 720 is typically considered good, but you may need as high as 760 to qualify for the best 30 year mortgage. FICO is a proprietary credit score developed by the Fair Isaac Corporation, and it is practically the only credit score that matters. Over 90% of all lenders rate potential borrowers based on their FICO credit score.\nA FICO credit score range is from 300 to 850. One of the biggest problems with receiving your free annual credit report from the three credit bureaus is that it does not include your score. You have to pay for that as an extra charge (typically $20 at the most). I recently purchased myFICO score, and it was very interesting to see a breakdown of how different credit scores can lead to higher interest rates.\nA Bad Credit Score Can Cost You Thousands\nThe difference between having a great credit score and just a decent one is also a difference of over 1.5% on a 30 year-fixed mortgage. It can also be a difference of 3.5% or more on a 48 month car loan. Heaven forbid if you have a poor score, you could be facing an interest rate of 17% of more on a car loan.\nWhile one or two percentage points do not seem like a lot initially, they can add up to some serious money over time. For example, you could pay just over $126,000 on a $200,000 home with a 30 year mortgage at today’s rate of 3.585%. Or, you could pay $68,000 more in interest payments over the course of your loan if you had a credit score of 639 or less.\nA poor score can also cost you almost $8,000 extra in interest on a new car loan if you have a poor credit score when compared to those with the best credit, 720 or higher.\nWhile you may be quick to right off one or two percentage points on your home mortgage or car loan because you have good credit and not great credit, it would be a mistake that could cost you thousands of dollars. Now is the time to continue focusing on improving your credit score before you need it to apply for a new loan.\nFrom getting insurance to applying for a loan, you need to get serious about your credit. If you’ve made mistakes in the past and your credit needs improvement, maybe you don’t know where to start. Improving your credit habits is a good place, such as paying off debt and paying your bills on time. But sometimes, bad credit occurs due to errors on your credit report. Ignoring these issues only makes the problem worse.\nCredit repair may seem overwhelming, but it’s easier than you might think. You can repair your credit score fast. And, you can also sign up for a variety of online services. If you have a mobile device, some companies offers a credit repair app and track your progress. These apps allow you to view your credit report file, review credit bureau actions in response to your dispute, and even track credit monitoring alerts.\nThis is your credit, and if you don’t protect it, nobody will. You’re not going to go from a 500 credit score to an 800 credit score overnight, but with better habits and the help you deserve, you can erase the past.']	['<urn:uuid:39b6e8df-dc03-4cd1-b99b-4b730b18cee4>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	7	61	1602
10	Did mathematical concepts like zero emerge before or after Aristotle's logical innovations?	Aristotle's logical innovations came before the mathematical concept of zero as we know it today. Aristotle developed the earliest study of formal logic around 384-322 BC, creating a system that dominated Western logic until the 19th century. In contrast, zero as a mathematical concept emerged much later - while the Babylonians used placeholder symbols around 400 BC, zero as an actual number didn't appear until around 650 AD in Indian mathematics. The Indians were the first to develop sophisticated rules for using zero in arithmetic operations, with mathematicians like Brahmagupta attempting to establish rules for calculations involving zero in the seventh century AD.	"['Aristotle was Plato\'s greatest student. One of his big contributions to philosophy was the theory of the four kinds of causes. Aristotle\'s ideal state would be ruled by the virtuous citizens. Aristotle thinks that a state is an association for allowing each citizen to live well. What was Aristotle\'s notion of friendship? It was broader than our modern notion of friendship. It was closer to the idea of people helping each other be virtuous. Aristotle thought the state had a duty to morally improve its citizens. Modern political theorists do not agree. Aristotle didn\'t think that the state should be barred from religion and censorship. Aristotle\'s ethical theory was centered on the question of what kind of life to live. It was not concerned with discovering what actions are right.\nAristotle (Greek: Ἀριστοτέλης [aristotélɛːs], Aristotélēs) (384 BC – 322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and polymath, a student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great. His writings cover many subjects, including physics, metaphysics, poetry, theater, music,logic, rhetoric, linguistics, politics, government, ethics, biology, and zoology. Together with Plato and Socrates (Plato\'s teacher), Aristotle is one of the most important founding figures in Western philosophy. Aristotle\'s writings were the first to create a comprehensive system of Western philosophy, encompassing morality, aesthetics, logic, science, politics, and metaphysics. Aristotle\'s views on the physical sciences profoundly shaped medieval scholarship, and their influence extended well into the Renaissance, although they were ultimately replaced by Newtonian physics. In the zoological sciences, some of his observations were confirmed to be accurate only in the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic. In metaphysics, Aristotelianism had a profound influence on philosophical and theological thinking in the Islamic and Jewish traditions in the Middle Ages, and it continues to influence Christian theology, especially the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church. Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as المعلم الأول - ""The First Teacher"". His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics. All aspects of Aristotle\'s philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues (Cicero described his literary style as ""a river of gold""), it is thought that the majority of his writings are now lost and only about one-third of the original works have survived.[ Logic\nAristotle portrayed in the 1493Nuremberg Chronicle as a scholar of the 15th century A.D. Main article: Term logic\nWith the Prior Analytics, Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic, and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th century advances in mathematical logic. Kant stated in the Critique of Pure Reason that Aristotle\'s theory of logic completely accounted for the core of deductive inference. History\nAristotle ""says that \'on the subject of reasoning\' he \'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of\'"" However, Plato reports that syntax was devised before him, by Prodicus of Ceos, who was concerned by the correct use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from dialectics; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like reductio ad absurdum in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a deductive system, he could never actually construct one and relied instead on his dialectic. Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from premises, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the conclusion would logically follow. Consequently, Plato realized that a...', 'A history of Zero\n|Ancient Indian Mathematics index||History Topics Index|\nThe first thing to say about zero is that there are two uses of zero which are both extremely important but are somewhat different. One use is as an empty place indicator in our place-value number system. Hence in a number like 2106 the zero is used so that the positions of the 2 and 1 are correct. Clearly 216 means something quite different. The second use of zero is as a number itself in the form we use it as 0. There are also different aspects of zero within these two uses, namely the concept, the notation, and the name. (Our name ""zero"" derives ultimately from the Arabic sifr which also gives us the word ""cipher"".)\nNeither of the above uses has an easily described history. It just did not happen that someone invented the ideas, and then everyone started to use them. Also it is fair to say that the number zero is far from an intuitive concept. Mathematical problems started as \'real\' problems rather than abstract problems. Numbers in early historical times were thought of much more concretely than the abstract concepts which are our numbers today. There are giant mental leaps from 5 horses to 5 ""things"" and then to the abstract idea of ""five"". If ancient peoples solved a problem about how many horses a farmer needed then the problem was not going to have 0 or -23 as an answer.\nOne might think that once a place-value number system came into existence then the 0 as an empty place indicator is a necessary idea, yet the Babylonians had a place-value number system without this feature for over 1000 years. Moreover there is absolutely no evidence that the Babylonians felt that there was any problem with the ambiguity which existed. Remarkably, original texts survive from the era of Babylonian mathematics. The Babylonians wrote on tablets of unbaked clay, using cuneiform writing. The symbols were pressed into soft clay tablets with the slanted edge of a stylus and so had a wedge-shaped appearance (and hence the name cuneiform). Many tablets from around 1700 BC survive and we can read the original texts. Of course their notation for numbers was quite different from ours (and not based on 10 but on 60) but to translate into our notation they would not distinguish between 2106 and 216 (the context would have to show which was intended). It was not until around 400 BC that the Babylonians put two wedge symbols into the place where we would put zero to indicate which was meant, 216 or 21 \'\' 6.\nThe two wedges were not the only notation used, however, and on a tablet found at Kish, an ancient Mesopotamian city located east of Babylon in what is today south-central Iraq, a different notation is used. This tablet, thought to date from around 700 BC, uses three hooks to denote an empty place in the positional notation. Other tablets dated from around the same time use a single hook for an empty place. There is one common feature to this use of different marks to denote an empty position. This is the fact that it never occured at the end of the digits but always between two digits. So although we find 21 \'\' 6 we never find 216 \'\'. One has to assume that the older feeling that the context was sufficient to indicate which was intended still applied in these cases.\nIf this reference to context appears silly then it is worth noting that we still use context to interpret numbers today. If I take a bus to a nearby town and ask what the fare is then I know that the answer ""It\'s three fifty"" means three pounds fifty pence. Yet if the same answer is given to the question about the cost of a flight from Edinburgh to New York then I know that three hundred and fifty pounds is what is intended.\nWe can see from this that the early use of zero to denote an empty place is not really the use of zero as a number at all, merely the use of some type of punctuation mark so that the numbers had the correct interpretation.\nNow the ancient Greeks began their contributions to mathematics around the time that zero as an empty place indicator was coming into use in Babylonian mathematics. The Greeks however did not adopt a positional number system. It is worth thinking just how significant this fact is. How could the brilliant mathematical advances of the Greeks not see them adopt a number system with all the advantages that the Babylonian place-value system possessed? The real answer to this question is more subtle than the simple answer that we are about to give, but basically the Greek mathematical achievements were based on geometry. Although Euclid\'s Elements contains a book on number theory, it is based on geometry. In other words Greek mathematicians did not need to name their numbers since they worked with numbers as lengths of lines. Numbers which required to be named for records were used by merchants, not mathematicians, and hence no clever notation was needed.\nNow there were exceptions to what we have just stated. The exceptions were the mathematicians who were involved in recording astronomical data. Here we find the first use of the symbol which we recognise today as the notation for zero, for Greek astronomers began to use the symbol O. There are many theories why this particular notation was used. Some historians favour the explanation that it is omicron, the first letter of the Greek word for nothing namely ""ouden"". Neugebauer, however, dismisses this explanation since the Greeks already used omicron as a number - it represented 70 (the Greek number system was based on their alphabet). Other explanations offered include the fact that it stands for ""obol"", a coin of almost no value, and that it arises when counters were used for counting on a sand board. The suggestion here is that when a counter was removed to leave an empty column it left a depression in the sand which looked like O.\nPtolemy in the Almagest written around 130 AD uses the Babylonian sexagesimal system together with the empty place holder O. By this time Ptolemy is using the symbol both between digits and at the end of a number and one might be tempted to believe that at least zero as an empty place holder had firmly arrived. This, however, is far from what happened. Only a few exceptional astronomers used the notation and it would fall out of use several more times before finally establishing itself. The idea of the zero place (certainly not thought of as a number by Ptolemy who still considered it as a sort of punctuation mark) makes its next appearance in Indian mathematics.\nThe scene now moves to India where it is fair to say the numerals and number system was born which have evolved into the highly sophisticated ones we use today. Of course that is not to say that the Indian system did not owe something to earlier systems and many historians of mathematics believe that the Indian use of zero evolved from its use by Greek astronomers. As well as some historians who seem to want to play down the contribution of the Indians in a most unreasonable way, there are also those who make claims about the Indian invention of zero which seem to go far too far. For example Mukherjee in  claims:-\n... the mathematical conception of zero ... was also present in the spiritual form from 17 000 years back in India.What is certain is that by around 650AD the use of zero as a number came into Indian mathematics. The Indians also used a place-value system and zero was used to denote an empty place. In fact there is evidence of an empty place holder in positional numbers from as early as 200AD in India but some historians dismiss these as later forgeries. Let us examine this latter use first since it continues the development described above.\nIn around 500AD Aryabhata devised a number system which has no zero yet was a positional system. He used the word ""kha"" for position and it would be used later as the name for zero. There is evidence that a dot had been used in earlier Indian manuscripts to denote an empty place in positional notation. It is interesting that the same documents sometimes also used a dot to denote an unknown where we might use x. Later Indian mathematicians had names for zero in positional numbers yet had no symbol for it. The first record of the Indian use of zero which is dated and agreed by all to be genuine was written in 876.\nWe have an inscription on a stone tablet which contains a date which translates to 876. The inscription concerns the town of Gwalior, 400 km south of Delhi, where they planted a garden 187 by 270 hastas which would produce enough flowers to allow 50 garlands per day to be given to the local temple. Both of the numbers 270 and 50 are denoted almost as they appear today although the 0 is smaller and slightly raised.\nWe now come to considering the first appearance of zero as a number. Let us first note that it is not in any sense a natural candidate for a number. From early times numbers are words which refer to collections of objects. Certainly the idea of number became more and more abstract and this abstraction then makes possible the consideration of zero and negative numbers which do not arise as properties of collections of objects. Of course the problem which arises when one tries to consider zero and negatives as numbers is how they interact in regard to the operations of arithmetic, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. In three important books the Indian mathematicians Brahmagupta, Mahavira and Bhaskara tried to answer these questions.\nBrahmagupta attempted to give the rules for arithmetic involving zero and negative numbers in the seventh century. He explained that given a number then if you subtract it from itself you obtain zero. He gave the following rules for addition which involve zero:-\nThe sum of zero and a negative number is negative, the sum of a positive number and zero is positive, the sum of zero and zero is zero.Subtraction is a little harder:-\nA negative number subtracted from zero is positive, a positive number subtracted from zero is negative, zero subtracted from a negative number is negative, zero subtracted from a positive number is positive, zero subtracted from zero is zero.Brahmagupta then says that any number when multiplied by zero is zero but struggles when it comes to division:-\nA positive or negative number when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator. Zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator. Zero divided by zero is zero.Really Brahmagupta is saying very little when he suggests that n divided by zero is n/0. Clearly he is struggling here. He is certainly wrong when he then claims that zero divided by zero is zero. However it is a brilliant attempt from the first person that we know who tried to extend arithmetic to negative numbers and zero.\nIn 830, around 200 years after Brahmagupta wrote his masterpiece, Mahavira wrote Ganita Sara Samgraha which was designed as an updating of Brahmagupta\'s book. He correctly states that:-\n... a number multiplied by zero is zero, and a number remains the same when zero is subtracted from it.However his attempts to improve on Brahmagupta\'s statements on dividing by zero seem to lead him into error. He writes:-\nA number remains unchanged when divided by zero.Since this is clearly incorrect my use of the words ""seem to lead him into error"" might be seen as confusing. The reason for this phrase is that some commentators on Mahavira have tried to find excuses for his incorrect statement.\nBhaskara wrote over 500 years after Brahmagupta. Despite the passage of time he is still struggling to explain division by zero. He writes:-\nA quantity divided by zero becomes a fraction the denominator of which is zero. This fraction is termed an infinite quantity. In this quantity consisting of that which has zero for its divisor, there is no alteration, though many may be inserted or extracted; as no change takes place in the infinite and immutable God when worlds are created or destroyed, though numerous orders of beings are absorbed or put forth.So Bhaskara tried to solve the problem by writing n/0 = ∞. At first sight we might be tempted to believe that Bhaskara has it correct, but of course he does not. If this were true then 0 times ∞ must be equal to every number n, so all numbers are equal. The Indian mathematicians could not bring themselves to the point of admitting that one could not divide by zero. Bhaskara did correctly state other properties of zero, however, such as 02 = 0, and √0 = 0.\nPerhaps we should note at this point that there was another civilisation which developed a place-value number system with a zero. This was the Maya people who lived in central America, occupying the area which today is southern Mexico, Guatemala, and northern Belize. This was an old civilisation but flourished particularly between 250 and 900. We know that by 665 they used a place-value number system to base 20 with a symbol for zero. However their use of zero goes back further than this and was in use before they introduced the place-valued number system. This is a remarkable achievement but sadly did not influence other peoples.\nYou can see a separate article about Mayan mathematics.\nThe brilliant work of the Indian mathematicians was transmitted to the Islamic and Arabic mathematicians further west. It came at an early stage for al-Khwarizmi wrote Al\'Khwarizmi on the Hindu Art of Reckoning which describes the Indian place-value system of numerals based on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0. This work was the first in what is now Iraq to use zero as a place holder in positional base notation. Ibn Ezra, in the 12th century, wrote three treatises on numbers which helped to bring the Indian symbols and ideas of decimal fractions to the attention of some of the learned people in Europe. The Book of the Number describes the decimal system for integers with place values from left to right. In this work ibn Ezra uses zero which he calls galgal (meaning wheel or circle). Slightly later in the 12th century al-Samawal was writing:-\nIf we subtract a positive number from zero the same negative number remains. ... if we subtract a negative number from zero the same positive number remains.The Indian ideas spread east to China as well as west to the Islamic countries. In 1247 the Chinese mathematician Ch\'in Chiu-Shao wrote Mathematical treatise in nine sections which uses the symbol O for zero. A little later, in 1303, Zhu Shijie wrote Jade mirror of the four elements which again uses the symbol O for zero.\nFibonacci was one of the main people to bring these new ideas about the number system to Europe. As the authors of  write:-\nAn important link between the Hindu-Arabic number system and the European mathematics is the Italian mathematician Fibonacci.In Liber Abaci he described the nine Indian symbols together with the sign 0 for Europeans in around 1200 but it was not widely used for a long time after that. It is significant that Fibonacci is not bold enough to treat 0 in the same way as the other numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 since he speaks of the ""sign"" zero while the other symbols he speaks of as numbers. Although clearly bringing the Indian numerals to Europe was of major importance we can see that in his treatment of zero he did not reach the sophistication of the Indians Brahmagupta, Mahavira and Bhaskara nor of the Arabic and Islamic mathematicians such as al-Samawal.\nOne might have thought that the progress of the number systems in general, and zero in particular, would have been steady from this time on. However, this was far from the case. Cardan solved cubic and quartic equations without using zero. He would have found his work in the 1500\'s so much easier if he had had a zero but it was not part of his mathematics. By the 1600\'s zero began to come into widespread use but still only after encountering a lot of resistance.\nOf course there are still signs of the problems caused by zero. Recently many people throughout the world celebrated the new millennium on 1 January 2000. Of course they celebrated the passing of only 1999 years since when the calendar was set up no year zero was specified. Although one might forgive the original error, it is a little surprising that most people seemed unable to understand why the third millennium and the 21st century begin on 1 January 2001. Zero is still causing problems!\nReferences (14 books/articles)\nOther Web sites:\nAstroseti (A Spanish translation of this article)\nArticle by: J J O\'Connor and E F Robertson']"	['<urn:uuid:1e8f6a35-68d1-402d-b397-80544ed528ab>', '<urn:uuid:36642d73-15f0-4d00-b82d-f3e3fb3b1a60>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	12	103	3520
11	I'm curious about education - what does Swami Vivekananda say about it?	Swami Vivekananda emphasized that education should teach children self-control and how to manage their passions and prejudices. He believed it should instill worthy motives, religious feeling, and build character. Additionally, he stressed that education should help understand God's laws in nature and focus more on developing mental powers rather than just learning facts.	['विद्या ददाति विनयं विनयाद्याति पात्रताम् ।\nपात्रत्वाद्धनमाप्नोति धनाद्धर्मं ततः सुखम् ॥\nvidyā dadāti vinayam, vinayādyāti pātratām |\npātratvāddhanamāpnoti, dhanāddharmam tatah sukham ||\nKnowledge makes one humble, humility leads to worthiness,\nworthiness creates wealth and enrichment,\nenrichment leads to right conduct, right conduct brings joy and contentment.\nIf you studied Sanskrit in school, you would have surely come by this śloka from the Hitopadeśa (hita – beneficial, and upadeśa – advice). This ancient Sanskrit text is a collection of delightful stories where animals and humans interact and bring out a moral lesson, all in an engaging narrative that appeals to both children and adults.\nVidya – this term loosely translates into knowledge. The issue with the English language is that it is too restricted to describe such terms. The Upaniśads detail apara-vidya, or worldly knowledge, and para-vidya– or spiritual knowledge. Apara Vidya is what we try to acquire through our current educational system, and unfortunately, para vidya is largely ignored in this process.\nSwami Vivekānandā summarised his views on education as:\nEducation should teach our children self control, the art of holding one’s passions and prejudices.\nIt should instill true and worthy motives, a profound religious feeling and inspire the formation of a great character.\nIt should help us to understand the laws of God in nature and to shape our lives to be in consonance with those laws.\nIt should pay much greater attention to the development of the powers of the mind than mere learning of facts.\nRabindranath Tagore also believed that education should bring a student closer to realising the ultimate truth – with more emphasis on para-vidya.\nLearning how to lead a fruitful and content life, taking everyone else’s well-being into consideration, surely comes more handy than merely training to land a job. Something that cannot be covered by just one “moral-science” class. Making this process an integral part of the educational system is something that I would like to contribute my time to, in my own small way.\nVidya, or true knowledge, leads to vinayam, or humility. This humility comes from the realisation that we are a very small part of a much larger but inclusive whole, and that our hard-earned knowledge will be left back here when we are gone.\nThe intelligence that we end up being so proud about, is a mere speck of dust in the spectrum of cosmic intelligence.\nWatch a bird fly, a plant grow, bees building a hive, or a colony of ants working tirelessly – these are just small examples of how nature goes about it’s business without a book in hand and a lot of weight in the head!\nVinayādyāti pātratām – from humility comes worthiness or capability – something that makes you stand apart from a crowd. The Gurukula system of education was largely a one-to-one transmission between the Guru and shishya – or teacher and disciple.\nThe reason being that each shishya has his or her unique capability – a different level of understanding, skillset and inclination.\nWhen you address a crowd – it is usually to ensure that everybody understands everything – and hence comes down to the lowest common denominator. One cannot present higher ideas this way. Vinayam leads to higher capabilities – all under the guidance of an able Guru.\npātratvāddhanamāpnoti – higher capabilities lead to more wealth. In the current day context, the students who come first in the rat race end up getting admissions to premier universities, better first jobs, better pay and hence more wealth. Not necessarily happiness – but wealth, yes. Dhanam is to wealth as vidya is to knowledge.\nDhanam includes material, spiritual and emotional wealth, not just money.\nAs we have seen lately, fortunes can change in an instant, wealth can be eroded in minutes, but dhanam stays on.\ndhanāddharmam tatah sukham – True wealth leads to good deeds, and following dharma – which in turn leads to contentment and lasting joy. Contentment is a very relative word. You may be content in eating rice and lentils, someone else, on the other hand, may want richer food. One may be content with a fan in summer, another may be content just having electricity.\nयश्चेमां वसुधां कृत्स्नां प्रशासेदखिलां नृपः ।\nतुल्याश्मकाञ्चनो यश्च स कृतार्थो न पार्थिवः ॥\nyaścemāṃ vasudhāṃ kṛtsnāṃ praśāsedakhilāṃ nṛpaḥ ।\ntulyāśmakāñcano yaśca sa kṛtārtho na pārthivaḥ ॥\nA king who rules over the whole earth is not satisfied. But a sage for whom a piece of stone and gold are equal, is always content.\nOur aim of knowledge should be to work towards contentment, by being humble, by striving to become worthy, and by acquiring true wealth. This wealth cannot be stolen, nor destroyed – it grows when you do charity and is not burdensome to carry and maintain. Sounds like a good deal isn’t it?']	['<urn:uuid:590c7856-bd71-47d3-a460-010cc70e4e89>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	12	53	801

It features a square pyramid measuring 40 metres by 40, which once had a circular building on top that served as the principal temple.

The layout of the city and its buildings, both civil and religious, built of adobe and volcanic stone within the Historic Centre of Cajamarca, offer an exceptional testimony of Spanish-Andean culture. The architecture, which is unique and covers every century from the 16th to the 19th, makes the city centre of Cajamarca a monument of great cultural value. In the fifteenth century the city of Cajamarca became part of the Tawantinsuyo (Inca Empire) when the Kingdom of Cuismanco was conquered by the Inca Pachacutec. Cajamarca retained its importance since for the conquering incas it was considered to be ""head of a province"". A body of functionaries who controlled this vast and rich region of the empire resided here. From this period dates the ""Ransom Room"" which is still standing, and is the one remaining vestige of the lnca domination of Cajamarca. It was here that Atahualpa was held prisoner and also where he offered his Spanish captors the famous ransom of gold and silver in order to obtain his freedom. In the area around the Historic Centre of Cajamarca there are a number of archaeological monuments of exceptional historic importance. These are: THE TEMPLE 0F HUACALOMA (1500 BC). These remains lie 2 kilometres south east of the city and belong to a sanctuary with walls of stone or volcanic rock covered with white plaster. THE TEMPLE OF LAYZON. A ceremonial centre some 7 kilometres to the south west of Cajamarca. At the summit of the hill there is a square pyramid measuring 40 metres by 40, on top of which there once stood a circular building that was the principal temple. CUMBE MAYO. A group of archaeological remains which include a pre-Inca water channel and a variety of lithics. These lie amongst the slopes of the mountain known as ""Cumbe"". 14 kilometres to the south west of the city at 3,500 metres above sea level. THE ""VENTANILLAS"" (SMALL WINDOWS) OF OTUZCO. These are to be found 7 kilometres to the north east of the city and constitute a cemetery which is one of the most characteristic and special archaeological monuments of the area. These remains belong to what is known as ""Cajamarcan Culture"" (11th to the 15th centuries AD). SANTA APOLONIA. This hill lies 200 metres to the south of the Plaza de Armas (the principal square of the city) and at the top are to be found some carved stones known as ""The Seats of the Inca"". In fact they were sacrificial altars for agricultural religious rites in the pre-Inca period. Furthermore, mention must be made first of the thermal and medicinal waters to be found in ""Baiios del Inca"" (The Baths of the Inca) where there is to be found the ""Pool of the Inca"".

13	store bought mozzarella vs homemade which takes more time prepare	Store-bought mozzarella is more time-efficient as it arrives ready to use, while homemade mozzarella requires a lengthy 2-3 hour cooking process plus additional time for steps like heating milk to specific temperatures, cutting curds, draining whey, and stretching the cheese. The homemade process also requires precise pH monitoring to reach 5.2-5.3 before the cheese can be properly stretched.	['Fresh mozzarella sets your pizzeria apart\nScott Gittrich, president of Toppers Pizza, doesn’t mind his work commute.\nThat’s because since 1998, Whitewater, Wisconsin-based Toppers Pizza, which has 70 locations across 11 states, has used a local cheese company as its primary supplier and manufacturer for its mozzarella.\nLocated in Belgium, Wisconsin, the manufacturer receives milk from more than 130 local dairy farmers — the same farms Gittrich drives past.\n“When I hit the road I see the cows that are churning out the milk that ultimately becomes our cheese,” he says.\nToppers Pizza purchases an average of 40,000 pounds of mozzarella per week, with an excess of more than 160,000 pounds per month.\n“When I first got into the business, I didn’t have the knowledge and understanding of the delicate balance involved in crafting the perfect cheese. So, I leaned on Jeff (Jeff Hiller, president at Cedar Valley Cheese) and his team’s expertise,” Gittrich says.\nDeciding to bring fresh mozzarella production in-house or purchasing it from a supplier can be a make-or-break business decision. For Gittrich, it was an easy one. “As we expand, it’s good to know that our cheese partner is right down the road,” he says.\nJames Schroeder, chef /operating partner at Piezzetta Restaurant in Baltimore, Maryland, also purchases fresh hand-pulled mozzarella from a supplier.\n“We were in the process of opening a new restaurant with a new staff and decided that consistency was paramount,” he says. “Then we found a product that we really liked.”\nTwice weekly, shipments of plastic wrapped mozzarella arrive. “Because the cheese is wrapped instead of stored in liquid it’s a bit dryer, and I really like that,” says Schroeder.\nHe also finds fresh mozzarella melts differently than traditionally shredded mozzarella. “The moisture content and surface area is significantly different. The fresh mozzarella has a much creamier texture and flavor,” says Schroeder, who prefers to slice or tear fresh mozzarella very thin so it melts right into a pizza.\nMichael Pasquarello, chef/owner at Bufad in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, purchases fresh mozzarella simply because “If I don’t think I can make it better, I will buy it from someone who can,” Passquarello says. He uses a fior di latte mozzarella from a top-of-the-line manufacturer.\n“The cheesemakers are consistent while still having that small production quality,” he says.\nSome operators prefer making their own fresh mozzarella. For example, Fabrizio Cavallini, chef at Monello in San Diego, California, makes 20 mozzarellas twice a week. “We take pride in our Milanese culture. This was another perfect way to show off our culture,” he says.\nHis fresh mozzarella appears in a Caprese salad, pizza and in “carrozza,” which is a mozzarella sandwich dipped in yolks and lightly fried.\nPedro Arreaza, market sous chef at FarmTable Kitchen (part of Locale Market), based in St. Petersburg, Florida, assures that fresh mozzarella is not hard to make.\n“It’s a good idea to make it fresh, not only for the art of making mozzarella, but also because it looks really cool to customers,” he says. “People are more attracted to mozzarella when they see it being created. A lot of people have never seen that process done before.”\nFor his fresh mozzarella, Arreaza uses an all-natural curd from a supplier. He cuts the curd with a chitarra, a string tool shaped like a guitar. Then he adds salt and uses two stages of water. The first stage brings the curd to temperature. Then he drains about 90 percent of the water and leaves a bit of the brine in it. The final stage is stretching the mozzarella.\n“Once you add that second stage, it gets super soft and stretchable,” Arreaza says. “You can work the mozzarella together. I usually use a big wooden spoon to be able to pick it up and stretch it out. Once the mozzarella gets all bubbly, it is telling you that it is ready to be shaped.”\nArreaza has an ice bath waiting to shock the mozzarella. He adds a bit of salt to the ice bath to incorporate seasoning into the cheese.\nHe shapes the mozzarella into balls or logs wrapped in plastic wrap, making sure there isn’t too much air in the cheese. For logs, rolling the mozzarella naturally forms a log shape.\n“I tie the ends and submerge it in the ice bath for five to 10 minutes so it keeps its log shape. When they slice it for pizza, we want to have a nice, sliced round that melts well and gets a good color in the oven,” Arreaza says.\nIf you’re indecisive about whether to purchase or make your own fresh mozzarella, Pasquarello offers this recommendation: Make your own and buy some that inspires you. Then compare the two.\n“Don’t even think about making it for your customers until you can make it better than your favorite producer,” he says.\nMelanie Wolkoff Wachsman is a freelance writer in Louisville, Kentucky. She covers food, business and lifestyle trends.', 'This is a generic recipe for making Mozzarella using a thermophilic starter culture. Italian in origin, famed for its use in North American style pizza. Categorized as a fresh cheese as it is not really pressed or aged and thus not a hard cheese. You can eat the cheese the same day you make it. An interesting note about mozzarella is its ability to be frozen and stored for up to six months and then thawed and used, with little loss in flavor. Note, true Italian Mozzarella is made from Buffalo milk, however most mozzarella is made using skim cow’s milk. In reality you can use any type of milk, although the taste and texture will vary.\n- 1 US gallon cow’s milk.\n- Thermophilic Starter Culture.\n- Rennet, amount as per package directions or your experience.\n- Litmus paper or digital pH.\n- Heat the milk to 90 F / 32.5 C.\n- Add 2 oz. thermophilic culture.\n- Ripen the milk for 45-60 minutes.\n- Dissolve the 1/2 tab rennet into 4 tablespoons water and then stir into the milk for at least 5 minutes to ensure even distribution.\n- Let the milk set for 60 minutes.\n- Once the milk has set, cut it into 1/2 inch cubes.\n- Let it cook at 90 F / 32.5 C for another half hour.\n- Over the next half hour slowly raise the temperature of the curds to 105 F / 40.5 C.\n- Let it cook at 105 F / 40.5 C for another 5-10 minutes.\n- Drain the whey by pouring through a cheesecloth lined colander.\n- Place the curds into a double boiler with the bottom pot filled with water maintained at 105 F / 40.5 C.\n- You’ll need to periodically drain the whey while the curds are cooking.\n- Flip the curds periodically so they are evenly heated. They should mat together.\n- Let the curds cook at this temperature for 2-3 hours.\n- When the curds are done cooking test the pH, it should be 5.2-5.3.\n- If the pH isn’t 5.2-5.3, it won’t spin. Allow it to cook a little longer.\n- Cut the curd mass into 1/2 inch cubes.\n- Drain off any excess whey.\n- Place the curds directly into water that is 170 F / 76.5 C. Don’t overheat!!\n- Use two large wooden spoons and work the curds by pressing them together.\n- A ball of cheese will begin to form.\n- When the ball is the right size, take it out and work it with your hands, stretching the mass over itself.\n- Do this several times with each ball. If necessary the ball can be put back into the water to warm it up so that it can be stretched further.\n- Then immediately dunk the cheese into a cold saturated brine solution.\n- Let the cheese soak for 60 minutes.\n- The cheese can be eaten fresh, kept in plastic wrap in the refrigerator for about 10 days or frozen for several months. The cheese does taste better if it is allowed to rest in the refrigerator for 24 hours before eating.\nBy far the hardest step is the stretching, spinning step. If you just can’t get it to work right, you might try putting the cheese mass into a microwave at a low setting for several seconds. Warm it up, and then work it.']	['<urn:uuid:5156a588-a534-4516-b118-b1dd691d9ea3>', '<urn:uuid:96b3e89d-e9a7-4c1b-8cdf-02dd4d09bb0f>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	10	58	1395

Laura Zeng (USA) of USA competes using the ball. REUTERS/Ruben Sprich\nSince she started training as a rhythmic gymnast at the age of seven, America\'s Laura Zeng has come to realise that most people in her country do not know much about her sport.\nThe 21-year-old competed at the 2016 Rio Olympics, is a six-time national champion and is her country\'s best shot at a medal in rhythmic gymnastics at the Tokyo Olympics.\nBut there is little fanfare, or funding, for rhythmic gymnastics in the United States.\nSo Zeng and her team mates have turned to social media to rally fans, inform the public and keep up with what the competition is up to ahead of the Games.\n""Social media has helped rhythmic gymnastics expand not just in the United States but globally as well,"" Zeng said.\n""Why would you put your kid in something that won\'t pay dividends? If you do artistic gymnastics you know there\'s many different routes that you could go.""\nUSA Gymnastics has ramped up its marketing and support of rhythmic gymnastics, even running a video series on Instagram to help explain the sport to a broader audience.\n""The number of rhythmic members has fluctuated over the last several years, but from the 2014-15 season to the 2019-20 season, there was a total increase of more than 34% in rhythmic members,"" a spokeswoman for the organisation said.\nHowever, artistic gymnast Nastia Liukin said rhythmic gymnastics had a perception problem.\n""It\'s just not as popular as artistic,"" said the 2008 Beijing Olympics all-around champion.

Is that the thing with the ribbons?\'"" she said.\n""Letting people know that it\'s not just running around with a ribbon like a headless chicken would be kind of nice.""\nAn Olympic medal event since 1984, rhythmic gymnastics is performed in individual and group competitions using hoops, balls, clubs and ribbons.\nGymnasts are judged on several factors, including how they use the apparatus - throws, tosses, spins and catches, for instance. They are also marked on ""body difficulties"" such as balances, turns, and jumps, as well as execution and artistry.\nEastern European countries have invested more heavily in rhythmic gymnastics than the United States and the sport has been popular in former Soviet states for decades.\nThanks to strong support and infrastructure, Eastern European rhythmic gymnasts have been more able to train and compete domestically during the COVID-19 pandemic, a definite advantage over their U.S. counterparts.\n""It\'s a huge thing, the inequality of the sport, if you compare its popularity here in the United States versus in Eastern European countries,"" Zeng said.\nZeng has cultivated an Instagram following of nearly 16,000 but that figure pales in comparison to the roughly 340,000 followers of Russian twins Dina and Arina Averina, who are expected to vie for gold and silver in Tokyo.\nIsrael\'s Linoy Ashram, another medal chance, has more than 60,000 followers.\nStill, this is the first time the United States has been able to send a full delegation of rhythmic gymnasts to the Olympics since the Games included the group competition in 1996.\n""With a chance to make the finals, we\'re really a sport to watch,"" Zeng said.\nReporting by Richa Naidu; Editing by Peter Rutherford\nJPMorgan takes on British rivals with launch of digital bank Chase\n267 individuals prosecuted for violating Covid-19 precautionary measures\nPrince Andrew is served accuser\'s sexual assault lawsuit in United States\nOutsourcing Medical Technologists for Vacant Jobs in Qatar\nPfizer: Know all about the Covid-19 vaccine and its usage in Qatar\nFIFA’22 over Covid-19: Qatar limbers up for the World Cup amidst a worldwide pandemic\nTop 5 Art Galleries You Must Explore in Qatar\nAfghan Women Speaks on Unyielding Hope of Restoring Their Homeland']"	['<urn:uuid:92e96a9b-5cff-4cfb-9bdb-1173be326eac>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	9	10	716

16	I need equipment that can handle different types of liquids - how do the liquid handling capabilities compare between modern farm sprayers and the Type III fire engine system?	Both systems are versatile in liquid handling but with different specializations. Farm sprayers are designed primarily for pesticides and agricultural chemicals, requiring precise calibration and specialized nozzles to control droplet size and minimize drift during application. The Type III fire engine, on the other hand, has a more diverse liquid handling system with a 516-gallon UPF Poly Tank that can handle water, gel, and foam, featuring built-in gel mixing capability and a compressed air foam injection system option. It also includes multiple discharge points: three 2.5-inch discharges, two 1.5-inch overhead cross lays, and a front-mounted water canon with remote control capabilities.	"['You are here\nFarm Sprayers Overview\nWhile sprayers were once a niche product, today sprayers have become an essential piece of farm equipment for effective crop production. By properly applying chemicals to control weeds, insects, and diseases, you give your crop the best chance for high yields.\nThe uptick in self-propelled sprayer ownership started in 2005 when there was an increase in Asian soybean rust and farmers needed to have a sprayer available to make timely fungicide applications. Guidance systems and advanced controls have also made sprayers much easier to operate, contributing to the acceleration of on-farm sprayers.\nOn this page, you’ll find maintenance information, spraying tips, a listing of ag sprayer manufacturers, and details on self-propelled sprayers as well as ATV sprayers.\nFirst and foremost, you need to make sure your sprayer is in top condition before spring and then maintain your sprayer throughout the growing season.\nSprayer maintenance includes checking fluid levels, greasing necessary components, calibrating the sprayer monitor, and more. This sprayer maintenance checklist breaks down what you need to do before you start spraying as well as daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance upkeep during the season.\nAt the end of the year, it’s important to do one final round of maintenance to winterize your sprayer. This will help protect your sprayer from frost damage and make sure it’s ready to go for the next year. This article gives five tips for winterizing your sprayer, including flushing the system, scrutinizing the exterior, and cleaning the cab.\nThere are multiple steps you can take each time you spray to optimize efficiency and minimize off-target drift. It’s essential to read the label, pick the best spray nozzle, calibrate your sprayer, and check wind speed. You should also use a spray-pattern check to make sure you have the right nozzle spacing and boom height. Get more spraying tips in this article on 16 steps to better spraying.\nThere is a small margin of error when it comes to spraying pesticides, both for increasing efficiency and protecting neighboring fields. For more effective and safe spraying, remember that small drops take time to hit the target, droplet size depends on pressure, small droplets dry quickly, and that nozzles produce a variety of droplet sizes.\nIn 1947, Ray Hagie, founder of Hagie Manufacturing, invented the world’s first self-propelled sprayer. This revolutionary piece of equipment would change how farmers and professional applicators apply pesticides. Today, self-propelled sprayers make up the majority of the farm spraying market, having largely replaced pull-type sprayers.\nSprayers continue to get more sophisticated with advanced technology like auto guidance, auto shutoffs, and Y-Drop. In this article, Illinois farmer Jeff Brown details how he uses technology to ensure that every drop applied to his plants is delivered when and where the plant needs it most.\nIf you’re in the market for a late-model self-propelled sprayer, be warned that low-hour sprayers are bringing higher prices on dealer lots and at auctions. Successful Farming’s 2018 price projection for 3- to 4-year old sprayers shows a 4% increase. See more late-model, low-hour equipment price projections in our latest Machinery Insider column.\nAgricultural Sprayer Manufacturers\nA number of equipment manufacturers make self-propelled sprayers, including John Deere, Hagie, Hardi, Case IH, New Holland, AGCO, and Equipment Technologies.\nIn 2017, John Deere introduced a 123-foot, carbon-fiber boom – its widest boom to date. The new boom was accompanied by the freshly designed CommandView III Cab, which features a hydro handle joystick, a 4600 Command Center display, and a redesigned CommandARM.\nNew Holland, AGCO, Hardi, and Equipment Technologies also introduced new sprayer models last year. New Holland introduced the Guardian SP310F and Miller Nitro 7310 – the first since New Holland acquired Miller-St. Nazianz. AGCO unleashed the RoGator C series with Liquid Logic, which helps to reduce off-target applications. Hardi came out with the Rubicon 9000. The 380-hp. Rubicon 9000 has a 2,200-gallon payload and booms up to 160 feet to cover 330 acres per hour. Last, Equipment Technologies reengineered its self-propelled hydrostatic sprayers for the North American market.\nAt the end of 2016, John Deere and Hagie introduced the STS16 – the first product collaboration between the companies since Deere’s acquisition of Hagie. The 2017 STS16 features a 9-liter John Deere PowerTech PSS engine.\nFor field borders, pastures, fence lines, and other hard-to-spray areas, ATV sprayers are ideal for spot spraying. These sprayers can come equipped with a spray wand or a boom, depending on the location you’re spraying. There are multiple options available for ATV boom sprayers, such as a steel, poly, or versatile boom.\nBefore you buy an ATV sprayer, consider how frequently you will use the sprayer, where you will spray, and how much you’d like to spend. This buyers’ guide gives advice on key ATV sprayer features, including pumps, drainable tanks, seat pressure control, and liftability.', 'Presentation on theme: ""Light Weight Type III Engine 4x4 Brush & Structure Highway & Off Road Rapid Response Fire Engine INSTRUCTIONS: Press the Up & Right arrow keys to move.""— Presentation transcript:\nLight Weight Type III Engine 4x4 Brush & Structure Highway & Off Road Rapid Response Fire Engine INSTRUCTIONS: Press the Up & Right arrow keys to move forward and Down & Left back.

17	How does cat brain research aid software development, and what tools make this possible?	Cat brain research contributes valuable data for neuroscience software development as cats are well-studied higher vertebrates with brains similar to primates (except frontal lobes). The data management and analysis is facilitated through neuroinformatics tools like database integration, image analysis, and computer simulation. For instance, there are systems like WordPress-based databases with SQL integration for storing neural activity data, while specialized neuroinformatics software helps create consistent terminology formats and enables data sharing across research institutions.	['Session 407 – Cortical Planning and Execution: Animal Neurophysiology\n407.01 / DP09/LL2 – An open database of cat neuronal activity\n|November 13, 2017, 1:00 – 5:00 PM||Halls A-C|\nPoster Type: Dynamic Poster\nPresenter at Poster: Mon, Nov. 13, 2017, 1:00 PM – 5:00 PM\nSession Type: Poster\nGrant Support: Barrow Neurological Foundation, a group of private donors\nAuthors: I.A. NALL1, I. BRAVERMAN1, J. T. GOODROAD1, F. FLORES1, F. JOHNSON1, A. RIVARD1, *I. N. BELOOZEROVA2\n1Arizona State Univ., Tempe, AZ; 2Neurobio., Barrow Neurolog. Inst., Phoenix, AZ\nAbstract: The cat is one of the best researched higher vertebrates. It is a model animal for studies of several common diseases. Except for the frontal lobes, cat brain is quite similar to the brain of primates. It is well studied but yet little understood. To promote understanding of the brain in general, we have created an open database of cat brain neuronal activity during various behaviors to allow all interested parties to search and analyze available cat brain data.\nWe formed a back-end system that utilizes the existing front-end functionality of WordPress, an open-source content management system, which is based on PHP scripting language and also uses an attached SQL relational database management system. We have merged that SQL with our custom MySQL database to act as our main data repository. With our interface and general functions, such as file-uploading, being handled by WordPress, we focused on modifying the system to make it better tailored to our requirements. We created a series of custom plugins, themes, scripts and widgets to allow for: (i) unique multi-data-point searching first through “AND” and then “OR”, (ii) varied searches that use both user-created and system-generated tags; (iii) increased data variety and consistency, with full data manipulation; and (iv) an administration layer, which allows admins to approve and monitor users.\nIn this dynamic poster, we will demonstrate the central features of the database: general searching, easy access to data, and data management. We will perform sample searches in response to attendees’ requests. By the time of the meeting, the database will contain ~500 GB of data on single neuron activity in the cat motor cortex and motor thalamus during overground locomotion with and without obstacles. Both raw and processed records will be available. Neuron identification, including data on axonal projections and conduction properties obtained in live subjects will be available. Approximate location of cell bodies within the structure determined by histology will be available. All data will be accompanied with behavioral data on task performance.\nThe cat brain database is started with data on locomotion collected in the laboratory of Dr. Beloozerova since 2000 as a part of NIH funded research. Later, data on cat brain activity during treadmill locomotion, balancing, and scratching will be added. Three-dimensional kinematic data on all behaviors will be added. The database is open to other laboratories for depositing their data on cat brain activity and body biomechanics. By making the data publicly available we seek to facilitate further research of the cat brain, which ultimately will lead to better understanding of human brain.\nDisclosures: I.A. Nall: None. I.

Beloozerova: None.', 'Neuroinformatics is an interdisciplinary research field focused on data structure and software tools to identify, analyze, model, organize and share neuroscience data. Neuroinformatics applies neuromorphic engineering, computational neuroscience and ontologies to neuroscience databases to integrate, visualize and quantify neuroscience research.\nWhat is Neuroinformatics?\nResearch in neuroinformatics extends to theory and methodology, including discussions on computational modeling approaches, database design, analytical tools, meta-analysis, and data sharing. Experimental data is vast in the heterogeneous field of neuroscience, and the integration and analysis of these increasingly large-volume, high-dimensional data sets necessitates neuroinformatics to further our understanding of the nervous system.\nNeuroinformatics is at the crossroads of neuroscience and information science. Neuroscience research contains many different sub-disciplines that analyze data from multiple levels of the brain, and information science is concerned with the collection, classification, and dissemination of information, among other things. To solve increasingly complex problems, clinicians and research scientists use computational tools, mathematical models, and neuroinformatic databases provided by neuroinformaticians to collaborate, share information, and quantitatively confirm working theories.\nWhat are some Fields Related to Neuroinformatics?\nNeuroinformatics is primarily concerned with the development of tools and databases for the management, analysis, modeling and sharing of neuroscience data. However, there are many scientific applications that benefit from this organizational and quantitative approach, also bringing valuable insights to neuroscience. Notably:\n- Computer Science – Computational models of neuronal systems\n- Experimental Psychology – Cognitive data, emotion and language\n- Medicine – Aging and mental diseases like depression and anxiety\n- Engineering – Brain-Computer Interface technology\n- Chemistry – Atomic structure of the nervous system\n- Mathematics – Quantifying neuronal differentiation and other neural models\n- Physical Sciences – Physical processes within neural cells and neuronal networks\n- Biology – Chemical processes and molecular structure\nWhat is the Connection Between Computational Neuroscience and Neuroinformatics?\nComputational neuroscience is the study of the development, structure, physiology, information processing and cognitive abilities of the nervous system. Computational neuroscientists employ neuromorphic engineering and other tactics to understand how the brain processes information, and informatics helps accelerate this neuroscientific discovery.\nNeuroinformatics tools like image analysis, computer simulation and database integration help facilitate neural modeling and collaboration in the field of computational neuroscience. The nature of this sub-discipline of neuroscience is primarily quantitative, so neuroinformatics is beneficial in the organization and analysis of data derived from computational research. Computational neuroscience differs in more qualitative experiments such as finding the optimal design of nervous systems or exploring various neural connectivity schemes in model networks.\nWhat is Neuroinformatics Software?\nNeuroinformatics software is primarily concerned with applying computer science to build databases, tools and networks for neuroscience research. Some neuroinformatics software applications are involved with structuring data to create consistent terminology and formats for the sharing of data; BrainML for example is a system that provides a standardized XML metaformat.\nNeuroinformatics integration software is also common. For example the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN) is a grid system for neuroscience where shared resources, services, interfaces and databases can be virtually distributed into a single environment. BIRN was formed to advance the diagnosis and treatment of disease.\nThe Neocortical Microcircuit Database (NMDB) is a large collection of brain data from the cellular level to complex structures. This database software acts similarly to open source software, as researchers can add to and edit the database.\nThe other main purpose of neuroinformatics software is the analysis and modeling of neuronal systems. For example the Budapest Reference Connectome is an online 3D brain model that can be used to visualize connections in the human brain. It was aggregated from the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 477 people as part of the Human Connectome Project.\nWhere Will Neuroinformatics Lead Us?\nThe evolution of neuroinformatics has fueled confidence in the neuroscience industry to invest in brain research projects with increasing budgets. Advanced neuroinformatics tools invented in the past five to ten years have led to a more accurate understanding of the structure and function of the brain, and the future of neuroinformatics will continue to have an important influence on neuroscience research.\nThe era of neuroscience big data is upon us, and the massive amounts of multi-modal neuroimaging data and dynamic methodologies aggregating across institutions requires innovative integrations that will put pressure on neuroinformatics to expand. Beyond integrations, future use cases will likely expand on data archiving, data processing and data mining, among other applications.\nDoes EMOTIV Offer Products for Neuroinformatics?\nEMOTIV offers innovative neuroinformatics tools for neuroscientists and clinicians to accelerate their research. For example the EMOTIV BrainViz is a real time 3D brain visualization software for neuroscience education and exhibitions. Real time display of brain dynamics is perfect for demonstrations, presentations and educational uses.\nEMOTIV also offers the award-winning EMOTIV PRO integrated software solution for neuroscience research and education. EMOTIV PRO is a neuroinformatics software tool for EEG data acquisition, event marking, analysis and data storage for professional brain research and education using any of our advanced EEG headsets.']	['<urn:uuid:12528ac6-49f7-46ba-9db5-e1303993db76>', '<urn:uuid:c91959a5-1dd7-4bd7-8eb3-bd35ec12b82b>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	14	74	1353
18	power generation storage tech comparison flywheel battery	In terms of power generation storage technologies, flywheel energy storage systems offer several advantages over battery storage: they have enhanced ability to meet high-power needs, lower lifetime costs, can operate in a large ambient operating temperature range, and have no recycling issues that could arise with battery technology. For comparison, battery-based storage systems are commonly used in micro hydro installations where power is generated at a steady rate and stored in a battery bank, enabling power usage at rates much higher than generation rates.	['We recently returned from a quick three-day, ~950-mile jaunt through the Bakken/PRB. Our trip, while educational, was cut short due to weather gremlins. In fact, we witnessed first-hand operations being suspended with some companies incurring shutdowns for 1-2 days due to North Dakota high winds. Below is a quick recap of our observations. Looking ahead, this week kicks of Q1 earnings season with HAL, BKR, SLB and CLB all reporting.\nBakken/PRB Observations. Shortened meeting schedule due to winter conditions and significant driving time, but our visits with local service companies reveal consistent expectations. First, completion activity is expected to remain stable with estimated Bakken frac crews hovering around ~10 fleets. Contacts generally don’t see much near-term improvement with local prophesies calling for ~10-12 fleets throughout the balance of the year. Consequently, our completion-oriented contacts see little near-term change. Well servicing contacts, meanwhile, are more optimistic with utilization for one company hovering near ~100% and another company stating activity levels are at pre-covid levels. Robust production-oriented work drives the high utilization with both companies now operating multiple production rigs on a 24-hour basis. Looking ahead, one company sees at least a 10% improvement in its rig hours during Q2. Efforts to move pricing are underway, a necessary process as labor challenges are growing (as is crew poaching). Both well service contacts were forced to shut down rigs due to high winds while weather-related incidents such as vehicle accidents were reported. Don’t be surprised to hear companies with Bakken/PRB exposure call out weather issues for Q2. Drilling activity is also expected to nudge higher as one drilling contact will soon reactivate an incremental rig to the basin. And while some may laugh that it’s just one rig, recall the Bakken rig count (per BKR) stands at just ~15 rigs so small increases matter. Lastly, there is local chatter of potentially three Wyoming in-basin sand mines in development.\nEmerging Sand Storage System. Our North Dakota tour included a site visit to a rail terminal as well as an eight-well pad not too far from the Watford City area. The purpose was to learn more about SmartSand’s emerging SmartPath technology, the company’s loading system used to deliver sand to its SmartDepot storage system. SmartPath was originally designed in 2019, but the system we toured is what we describe as version 2.0. Notably, SND invested more R&D to refine the product’s capabilities with the upgraded version now feeding three silos simultaneously versus two previously. Dust controls appear to be enhanced with management believing SmartPath’s dust mitigation efforts are superior to most competitive systems. We cannot validate the relative comparisons, but we can attest to seeing essentially no dust, a noteworthy observation particularly when wind gusts the day of our tour exceed 20+ mph. Also, we can attest to the fact that little loose sand was found in/near the entry point into the SmartPath feeding system. Another item which we found noteworthy is the system’s ability to run on electric while it can also operate on traditional diesel via its Tier 4 engine.\nWhile the SmartDepot storage system has less storage capacity than other systems (200 tons) per silo, the belly dump offload capability allows for fast unloading (roughly 7 minutes/trailer with driver not getting out of truck). Moreover, in North Dakota and Wyoming larger trailers historically tied to the grain industry are used for sand transport to the SmartPath/SmartDepot system. These trailers hold as much as 35 tons, more than the 20-25 tons associated with other delivery methods. The SmartPath system itself can hold upwards of 35 tons, a benefit should delays associated with trucking logistics exist. We do note that SmartSand does not own its own logistics fleet, but instead contracts with third party providers. This operating strategy differs somewhat from some of the existing competition.\nIn the case of the job we toured, Lobo Logistics managed the sand logistics, employing its 35-ton Haul-MAX trailer. This trailer, we believe, is unique to the North Dakota and Wyoming market as the state as more flexible trailer weight restrictions. We believe the weight limit in North Dakota is ~105,000 pounds and Wyoming is ~117,000 pounds. A key benefit of Haul-MAX is reduced truck loads which, in turn, reduces the number miles driven and diesel consumed. For example, Lobo contends in a case study that use of its system reduced those metrics by nearly 30%. This would imply positive ESG considerations due to less emissions and less road traffic. Moreover, the belly-dump nature allows for quick turns which is a benefit to drivers who get paid based on the number of loads/day. We did update with Lobo during our trip and learned the company does not necessarily standardize on the Haul-MAX. In other markets it will work with competing systems. One data point we found commendable is the fact the company has a TRIR of zero since inception.\nSmartSand’s foray into the last mile business began with its purchase of Quickthree Solutions in 2018. It is our impression the company’s push into last mile has been slower than originally intended, a combination of the time to R&D the system as well as the consequence of the 2020 industry malaise. Now, however, the reinvigorated SmartPath design is operating in the field with the first newly upgraded system commencing work this quarter. Initial customer feedback is positive as third-party contacts report a much improved product over the initial design. This is important as SmartSand faces significant competition as larger players with sizeable as well as established positions presently dominate the last mile segment. These include Solaris, SandBox (SLCA), Hi-Crush, PropX, Sand Revolution, TSS, Catapult, CIG Logistics, among others.\nAs with other product-specific comments we have written about in recent months, our thoughts on SmartPath are not an endorsement. Rather, we appreciate the opportunity to learn about new products coming to market as such products have the potential to be market disruptive.\nFlywheel Energy Storage System. Efforts to reduce emissions and improve one’s ESG profile is generally associated with public companies whose shareholders are increasingly focused on ESG. Conventional wisdom typically holds that private companies are less concerned about ESG, largely because they are private. That said, during our Gillette meetings we caught up with Cyclone Drilling, primarily to hear their land drilling perspectives. However, in our meeting we were surprised to hear how serious the company is taking emission reductions. By way of background, Cyclone has been in business since 1975. The company was founded by James Hladky, but is now run by his two sons. At its peak, Cyclone owned/operated 28 rigs, but during the 2015/2016 downturn, Cyclone scrapped 14 rigs as it focused on its newer generation equipment. Today, the company is running 6 of its 14 rigs with active rigs drilling in Utah, Oklahoma, Colorado, Wyoming and North Dakota. The company’s foray into Utah and Oklahoma are relatively new events. What is interesting, however, is of the six rigs, two are powered off the grid while another three rigs are running on dual fuel. In terms of outlook, Cyclone sees rising inquiries with many companies looking for rigs in the June timeframe. Based on current discussions, the company’s rig count should improve to ~10-12 rigs by YE with most of the incremental rigs expected to go to the PRB/Bakken.\nWhile Cyclone’s activity outlook is encouraging, we were more interested in the company’s R&D efforts to reduce emissions. Specifically, the company is working with KRW Technologies/Avid Controls to develop a flywheel energy storage system. Prior to our trip, we had never heard of the flywheel concept (for drilling applications), so a quick internet search and YouTube video review helped us gain a modicum of knowledge. We also posed questions to both the designer and Cyclone. Simplistically, the flywheel system under development is an energy storage system, much like that of the battery storage system which tends to get more publicity. The purported benefits of the flywheel system include: (1) an enhanced ability to meet the high-power needs of a drilling rig; (2) lower costs over the life of the system; (3) ability to operate in a large ambient operating temperature; and (4) no recycling issues which could arise with battery technology. The flywheel system which Cyclone intends to deploy will feature a 2.9 MW rating and will be a single cell device which should lead to better reliability.\nCyclone’s desire to use the flywheel system is based on a belief it can optimize engine efficiency, generating better fuel economies assuming a steady engine load. It hopes to achieve “peak shavings” whereby it takes the peaks out of demand on the generator. If memory serves correct, once peak shavings are achieved, the rig can run 100% on natural gas. At this point, it’s hard to pass judgment on the merits of this technology as Cyclone has yet to deploy its first system and we haven’t seen it operate in person yet. That will occur later in Q2, so we’ll check in on the product benefits once field trials have occurred.\nBKR U.S. Land Rig Count. The BKR U.S. land rig count gained another 5 rigs this week and now stands at 426 rigs. Gains have been achieved in 30 of the past 31 weeks.\nDEP Upcoming Events: We are starting to populate the calendar for this summer. Targeting a theme of baseball, good food and good wine.

Micro hydro is making a comeback for electricity generation in homes.\nMicro hydro, or small-scale hydro, is one of the most environmentally benign energy conversion options available, because unlike large-scale hydro power, it does not attempt to interfere significantly with river flows.\nWe offer a variety of small hydroelectric generators that are designed to be 12, 24, or 48 volt battery chargers, operating off a relatively small volume of water. They charge batteries 24 hours per day. As little as a 10 foot head of water can supply a steady charge to a battery bank. A small hydroelectric system is an excellent match with solar modules, both charging the same batteries. When it’s rainy and the solar modules are performing at their low point, the hydroelectric system will be at its peak, and vise versa.\nHow much power can you generate?\nThat depends on the dynamic head, the amount of water flow and the efficiency of the turbine/generator combination. To get an idea about available power in watts, multiply the head in feet, times flow in GPM, times 0.18 times efficiency. Turbine efficiency ranges from 25% to 50%, use 0.30 as an average for efficiency.\nIf you think you have a suitable site for Micro Hydro power, we can help you determine the best unit for the situation.\nThis is an example of a 12 volt , 60 amp micro hydro system. The compact unit produces power as long as the water flows. The unit shown is operating with approximately 90 feet of vertical hydraulic head (40 PSI) and the tail stock water exits are clearly visible. This unit is working with two inlets being powered and some units can be operated with four jets at very low hydraulic head. One unit has recently been installed with under 10 feet of head. The system is easy to install with minimum working knowledge of PVC piping and basic DC wiring techniques. It runs 24 hours a day, quietly sending power to whatever electrical needs you may have – usually charging batteries to power AC inverters.\nA few words about the “stream engine”. The micro hydro permanent magnet alternator and housing are manufactured in Canada by Energy Systems and Design. As the only moving parts of this alternator are the three sealed ball bearings, the life expectancy of this unit is far greater than that of the conventional brush type alternators used in the past. The machine is equipped with a turgo turbine wheel with rugged bronze construction. This design allows the use of high flows at low heads.\nOutput up to I kW and higher is possible in battery based power systems.\nPower is generated at a steady rate and stored in a battery bank. This enables the power to be used at rates much higher than at which it is generated. During times of low demand the power is stored. An inverter is used in systems when AC power is desired. The engine is located at the end of the pipeline near the stream and flows can be a few gallons per minute (gpm) or as high as hundreds of gpm. The water passes through a nozzle that increases its velocity as it exits, and then it strikes the turbine runner, which is connected to the generator shaft. Nozzle inserts from a half inch to 1 inch diameter can be used, and up to four nozzles can be installed in one machine. Micro hydro systems have come a long way as a cost-effective way to create electrical energy for remote living.\nHere’s a “stream engine” installation (below right) that replaced the older water powered generator (below left). The smaller and more efficient “Stream Engine” has been humming away flawlessly for a couple of years and never misses a beat.']	['<urn:uuid:7312c569-d689-44ba-b97c-58f40142bd12>', '<urn:uuid:91cafa84-8d99-41eb-9339-0e77c4ab955f>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	7	84	2314
19	I want to see sharks in Mexico. When can I visit Guadalupe Island?	Isla Guadalupe is only accessible for three months a year, from August to October. It's one of only four places on the planet where you can safely see Great White Sharks, with visibility often reaching up to 45 meters.	['Beautiful beaches, tacos and tequila, mariachis, and ancient civilisations are some of the things Mexico is best known for. But did you know that this Latin American country is also a goldmine for divers looking to find rare species underwater? With six natural UNESCO World Heritage Sites and a strategic location for marine activity, here’s our pick of the 7 best diving destinations in Mexico.\nDiving Destinations in Mexico\nYou may already be familiar with these natural wonders if you’ve been planning your trip to Riviera Maya, but do you know just how unique they are? Cenotes are deep water cavern-like sinkholes, with a surface opening created by natural collapse. They are filled only with rainwater and underground rivers, so their constant water temperature makes diving here possible all year long.\nUnlike the rest of the dive sites on this list, Cenotes are not go-to locations when searching for fauna diversity. Instead, you will find geological formations worthy of bringing your GoPro for this one-of-a-kind experience. Still waters, prehistoric fossils, and almost holy-looking lighting shooting in from above might make you feel like time has stopped while you explore these sites.\n2. Cabo Pulmo National Park\nDescribed by Dr. Sylvia Earle as a conservation model to the world, Cabo Pulmo became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005 due to an amazing turnaround from the neglect and pollution that the area was under before the 1980s. The local community, seeing their loss, forced government action that has now achieved the largest increase in biomass known in any protected area in the world.\nHome to over 6,000 marine species and one of the only three living coral reefs in North America, Cabo Pulmo is an incredible diving destination that hosts both large fish and macro life for those seeking to make it a photography adventure.\nThe best season to visit is August to November. This is when the waters are warmer and large schools of Groupers join Jackfish tornados for mesmerising underwater moments. Turtle and Shark sightings are also common, and you might catch Mobula Rays roaming those areas as well.\n3. Cabo San Lucas UNESCO Marine Park\nLocated where the Pacific Ocean meets the Sea of Cortez, Cabo San Lucas was named “The World’s Aquarium” by none other than Jacques Cousteau.\nEels, Nudibranchs, Stingrays, schools of Grunts and Jackfish, Seahorses, Lobsters,\nAngelfish, and Sea Lions are some of the regularly spotted species inhabiting these extraordinary waters. During the late autumn and spring seasons, Cabo San Lucas becomes the courting and breeding ground for Mobula Rays, a spectacle of flipping and splashing that has not been witnessed anywhere else in the world.\nCabo, as it’s popularly known, is also special for its sand falls. This is a tectonic phenomenon only present in a handful of places on the planet. Sand falls literally look like underwater cascades, so you might feel like you’re living in a Stranger Things episode while diving here. As cool as it gets, right?\nAdventurous diver tip: if you’re a big pelagic fan, you might not want to miss out on Gordo Banks. Just outside Los Cabos, this dive site is famous for its schools of Hammerhead Sharks. You can also expect the occasional sightings of the area’s big guys: Mako Sharks, Tuna, Manta Rays, and even Whales.\n4. Isla Guadalupe\nIsla Guadalupe is a small volcanic island situated 240km off the coast of Baja California. It’s also one of the only four places on the planet where Great White Sharks can be (safely!) seen by humans.\nFamous for being the top destination for Great White encounters, with visibility often going up to 45 meters. This cage diving experience is a must for true Shark lovers who want to finally meet up close with one of the ocean’s top predators.\nThis remote location is only accessible via liveaboard and for three months a year (August to October). The good news? You don’t need to be a scuba diver to see these bad boys, so it can easily turn into a family trip while on holidays!\nCozumel is one of the all-time classics when it comes to diving in Mexico. With easy access from Playa del Carmen, it’s a very laid-back destination where you can enjoy resting at beautiful beach resorts in between dives.\nWhat made Cozumel so popular is still very much alive to this day. Beautiful corals and a variety of species give life to its wonderful marine ecosystem, and they can be enjoyed by divers of all levels.\nDrift dives, wall dives and reef dives will keep you entertained during the whole trip, with Eagle Rays, Nurse Sharks and lots of tropical fish making an appearance in your underwater photos. Beware though: divers have reported feeling like they’re in a National Geographic film.\nThe best time to visit? All year round! Cozumel’s water temperature and visibility maintain great conditions throughout the year, so it’s an easy destination for impromptu getaways.\n6. Banco Chinchorro\nOne of the best places to dive in the whole Northern Hemisphere is this Biosphere Reserve. Banco Chinchorro is the biggest atoll in Mexico, and it’s actually home to numerous dive sites. Its west side is suitable for all levels, with colorful reefs protected from the open ocean. Its east side is packed with over 200 wreck sites, some of which are inaccessible even for seasoned divers due to heavy surf conditions.\nWith year-long great diving possibilities, you can visit Banco Chinchorro to encounter Hawksbill, Green and Loggerhead Turtles, Barracudas, Eagle Rays, Nurse Sharks, Reef Sharks, Green Morey Eels, Jackfish, Blue and Midnight Parrotfish, and different species of Groupers.\nLife is plentiful in this unspoiled reserve, and shipwrecks are home to numerous smaller species and gorgeous setups. Yet one of its main attractions continues to be swimming with Crocodiles! Although this isn’t precisely diving, people visit Banco Chinchorro as one of the few places in the world to encounter the American Crocodile. So, if you’re the fearless kind, don’t miss out on an experience to remember…\n7. Socorro Island & the Revillagigedos\nA pelagic lover’s paradise, Socorro Island is a hub for marine life in the Pacific Ocean. Offshore and protected from human life (only accessible via liveaboard), it attracts some of the most sought-after animals in the diving world, including the Humpback Whale.\nBottlenose Dolphins are friendly enough to approach divers, and Sharks from seven different species populate these waters, including the biggest fish in the sea. The Whale Shark. Hammerheads, Whitetips, Silvertips and Galapagos Sharks regularly join Manta Rays and large schools of fish. It makes diving in Socorro simply unforgettable.\nBut what makes Socorro truly unique is being the breeding ground for Humpback Whales. Thousands of them make their journey through these waters from January to April. So it give divers a great chance to see them thrive underwater. Don’t miss the opportunity to swim with these majestic mammals!']	['<urn:uuid:e823b607-82e8-4bec-b57b-f0e349c4e1d0>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	13	39	1149
20	us civil war first major mainland conflict distance washington dc participants	The first major land battle of the American Civil War was fought at Manassas railroad junction, approximately 30 miles southwest of Washington, D.C. The battle involved General Irvin McDowell's Army of Northeastern Virginia against Confederate forces led by Joseph Johnston (who had arrived from the Shenandoah Valley) and Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard.	"['150 years ago today, the first major land battle of the American Civil War was fought outside the Manassas railroad junction, roughly 30 miles southwest of Washington, D.C. General Irvin McDowell\'s Army of Northeastern Virginia met the Confederate forces of Joseph Johnston, freshly arrived from the Shenandoah Valley, and Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard, and a fierce and confusing fight ensued. Today, on the fields of Manassas, the Park Service is staging the first of their four days of commemoration ceremonies, which several of my Antietam colleagues have the honor of taking part in (I will have that same privilige on this upcoming Saturday).\nWhile the numbers of casualties from First Manassas are far fewer than the numbers who would soon line the fields near towns named Sharpsburg, Gettysburg, and Spotsylvania Court House, the impact of the casualties from 150 years ago today were still immense. From April through July of 1861, Americans had been convinced that the war would be an easy affair, quickly won with one grand charge against the enemy. Many thought of war as only the romantic event it was portrayed as in books, stories, and folklore. It took the Battle of 1st Manassas to shake loose the notion that the war would be easy and quick. Manassas signaled that the Civil War would be a struggle far longer, far bloodier, and far more devastating than any had dared to imagine.\nOn this date 150 years ago, roughly 4,700 men fell in battle as casualties. Armies of civilians fought against each other in a desperate struggle. Men wore uniforms of every style, make, and color, making it nearly impossible to distinguish friend from foe on certain parts of the field that day. Civilians came from Washington with picnic baskets, prepared to watch the grand battle that was sure to decide the whole matter of secession quickly and decisively. Those same civilians, along with many of the Union soldiers, found themselves scrambling to get back to the safety of Washington by days end, shocked and terrified by the terrible reality of war. The order of battle for 1st Manassas reads as a ""who\'s who"" listing of famous Civil War names. Not only were McDowell, Johnston, and Beauregard present, but so was Longstreet, Jackson, Stuart, Early, Ewell, and Burnside, Sherman, Howard, Richardson, and Franklin. Many of these men would go on to have brilliant and distinguished careers during the war. Thomas Jonathan Jackson would rise to fame after standing upon Henry Hill ""like a stonewall,"" only to be cut down at the height of his fame and glory at Chancellorsville in May of 1863. Ambrose Burnside would leave his mark on many a battlefield of this war, leading troops over a small three arch bridge along Antietam Creek, as well as ordering troops to assault heights overlooking the quiet town of Fredericksburg. William Tecumseh Sherman led a brigade of troops against Confederate forces on Henry Hill that day, a much smaller force than the one he would lead through the state of Georgia in 1864, burning cities, foraging crops, and bringing the realities of war home for the entire Confederacy. J.E.B. Stuart, who led a dramatic cavalry charge at Manassas, rocketed to fame as the Confederacy\'s fearless cavalryman, leaping into the hearts, minds, and imaginations of an entire people, only to be mortally wounded at Yellow Tavern in 1864, dying at the young age of 33.\nFor all of these men, their journey through the American Civil War began 150 years ago today.\nYet, while Jackson, Burnside, Sherman, and Stuart went forward from 1st Manassas to achieve fame on other fields of battle, many men never left the field that day. One of those men was Major Sullivan Ballou of the 2nd Rhode Island Volunteers.\nThe story of Sullivan Ballou, much like so many other stories of individuals who fought and died during the Civil War, reminds us that the war was not a romantic sport, nor was it a weekend hobby for those who fought it. It was a life and death struggle for the future of their lives, their families, and this country. It was a fiery ordeal which touched both the battlefield and the home front, exacting a terrible price from all who experienced it.\nBefore the war, Sullivan Ballou was an attorney and politicain, serving in the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He was a Republican and a supporter of Abraham Lincoln. On October 15, 1855, he married Sarah Hunt Shumway, with whom he had two boys, Edgar and William. He volunteered to serve in the 2nd Rhode Island Volunteers at the outset of the war, which brought him to the fields along side Bull Run Creek on July 21, 1861. On that morning, while riding into battle out in front of his troops, a 6 pound solid shot severed Ballou\'s right leg below the knee and killed his horse. Ballou was carried from the field in severe pain, and though surgeons did what they could for him, he succumbed to the terrible nature of his wounds one week later.\nOn July 14, 1861, exactly 1 week before he was mortally wounded at 1st Manassas, Ballou wrote a letter home to his wife explaining his feelings in the event that he would be killed in battle. Ballou seemed to have a premonition that his death was near, and his letter serves as final testimony of his love for his wife, his children, and his country. The letter was never sent. It was found in Ballou\'s trunk after his death, and was given to his wife by Rhode Island Governor William Sprague. The letter which Ballou wrote stands as one of the most remarkable letters any soldier from either side wrote during the war. It captures a deep love for family and country. Ballou\'s Christian faith shines through in his words, and his profession of faith, love, and patriotism remind us why it was that so many left their safe and peaceful homes to fight in a deadly struggle which was so greater than themselves.\nMajor Sullivan Ballou, 2nd Rhode Island Volunteers\nJuly the 14th, 1861\nMy very dear Sarah:\nThe indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days—perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.\nOur movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure—and it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. Not my will, but thine O God, be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing—perfectly willing—to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt.\nBut, my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows—when, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children—is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country.\nSarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.\nThe memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me—perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar—that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.\nForgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot. I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.\nBut, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the brightest day and in the darkest night—amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours—always, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.\nSarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for me, for we shall meet again.\nAs for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father\'s love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers his and hers I call God\'s blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children.']"	['<urn:uuid:926d9632-5a45-4615-bcd7-8544d121be74>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	11	52	1746
21	I'm trying to figure out how search engines work with websites. Can you explain what happens when a search engine visits my website for the first time and what it needs to do next to show my pages in search results?	When a search engine visits your website, it first looks for a robots.txt file. The search engine crawler (also known as spider or Googlebot) then follows links to discover new web content, bringing it back to the search engine's database for indexing. For your pages to appear in search results, two key factors are important: crawlability (the ability for search engines to discover all your site's content without encountering dead-ends) and indexability (the ability to properly catalog your content for relevant keyword searches).	"['The robots exclusion protocol (REP), or robots.txt is a text file webmasters create to instruct robots (typically search engine robots) how to crawl and index pages on their website.\nRobots.txt is a text (not html) file you put on your site to tell search robots which pages you would like them not to visit. Robots.txt is by no\nmeans mandatory for search engines but generally search engines obey what they are asked not to do. It is important to clarify that robots.txt\nis not a way from preventing search engines from crawling your site (i.e. it is not a firewall, or a kind of password protection) and the fact that\nyou put a robots.txt file is something like putting a note “Please, do not enter” on an unlocked door – e.g. you cannot prevent thieves from\ncoming in but the good guys will not open to door and enter. That is why we say that if you have really sensitive data, it is too naïve to\nrely on robots.txt to protect it from being indexed and displayed in search results.\nWhen a search engine crawls (visits) your website, the first thing it looks for is your robots.txt file. This file tells search engines what they should and should not index (save and make available as search results to the public). It also may indicate the location of your XML sitemap.\nGoogle’s official stance on the robots.txt file\nRobots.txt file consists of lines which contain two fields: line with a user-agent name (search engine crawlers) and one or several lines starting\nwith the directive\n- How to create a robots.txt file\nYou will need to create it in the top-level directory of your web server.\nWhen a robot looks for the “/robots.txt” file for URL, it strips the path component from the URL (everything from the first single slash), and puts “/robots.txt” in its place.\nFor example, for “http://www.example.com/shop/index.html, it will remove the “/shop/index.html“, and replace it with “/robots.txt“, and will end up with “http://www.example.com/robots.txt”.\nSo, as a web site owner you need to put it in the right place on your web server for that resulting URL to work. Usually that is the same place where you put your web site’s main “index.html” welcome page. Where exactly that is, and how to put the file there, depends on your web server software.\nRemember to use all lower case for the filename: “robots.txt“, not “Robots.TXT.\nYou can simply create a blank file and name it robots.txt. This will reduce site errors and allow all search engines to rank anything they want.\nHere’s a simple\nUser-agent: * Allow: /wp-content/uploads/ Disallow: /\n1. The first line explains which agent (crawler) the rule applies to. In this case,\nUser-agent: * means the rule applies to every crawler.\n2. The subsequent lines set what paths can (or cannot) be indexed.\nAllow: /wp-content/uploads/allows crawling through your uploads folder (images) and\nDisallow: / means no file or page should be indexed aside from what’s been allowed previously. You can have multiple rules for a given crawler.\n3. The rules for different crawlers can be listed in sequence, in the same file.\n- Examples of usage\nPrevent the whole site from indexation by all web crawlers:\nAllow all web crawlers to index the whole site:\nPrevent only several directories from indexation:\nPrevent site’s indexation by a specific web crawler:\n- Robots.txt for WordPress\nDon’t choose to disallow the whole wp-content folder though, as it contains an ‘uploads’ subfolder with your site’s media files that you don’t want to be blocked. That’s why you need to proceed as follows:\n# disallow all files in these directories\n- Miscellaneous remarks\n- Don’t list all your files in the robots.txt file. Listing the files allows people to find files that you don’t want them to find.\n- An incorrect robots.txt file can block Googlebot from indexing your page\n- Put your most specific directives first, and your more inclusive ones (with wildcards) last', 'To gain a competitive advantage in Google, you must deal with two key factors to shape your search rankings - crawlability and indexability. Without testing for these factors, you\'ll find it extremely hard to outrank the competition.\nSo, you’ve built a great website, created amazing content, used a good SEO strategy and curated backlinks from blogger outreach. However, you\'re still finding it really hard to rank in Google. You may ask yourself...\n- is my site crawlable?\n- is my site indexable?\nI\'ll teach you how to make your site more crawlable and more attractive to the search index. Start by running a crawl test below...\nTest Website Crawlability\nRun a quick crawlability test.\nFind critical issues affecting your site’s indexability in Google.\nHow Does Google Crawl Websites?\nGoogle has 3 core components:\nThe crawler is also known as a spider, Googlebot and user agent.\nThe crawler’s job is to discover new web content by following links. It follows each link, then follows the links on newly discovered web pages, and so on and so forth.\nThe crawler then brings new content back to Google’s database for cataloging, referred to as indexing.\nWhat Does Crawlability Mean?\nThe ease of or ability for Google to crawl your website content, discover all site links and their destination pages without encountering dead-ends.\nWe’d like to assume that all your links lead to their destinations and your site is easily crawlable. But, if the spider has trouble crawling your site you’ll risk a low ranking.\nWhat Does Indexability Mean?\nThe ability for Google to catalog your website content properly for relevant keyword search terms.\nSo, crawling of your site directly affects how the search engine indexes your pages.\nHow to Influence Crawlability and Indexability\nCrawlability is influenced by the technical and structural aspects of your website environment.\nGoogle may stop crawling if it discovers broken links, technical issues or an inefficient site layout.\nThe goal is to create an efficient site setting to influence the spiders’ ability to crawl your site.\nEfficient crawling starts with good internal linking, site structure and no crawl errors.\nYour website should be a well-connected network of web pages that link to one another in a logical structure.\nYour web pages need to be reachable via a hyperlink, otherwise, you risk undiscoverable pages.\nThe crawler can’t index pages it doesn’t find.\nAs I mentioned, your site should be inter-connected with relevant page to page links. The crawler (or site visitor) should be able to access any page within 1-2 clicks (3 max). Pages nested too deep presents a poor site structure and a bad user experience.\nTo help Google understand your content better, the site structure must have link relationships around core topic pillar pages that link to related sub-topics commonly referred to this as content cluster.\nThen to help Google even further you must have those sub-topics link back to the core topic showing content priority. See the content cluster example below (from our HubSpot Content Strategy Tool) showing the core topic linking to sub-topics.\nFailure to create link relationships leads to undiscoverable pages and content the crawlers have difficulty indexing (classifying).\nFix Crawl Errors\nIf the search engine follows a link but cannot access the page while crawling, there won’t be anything new for indexing. Your web server may return any of the following HTTP errors: 500, 502, 503, 404, etc.\nCrawl errors will show up in Google’s Search Console (previously Google Webmaster Tools). So, you’ll want to fix them right away.\nFix Broken Links\nBroken links occur when moving or renaming web pages. Short of making a sitewide search and replace, you may create a dead-end link unintentionally. The crawler can’t access pages from a broken link. Generally, you\'d see a 404 error - page not found.\nFix Redirect Loops\nA redirect is a server rule where the server will send a user to page B when page A is requested.\nMore specifically, a redirect loop happens when multiple (conflicting) redirect rules. I.e. redirect rule #1 says Page A points to Page B and redirect rule #2 says Page B points to Page A.\nSimilar to a broken link, a redirect loop may occur when moving content or renaming page URLs. The crawler can’t access neither Page A nor Page B.\nForms and Scripts\nCrawlers can’t access content restricted behind a form. You may have content accessed via a login form or gated content requiring a form submission before displaying.\nOutdated technology or third-party scripts can restrict the crawler and prevent indexing.\nHow to Improve Crawling and Indexing\nI’ve mentioned that linking, structure and errors will influence the crawling and indexing of your site. Now, let’s discuss how we can improve the efficiency of the crawl and create a healthy environment for indexing.\nCrawler Access with Robots.txt\nRobots.txt is a utility file living within your site and crawled by Google. It has special block/allow indexing instructions which helps Google\'s ""crawl efficiency"" and ""indexing accuracy"". Note, Meta Tags can also deliver per page instructions on a case-by-case basis.\nPage Load Speed\nFaster loading websites yield a better user experience and improves the bots crawling rate.\nBut, note that increased crawl rate doesn’t always mean better indexed search results. Google considers over 200 factors when determining your search engine rankings.\nA sitemap lists important web pages of your site, while telling the search engines about your content. The sitemap also gives valuable metadata like last page update. A few ways to keep sitemaps organized and crawlable:\n- Update XML sitemap regularly *\n- Eliminate duplicate pages ***\n- Redirect pages properly (when deleting or renaming) **\n- Ensure canonicalized pages *\n- Use consistent, search engine friendly URLs\n- Use a UTF-8 encoded sitemap *\n- Check for sitemap errors regularly ***\n* Feature of Yoast SEO free plugin\n** Feature of Yoast SEO premium plugin\n*** Google Search Console\nNothing attracts search engines more than authoritative, high-quality content. But, not all content is created equal. Remember that it must meet the organic keyword litmus test and provide something of value to the consumer.\nPrevent Duplicate Content\nThe same content found on multiple URLs of your website. It can occur on any site especially ecommerce stores and blogs. A few examples:\n- mysite.com/nike-air-max/ and mysite.com/sneakers/nike-air-max/\n- mysite.com/my-cool-blog-post/ and mysite.com/my-category/my-cool-blog-post/\nGoogle doesn’t know your preferred URL which may impact crawling and indexing. It’s easily fixed with the rel=“canonical” Tag telling Google your primary URL.\nCrawlability Testing and Index Monitoring Tools\nGoogle SEO Tools\nUse Google’s go-to list for SEO tools. Here are a few popular ones:\n- PageSpeedInsights to analyze pages for speed and usability improvement suggestions.\n- Mobile-Friendly Test is another great tool to show mobile performance.\n- Google Search Console provides rich insights into your site\'s crawlability and indexing. A place to submit your XML sitemap, examine structured data and much more.\nSEO Site Audit\nRun a site audit regularly to maintain good SEO health. A site audit tool will give you a comprehensive overview of your site’s overall health allowing you to stay on top of problems.\nSEMrush offers the most comprehensive set of tools and is our SEO secret weapon.

22	How do the new graphene-based light detectors perform in terms of speed and are there any advantages compared to regular light sensors?	These graphene-based photodetectors demonstrate ultrafast performance with no degradation in photoresponse up to 40 GHz, and analysis suggests they could potentially exceed 500 GHz bandwidth. They also offer unique advantages including zero source-drain bias, no dark current operation, and good internal quantum efficiency.	"[""Graphene research so far has focused on electronic1,2,3,4,5,6 rather than photonic applications, in spite of its impressive optical properties7,8. These include its ability to absorb ∼2% of incident light over a broad wavelength range despite being just one atom thick7. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast transistor-based photodetectors made from single- and few-layer graphene. The photoresponse does not degrade for optical intensity modulations up to 40 GHz, and further analysis suggests that the intrinsic bandwidth may exceed 500 GHz. The generation and transport of photocarriers in graphene differ fundamentally from those in photodetectors made from conventional semiconductors as a result of the unique photonic and electronic properties of the graphene. This leads to a remarkably high bandwidth, zero source–drain bias and dark current operation, and good internal quantum efficiency.\nSubscribe to Journal\nGet full journal access for 1 year\nonly $14.08 per issue\nAll prices are NET prices.\nVAT will be added later in the checkout.\nRent or Buy article\nGet time limited or full article access on ReadCube.\nAll prices are NET prices.\nNovoselov, K.

23	difference between array and linked list elements ordering mechanism	While both arrays and linked lists arrange elements in linear order, arrays determine element order by their index, whereas in a Linked List the order is determined by pointers in each element.	"['Data Structures- Linked List\nA linked list is a data structure in which elements are arranged in linear order (like an array).\nBut unlike an array, where the order is determined by the index of each element in it, the order in a Linked List is determined by a pointer (or multiple ones) in each element of the list.\nThere are multiple types on Linked List, but here, I\'ll use a Doubly Linked List.\nIn a Doubly Linked List L, each element has 3 attributes;\n- key, which represents the data,\n- next, a pointer to its successor, and\n- prev, pointing to its predecessor.\nFor an element E,\nE.prev == nil means E is the list\'s head. The first element in the list. On the contrary,\nE.next == nil means E is the tail. The last element of the list.\nHere is what an Element would look like:\nclass Element attr_accessor :key, :prev, :next def initialize(args) @key = args[:key] @next = args[:nex] @prev = args[:prev] end end\nAnd here are 2 elements, one being the head.\nAs you can see,\nhead.next points to tail and\ntail.prev points to head.\nhead = Element.new key: 13 tail = Element.new key: 25, prev: head head.next = tail\nThis is a really simple implementation of Element. Here I create the element and link them manually.\nOur list needs its own class to implement basic operations such as\ninsertto add an element (element becomes the new head)\ndeleteto remove en element\nsearchto look for an element\nmaximumto find the smallest and biggest element\nHere would be an implementation of that class:\nclass LinkedList attr_reader :head def initialize(element=nil) @head = element end end head = Element.new key: 13 list = LinkedList.new head list.head => #<Element:0x007f878aafc198 @key=13, @next=nil, @prev=nil>\nThe list is initialized with an element which becomes the head (and the tail being the only element). The element can be nil, in which case the list would be empty.\nNow let\'s create the\ninsert method, to allow us to add new elements to the list:\ndef insert(element) el.next = @head @head.prev = el if @head @head = el end\nSo what exactly is happening here?\n- The new element\'s next attribute is set to point to the list\'s current head (insert adds elements in front of the list, remember?),\n- list head\'s prev is set to point to our element, and\n- our list\'s\n@headis set to our new element.\nAs you can see, in this example we had a linked list where the head is 9. We\ninserted the element with\nkey: 25, which becomes the new head.\nOn the opposite, let\'s now implement\ndelete, which will allow us to remove an element from our list:\ndef delete(element) el.prev ? el.prev.next = el.next : @head = el.next el.next.prev = el.prev if el.next end\n- On line 1, we check if the element has a predecessor by checking if its\n.prevexists. If it does, we set its predecessor\n.nextto point to our element\'s successor. If our element doesn\'t have a predecessor, it means it\'s our list head. In that case, we set the head to point to its successor.\n- Then, we do the exact opposite; Unless our element is the tail, we set its successor to point to its predecessor.\nAs you can see, in this example we removed 4. Hence,\n16.next now points to 1 and\n1.prev points to 16. No more 4.\nFinally, let\'s implement\nsearch, allowing us to find an element from a key in the list (makes more sense to look for a key than an element).\nIf the element we are looking for is not in the list, we will return\ndef search(key) x = @head while x && x.key != key x = x.next return x end\nHere the search works like a sequential search. It starts from the head, it iterates over every element until it finds an element with the key we are looking for.\nIf no element has the key we are looking for, it will iterate until the last element of our list, which has\n.next == nil, which will be returned.\nHere. I\'m done with Linked List.\nThis is obviously a really simple implementation in ruby, which I do for learning purposes.\nOther types of linked lists\n- Singly Linked Lists are linked lists where nodes have only one pointer, to its successor.\n- Sorted Linked Lists\'s linear order corresponds to the linear order of keys stored in elements of the list (e.g. 1->2->3->4).\n- Circular Linked Lists have the prev pointer of the head point to the tail, and the tail\'s next pointer point to the head.\nBoth images are screenshots from the incredible book ""Introduction to algorithms, 3rd edition"" written by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein.']"	['<urn:uuid:e33e7584-0a52-4763-8282-287acaddb5fd>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	9	32	802
24	solar lease vs solar panel purchase maintenance responsibility comparison	With a solar lease, the solar provider owns, operates and maintains the system, providing free monitoring, maintenance and repairs at no extra cost to the lessee. In contrast, when purchasing solar panels outright, the homeowner is responsible for maintaining and monitoring the equipment themselves, including regular maintenance such as keeping the panels clean to ensure maximum energy output from the sun.	['How does a solar lease work?\nAnd is it worth it?\nIf you’re interested in harnessing the sun’s power to reduce your electricity bills, a solar lease may be an ideal solution. Solar leases make green energy more accessible by letting you install and utilize solar equipment without purchasing it outright (like with a car lease). A solar lease is ideal for homeowners who want to save money on their electricity costs without committing to a solar loan.\n- A solar lease is a great option for homeowners who want to reduce their electricity bills and invest in renewable energy.\n- A solar lease is an alternative to paying in cash or taking out a loan or power purchase agreement (PPA).\n- The type of lease you choose will depend on your budget, energy consumption needs and other factors.\n- Before signing up for a solar lease, carefully research different companies and compare their rates, terms and conditions.\nWhat is a solar lease?\nA solar lease is an agreement where you rent or lease solar panels and other related equipment from a solar provider or installer. This means the solar provider owns, operates and maintains the system for you. In exchange for your monthly payment, you may also receive a production guarantee from the installer. This means the system is guaranteed to produce a minimum amount of energy over a set number of years.\nHow is a solar lease different from a solar PPA?\nSolar leases are similar to power purchase agreements (PPAs) in that they offer an alternative to the outright purchase of solar equipment. However, there are several key differences between solar leases and PPAs. With a PPA, you pay for the electricity generated by the system over time; with a lease, you pay for the use of the equipment itself. With both options, there are often few upfront costs, but monthly costs may increase over time.\nHow is a solar lease different from a solar loan?\nSolar leases also differ from traditional panel purchases and solar loans because they require lower upfront costs and may come with more flexible contract terms and conditions. Panel purchases require long-term commitments with substantial solar panel costs. In contrast, it may be possible to transfer a solar lease agreement to someone else, like when you sell your home. Still, many large solar companies make it difficult to get out of a lease agreement early.\nHow solar panel lease agreements work\nGetting a solar lease involves renting solar panels and other equipment from a company that owns the equipment. This arrangement differs from buying solar panels because you don’t need to pay a lot of money right away, but you can immediately benefit from reduced electricity bills.\nSolar leases usually have a set term — typically 20 to 25 years — during which time you make monthly payments in exchange for using the equipment. Your payment amount depends on the company, the size of the system, how much energy you use, your location and your creditworthiness. The company may also include free repairs and maintenance with your lease.\nThat said, some customers report receiving inadequate maintenance from their solar equipment provider, like Laurinda of McVeytown, Pennsylvania, who said: “At the time of installation Trinity told us that they would monitor our system and make sure that it remained in working condition …. My husband checked our system and realized it wasn’t working properly. Trinity wasn’t monitoring it like they said they would. We contacted them so they would come and repair it. They didn’t.”\nWhat happens at the end of a solar lease?\nAt the end of your solar lease term, you may be able to renew the contract, upgrade to a newer system or have the system removed from your home. In some cases, you may also purchase the solar panels outright from the provider. Renewing or buying out the lease can provide added long-term savings since you won’t need to continue making monthly payments.\nOverall, solar leases provide a great way to switch to clean energy without making significant upfront investments or long-term commitments. With more flexibility than purchasing panels outright and repairs and maintenance included, leases are becoming increasingly popular for households looking to go green.\nIs leasing solar panels worth it?\nLeasing solar panels can be a great option for households looking to switch to clean energy without having cash for a down payment or the entire purchase amount. A lease is also a good option if you prefer to avoid maintaining and monitoring the equipment yourself. That said, homeowners who lease their solar equipment can’t take full advantage of available incentives — so eligible households may prefer financing over leasing.\nCy Yablonsky of PowerLutions, a solar installation company in New Jersey, said, “Financing solar panels is the better option for individuals who can fully take advantage of available incentives. … A lease is more suitable for those who cannot.” Still, you might opt for a lease over financing if you don’t want the burden of being responsible for the system (and any maintenance issues) in the long run.\nPros of solar leases\nMany homeowners opt for a solar lease because it ultimately frees them of responsibility when it comes to maintenance and repairs.\n- Flexibility: Solar leases provide some flexibility over purchasing equipment outright because terms usually last up to 25 years and may be transferred when your house sells. This means you can switch to clean energy without committing to a lengthy solar loan and update your panels as the technology evolves.\n- Low initial payment: Leases don’t usually require any money down, while purchasing panels outright requires full payment or a down payment. This means you can start saving on your electric bill with little to no upfront cost. Some solar companies require a down payment for leases, so read the contract carefully before signing.\n- Free maintenance and repairs: Most solar companies include monitoring, maintenance and repairs at no extra cost to the lessee. Solar leases offer a more hands-off approach to clean energy and are an excellent option if you prefer not to manage the system yourself.\n- Potential incentives: Depending on where you live, leasing solar equipment may qualify you for state incentives, though this is uncommon.\nCons of solar leases\nA solar lease isn’t ideal for every homeowner; make sure to consider the disadvantages before you sign on for this option.\n- Limited or no rebates or incentives: In general, the leasing company that owns the solar equipment benefits from available rebates, incentives and tax credits — not the lessee. According to Mark Steber, chief tax information officer at Jackson Hewitt: “The federal residential solar energy credit is only available to taxpayers who purchase and install solar panels on their home. The tax credit is not available to those who are leasing the equipment, as the lease is not a purchase cost.”\n- Not suitable for everyone: Leasing solar equipment might not make economic sense in areas where electricity rates are low because lessees won’t recoup their investment within their chosen lease term period.\n- Long-term commitment required: Even though some solar leasing companies offer short-term contracts, many require longer commitments that may be difficult for households to keep up with over time. These lengthy contracts can also complicate selling your home down the line.\n- Lack of ownership: Because the system belongs to the leasing company, you won’t have full control over the equipment or be able to customize it as desired.\nHow much is a solar lease per month?\nThe monthly cost of a solar lease per month varies depending on the size of the system, the location, your credit score and other factors. Generally speaking, most leases require a monthly rate between $50 and $250, and this amount may increase by a small percentage each year. Some leasing companies require a down payment, but most don’t.\nThese rates are usually lower than average electricity bills in many states, so leasing provides a financial benefit that can help households switch to clean energy without feeling weighed down by hefty upfront costs. Certain incentives may also apply depending on where you live, but these are usually limited to solar panel owners.\nIs it worth buying a house with leased solar panels?\nBuying a house with leased solar panels may be worth it if the monthly payments are lower than the average electricity bills in your area. According to Yablonsky, of PowerLutions: “The viability of an existing solar lease depends on its terms and conditions compared to current market offerings. Potential homebuyers should review the lease price, duration, escalation rates and other term details.”\nAlso, consider that an existing solar lease means you don’t have complete control over the system and may not be able to customize it. You’ll also have to meet the solar company’s qualification requirements, which may include having a minimum credit score of 700.\nWhat happens at the end of a solar lease?\nAt the end of a solar lease, the lessee has several options. Depending on the terms of the agreement, you may be able to renew the contract and keep the equipment for an additional term or lease new equipment to update the system. Depending on the solar company, you also may be able to purchase the system outright.\nIf you decide to move out and terminate the lease earlier than expected, most companies require that all payments are made in full and any outstanding balances are paid off before transferring ownership. That said, you may be able to transfer the lease to the new homeowners — though this typically means the buyers have to meet stringent qualification requirements.\nYou’re signed up\nWe’ll start sending you the news you need delivered straight to you.

Going with solar power can be an important investment in your future. You have to understand if it will fit into your budget. This article is going to help you know more about the financials involved with solar energy.\nYou should start out taking small steps when implementing solar energy in your home or business. A small investment of just a few solar powered garden lights is a great way to get started. You will find these in various locations, such as home improvement retailers and other major retail stores. They are very easy to install.\nHow many panels you have in place and their efficiency will determine output. Do the math and figure what you require. You might be able to get away with having fewer panels if they are of higher quality.\nIf you perform regular maintenance on your solar power system, it will function well for a long time. Keeping the panels clean will help to ensure that you are harnessing the maximum amount of energy from the sun that you can. Do not hesitate to hire a professional to help you clean and inspect your system but keep in mind that you can save a lot by inspecting your system yourself.\nHeating water with a solar-powered heater can help save the environment. Solar water heating options are many and varied, and an online search will provide you with a wide array of choices. You can install one in any sunny location.\nIf you want to go solar partially, check out small-scale applications of solar power. There are two ways to do this. You can find small-scale panels to prop on your window to recharge electronics. Next, try to find camping equipment that can run on solar power. Cutting a few dollars here and there can really add up.\nWhile it can seem like solar panels are hooked to the roof permanently, the best systems out there that generate lots of energy can have their panels repositioned during the different seasons. This is why investing in panels that track the sunlight are best for optimal performance.\nYou should have a back-up plan in case the solar panels don’t work as they should. Remaining connected to the main power grid is your best option but you could invest in a generator. If you choose to go the generator route, consistently test it. You may also want to have multiple generators.\nIf you are interested in leasing a solar power system, pay attention to the terms. You want to be able to transfer the lease if necessary. This is important because if put your home on the market, you may get stuck with paying for a leased solar energy system that you are not able to use. Having the option to transfer the lease will give the new homeowners a beneficial system, and remove your obligation to pay for it.\nMoney can be saved on your energy bills if you install solar panels where you live or if you use solar water heating. If an area of your home is exposed to a minimum of five hours of direct sunlight, a photovoltaic panel system might work well for you. People often see their pool’s heating bill decreased from solar water heating.\nConsider a backup power option, just in case you have a problem with your solar panels. Depending on your situation you might want to stay connected with the local power grid, or invest in a generator for when problems occur with your system. Remember that generators must be tested regularly, and you will also want a backup generator!\nHow do you use energy? Before converting to solar energy, it’s vital that you have a good estimate of the amount of power that your home or business uses. These facts are essential if you are to choose an appropriate sized solar power system. You should look at your yearly energy bill since costs vary by season.\nYou can add pathway lighting to your home or your business today to get started on harnessing the power of the sun. These small lights can absorb sunshine throughout the day and power the lights at night. These are very simple to put in, and they light up your outdoor space in a charming way.\nThe technology used to create solar power keeps improving. What used to cost a small fortune now has lowered to the point where many consumers can afford them. Regardless of your energy needs, you can find a good solar power system if you try.\nWhen it comes to solar water heaters, be realistic. Even the best models will only reduce your power consumption by 1/3. Have no fear! Your early morning shower will be nice and warm with solar heating. The water that was heated the day before will stay toasty overnight.\nMany people don’t realize that when you have a solar power system, you do not have to hook up to a power grid. You can choose to be independent if you are ready to invest in a battery and a backup generator. This means you can look forward to no more utility bills.\nPrior to installing solar panels, determine if your home gets enough sun to make it beneficial. Solar roof panels may not be a good idea if your home stands in deep shade all day. Excessive shade will keep you from getting the most out of your soalr panel investment.\nIf changing your house to solar energy power is something you are considering, start with the areas that will be easiest to convert. Purchase small solar appliances and outdoor fixtures to get a taste before you go all-in. Doing things gradually will make it easier to stick with.\nLook at installing solar panels just like another major project for your home. Spend time learning about your options for manufacturers, suppliers and installers. Read reviews, compare prices and ask for references. Read any contracts carefully and if you need to, ask a legal specialist to look at it and make sure you get the most from your money.\nMake sure your solar panels are pointed at the right angle towards the sun for maximum benefit. It’s where the energy comes from, so properly orient your panels at all times.\nNever walk on solar panels! The materials are durable, yet very expensive. Applying weight to them is risky. If you have to walk over your panels, avoid walking on the edges since these areas are more fragile.\nHang your garments on a clothesline to dry. Even though this idea has been used for many years, it’s still efficient. Running the dryer can be costly; instead, hang any clothes on sunny days. This will save you tons on your utility bills.\nAs you consider the benefits of installing solar panels, you must take into account how much shade surrounds your property. If you have a lot of shaded area, pass on the solar panels. Shade limits the sun’s performance on solar panels. This reduces the effectiveness and cost efficiency of solar heat.\nUsing solar energy will save you a lot of money. If you do make the investment, you should definitely start seeing a return on it very quickly. You can also sell electricity that your home has produced for credit at a utility company.\nHave financial background checks done on solar panel companies you plan to purchase from. Choose a company that has been around for a while and has a good reputation. This is important for your warranty, as you want to make sure you are able to get new panels should a problem occur.\nYou could have your solar energy panels installed with a large discount or even free. The government is trying to promote solar energy benefits and many wish to cover apart or all of the costs in return for its installation.\nSolar power is a good thing to consider if you use a lot of power and your roof gets a minimum of five hours direct daily sunlight. The money you put in upfront to start and maintain can be worth it here.\nRemember that price is just one of the things to think about when choosing a solar energy system. There are all kinds of solar panels that exist, and they all vary in brand, size, warranty period, performance, quality of materials, etc. Because of this, you should thoroughly research all the solar panels and select the highest quality one rather than the cheapest one. You should buy the best quality at the best price for you.\nAs you start shopping for a system, have an estimate of the electrical demands, extent of sun on the areas around the home, and then choose the right size and shape of the panel. You can invest in smaller panels or may find that larger panels are more suited for your needs.\nSolar panels don’t just light up homes. They can provide heat and warm up your water, too. Solar panels will eventually pay for themsleves. the amount you pay on your electricity.\nConsider outside influences when you you’re figuring out your estimated solar energy output. The listed expected output for most solar panels is calculated using ideal situations and direct sunlight. Shade from trees, overcast conditions, and other environmental issues can decrease how much your panels actually output.\nFind the most effective usages of solar energy. For instance, many solar energy systems won’t have enough energy to heat a home. They should be able to provide energy for a water heater though. Understanding what your unique situation is will help you figure out what you should do.\nRoof mounted solar panels should be installed in a location that has been carefully considered in advance. Consider latitude during installation to get the most electrical output you can from the panels.\nRemember that solar panels aren’t just meant for the roof. If your land has enough space, this can be a better option for you than the roof. If possible, choose adjustable mounts and invest in a sun tracker so your panels can always be positioned at the right angle. However, you will lose a good bit of your land.\nWhen you design your home, make the most of passive solar energy by including ample windows along the south side.

25	what causes damage to concrete in winter	In winter, freeze-thaw cycles damage concrete because when water infiltrates concrete and freezes, it occupies 9% more volume than in liquid state. This expansion causes fractures that grow as saturation increases.	['Consulting experts when selecting appropriate waterproofing\nby Carter Pogue\nSevere weather can cause extensive damage to a building’s roof, foundation, and interiors. Waterproofing plays an extremely important role in protecting every aspect of a structure’s construction. Knowing which coverage to specify for a particular project is more than just a science—it is an art form. Consulting with an experienced specialty contractor for the best waterproofing options available will ensure a quality job to extend the structure’s life.\nWater is moved through a building via numerous forces, including hydrostatic pressure, capillary action, wind/air currents, surface tension, and natural gravity. If there is any breach in a structure’s envelope, water is sure to find its way in.\nWaterproofing has come a long way since 1915, when ironite was first introduced. Painted onto the inside of basement walls, this material became a popular option because it could be applied quickly and was less expensive than the traditional dampproofing methods at the time.\nAs the decades progressed, so did improvements in the materials and techniques used to completely waterproof a building—from the roof to its below-grade exterior and interior walls and everything in between.\nThe exterior walls of a building can be a significant source of unwanted water leakage. Many openings are required in commercial building walls—from plumbing and irrigation connections to lighting, HVAC system elements, exhaust vents, air intakes, joints around windows and doors, and fire alarms. There are also unplanned holes caused by aging brick joints that need re-pointing, vanishing sealants, damage from acid rain, and settling cracks. All wall penetrations provide easy access for water, bugs, rodents, or birds to enter the building and cause damage.\nA structure’s first line of defense against the elements is above-grade waterproofing, which includes caulks and sealants to seal the perimeters of windows and other openings. The amount of sealant needed on a new or existing structure depends on exposure and expansion/contraction problems that may be identified. Some types of sealants include:\n- elastomeric breathable wall coating systems;\n- protective/decorative surface coatings; and\n- clear water repellents.\nConcrete, terrace areas, and decks\nIn the winter, freeze-thaw cycles can cause big problems with concrete structures. When water infiltrates concrete, it can freeze and then occupy nine percent more volume than in its liquid state. This expansion causes distress on the concrete, which can lead to fractures that continue to grow exponentially as saturation of the material increases.\nA wide range of restoration, repair, and reinforcing services are offered by certified, specialty contractors who can repair cracks, spalls, rust spots, deterioration, pot-holes, and heaves in concrete and masonry. More often than not, concrete repairs are made before they become a more serious or costly issue, but there are also measures that can actually prevent future damage.\nApplying hot-applied or below-grade waterproofing to buried structures, urethane waterproof traffic coatings to parking decks, and protective acrylic coatings to pedestrian areas and exterior façades extends the life of the repair, protects adjacent areas still in good condition, and significantly improves the aesthetics of the area treated. Used over concrete, wood, or steel, a variety of deck coatings can prevent leaks from penetrating to areas below and maintain the surface’s color to keep it looking like new. Recent technology has provided materials for these special coatings suitable for suspended slabs, recreational roof decks, garages, patios, balconies, sun decks, areas around pools, and other locations requiring a durable surface.\nA commitment to good roof maintenance practices can prevent overflowing gutters, clogged downspouts, and excessive ponding water, which can lead to costly roof, façade, and foundation damage. Decaying leaves, pine needles, and dirt runoff can all be contributors, which is why it is essential all roof drains remain clear of obstructions. In addition to the risk of water pouring into tenant spaces should a breach in the roof occur, the freezing and thawing of ponding water during the fall and winter can cause extensive roof damage.\nApplying waterproofing to a structure’s roof is important and requires a professional’s expertise to determine which option works the best. Some available roofing systems include:\n- synthetic rubber materials;\n- hot rubberized asphalt; and\n- insulated roofing membrane systems.\nFeasibility of installation, cost, and compatibility play major roles in deciding which roofing assembly is best-suited for a structure.\nA number of excellent below-grade exterior foundation waterproofing systems have become available within the last 20 years to prevent water penetration through basement walls, concrete lids, pits, and other below-ground areas. These waterproofing materials may be applied on the inside or outside of the wall or foundation.\nMajor examples include:\n- fluid-applied elastomeric membranes, mastics, and coatings that form a tough, seamless membrane to withstand abuse and high levels of hydrostatic pressure;\n- hot-applied rubberized asphalt for horizontal waterproofing in split-slab construction and insulated roof membrane assembly roofs;\n- single-ply sheet systems (e.g. rubberized asphalt sheets, ethylene propylene diene monomer [EPDM] synthetic rubber, polyvinyl chloride [PVC], chlorinated or chlorosulfonated polyethylene [CPE or CSPE], butyl rubber, and neoprene); and\n- bentonite clay panel and sheet systems that swell when they become saturated to block moisture from entering a building.\nMetallic, capillary/crystalline, and cementitious materials are available for waterproofing a structure’s interior. These materials may be applied by brush, trowel, spray, or dry-shake methods to concrete or masonry substrates opposite the source of moisture. For foundations, these materials are applied to the interior of the structure. For tanks, reservoirs, and other structures that hold water, these materials are applied to the exterior.\nWaterproofing should never be limited to one option or a go-to method. Selecting the most suitable strategy should be researched through consultants, engineers, and material manufacturers. Installers should be experienced and comfortable with the products they are installing. Surface preparation is critical for all surfaces and with all products.\nIt is also important to remember there is simply no maintenance-free structure or material. Maintenance programs recommended by the manufacturer should be stringently followed to stay in accordance with warranty obligations.\nCarter Pogue is a project manager with Western Specialty Contractors. He started his career with the firm almost 15 years ago as a general cement mason, learning all aspects of the restoration/waterproofing business. Pogue quickly moved into a general foreman role in 2004, facilitating projects such as the University of Missouri−Columbia stadium restoration before being promoted to general superintendent where he coordinated and executed multiple construction projects and subcontractor operations. In 2012, he became a project manager with Western. Pogue is an active member in the local Great Plains Chapter of the International Concrete Repair Institute (ICRI). He has been awarded multiple safety and achievement awards within the company and is certified through the Post-Tension Institution (PTI).

26	How do metamaterials enable microwave applications, and what's their link to terahertz technology?	Metamaterials enable a new generation of microwave devices through composite right/left-handed transmission line structures that exhibit larger bandwidths and lower loss. These materials allow for novel guided-wave and radiated-wave applications like dual-band components and enhanced-bandwidth devices. Regarding the terahertz connection, metamaterials are being actively developed for terahertz applications, particularly in the range of 0.1 to 10 THz, where they can be used for various imaging and spectroscopy applications. The development of 'magnetless' magnetic metamaterials and terahertz magnetic metamaterials represents a significant frontier in bridging microwave and terahertz technologies.	['Electromagnetic Metamaterials: Transmission Line Theory and Microwave Applications\nNovember 2005, Wiley-IEEE Press\nThis book presents an original generalized transmission line approach associated with non-resonant structures that exhibit larger bandwidths, lower loss, and higher design flexibility.

Moreover, they provide a host of practical engineering applications.\nThe book begins with an introductory chapter that places resonant type and transmission line metamaterials in historical perspective. The next six chapters give readers a solid foundation in the fundamentals and practical applications:\n* Fundamentals of LH MMs describes the fundamental physics and exotic properties of left-handed metamaterials\n* TL Theory of MMs establishes the foundations of CRLH structures in three progressive steps: ideal transmission line, LC network, and real distributed structure\n* Two-Dimensional MMs develops both a transmission matrix method and a transmission line method to address the problem of finite-size 2D metamaterials excited by arbitrary sources\n* Guided-Wave Applications and Radiated-Wave Applications present a number of groundbreaking applications developed by the authors\n* The Future of MMs sets forth an expert view on future challenges and prospects\nThis engineering approach to metamaterials paves the way for a new generation of microwave and photonic devices and structures.

Engineering Department of the University of California, Los Angeles. He has authored hundreds of book chapters and journal articles. He is also the author of a number of prominent publications, including RF Technologies for Low Power Wireless Communications.', 'Terahertz Molecular Lasers - Introduction & Applications\nThe THz Spectral Region\nThe terahertz spectral region, which falls between the microwave and infrared ranges, is one of the most promising regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, but it is currently underutilised in research and industry. There is no universal definition for what constitutes the terahertz band, but the frequency range of 0.1 to 10 THz (λ = 3 mm to 30 μm) is the most widely referenced. Due to its position within the electromagnetic spectrum, terahertz radiation has unique penetrating properties that make it highly attractive for spectroscopy and imaging applications across a wide variety of fields, including medical science, biology, security, astronomy, pharmaceutical, materials science, and physics. These applications range from the use of terahertz radiation to induce quantum oscillations in semiconductors for fundamental physics research, to the non-destructive biomedical imaging of tissue using terahertz holography.\nFigure 1: The THz band, 0.1 – 10 THz.\nWith the exception of astronomy, where the astronomical object itself is the terahertz source, terahertz spectroscopy and imaging applications require a source of terahertz radiation. Terahertz sources can be split into two main types: ultrashort pulse and continuous wave. Ultrashort-pulse terahertz sources are the foundation of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), in which materials are probed with ultrashort pulses of terahertz radiation generated via femtosecond lasers. The ultrashort pulse results in a broad bandwidth of terahertz frequencies that enables fast acquisition times in THz-TDS, but with low-frequency resolution that limits its usefulness in spectroscopic applications. For applications that require high-frequency resolution, or terahertz excitation at a single, well-defined frequency, continuous-wave terahertz sources are required.\nThere are a diverse range of continuous wave THz sources currently available commercially including difference-frequency generation, backward wave oscillators, microwave frequency multipliers, quantum cascade lasers and optically pumped molecular lasers. Backward-wave oscillators and frequency multipliers are extensions of microwave-type oscillator technology into the terahertz region. They can provide high power, but they become impractical at frequencies above 1 THz. Difference-frequency generation utilizes two IR lasers that are offset in frequency to produce terahertz radiation at the difference-frequency of the lasers, which results in a highly tunable terahertz source, but with low powers in the microwatt range. Quantum cascade lasers have long held promise as a terahertz source. They continue to advance but currently require deep cryogenic cooling for continuous-wave operation in the terahertz region, partly due to scattering at high temperatures. They are limited to powers in the low milliwatts and operation above 1 THz.\nEach of these sources is ideal for many terahertz applications, but in general, they either suffer from low power or limited frequency range. For applications that require high power at discrete frequencies across the terahertz range, the optically pumped terahertz molecular laser is the ideal source.\nThe Terahertz Molecular Laser\nThe optically pumped terahertz molecular laser was first demonstrated in 1970 by Tao-Yuan Chang and Thomas J. Bridges at Bell Labs1. It has since been optimised and refined for the delivery of high-power, coherent terahertz radiation over a wide range of frequencies and is a workhorse of terahertz research laboratories around the world. The laser is known by several names in the scientific community, with the most common one being the optically pumped far-infrared (OPFIR) laser. It is also known as an optically pumped terahertz laser (OPTL), a terahertz gas laser, and a terahertz molecular laser.\nIn the optically pumped terahertz molecular laser, a pump laser is used to optically excite a vapour of polar molecules to a higher-lying energy level from which they relax with the emission of terahertz radiation. The pump laser can take a variety of forms, with the most common arrangement being a CO2 infrared laser, the output of which is coupled into the terahertz molecular laser. This coupling can be either external, such as on an optical table, where the pump laser and terahertz laser are separate entities, or internal, where the pump and terahertz lasers are contained within a single unit.\nFigure 2: Schematic of an optically pumped terahertz molecular laser based on an Edinburgh Instruments FIRL-100.\nThe main components and the operating principle of the laser are shown in Figure 2. The schematic is based on an Edinburgh Instruments FIRL-100, where the CO2 pump and terahertz molecular laser are integrated into a single system capable of outputting both infrared radiation (9 to 11 μm, or 27 to 33 THz) and terahertz radiation (40 μm to 1.22 mm, or 0.25 to 7 THz).\nStage 1: CO2 IR pump laser\nThe process starts with the CO2 pump laser which consists of an optical resonator formed between a diffraction grating and a partially reflecting ZnSe output coupling mirror. The ZnSe mirror is mounted on a piezo-electric transducer to allow for fine control of the resonator length. The gain stage is a high-voltage gas discharge tube sealed with Brewster angled ZnSe windows that sits between the grating and mirror.\nTo achieve lasing, a CO2/N2/He gas mixture is flowed through the discharge tube and the N2 molecules are promoted to a vibrationally excited state via collisions with electrons from the electric discharge. The N2 excited state is close in energy to the 0001 vibrational excited state of the CO2 molecule, and population of the 0001 state proceeds through resonant energy transfer. A population inversion now exists between the 0001 and the lower-lying 0200 and 1000 vibrational states of CO2, facilitating stimulated emission and lasing to occur between them (Figure 3).\nThe vibrational transitions are grouped into two bands, the 10 μm and 9 μm, and within each band are a manifold of possible vibro-rotational lasing transitions with various emission wavelengths. By changing the angle of the diffraction grating (making a coarse adjustment) and the length of the optical resonator through the piezo mirror (fine-tuning), the desired transition can be brought into resonance — with ~80 laser transitions selectable between 9 and 11 µm (27 to 33 THz).\nFigure 3: Simplified energy level diagram of the CO2 lasing mechanism.\nStage 2: Terahertz Molecular Laser\nTo generate terahertz radiation, the output from the pump laser is focused down and coupled into a sealed terahertz resonator. This setup comprises a ZnSe input Brewster window that forms a vacuum seal at one end of the resonator, an input coupling mirror, and a dichroic output coupler that enables extraction of the terahertz emission while reflecting the IR pump beam. The resonator is evacuated and filled with a low-pressure vapour of a small molecule possessing a permanent dipole moment — meaning that two or more atoms within the molecule have very different electronegativities. Optical pumping by the CO2 pump laser excites the molecules to a vibrational excited state (Figure 4), creating a population inversion between the rotational states, J, within the vibrational excited state, which can undergo stimulated emission and lasing. The transitions between the rotational states are much lower in energy than the vibrational transitions involved in the CO2 laser, falling within the 0.2 to 8 THz range. The output frequency of the pump laser is tuned to excite the desired vibro-rotational transition of the molecule, and the terahertz resonator length is tuned to select the rotational transition that is in resonance and therefore the output frequency of the laser.\nFigure 4: Simplified energy level diagram of the terahertz molecular laser.\nChoice of molecule\nA wide range of laser-active molecules can be used to generate the terahertz emission. In general, the molecules should possess a permanent dipole moment, be able to form a vapour, and have vibrational transitions that can absorb the pump laser frequencies. These requirements are satisfied with lightweight polyatomic molecules such as CH3F, CH2F2, and CH3OH and over 1000 laser lines have been identified across the 0.2 to 8 THz frequency range, a handful of which are shown in Figure 5. The 2.52 THz transition from CH3OH (methanol) vapour is particularly common within terahertz spectroscopy and imaging research, with output powers >100 mW readily achievable using this transition.\nFigure 5: Laser transitions of three molecules used in THz lasers. K and J are quantum numbers defining the rotational state of the molecule. Adapted from Ref 2. Pump frequencies from Ref 3.\nThe terahertz molecular laser excels at applications that take advantage of its high power, stability, well-defined frequency, and long coherence lengths. One such application area that is of great interest for both academic research and industrial testing is continuous-wave terahertz imaging. Because terahertz radiation lies at the boundary of the microwave and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, it shares characteristics with both that make it attractive for imaging. Similarly to infrared radiation, terahertz radiation can initiate energy transitions within materials and be used to spectroscopically identify various materials and chemicals through their unique spectral fingerprint. And like microwaves, terahertz radiation can penetrate many nonconducting materials — such as plastic, clothing, masonry, and semiconductors — enabling nondestructive imaging through these materials, but with a superior spatial resolution due to its shorter wavelength.\nThese penetrating properties make terahertz imaging attractive for materials analysis, industrial non-destructive testing, and security screening. Terahertz will pass through fabric and plastics but be strongly absorbed by metals, creating contrast in the image. It is equally appealing for biomedical applications because it can penetrate farther into tissue than visible and infrared. It is also nonionizing, possessing an energy ~1 million times lower than typical imaging x-rays. Therefore, it poses little risk to health and is unlikely to cause photodamage in biological samples during imaging.\nAt present, the most established terahertz imaging methodology is an extension of the THz-TDS technique, in which the sample is raster scanned through the pulsed excitation spot to build up a two-dimensional image pixel by pixel. This approach provides a wealth of information but suffers from long acquisition times due to the step-wise method of image creation. A wide variety of alternative imaging techniques are therefore being actively researched to utilise continuous-wave terahertz sources, one of which is continuous-wave terahertz digital holography.\nFigure 6: Off-axis digital holographic imaging setup using the 2.52 THz line from methanol. Adapted from Ref 4.\nIn continuous-wave terahertz holography, the interference pattern between a terahertz wavefront scattered by an object (the object beam) and a coherent wavefront that has not interacted with the object (the reference beam) is recorded using an array detector (Figure 6).4 The amplitude and phase information are encoded in the hologram, enabling amplitude and phase-shift images of the object to be numerically reconstructed, which reveals information on the internal structure. Since the image formation process relies on coherence between the object and reference beams, a source with a long coherence length, such as an optically pumped molecular laser, is required.\nA video-rate terahertz holographic imaging system that used an Edinburgh Instruments FIR-295 terahertz molecular laser as the source was recently demonstrated in a laboratory setting.5 Using the system, the researchers were able to image a metallic object concealed within a paper envelope and a polyethylene bag, highlighting the potential of terahertz holography for real-time remote sensing in industrial quality control and security screening. The utility of digital holography for various biomedical imaging applications is also under intense research.6,7 The technique is capable of distinguishing between cancerous and healthy tissue, and it could be used by surgeons to identify tumour boundaries prior to surgical resectioning of cancerous tissue.6,7\nTerahertz spectroscopy and imaging technology have advanced significantly over the past decade. The optically pumped molecular terahertz laser has helped drive this progress and Edinburgh Instruments terahertz lasers are the workhorses of terahertz research laboratories throughout the world. Continued improvements in the performance and availability of terahertz sources, detectors, and signal processing will open up increasing fundamental and industrial applications to the power of this unique region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n- T.Y.

Cūra Earth, founded by Dr. Aubrey Tauer and Dr. Melissa Raguet-Schofield, combines science, social action, and creativity to achieve sustainable health of people, animals, and ecosystems in Nicaragua. Regarding climate impacts on health in Nicaragua, several diseases are significantly affected by climate conditions. Dengue cases show strong correlation with rainfall patterns, with peaks during wet seasons. Temperature affects both virus and mosquito reproduction, with optimal conditions between 25-32°C. Additionally, extreme rainfall can lead to water contamination causing diarrheal diseases, while droughts reduce clean water availability. During events like Hurricane Mitch, these health impacts were particularly severe, leading to increased cases of respiratory infections, diarrhea-related diseases, and vector-transmitted diseases like dengue and malaria.	['What is in a name?\nA history lesson\nCūra is not a word we come across everyday. However it has special meaning to the mission of this organization. Cūra is Latin, originally from the Proto-Indo-European “koys-“ (to care for, cure). The Latin form is the root of the modern day word for cure. Cūra‘s definition includes care,concern, solicitude, healing, and guardianship- all of which this organization’s mission is about in reference to the Earth and the life on it.\nThere is an ancient Roman fable about a goddess named Cura:\n“In crossing a river, Cura gathered clay and, engrossed in thought, began to mold it. When she was thinking about what she had already made, Jove arrived on the scene. Cura asked him to grant it spiritus, “breath” or “spirit.” He grants her request readily, but when she also asked to give her creation her own name, he forbade it, insisting that it had to carry his name. While the two were arguing, Tellus (Earth) arose and wanted it to have her name because she had made her body available for it.\nThe judgment is finally rendered by Saturn. He determines that since the spiritus was granted by Jove, he should have it in death; Tellus, or Earth, would receive the body she had given; because Cura, or Care, had been the creator, she would keep her creation as long as it lived. To resolve the debate, homo, “human being,” would be the name, because it was made from humus, earth.” *\n*Available under Creative Commons license http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura\nMission and History\nCūra Earth combines science, social action, and creativity to achieve sustainable health of people, animals, and ecosystems.\nCo-founders Dr. Aubrey Tauer and Dr. Melissa Raguet-Schofield met in 2003 during a field primatology course in Nicaragua. Dr. Raguet-Schofield went on to do her dissertation in physical anthropology in Nicaragua, while Dr. Tauer became a wildlife and public health veterinarian. Both scientists fell in love with the country, and wanted to do more to help the people, wildlife, and domestic animals. In June of 2011 we decided to co-found Cūra Earth to apply the principles of ecohealth (also referred to as conservation medicine) to find solutions to the many problems developing nations face. As this organization grows, we hope to expand programs to other countries and even parts of the United States that could benefit from the science, social action, and creative methods of outreach we conduct.\nAims and Scope\nCūra Earth aims to advance health by uniting ecology and the biomedical sciences. The organization’s work integrates the fields of human and veterinary medicine, anthropology, ecology, earth sciences, and ecosystem management.\nAs an organization working at the intersection of environmental health, human health, and animal health, Cūra Earth will:\n- Focus on neglected diseases and neglected populations\n- Develop novel programs for solving public health problems, including the use of new technology\n- Provide training and medical services to impacted populations of people, domestic animals, and wildlife\n- Research anthropogenic change and the drivers of emerging diseases of humans and animals in terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems\n- Assess risks related to habitat degradation, trade of wildlife and plants, and climate change\n- Conserve wildlife and wild lands\n- Provide outreach using both traditional methods as well as new media, art, and social networking\nScope: Cūra Earth is a non-profit organization dedicated to developing comprehensive international research, conservation, and public health programs. Because many of the issues and diseases we work with do not respect human created boundaries, as we grow many of our programs will span multiple countries and even continents. Our focus is on endangered habitats and threatened species, and indigenous or disenfranchised human populations.\nCūra Earth is one of the few organizations working in the emerging fields of One Health and EcoHealth. These fields seek to forge collaborations amongst different healthcare professionals and ecological scientists, as well as perform research on how change in the earth’s environment affects human health.\nDr. Aubrey Tauer, DVM, MPH\nPresident & Chief Scientific Officer\nDr. Iga Stasiak, DVM, DVSc\nBoard of Directors:\nAubrey Tauer, DVM, MPH\nMelissa Raguet-Schofield, Ph.D\nTherese Genis, MPH', 'PAST CLIMATE IMPACTS ON HEALTH IN NICARAGUA\nAs part of the CRM TASP, Altamirano and Guzmán (2012) studied the impacts of past climate patterns on diarrhoea, dengue and\nleptospirosis. These are some of the most important diseases in Nicaragua and are expected to depend significantly on climate\nconditions. The statistical analysis focused on the SILAIS, or health regions, of Managua, León and Chinandega, because of the\nhigh prevalence of the three diseases in these areas. The authors looked at correlations of temperature and precipitation with the\nnumber of cases of the three diseases, both on a monthly basis to detect seasonal patterns, and with annual data, to look at the\nimpact of specific events as well as possible longer-term trends.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO, 2012a) defines diarrhoeal diseases “as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per\nday (or more frequent passage than is normal for the individual),” which leads to dehydration and loss of nutrition. Diarrhoea kills\n1.5 million children worldwide every year and is the second leading cause of death in children under five years of age. Diarrhoeal\ndisease is caused by bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms that infect the body through contaminated food or water, or from person\nto person. According to MINSA (2011), 264,848 cases of acute diarrhoea were reported in 2010 in Nicaragua. Of these, 99,469 cases\nwere reported in the SILAISs of Managua, León and Chinandega. This amounts to an increase in cases for these three regions of\naround 50 percent compared with the 2000 to 2009 average (Altamirano and Guzmán, 2012).\nClimate variables can have an important influence on the prevalence of diarrhoea. For example, at higher temperature levels, the\ninsects that carry bacteria reproduce more rapidly. Extreme rainfall can lead to contamination of water, which increases the breeding\nground for bacteria, viruses and parasites. Droughts can also reduce the amount of available clean water and thereby increase\nhuman contact with contaminated water.\nDue to a global resurgence in recent years, dengue is now the most common mosquito-borne viral disease in humans, with an\nestimated 50 million infections a year worldwide. It is mainly transmitted by the predominantly urban mosquito Aedes aegypti and\nleads to flu-like illness or even dengue haemorrhagic fever, which can be lethal.\nClimate conditions can influence the spread of dengue in several ways. Temperature levels affect the survival and speed of reproduction\nof both the virus and the mosquitoes that carry it. At different stages of their life cycle, mosquitoes require temperatures of around\n25° C to 32° C. Transmission can occur within a temperature range of around 14° C to 40° C. Higher temperatures can shorten the\ntime between the infection of the vector and the vector’s ability to infect someone. Water temperatures are particularly important,\nas the mosquito larvae grow in water. In warmer water they tend to develop more rapidly but will be smaller as adults, and as a\nresult, they need to bite more often in order to feed themselves with blood. Rainfall, on the other hand, can have an effect on the\navailable breeding area. Both heavy rainfall and droughts can create pools of water where mosquitoes can reproduce and grow.\nWater deposits in and around settlements are of particular importance for dengue, a predominantly urban disease (Altamirano and\nThe number of suspected monthly dengue cases closely follows seasonal rainfall patterns. Based on monthly averages for the period\nfrom 1993 to 2010 and applying a one-month lag between rainfall data and the number of cases, Altamirano and Guzmán (2012)\nfound a 78 percent, 89 percent and 93 percent correlation for Managua, León and Chinandega, respectively. While the analysis\ncannot prove a causal relationship, this result strongly supports the hypothesis that periods of heavy rainfall increase breeding\npools for disease-carrying mosquitoes. The second-highest\npeak on record occurred in 1998, when El Niño conditions initially brought warm and dry weather before Hurricane Mitch brought\ndevastating rains in October. In the month of October, 1,985 mm of rain fell in Chinandega. The year 2010, the last and highest peak\nin dengue cases, was a very wet year, with one tropical depression and two storms and annual precipitation exceeding averages.\nLeptospirosis is a bacterial disease that can cause high fever, severe headaches, muscle pain, chills, redness in the eyes, abdominal\npain, jaundice, haemorrhages, vomiting, diarrhoea and a rash. Humans contract it through water contaminated by urine from\ninfected rodents or other animals. It enters the human body through skin abrasions and the mucosa of the nose, mouth and eyes.\nAlthough not well-documented, leptospirosis occurs worldwide and peaks in the rainy season in endemic regions (WHO, 2012a).\nBacteria need water or high humidity and temperatures between 20° C and 37° C. They survive best in standing water, ponds, swamps and lagoons, but die quickly under\ndry conditions (Altamirano and Guzmán, 2012). Because transmission requires contaminated water, cases typically peak in the rainy\nseason, and the disease can reach epidemic dimensions during floods (WHO, 2012a).\nA comparison of climate and health data shows that observations in Nicaragua are in line with expected patterns. Of the 8,952 cases\nthat were reported in the three SILAISs of Managua, León and Chinandega between 1996 and 2010, over 80 percent occurred in the\nmonths of October and November, right after the peak of the rainy season. What is interesting about this disease compared with others is the fact that peaks are very\nhigh, so that there appears to be an epidemic threshold that, if passed, leads to a rapid spread of the disease.\nNicaragua’s ‘First National Communication to the UNFCCC’ (República de Nicaragua, 2001) looked at the impacts of climate change\non malaria. Higher temperatures are expected to increase the prevalence of malaria, because they increase the speed of reproduction\nand growth of the mosquitoes that transmit the disease. Also, below a certain temperature, the mosquitoes don’t survive. Rainfall\ncan affect the prevalence of malaria in similar ways as for dengue, as the mosquitoes need standing waters for reproduction.\nAccording to community consultations conducted by López et al. (2011), dry conditions often lead to an increased prevalence of\nrespiratory diseases, mainly from increased contamination of the air with dust. It is also worth mentioning the results of a study by\nDelgado Cortez (2009), which looked at the impacts of heat stress on sugarcane farm workers, who are exposed to temperatures\nof up to 34.5° C. The output of workers who didn’t drink at least six litres of water was almost one-third lower than that of workers\nwho did drink sufficiently. Apart from the occupational health risk for the involved workers, this highlights the economic damages\nof climate-induced health stress.\nHealth impacts of Hurricane Mitch\nECLAC (1999) conducted a thorough impact assessment shortly after Hurricane Mitch struck Nicaragua in October 1998. They\nlooked at, among other things, social and economic impacts in the health sector. This detailed analysis offers insights into some of\nthe more complex direct and indirect consequences of extreme events for health:\n- The main reported causes of morbidity were acute respiratory infections, acute diarrhoea-related disease, skin diseases, impetigo, conjunctivitis, and the resurgence of vector-transmitted diseases such as cholera, dengue and malaria.\n- The destruction of the health infrastructure reduced the system’s response capacity at a time when demand was soaring.\n- The high number of victims and displaced people and the destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure led to massive hygiene problems, which in turn facilitated the spread of respiratory and diarrhoea-related diseases as well as meningitis and dengue.\n- Providing people with enough water and food in the emergency was difficult because of high demand and destroyed infrastructure.\n- After the disaster, flooding, damming and landslides favoured the creation of new sites prone to the generation of vectors, which has caused increases in cases of leptospirosis, rabies, Chagas’ disease and leishmaniaiasis, along with acute respiratory\n- infections and diarrhoea-related diseases.\n- Total economic losses caused by the hurricane were estimated at US$53 million, including direct damage to structures, equipment and installations and indirect costs stemming mainly from campaigns to combat hurricane-related diseases.\nhealth_and_climate_nicaragua.pdf (2.23 MB)']	['<urn:uuid:b20cda29-84b1-4c1c-b026-0d0838ccddc0>', '<urn:uuid:cff2c9a2-0d57-400c-9ef0-732ee3008b8c>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	15	112	2039
28	workplace rewards vs punishment system differences purposes	Rewards and punishments serve different purposes in the workplace. The reward system, which includes monetary bonuses and non-monetary incentives, aims to encourage positive performance and behavior, satisfy employee curiosity about their performance, develop employee potentials, and serve as a basis for promotions. Employees are naturally motivated to work harder when they know rewards are available. The disciplinary system, on the other hand, is designed to correct employee behavior or performance through a progressive series of actions. These actions range from verbal warnings to termination, depending on the severity of misconduct. The purpose is to maintain a healthy and productive workplace while ensuring employees are treated fairly and consistently. Companies must document both rewards and disciplinary actions in the employee's personnel file to maintain proper records.	"['In our everyday activities, we are doing so many things that require management of our time and resources. Even in our homes, we are tasked to perform our duties as a mother, father, son, daughter or grandparent. We are so busy during the day trying to accomplish the task and trying to beat the deadlines. But at the end of the day, have you ever considered evaluating your performance? Have you ever assessed your efficiency and effectiveness? Have you ever checked your improvements? Do you even want to be successful? What is success for you then?\nThese thoughts linger on our subconsciousness as we are trying to make our everyday living. It is our challenge to not only survive the day but also achieve or even surpass our objectives. How do we know that we are doing “okay” for that day? Performance evaluation.\nApplying this to the corporate and business world, every organization has its own organizational goal in which every member must help in achieving it. To help the management in assessing whether or not the goal is achieved or the level of performance still needed or required if the target is not yet achieved, there has to be performance evaluation.\nWhat Is Performance Evaluation?\nPerformance evaluation is a systematic way of examining how well an employee is performing in his or her task. The evaluation should be planned and should allow feedback. Performance evaluation should be contained in an evaluation report and may be in a form of an evaluation questionnaire.\nWhy Is Performance Evaluation Important?\n- To encourage positive performance and behavior: It is our mentality to work harder if we know that we are being evaluated at a certain period of time. With this, we are being motivated indirectly to push beyond our limits. Companies usually give rewards to top performers. So naturally, employees would try to do their best to achieve their target.\n- To satisfy employee curiosity as to how well they are performing: When the ratings of the employees are announced in a timely manner, for example, monthly, they will look forward to that same day of the month and become curious of their performance or their improvements. They will as well get intrigued on how well their co-employees performed. Just be careful not to cause unhealthy competitions. Only healthy competitions should be promoted. If you are the employee or the supervisor or one of the key personnel, observe symptoms of unhealthy competitions and encourage your members to compete on their own self and to surpass their limits, rather than comparing their achievements to others. Everyone has their own capacity, but by proper guidance and motivation, everyone can undoubtedly surpass their limits.\n- To develop employee’s potentials: Everyone has potentials stored within them, waiting to be fully unleashed. One might just need a little motivation and inspiration to keep the fire of their goals burning in their hearts. Having the performance of the employees evaluated may help them gauge up to what extent are they working and to how much more they are needing to hit the target.\n- To serve as a basis for incentives, promotions, or disciplinary actions: Companies would commonly offer incentives and promotions to compensate a job that is very well done. This method usually works if properly implemented by the management team and with the help and motivation of the immediate supervisors. For employees who are constantly not hitting the target set by the company, there are corresponding sanctions that await them. Disciplinary actions might be implemented not only to punish the employees who have not reached the quota, but also to remind them as well as to motivate them to exert more effort than what they have given right now.\nDisciplinary actions may be included but are not limited to the following.\n- Verbal warning. Usually, companies would give a verbal statement to an employee violating the rule or company policy examples on the first instance, and usually, the intensity of the offense is not grave.\n- Written warning. After the first warning, usually the verbal warning, a written warning may be sent to the employee violating the company rules. It is a formal notification from the employer extended to the employee, making the latter aware of the violation he or she has committed. This is also usually given if the intensity of the offense is just light to moderate.\n- Suspension. If the sanction of the employee for a violation com a fitted is suspension, it is either he or she has done a serious violation or has committed repeating violations. Different companies have different methods and types and graveness of violations depending on their company policies. Notice of suspension is given to an employee in writing. Suspension may be for a week or two or even a month, depending on the severity of the violation committed.\n- Dismissal. If an employee has committed a violation over again or if he or she has committed a grave offense, it is usually in a company’s code of conduct to sanction such employee, and the worst disciplinary action that an employee might receive is dismissal. An employee may be dismissed or discharged from work if the offense is very severe.\nCompany incentives commonly include the following.\n- Monetary. This is a money-based reward given to an employee when an employee hits the target or exceeds expectations. This may include cash bonuses, profit sharing and other reward that can increase an employee’s compensation.\n- Non-monetary. Contrary to monetary incentives, non-monetary incentives are incentives that do not involve money. This usually includes gifts, gift certificates, office materials, or any other that a superior or the company management might think. Giving incentive is a way of thanking an employee for his or her effort that exceeds the standards set by the company; it also motivates an employee to retain his performance or to do more than what he is doing.\nOn the employee’s shoes, performance evaluation is a way to measure their work for the day or for the month. It is also a motivating factor for them to work more to achieve the objectives set by the upper management. Evaluating the performance of an employee would also help him or her to assess himself or herself on how much more effort he needed to achieve the task. For example, in a sales company, an employee may be tasked to hit a target of $200,000 per day, but as per evaluation, a certain employee hit only $150,000 a day. With this, the employee is informed to do more to have an additional $50,000 sales in order to achieve the target. Why would an employee wanted to reach the target? Then, the incentive would come in the way. It is actually either incentive or disciplinary action for poor performance or negligence of duty.\nOn the other hand, on the employer’s side, the management or employer is looking after each employee to ensure that company goals should be attained. With this, performance evaluation is needed so that employers would know how much more would the group needed to hit the target. If most of the employees are performing poorly, the management would be alarmed, and it may be an indication that the management might have to recalibrate their ways on how to inspire people and to push employees beyond their limits.\nPerformance Evaluation Form Samples\nEmployee Evaluation Form\nExempt Positions Job Evaluation Form\nFieldwork Performance Evaluation Form\nGeneral Performance Evaluation Form\nGoals and Performance Evaluation Form\nPerformance Factor Narrative Form\nPlain Performance Factor Form\nProbationary Employee Performance Evaluation\nSimple Employee Performance Evaluation Form\nStaff Evaluation Form\nStudent Performance Evaluation Form\nHow to Evaluate Performance\n- Compare the target or standards set by the company to the performance of the employee.\n- Seek reviews from the staff, the key personnel or the immediate supervisor.\n- Consider the degree of difficulty of a given task.\n- Judge the output, not the potential of the employee, for potentials are limitless.\n- Constantly review performance for the period.\n- Avoid rating pitfalls: inflated rating because of using a less stringent standard to a professional member, evaluation on the basis of a single performance, inconsistency of rating system, or taking the matter personally on the employee.\nAfter the evaluation of the performance, it should be documented for future purposes like for comparing individual performances whether a certain individual has improved or not. It can be documented either in a soft copy or a hard copy, whichever is preferred by the company. Documentation can also be the basis for feedback.\nFeedback for the Performance Evaluation\nAfter the evaluation has been done, the task of the management does not stop there. In order to assess and make action to the performance of an employee, a feedback must be given and must be in a written form for clarity and to avoid misunderstandings. Some feedback that is common in a performance evaluation is the following.\n- Achievement – The employee is assessed on the level of achievement he has done and on whether he has or has not achieved the target.\n- Administration – This also includes assessing an employee on how well he administers his or her time and how well he or she manages his or her resources including planning for a certain project. Promotion might be given to employees who exceed their supervisory skills.\n- Cooperation – An employee will also be rated on his or her cooperation to the success of the group or his or her individual success.\n- Creativity – Creativeness can be measured by how an employee makes something novel out of the very same thing that he has faced everyday. It is thinking outside the box and having new and unique perceptions to certain things.\n- Improvement – Assessing improvement is better than assessing output. Constant improvement will lead to excellent output. As it is said, we have limitless potentials, so everyone can improve in their own little ways through perseverance.\n- Interpersonal skills – This is an assessment of how an employee communicates to his co-employees and his level of the way of communicating to other people.\n- Problem-solving – An employee is assessed on how he could solve a certain problem and what are the ways on how he handles a problem if he has given such.\n- Productivity – Productivity is a measure of one’s efficiency and effectiveness in his work and is demonstrated on the output by an employee over a given period of time.', ""In human resources, disciplinary actions are a type of personnel action taken by an employer for their misconduct to correct employee behavior or performance.\nDisciplinary action can range from a verbal warning to termination of employment. The type of disciplinary action taken will depend on the severity of the misconduct and the company's policy.\nWhat is the Definition of Misconduct?\nMisconduct is any behavior not following the company's rules and regulations. Common examples of misconduct include:\nTypes of Disciplinary Actions\nThere are three main types of disciplinary actions:\n1. Verbal Warnings\nVerbal warnings are the most common type of disciplinary action. They are usually given for minor infractions and are meant to warn the employee that their behavior or performance is not up to par.\n2. Written Warnings\nWritten warnings are more serious than verbal warnings and are usually given for more serious offenses. They are a formal way of documenting the employee's infraction and typically include a list of expectations for the employee to improve their behavior or performance.\nTermination is typically reserved for employees who have committed serious offenses or have failed to improve their behavior or performance despite repeated warnings.\nHow are Disciplinary Actions Carried Out?\nWhen an employee is found to have committed misconduct, the first step is usually a verbal warning from their supervisor. If the misconduct is more serious or the employee has been warned before, the next step may be a written warning.\nThe written warning will outline the misconduct and the consequences of continued misconduct.\nIf the employee continues to exhibit misconduct, the next step is usually a suspension. Depending on the company's policy, it may be with or without pay.\nA suspension is usually the last warning before termination, so the employee must be aware of the seriousness of their misconduct.\nOnce an employee has been terminated, are usually not eligible for rehire. It is because termination is considered the most severe form of disciplinary action.\nThe disciplinary action process is essential for maintaining a healthy and productive workplace. It is also vital to ensure that employees are treated fairly and consistently.\nNote that every organization is unique with its own cultures, management styles, expectations, risks, and other factors that influence the disciplinary measures it takes.\nFor example, some organizations will view and treat certain behaviors—such as sexual harassment in the same way as absenteeism, while others may not!\nWho Decides Whether or Not to Take Disciplinary Action?\nIf an employee breaks a company rule, it is generally up to the supervisor to decide whether to take disciplinary action. The supervisor will usually consider the severity of the infraction, the employee's record, and the company's policies.\nFactors that can influence the decision to take disciplinary action include the following:\nThe severity of the infraction: A minor infraction may warrant a verbal warning, while a more serious infraction may warrant a written warning or even termination.\nThe employee's record: If the employee has a history of breaking the rules, this will likely influence the decision to take disciplinary action.\nThe company's policies: Some companies have strict policies that dictate when and how disciplinary action should be taken. Others may be more lenient.\nHuman resources: In some cases, the decision to take disciplinary action may be escalated to human resources. They may be involved in the decision-making process or guide the supervisor.\nHow Disciplinary Actions Should Be Documented?\nDisciplinary actions should be documented in the employee's personnel file and handled consistently and reasonably to avoid legal issues.\nIt is because disciplinary actions can significantly impact an employee's career, and if they are not well-documented, it can be challenging to prove that the actions were justified.\nThere are a few things that should be included in any documentation of disciplinary action –\nFirst, there should be a clear description of the committed infraction. It should include what the employee did wrong and how it violated company policy.\nNext, the documentation should include the consequences that were given to the employee. It could consist of a written warning or a suspension. It is essential to be clear about the consequences, so the employee knows what to expect.\nFinally, the documentation should include the date of the disciplinary action. It is important to track when the action was taken and how long it occurred.\nBy including all the essential information, it will be easier to show that the actions were taken somewhat and as per company policy.\nIf you are an employer, you must consult with an HR professional or attorney to ensure that your disciplinary actions are legally defensible.\nIf you are an employee, you should be aware of your rights and understand the disciplinary process at your workplace. You may have legal recourse if you feel that you have been unfairly disciplined.\nAre there any Alternatives to Disciplinary Actions?\nOne alternative to disciplinary action is to offer counseling or coaching. Counseling can help employees identify the root cause of their rule-breaking behavior and find ways to avoid it. It could be done either in person or via an employee assistance program.\nSome companies choose to offer educational opportunities instead of disciplinary action. It could involve sending the employee to a training course or providing information on the rule they broke.\nThis approach aims to help the employee learn from their mistakes and prevent them from making them again in the future.\nWhich of these alternatives is best depends on the company culture and the severity of the rule violation. Companies may find that a combination of these approaches is most effective.""]"	['<urn:uuid:61ace8ff-7836-461b-b22d-abcaa0230d73>', '<urn:uuid:0dc11c5b-39b0-41dd-9926-f6f9734bbbc6>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	7	125	2683
29	As an aquatics facility manager, I'm curious about the Wibit inflatable obstacle course - what are its programming advantages for pools, and what safety measures need to be implemented when using such inflatable equipment?	The Wibit inflatable obstacle course offers programming advantages by creating excitement similar to TV shows like Wipeout, helping attract students to facilities, and working in various pool depths due to its modular design with different depth-rated elements. However, comprehensive safety measures must be implemented, including: having trained lifeguards constantly vigilant and rescue-ready, developing a detailed supervision plan, removing unsupervised children from the water, prohibiting activities like diving or running, providing clear safety signage, and ensuring proper risk assessment of flotation devices that could impair supervisor vision. Additionally, an effective emergency plan, proper first aid equipment, and trained first aid officers must be in place.	"['The Wild World of Wibit\nDecember 16, 2015\nAdventures in Programming\nAquatics and Safety Coordinator\nWeber State University\nWith the popularity of shows such as Wipeout and American Ninja Warrior, inflatable obstacles have become a popular programming option for many universities across the country. Campus Recreation departments are always looking for new programming ideas to implement and the Wibit provides a unique program that gives students an experience similar to what they are watching on television.\nWhat is a Wibit? To define it simply would be to say that Wibit is not a product, but rather a company. The product Wibit manufactures is an inflatable obstacle course for use in aquatic programming. When a programmer sees Wibit, they see a world of excitement and possibility. When a Risk Manager sees Wibit, they run the other direction. At least, this was the experience of Weber State University when Campus Recreation purchased a Wibit obstacle course.\nIn the fall of 2013 the Campus Recreation department at Weber State University opened a newly renovated building with an expansion and new equipment. Because these renovations didn’t include the pool, the Aquatics Coordinator at the time was tasked with finding a new, fun program to implement in the pool. She came up with Wibit. Another local community pool already had one of these courses and had success in implementing it, so with some research and some student input, the department decided to buy one. However, once the Wibit arrived, the implementation was not as easy as taking it out of the box, inflating it, and throwing it in the pool. In the excitement of buying the Wibit, Campus Recreation forgot to take one critical step—convincing our stakeholders it was feasible.\nOur facility at Weber State is unique in the fact that, other than our new expansion, our facility is not owned by us. Much of our programming space actually belongs to an academic department, including the pool. So when the Wibit was delivered to the pool deck, the first person to see it was the academic facility coordinator. She was not excited. What ensued was a battle with the academic department and university risk management in order to prove that we could safely implement this programming. In the end, a compromise was made and Wibit Nights are a popular program in our facility. However the journey to implementation was not easy. We learned many lessons along the way and will continue to learn as we move forward. Here are the four biggest lessons we learned in our process.\n1. Wibit can work for almost any Aquatic Facility\nWeber State University has a six lane, 25 yard pool. The minimum depth is four feet and the maximum depth is eight feet. It is primarily a lap swimming pool, and many programmers would say our ability to run programs is quite limited. However, there are many things we can still do in our pool. For instance, we have run programs such as SUP Yoga, Dive-In Movies, Triathlons, and of course, the Wibit.\nThe great thing about Wibit is that different elements of the obstacle course are rated for different pool depths. So if your pool is very shallow, you can purchase only shallow elements. Although they have “pre-set” courses, you can also buy pieces individually, as they have a universal set-up system so any two pieces can attach to each other. The key to getting the right pieces for your pool is to do your research. It is also important to look into what you will need to secure the Wibit to the walls. The company provides ropes that must be used to secure the Wibit, but it is up to you to find the best way to attach those ropes to the wall, whether you rig them to lane line hooks in the wall, diving blocks, or some other structure.\n2. Don’t leave your stakeholders out of the decision-making process\nIn our case, our two biggest stakeholders were the academic facility coordinator and our university risk officer. Neither of these stakeholders are programmers, so it took a lot of convincing on our part to prove we weren’t out of our minds, especially since we failed to consult them before we bought our Wibit.\nIt is especially important to come up with a risk management plan to present to your organization’s Risk Officer, with detailed explanations of how you are going to minimize any risks of injury that are associated with using the Wibit. Some information to include: how many lifeguards you will have on shift, how many participants can be on the Wibit at one time, and rules such as no jumping, no diving, and no sliding face first.\n3. Training, Training, Training!\nStaff training is critical to successful implementation of the Wibit. When I started my position in July 2015, only two of my staff members knew how to set up the Wibit and guard for it. I didn’t even know how to set it up, so I could not effectively train my staff until I had been trained. In order to remedy the lack of training, these two lifeguards lead an in-service to train everyone how to set up the Wibit and important things to remember about guarding a Wibit event.\nAn in-service training is a great way to train all your staff at once and to give refresher training, but when new staff is hired, you have to do it all over again. Some facilities use manuals or have shadow shifts for that initial training. At Weber State we are creating an electronic training manual that will include pictures and videos on the set-up. This will become a part of new employee orientation and staff members will have to take a quiz on the Wibit before they guard a Wibit event.\n4. Storage and Maintenance are necessities\nStorage and Maintenance have turned out to be our biggest issues since implementing our Wibit. Being a small pool intended primarily for lap swimming, we do not have a lot of storage space in our facility for large equipment. The Campus Recreation department has one small storage closet on the pool deck. Any other storage space is across the building. It is extremely important to have adequate storage space for the Wibit. Our Wibit has a few large, heavy pieces and were previously stacked in a corner blocking a door. Although they fit in our storage closet, they don’t leave a lot of walking room or storage space for other equipment.\nBe sure to analyze your storage options before purchasing your Wibit. In addition, it is important to make sure the Wibit is properly stored. It is critical that all pieces be rinsed off and left to dry completely before putting them away. Rinsing them minimizes chlorine residue and drying completely prevents mold.\nAlong with maintenance of the actual Wibit, we also ran into some issues with maintaining the accessories. The Wibit comes with a pump to inflate and deflate the pieces, but when inflating five large pieces, it overheats and burns out. My first experience with the Wibit at Weber State was helping the lifeguards inflate using hand pumps because both of our pumps had overheated. In order to overcome this obstacle, we bought another pump and we now inflate the pieces throughout the day before the event, instead of trying to do everything the hour before the event.\nOverall, implementing the Wibit at our facility has been great for our Campus Recreation Department. At a school where most students commute and don’t even know we have a swimming pool, it has helped bring students into our facility to learn about all the programming we offer. It has created buzz on campus about our facility and we’ve had other organizations ask to rent our Wibit.\nAlthough we chose to purchase a Wibit, there are a lot of options out there for unique aquatics programming. The things that Weber State learned through implementing the Wibit can be applied to implementing a wide variety of programming from Battleship, to SUP Yoga, to Dive-In Movies. It is important to remember that despite any set-backs you may have, any program can be successful with proper planning.', ""In December, a young girl was pulled from a local swimming pool unresponsive. Thankfully though, she quickly recovered. The girl was at the pool for school-based activities.\nAlso, in December, a member of public was pulled from a swimming pool unresponsive. Unfortunately, the man couldn’t be revived. It appears he may have suffered a medical episode.\nIn November, a 20-year-old man was also pulled from the bottom of a swimming pool. Sadly, he later passed away.\nThese findings are not yet confirmed, and investigations into these three incidents are continuing into the exact cause.\nSwimming pools are used mainly by children and young people as an avenue for having fun. However, drownings do occur and are tragic, especially when children are involved.\nThere are substantial penalties in the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Act) if it is found a pool operator has not taken adequate steps to prevent a person drowning.\nLifeguards play a critical role in preventing drownings. The most critical skills for a lifeguard are those that prevent drownings. Pool operators must ensure lifeguards are constantly vigilant, attentive and rescue ready.\nThe Royal Life Saving Society Australia (RLSSA) has developed guidelines, in consultation with the aquatics industry across Australia, to provide advice to the industry on the minimum requirements to prevent or minimise the risk of drowning in publicly accessible pools.\nThe supervision component of the guidelines provides practical guidance for operators on the type, quantity and location of supervision needed within an aquatic environment.\nA pool operator should manage health and safety risks by:\n- conducting an aquatic supervision risk assessment\n- preparing a supervision plan\n- providing trained pool lifeguards, pool supervisors and first aid officers\n- ensuring young people or people with limited swimming competency such as children are accompanied by adults who need to supervise them\n- ensuring children under five years of age are constantly supervised by an appropriate parent/guardian who is prepared to swim (adequate supervision means the parent/guardian must accompany the child in the water and always remain within arm’s reach)\n- ensuring children under ten years of age are constantly accompanied by an adult while in the aquatic area\n- ensure unsupervised children under five years of age are removed from the water and placed in a safe area until collected by the parent/guardian\n- ensuring an unsupervised child of poor swimming ability, regardless of age, is removed from the water by a staff member\n- prohibiting and monitoring activities such as diving, running and hypoxic training\n- providing information or signage about pool safety (e.g. accompanying adults to supervise their children, prohibited activities, pool depth)\n- removing or prohibiting the use of permanent or semi-permanent flotation devices when there is no supervision of their use\n- restricting entry to areas of increased risk or that require higher levels of swimming competency (e.g. slides, diving boards, deep water).\nPublic swimming pools and aquatic facilities present a number of health and safety hazards, including those which increase the risk of drowning, such as:\n- large bodies of water often with many people using them at the same time\n- users of all ages with varying levels of swimming experience\n- design or construction of the pool hindering line of sight of supervisors\n- pool depths that change suddenly\n- the presence of personal buoyancy devices (floaties, tubes) or large water-borne inflatable devices permanently or semi-permanently located in pools for common use (slides, bouncing castles, line ropes) which may impair the vision of adults or those supervising pool activities\n- slips, trips and falls from wet surfaces.\nFirst aid and emergency situations should be covered by ensuring:\n- an effective emergency plan is in place and is tested regularly\n- resuscitation signage is clearly visible\n- appropriate access to first aid equipment and trained first aid officers\n- first aid officers are properly trained and can administer an advanced level of first aid and resuscitation (such as administering oxygen or using an automated external defibrillator)\n- first aid facilities and equipment are appropriate to the size of the pool facility.\nPool operators are reminded that important information for the safe running of the pool facility can be found in the Guidelines for Safe Pool Operations which is released by the Royal Life Saving Society of Australia.\nThe guidelines also cover:\n- safe pool operations\n- guidance for pool operators as a minimum standard for running their pools.\n- water safety\n- guidance for aquatic environments operated by bodies corporate, hotels, motels, camping and caravan grounds, commercial learn to swim schools and school pools and aquatic environments that are part of urban water developments\n- water safety - body corporate pools\n- guidance for aquatic amenities such as residential units, apartment blocks, high rise style apartments and retirement villages.\n- water safety - hotel, motel, camping and caravan grounds\n- guidance for any swimming pool and/or spa facility within a resort, hotel, motel, camping or caravan ground environment\n- water safety - commercial learn to swim and school pools\n- guidance for any swimming pool and/or spa facility within a commercial learn to swim environment of a swimming pool or a pool located at a school.\n- water safety - urban water developments\n- guidance for purpose-built water environments near or around areas where the general public may go, e.g. parkland and reserves.\nThe guidelines are available at Royal Life Saving Society - Australia website.\nThe RLSSA also produces fact sheets and national polices to assist swimming pool operators and inspectors.\nWays to manage health and safety\nTaking steps to manage risks is a condition of doing business in Queensland. Effective risk management starts with a commitment to health and safety from those who manage the business. If an incident occurs, you'll need to show the regulator that you’ve used an effective risk management process. This responsibility is covered by your primary duty of care in the Work Health and Safety Act 2011.\nUse the hierarchy of controls to help decide how to eliminate and reduce risks in your place of work. The hierarchy of controls ranks types of control methods from the highest level of protection and reliability to the lowest. It’s a step-by-step approach to eliminating or reducing risks. You must work through the hierarchy of controls when managing risks, with the aim of eliminating the hazard, which is the most effective control.\n- Managing risks at publicly accessible pools – information guide (PDF, 0.21 MB)\n- How to manage work health and safety risks code of practice 2021 (PDF, 0.65 MB)\n- First aid in the workplace code of practice 2021 (PDF, 0.48 MB)\n- Royal Life Saving Society – Australia\nSupport for people affected by a serious workplace incident\nFor advice and support:""]"	['<urn:uuid:3978e70c-bd12-433d-b3ee-b961d8a55cf6>', '<urn:uuid:21ad8999-fd2e-4516-96dd-6e3a97800289>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	34	104	2492
30	what is sattwa and how to increase it	Sattwa is the foundation of creativity and inner peace. To increase sattwa, you can: watch sunrise or sunset in nature, eat fresh vegetarian food when the sun is high, take a shower before yoga (but wait 15 minutes after yoga to shower), and use sandal or rose incense or essential oils. It's important to avoid stimulants like coffee, tea, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, garlic, onions, and synthetic perfumes, as these increase rajasic energy. You should also avoid meat, stale food, poorly-ventilated rooms, oversleeping, overeating, and lack of cleanliness or exercise, as these increase tamasic energy.	['Deepening the Yoga Practice\nBy Swami Sivadasananda\nThis article offers practical advice to help you with the inner experience of yoga. It is important to remember that progress in our practice should be approached in a holistic manner.\nIf we experience difficulties in one aspect of our practice, we can balance these out by other aspects where we may be more proficient. In fact to be strong in one aspect does not necessarily indicate overall progress.\nAsanas and the Three Gunas\nIn order to increase harmony and peace within our lives, we need to be aware of the influence of the three gunas or the three qualities of nature. These are sattwa, rajas and tamas.\nConnect with Sattwa\nSattwa is the foundation of creativity and inner peace. Watch the sunrise or sunset out in nature. At this time sattwa predominates in the atmosphere and uplifts body and mind. Eat fresh and pure vegetarian food at times when the sun is high, rather than after sunset. Water neutralises energies. Take a shower before practising yoga, but wait at least fifteen minutes after a yoga session before showering. The scent of sandal or rose from good incense or essential oil enhances sattwa.\nAvoid all stimulants such as coffee, tea, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, garlic or any of the onion family, as well as synthetic alcohol- based perfumes. Loud music, too much talking, or associating with large groups of people all increase rajasic energy.\nMeat and stale food, poorly-ventilated rooms, oversleeping, overeating, lack of cleanliness in your living space, and lack of physical exercise all increase tamasic energy.\nPositive Effects of Asanas on the Gunas\nThe energy changes experienced during asana practice are actually not an increase in quantity, as commonly perceived, but rather a change in quality. The vibratory level changes from tamas and rajas to sattwa.\nImagine a yoga class where half the students enter with a rajasic energy. They are unable to relax, their breath is accelerated and they constantly adjust their pose. The other half of the class is in a tamasic state. Their bodies feel heavy, breathing is short and shallow, and the relaxation pose seems the only attractive posture for them.\nNow imagine the class is told to come into the shoulderstand and hold it quietly for three minutes. Those students with rajas, will find the holding uncomfortable. Their minds say: “I need variation.” As they hold the pose, after a minute or so their breath will automatically deepen and slow down, muscles will relax, and the energy will shift to sattwa.\nThose students with more tamas in their system will also find maintaining the posture uncomfortable. But their question will be “When can I return to the relaxation pose?” Holding the pose will stimulate the breath and heart beat, and tamas will be transformed into rajas and then into sattwa.\nThe more we avoid tamasic and rajasic influences in our daily lives and the more contact we have with sattwic influences, the more quickly the asanas will change our vibratory level. With practice, even twenty to thirty minutes of asana practice will be enough to produce a change in the gunas. The practice of asanas gives us tremendous confidence to face whatever challenges life presents us with, because we begin to understand that creativity and peace are accessible with each session. More advanced yogis can change the gunas by mere will power.\nAsanas and the Yamas and Niyamas\nBoth the physical body and the mind are a manifestation of Mother Nature, or shakti, in her microcosmic form. The yamas and niyamas of the eight-limbed or ashtanga yoga system are guidelines for a harmonious relationship with the world, or shakti in her form as macrocosm.\nThey are non-violence, truthfulness, sublimation of sexual energy, non-stealing, non-acquisitiveness, cleanliness/purity, contentment, austerity, study of the scriptures and surrender to God.\nThe spiritual aim of asanas and pranayama is to awaken the dormant shakti in the muladhara chakra or root chakra at the base of the spine and to unite her with Siva or the unchanging consciousness in the crown chakra at the top of the head. The higher the shakti moves up in the chakras, the more she is experienced as universal energy. Finally the experience of the inner and the outer shakti become One.\nIf the universal laws of the yamas and niyamas are ignored, shakti as the Soul of the world is negated. The practice of asanas loses its spiritual meaning and the inner shakti will not reveal herself. Here, the practitioner will tend to shift his attention outwards.\nThe asana experience will be more isolating than unifying and the shakti will manifest as maya (illusion) in thoughts such as: “Oh what exceptional capacities I have, what exceptional physical purity I have (this thought itself is a mental impurity), what exceptional physical beauty I have.” Asanas practised as “performance yoga” in order to attract the attention of others leads nowhere.\nAn ashram or yoga retreat is an ideal place to experience the interrelationship of the yamas and niyamas and the asanas. Communal living in simple conditions enriches us when we approach it with a spirit of sharing. If we come with the attitude “what’s in it for me?” we become isolated and end up unhappy and dissatisfied.\nThe possibilities for tension and friction are innumerable. When they are overcome through yamas and niyamas, the inner shakti responds positively in the asanas and expansion of consciousness occurs while practising.\nKarma yoga or the practice of selfless service for the good of others offers the best practical training for the acquisition of the yamas and niyamas.\nPratyahara and Dharana in Asanas\nPratyahara is the imitation of the mind by the senses, which comes by withdrawing the senses from their objects. Raja Yoga Sutras II/54\nThe five senses function through the projection of prana. It is an illusion to think that we take prana in when we use our senses. For example, for the ear to hear, nerve impulses travel back and forth between the central nervous system and the ear, and prana is projected towards the sensory object.\nThrough pratyahara or withdrawal of the senses, the senses become so well controlled that they simply follow the mind. If the mind does not want to hear sounds, the sense of hearing is automatically withdrawn. Asanas can help attain mastery over this limb of raja yoga.\nWhen we hold an asana we focus on the movement of prana in the body. We project prana to contract certain muscles and then withdraw it again to relax them. The movement of sense-energy is similar, only the vibratory level is higher.\nDuring asana practice, we may feel subtle sensations in the body, such as body weight, a subtle warmth or the perception of infinity when we visualise the space in the atoms of the cells. These experiences turn the senses inward, thus avoiding, in a natural manner, the need to repress the outward-moving tendency. The sensory experience in asanas is so attractive, that these outward-moving tendencies are relinquished with little or no resistance.\nThe mind is prana at the highest vibratory level. Dharana or concentration is difficult because we must abandon all thoughts that distract us from the object of concentration. In asanas there are innumerable ways to help the mind concentrate.\nThere is variety, and yet this variety is contained within one field, the body. We develop dharana by projecting mental prana onto that one field. The more we practise control of prana through asanas, the better the chance we have of experiencing dharana.\nOvercoming Body Conditioning\nThe way our body is built actually determines how we view time and space. We look ahead into the future, while behind us lies the past. When we are awake with our eyes open, we create mental patterns which lead us to perceive life in terms of future or past events. With this to contend with, how can we dream of reaching the yogic ideal of “being here now”?\nYoga asanas skillfully take us away from the notions of ahead and behind, front and back. Forward bends are counterbalanced by backward bends, and vice versa. Even though there may be quite some movement during a yoga class, we do not stray from the mat.\nDuring relaxation, we move systematically from the feet to the head, following the pathways of the peripheral nervous system and back to the central nervous system, i.e. the spinal cord and the brain. The same pattern is applied in pranayama and the meditation exercises. The upward flow of energy not only takes us away from spatial perception, but stimulates the chakras, creating a different perception of time.\nOvercoming the Conditioning of Language\nThe same limitations, which have their source in the environment, occur with language.\nHere is an object – a table for example, and it must have a name to have a form. But also very subjective experiences such as emotions are labeled with words.\nThese words reflect a collective consciousness, which does not necessarily correspond to the consciousness of the individual. The average vibratory level in society is of rajas (activity, passion). Language is not only used in spoken communication, but is also the fundamental vehicle for the thinking process. It is therefore difficult\nto raise the awareness to higher levels of consciousness, if the very words with which we think correspond to the relatively low vibration of the collective consciousness.\nMantras are words which were not created to describe objects and are not related to the collective consciousness. They were revealed to sages in deep meditation. The root sounds of mantras correspond to the vibratory levels of the chakras.\nSymbolically traditional drawings of the chakras represent petals of the chakra- lotus, each associated with one letter of the Sanskrit alphabet. When we repeat a mantra, we bypass the mechanism of ordinary language, and connect to higher mental states such as intuition and inner peace.\nSwami Sivadasananda is Yoga Acharya and teaches workshops throughout the Sivananda Centres in Europe and Teachers’ Training Courses Worldwide.']	['<urn:uuid:4880221c-7126-4e90-9773-83e619d89d4f>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	8	94	1671

32	wood replacement process violin neck heel restoration technique	The repair involved soaking a thin piece of aged maple in hot water until flexible, then applying hot hide glue and clamping the flexible maple into the scooped area using a cork clamping block. Once the glue was completely dry, the wood was planed flat to match the original shape of the neck heel.	['Resurrecting an Old Violin From Alabama\nRepair Procedure: “Young Lady from Alabama” Violin 1/2017\nThis Violin came to me because a young lady in Alabama had read my article on violin repair, and decided she wanted me to fix her fiddle.\nShe sent me a few photographs to see whether I thought it was repairable and worth repairing. I said yes, on both counts, and she shipped me the violin. She knew that it was not an expensive, high-quality violin, but it was special to her, and she felt that the investment would return a better violin for her to play than the cheap one she was currently playing, and give her more pleasure as well, because of the sentimental attachment.\nHere is the original photo I saw:\nShe sent me the fiddle, carefully packed, and it arrived unharmed. Fortunately, I got home immediately after the FedEx people dropped the package on my porch, as it was raining hard, but the package was nearly completely dry.\nBut, this is what I found inside:\nStarting Condition (as seen from outside):\n- The neck is separated from the button. (above)\n- The neck block is broken. (below)\n- The treble side upper bout rib is damaged at neck joint (and is “re-touched” with red ink).\n- There is missing wood at the heel of the neck.\n- There is at least one repaired crack in the top plate.\n- Remove all the fittings and strings; store them in the case pocket.\n- Remove the neck.\n- Make a cork-lined clamping caul, to hold the ribs in proper alignment.\n- Remove the top plate and inspect all interior conditions.\n- Crack repair was “OK”, but minimal: add 2 cleats, clean up the three old cleats.\n- There is missing wood from previous top removal. Repair it, before closing.\n- The bass-side upper bout rib is cracked. Repair it before closing.\n- The saddle fell off—re-install after closing.\n- Remove the old neck-block.\n- Repair the damaged ribs, and replace the missing wood at the neck-heel.\n- Install the new block, using hot hide glue and clamping caul.\n- Level the front of the garland.\n- Re-install the repaired front plate, including original saddle.\n- Re-set the repaired neck.\n- Minimally “dress” the Fingerboard.\n- Retouch the varnish all over, as needed. (It should look nearly new…the violin was quite glossy before.)\n- Set-up the violin, using old pegs and chinrest, but replacing all else.\n- New tailpiece with four tuners (with her approval)\n- New bridge\n- New soundpost\n- New Dominant strings\n- New cork on Chinrest clamping surfaces\n- Add a few business cards\n- Add an invoice.\n- Play and adjust for best sound.\n- Pack and ship to Owner\nSounds pretty straightforward, doesn’t it? And, really, that is about how it worked out:\nThere was also missing wood at the neck-heel: At some point in the history of this fiddle, it had been snapped loose from the neck block, and a piece of wood about the size and shape of a fingernail had chipped out of the gluing surface of the neck. (photo up above) This is a critical joint, so the wood had to be replaced.\nI soaked a thin piece of aged maple in hot water until it was flexible, during which time I scraped smooth the scooped out place in the heel. Then I slathered in the hot hide glue, and clamped the now-flexible maple into the “scoop”, using a cork for a clamping block. When the glue was completely dry, I planed the wood flat to match the original shape of the neck heel.\nMeanwhile, the inside of the top plate needed attention: there was a (poorly) repaired crack to attend to, several bits of missing wood, etc.\nI replaced any missing wood using spruce, cut to fit, and hot hide glue. While I had the top off, I cleaned up the old crack, and added two more diamond-shaped cleats. The importance of this shape is that it minimizes stress on the grain of the undamaged wood. That square, block (center cleat) above could cause a new crack to form along its edge. I eventually carved the old cleats to a thin taper, to minimize the danger.\nFinally, the top can be re-installed on the garland. First I leveled the garland, so that any inconsistencies caused by my replacing that neck-block will be eliminated, and the top will fit cleanly. Then I dry-clamped the top in place, and, loosening a few clamps at a time, I inserted hot hide glue all around the edges, especially at all six blocks. As I completed the glue insertion in each area, I replaced the clamps and gently re-tightened them, then cleaned off any glue squeeze-out.\nThe result? The body is reassembled and the next step is re-setting the neck.\nOnce the neck is fitting exactly, I double check all dimensions and angles and finally slather hot hide-glue in the joint and ram the neck-heel home, checking rapidly to make sure everything is still correct. Then I clamp it so that it stays secure until that glue is fully set and dry.\nSo, I have to file and smooth the neck-heel joint, then re-touch the varnish so that the old and new are a close match, at the heel and both ribs. Then re-touch all the varnish, not attempting to make it new, but to cover any bare or damaged wood with varnish that matches the original varnish.\nThe rib-patch is not invisible, but it is no longer objectionable, so I am satisfied.\nAnd finally, everything is done! The set-up is complete, all the old dings and scuffs have been retouched, and the old fiddle looks and sounds great.\nTime for this one to go home.']	['<urn:uuid:9fc13bd9-395f-4585-b900-eab82e38cde7>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	8	54	967
33	From my experience in religious community outreach, I'd like to understand how contemporary churches balance environmental awareness with visitor engagement - what's the relationship between ecological focus and visitor attraction in modern churches?	Environmental engagement has become critical for church outreach, with Forest Churches specifically addressing this through nature-based worship and environmental stewardship, responding to both climate and biodiversity crises. This environmental focus aligns with visitor expectations, as research shows potential church visitors are seeking inner peace (37%) and hope (35%), which these nature-connected spiritual spaces can provide. The emphasis on environmental concerns is increasingly mainstream and particularly important for attracting young Christians.	['Plymouth Wild Church\nPlymouth Wild Church is part of the Forest Church movement\n“Could now be the moment for ‘Forest’ churches to grow?”\nA article by the Environmental Engagement Officer in the Gloucester Diocese, Reverend Cate Williams. She explains why Forest Church could see growth during and beyond the Covid-19 pandemic. 18/03/2021\nIn 2020, many who had never thought of taking outdoor worship seriously were inspired to give it a go, prompted by safety considerations around gathering indoors. Worshipping outdoors isn’t however simply a response to the pandemic, there has been a growing movement towards outdoors worship against the background of the twin climate and biodiversity environmental crises, rooted in a desire to reconnect with God’s creation.\nN.B. DC has been working in the Forest Church movement for the past 25 years in Devon and in Hertfordshire.\nIn wider society, environmental charities and Forest School are helping us to reconnect with nature, with initiatives such as the National Trust’s ‘50 things to do before you are 11 ¾’ proving popular. There is growing awareness that in order for individuals and society to take environmental considerations seriously, we need to love what we are seeking to protect.\nForest Church adds a spiritual dimension. The intent is to both enable participants to grow in love for God’s creation, and to grow in thankfulness towards the God who made it. Forest Church at its best engages with people who would be unlikely to attend indoors worship, with many saying that nature is their ‘spiritual’ place. It provides a framework within the Christian tradition around experiences that, using the term loosely, many would label as spiritual, as well as encouraging love for creation and environmental ethic.\nNot just forests!\nForest Churches vary hugely and don’t need to meet in a Forest! Some are quiet and contemplative, others focus on children and families, with the energy, chaos and creativity that this brings. Many work in an intergenerational way, incorporating aspects both for children and families and for adults attending without parenting responsibilities. There is no right way to go about it – it all depends on local relationships and networks, and on what outdoor spaces are available as locations for worship. I’ve come across Welly Church, Muddy Church, Outdoor Church and Wild Church.\nThere are all kinds of good reasons for moving worship outside which is in a similar style to that which could happen in the church building, but that isn’t Forest Church. At the heart of a Forest Church gathering is actively choosing to engage with God’s creation, in awe, wonder and thanksgiving, and to make this the heart of worship.\nMuch is about noticing and appreciating – sometimes just exploring what is there, other times using resources such as spotter sheets and colour matching cards. Often the turning of the seasons are referenced, noting how nature lives out on an annual basis the death and resurrection that is at the heart of the Christian faith. Hope is profoundly illustrated for us, as we observe nature dying back each winter, trusting in the coming of spring (Romans 8.22-25). These prayers produced for Easter 2020 illustrate the different ways this might work in practice (link opens PDF).\nWhat happens in a typical ‘service’?\nIn my own Forest Church, most gatherings involve starting together with some opening prayers, reference to the season and how it links to Christian themes, perhaps a bible reading though that may come later. We then explore in nature through whatever is the chosen core activity on that occasion, often walking as we explore. We re-gather and talk about what we have done and found, perhaps with a reading at this point. There may be time for each to wander individually to pray in a space, at some point there are some closing prayers, and a reminder to tread gently on God’s world as we return to our normal rhythm of life.\nThe environmental imperative\nIt is increasingly critical that Christians engage with environmental concerns as part of core discipleship, whether worshipping indoors or outdoors. There’s a much-neglected biblical imperative to tend God’s creation and an urgency with which the current environmental crises are presenting themselves. Given the urgency of the crisis and given the increased prominence within wider society, the church cannot expect to be taken seriously by faith explorers if they’re not modelling good practice in this area of life. A recent report published by Youthscape and Tearfund highlighted the prominence of environmental concerns with young Christians. This is no longer a fringe concern for keen ‘greenies’ but is increasingly mainstream.\nThis brings with it a challenge to all churches, indoors or outdoors, Fresh Expressions or with long history, to find their right path toward sustainable practice, living gently with respect to all God’s creatures, as together we praise our maker.\nFor those wanting to explore some more:\nFor further informationon Plymouth Wild Church please contact David Curry at firstname.lastname@example.org', 'Churches want to be places that are open for people outside the congregation to visit. But are they perceived as such by those who aren’t Christian or who don’t currently have a church home? Understanding the external perceptions and expectations of church buildings can be key to outreach and mission.\nIn Making Space for Church Visitors, a Barna briefing produced in partnership with Aspen Group, we look at seven insights that shine light on the significance of the design and function of today’s churches, and how this impacts a church community’s ability to welcome visitors.\nIn this excerpt, we’ll highlight two of the seven insights featured in the briefing. Be sure to subscribe to Barna Access Plus so you can be one of the first to read the full release.\nVisitors to Your Church Might Feel More Comfortable in Honest, Safe Spaces\nTo make space for potential church visitors is to make space for trust, transparency and safety. Barna’s Spiritually Open project repeatedly highlights how the general population today, including those outside the Church, are eager for honest faith. In fact, nearly one in three unchurched teens and adults (31%) tells Barna they would be “very comfortable” attending a Christian church where the pastor or priest openly discusses their doubts about Christianity as a manifestation of authenticity. In Making Space research, we also see that U.S. adults, including the churched and unchurched, seem to gravitate to what feels “authentic” versus “professional,” by wide margins.\nAt the same time, the unchurched may initially be hesitant to personally embrace authentic, vulnerable conversations within a church. When it comes to topics concerning daily life—such as loneliness, depression, anxiety, relationships and career—unchurched respondents in the Making Space survey rarely choose a Christian church as a comfortable environment for meaningful conversation. Respondents in this group also say they rarely visit a church if they are feeling lonely, depressed, introspective or even social.\nChurch buildings don’t appear to be inviting to outsiders for holistic, whole-life conversations and growth, except as it concerns specific and explicitly spiritual aims. Unchurched adults desire authentic dialogue, but they don’t see church as a place where this can happen. Why? How “safe” an unchurched person feels may play a role.\nThinking about Christian churches, close to half of unchurched adults (45%) strongly agree churches should be a safe place for hurting people. Additionally, when asked the purpose of a church building, second on the list among unchurched adults is providing safety and security (36%).\nChurch Visitors May Be Looking for Inner Peace\nBeyond the physical aspects of the church, just over half of unchurched adults (53%) tell Barna they believe that church is “a sacred space” rather than “just a building” (30%). This group also points to nature (69%), memorial sites (50%), churches (48%) and cathedrals (46%) as being transcendent or “a place that brings a person closer to experiencing connection with something beyond the physical world.” U.S. adults, across all demographics, associate this transcendence with “a sense of peace or calm.”\nAlthough they are aware of transcendent places, most U.S. adults fail to visit these types of spaces. For unchurched adults, this is even more true (just 14% of unchurched adults regularly visit places they would consider transcendent). For the unchurched, what could be missing because they tend to occupy less-than-transcendent environments? Perhaps it may contribute to a deficit of the very feeling they report makes a place transcendent: peace.\nWhen people experience a lack of calm in daily living, its presence can signify something otherworldly. Here the Church is uniquely positioned to offer something the world cannot. As C.S. Lewis put it, “God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from himself, because it is not there. There is no such thing.”1\nThis peace is something potential church visitors—especially those who are spiritually open—may be seeking. Research from Spiritually Open hints at this: When Barna asked U.S. teens and adults to share what, specifically, they are looking for in their spiritual beliefs, the plurality chooses inner peace (37%), followed by hope (35%), healing and forgiveness (30% each).\nChurches have a special opportunity to draw in visitors with spaces that provide a feeling of peace, purpose, safety and more. How might your church do this? Consider emphasizing church design and use that evokes characteristics of the places, feelings and experiences we’ve described.\nAbout the Research\nResearch for Making Space consists of data and analysis based on an online quantitative survey of 2,000 U.S. adults, conducted from February 28–March 9, 2022. The margin of error for the sample is +/- 2.0 percent at the 95 percent confidence level. For this survey, researchers used an online panel for data collection and observed a quota random sampling methodology. Quotas were set to obtain a minimum readable sample by a variety of demographic factors, and samples were weighted by region, ethnicity, education, age and gender to reflect their natural presence in the United States population (using U.S. Census Bureau data for comparison).\nThe Spiritually Open project is based on a survey of 2,005 U.S. adults and teenagers (ages 13-17) conducted online from December 13–22, 2022 via a consumer research panel. The margin of error for the sample is +/- 2.0 percent at the 95 percent confidence level. Quotas were set to representation by region, race / ethnicity, education, age and gender based on the U.S. Census Bureau. Minimal statistical weighting has been applied to maximize sample representation.\nAdditionally, a survey among 511 U.S. Protestant senior pastors was conducted online from December 13, 2021–January 3, 2023. Participants are all members of Barna Group’s Proprietary Pastor Panel. Minimal weighting has been used to ensure the sample is representative based on denomination, region and church size.\n1. C.S.

34	What diagnostic approaches and treatment durations exist for brain lymphomas?	For diagnosis, stereotactic needle biopsy is the preferred method in sporadic cases, while in AIDS patients, the response to toxoplasmosis treatment helps differential diagnosis. CSF examination may show lymphocytic pleocytosis, and immunohistochemical demonstration of monoclonal lymphocytes can indicate tumor spread. Regarding treatment duration, radiation therapy regimens typically last between three to seven weeks, with sessions conducted every weekday. Follow-up appointments occur 3-6 weeks after the last radiation session, with subsequent monitoring every 6 months to check for recurrence.

Cancer cells differ from normal cells not only in their appearance but also in how fast they divide and form new cancer cells. The radiation is programmed in a way that it attacks and destroys only rapidly dividing cells, which ensures that normal cells are not affected.\nAlternate Name of Radiation Therapy for Brain Tumour\nExternal Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT)\nHow is Radiation Therapy for Brain Tumour Performed?\nBrain tumours are treated using high-powered radiation sources that aim to attack only cancer cells. For highly invasive tumours, surgeons use radiation to shrink them before they can surgically remove them. Radiation therapy is very effective even as a standalone treatment for brain tumours and is also non-invasive.\nThere are many types of radiation therapies – EBRT, 3D conformal therapy, Intensely Modulated Radiation Therapy, Stereotactic Radio Surgery, Conformal Proton Beam Therapy, and more. These different types of radiotherapies differ in source radiation, but in all of them, a focused beam is projected towards the tumour area in the brain, which aims to kill the cancer cell.\nWith the advancements made in medical science, doctors are now able to guide high-energy beams in different directions using imaging techniques such as MRIs in real time. A machine sends the rays of energy to the tumour. This treatment is usually done every weekday over a course of three to seven weeks.\nIn brachytherapy, small seeds of radioactive substances are placed in or around the tumour surgically. This way, only local tumour areas are affected by the radiation spreading from the seeds. Once treatment is completed, the surgeon will remove these seeds via a catheter or applicator.\nPreparation for Radiation Therapy to Treat Brain Tumour\nBefore radiation therapy, your doctor may require you to undergo a couple of procedures. Some of them are:\n- Pre-operative imaging such as a 3D MRI: Before undertaking radiation therapy, the oncologist will assess the pros and cons of different treatment modalities in order to ensure the best possible outcomes. For this, pre-operative imaging scans are carried out that help determines the invasiveness of cancer.\n- Radiation simulation: Radiation therapy requires you to be extremely still, and so a simulation will be carried out by your oncologist to ensure you can find a comfortable position.\n- Dietary requirements: Your oncologist will guide you with a detailed diet plan as some foods such as those high in acidity and sodium need to be avoided when receiving radiation.\nNon-invasive, unless brachytherapy is performed\nA radiation therapy regimen can last anywhere between three to seven weeks. Once the radiation regimen is completed, the doctor will ask you to come for a follow-up appointment 3-6 weeks after the last session of radiation therapy.\nThe doctor may ask you to get periodic PET scans to assess whether the radiation has affected your cancer and how much. On the assessment of the same, they will further guide you on the next steps you need to take. This follow-up may be carried out every 6 months after the initial sitting, to ensure cancer has not recurred.\nIn case of radiation therapy has been used to shrink the tumour before surgery, the doctor will assess your fitness and your ability to handle an invasive procedure following which they will guide you for the surgery. It is ideal to report any and all side effects to your doctor during these follow-up visits.\nRisks for Radiation Therapy to Treat Brain Tumour\nSome of the risks posed by radiation therapy are:\n- Side-effects: Damage to surrounding areas in the body may result in mood imbalances and fatigue, nausea, headaches, and so on.\n- Hair loss: Patients undergoing radiation therapy for brain tumours report hair loss 2 to 3 weeks into the therapy. The hair almost always grows back after 3-6 months.\n- Vision or memory loss: Although quite rare, if the tumour infringes on the areas of the brain that are responsible for either vision or memory, radiation therapy may result in damage to surrounding areas and cause temporary vision loss or memory loss.\nRecovery From Radiation Therapy\nMost side-effects of radiation therapy such as mood imbalances, anxiety and nausea are mild and resolve on their own and fairly quickly. However, it is advised to report any and all side effects to your oncologist.\nAs far as cancer is concerned, the response of cancer to treatment is quite subjective. In most cases, cancer responds well within a few weeks of radiation therapy. If the aim of the therapy is to shrink cancer, then this sign is followed up with surgery, which prolongs the recovery period due to its invasiveness. In case cancer does not respond to the therapy, the oncologist may suggest alternative treatments.\nRadiation Oncology Therapy: How Radiation Therapy Is Used for Cancer Treatment\nIn Nanavati Max Institute of Cancer Care\nApr 24, 2323\nDifferent Types of Radiology and Its Techniques\nApr 24, 2323\nGet Second Opinion\nGet free second opinion from India’s leading specialists.']	['<urn:uuid:bbf0b73e-9da9-4571-a0e8-9f3210b0b0e0>', '<urn:uuid:88cbe9a4-b87f-43fd-8ead-5ae247350706>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	10	78	1936
35	exercise requirements dog weight loss program	The program includes 2 daily activity sessions, starting with short durations and gradually increasing to 2 x 30-minute sessions of walking, off-leash activity and play. For obese dogs, activities can include land-based exercises targeting core muscles, underwater treadmill therapy, and exercises tailored to each patient's ability, especially for those with conditions like osteoarthritis.	"['Canine obesity can lead to a range of diseases. Veterinary rehabilitation practices with weight loss programs will help overweight patients shed excess pounds, thereby improving their overall health and longevity.\nCanine obesity is not just one disease – it represents a major risk factor for a plethora of serious yet preventable health problems. That fat, adorable, jiggly Labrador in your exam room is at risk for developing diabetes mellitus, urinary incontinence, osteoarthritis, and pulmonary diseases, as well as many other life-threatening conditions,1 and is also at risk for a shortened life span.2 Veterinary rehabilitation practices offer you the opportunity to recommend safe and successful weight loss programs that will assist clients with obese dogs. Each patient will most likely present with a significant number of comorbidities (such as marked osteoarthritis) that must be carefully managed to ensure his safety. Trained veterinary rehabilitation therapists are perfectly positioned to help these dogs.\nStart with an in-depth client interview\nStudies have indicated that 34% to 59% of dogs are obese or overweight.1,3,4,5 In order to tackle this heavy problem (no pun intended), a number of investigations must begin. An in-depth interview surrounding the dog’s lifestyle should be conducted, including but not limited to:\n- Daily routine: A rundown of a typical day for the client’s dog.\n- Current activity level: This includes walks, runs, play, etc.\n- Quality of life: How does the client feel the dog is dealing with his weight?\n- Complete calorie count, including treats and table scraps: Don’t forget to ask how the client is measuring the dog’s food – do they use a common cup or a standard measuring cup?\n- Previous medical history, including recent bloodwork: It is absolutely essential to rule out any underlying metabolic conditions that will dampen weight loss efforts, such as hypothyroidism or hyperadrenocorticism.1\nSet mutual and obtainable goals with the client\nIt is also necessary to establish realistic expectations with the client. Every client’s lifestyle is unique, and weekly rehabilitation or underwater treadmill visits may not be reasonable or realistic to him or her. The client may not agree that the dog’s weight represents a major issue or hindrance to overall well-being. For these hesitant clients, the author provides research studies2 while also highlighting the fact that physically fit dogs, just like humans, are likely to live longer than overweight ones. It may be necessary to discuss the high probability of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and arthritis, and their associated financial costs. By setting mutually agreed-upon and obtainable goals, you will find clients are more compliant and honest, leading to more successful outcomes for weight loss programs.\nWeight loss program basics in veterinary rehabilitation practice\n1. Controlling the calories: food intake\nCounting all the calories coming into the dog beforeinitiating the weight loss program will make it easier to control the calories coming in after the program starts. As a trained veterinary canine rehabilitation therapist, this author prefers to have clients complete a “daily food diary” of everything and anything that enters the dog’s mouth. In more cases than not, one family member is the predominant “treat-giver” (or “calorie-provider”). Explaining to clients how to read the kilocalorie count on a treat or food bag will help them realize just how many kilocalories they are feeding their furry kids every day. It is strongly recommended that this food diary be kept up throughout the weight loss program in order to keep clients accountable for their dogs’ daily food intake.\nOnce clients understand the number of kilocalories their dogs should be consuming, it is then a matter of adjusting their daily kilocalorie intake. The veterinary market offers numerous weight loss diets that target satiety with increased fiber content. Alternatively, you may find that simply cutting out all high-calorie (and heavily-laden fat content) treats is a far more effective method.\n2. Safely increasing activity levels\nJust as in human medicine, increased activity levels can help burn fat and preserve joint function. For obese dogs, however, a veterinary rehabilitation weight loss program tailors the program to each patient’s current ability. Overweight or obese dogs are at increased risk for musculoskeletal injuries; concurrent diseases, such as tracheal collapse or painful osteoarthritis, can affect the safety of prolonged exercise. Land-based exercises, joint manipulation, land dog treadmills, acupuncture, and hydrotherapy (underwater treadmill therapy — UWTM) can be utilized to provide a safe, pain-free weight loss plan for any obese or overweight dog.\n- Land-based exercises consist of personalized exercises targeting core muscle groups, as well as exercises to increase endurance without placing excessive pressure on the joints. A major benefit of land-based exercises is that they can be taught to the client and continued in the home setting for the rest of the dog’s life. Once your patient has lost the excess weight, the next step is to maintain that lower weight! Veterinary rehabilitation therapists are trained in these exact areas.\n- Underwater treadmill therapy safely increases the obese/overweight patient’s endurance level via a reduced weight-bearing and buoyant environment. The warm water environment can aid in muscle relaxation and facilitate the motivation to walk. Turbulence and depth can all be controlled for a more individualized workout. Weaker patients will reap more benefits from the safety and control of an underwater treadmill than in open swimming pools. Research has demonstrated that raising the water level to hip height reduces the total body weight to about 38% .6 Swimming pools also offer these benefits, but in a more uncontrolled setting.\n3. Managing pain in patients with concurrent osteoarthritis\nFor obese dogs that also have advanced osteoarthritis, veterinary rehabilitation therapists offer non-invasive pain management techniques, including veterinary acupuncture and veterinary therapeutic laser therapy. These methods can be incorporated easily into any weight loss program. See Table 1 below for an example of a weight loss program within a veterinary rehabilitation practice.\nAnalyzing weight loss success\nWeight loss success can be measured in a number of ways; most often, of course, the measurement of true success is seeing numbers decrease on the electronic scale. While your clients may wish to quantify success this way, the author believes that a number of other factors should also be included when analyzing the success of a weight loss program. Every week, the following should be gauged:\n- Energy levels\n- Quality of life\n- Decrease or elimination of comorbidity signs (such as coughing from tracheal collapse or limping from arthritis)\nStance analysis can include weekly or bi-weekly standing photographs – body changes may appear very small from week to week, but an initial photograph or “before” video versus the end photograph or “after” video can speak volumes!', 'Dog Weight Loss Program FAQS / Help\n1. How does the dog weight loss program work?\n2. My dog has a health condition- can my dog participate?\nAs is the case with human diet programs, Dog Slim recommends that all canine participants of The K9 Weight Challenge receive a health check before commencing their weight loss program. Restricted calorie diets are unsuitable for some patients with pre-existing health conditions.\nOur downloadable veterinary description of the program can be provided to your veterinarian for their perusal to determine whether your dog is safe to commence our dog weight loss program.\n3. What age does my dog have to be, to participate in the dog weight loss program?\nThe K9 Weight Challenge is suitable for dogs aged over 1 year of age. (N.B. Giant breed dogs should be older than 18 months). So long as your dog is overweight and is otherwise healthy there is no maximum age limit.\n4. How much exercise does the program require?\nThe K9 Weight Challenge primarily focuses on managing your dog’s caloric intake to promote a healthy weight. Our activity plans are supplementary to this. We have three activity plans to choose from depending on your dog’s age, breed, current fitness and mobility.\nThe programs commence with 2 short activity sessions per day. These gradually increase in intensity to incorporate 2 x 30 minute sessions (of walking, off leash activity and play) per day.\n5. Am I required to feed my dog a specified food?\nThe K9 Weight Challenge does not endorse any one product of dog food. However for best rates of success we encourage our canine participants to be fed a commercialized “diet"" or ""light"" food or “weight loss” formulation for the entire program. You will be guided in selecting a suitable diet food for your dog as part of your pre-challenge prep week.\n6. My dog has a disability and cannot exercise – can he join the program?\nYes! Our program is suitable for all levels of mobility. Even if your dog is unable to participate in our activity schedule, canine weight loss can be managed through calorific restriction alone. This is particularly relevant for dogs awaiting surgery pending sufficient weight loss.\nWe have three activity programs available, suitable for varying breeds and levels of mobility and fitness.\n7. Can I have multiple dogs under the same enrollment?\nThis program relies on accurately calculating the calorific intake for your dog on an individualized basis. When it comes to metabolism and calorific requirements, no two dogs are alike. Our statistics page is set up to record data for one dog only. Multiple statistics and multiple calorie plan pages will require additional enrollments.\nA 50% discounted rate is provided for additional dogs enrolled under the same owner. Please email us to secure this discount.\n8. How much weight can I expect my dog to lose on your program?\nThe K9 Weight Challenge- dog weight loss program aims for canine participants to achieve 1-3 % body weight loss per week. This is in line with professional veterinary weight loss guidelines.\nWith strict adherence to our dog weight loss program the follow weight loss figures can be achieved over the course of 12 weeks:\n- Starting weight of 50 kg (110 lb) – lose 5.7-15 kg (12.6-33 lb)\n- Starting weight of 40 kg (88 lb) – lose 4.1-12.3 kg (9-27 lb)\n- Starting weight of 30 kg (66 lb) – lose 3.5-9.2 kg (7.7-20 lb)\n- Starting weight of 20 kg (44 lb) – lose 2.4-5.3 kg (5.3-11.7 lb)\n- Starting weight of 10 kg (22 lb) – lose 1.3-4.4 kg (2.9-9.7 lb)\n- Starting weight of 5 kg (11 lb) – lose 600 g-1.5 kg (1.3-3.3 lb)\n9. What happens if my dog does not achieve his target weight during the program?\nDepending on your dog’s starting weight and Body Condition Score, achieving your dog\'s healthy target weight within 12 weeks may not be possible. For dogs in the morbidly obese and upper obese range it can take up to 6 months or more to achieve their healthy target weight.\nYour dog will however have started on their weight loss journey and you will have learnt the tools and techniques to continue keeping them on track to reach their healthy target weight.\nOur dog weight loss programs teach you how to transition your dog to a suitable maintenance caloric intake once they achieve their target weight. For continued support, guidance and community, you may choose to re-enroll your dog in our ongoing membership option (coming soon).\n10. What happens if my dog achieves his target weight before the end of the program?\nIf your dog is only mildly to moderately overweight, this scenario is possible.\nOn the K9 Weight Challenge all dogs receive individualized calorie plans which are adjusted on an as-needs basis. Once the healthy target weight is met, a maintenance calorie plan is formulated. This maintenance plan aims to keep your dog at a healthy weight without further weight loss.\nYour dog’s weight, measurements and statistics will continue to be uploaded until the end of the program and you will continue to receive educational and motivational healthy weight information.\n11. How does the program conclude?\nAt the end of the 12 weeks participants receive a K9 Weight Challenge report card summarizing their weight loss journey.\nAn invitation to take out ongoing membership will be provided. This is especially valuable for owners whose dogs are yet to achieve their target weight and for owners who would like to receive ongoing support in maintaining their dog’s healthy weight.\n12. What happens if I take up the continued membership option?\nMany owners enjoy the continued support, motivation and comradery provided by the The K9 Weight Challenge community. This is especially the case for owners whose dogs start out in the obese weight ranges and who may not as yet attained their target weights.\nYour membership will provide you with ongoing support and calorie planning to help your dog attain their healthy target weight. The statistics from your dog’s first round are retained and built upon. Membership is provided on a month by month basis and can be cancelled any time.\n13. What happens if I need to go away or on vacation during the program?\nThe entire program is accessible from your mobile phone, so if your dog is travelling with you, location should not be an issue. As long as you have sufficient “diet dog food” supplies the program can be successfully completed anywhere.\nShould your dog need to go into kenneling or require the services of a pet sitter, we have a downloadable letter for your dog’s carer outlining your dog’s dietary and activity requirements as per the program.\n14. Can I provide home cooked meals during the program?\nHome cooked meals are acceptable providing you have a complete understanding of the calorie content of the food you prepare. The K9 Weight Challenge – dog weight loss program provides 4 easy diet recipes with suitable calorie and protein contents for dog weight loss purposes.\nTo ensure you feed your dog nutritionally balanced home-prepared meals we recommend the addition of pet vitamin and mineral supplements to all homemade dog food recipes.\n15. Can I restrict my dog’s regular dog food, instead of feeding a diet food?\nThis may be an option if your dog is only slightly overweight. (I.e. Body Condition Score of no greater than 6/9). As long as treats and extras are restricted, weight loss can be achieved by tweaking the quantity of your dog’s mainstay dog food.\nHowever if your dog needs to lose greater than 10% of their starting weight, we strongly advise changing your dog onto a diet formula. This is to avoid nutrient deficiencies. Commercial dog foods contain their nutrients in ratio to their calorie component. So by cutting back on quantity and therefore the calorie content of your dog’s regular food, you will also be cutting back on vital nutrients (i.e. vitamins, minerals, amino acids and trace elements.) Dog diet food is nutrient enriched to ensure adequate nutrient intakes despite the lowered calorie content.\nSignificant reductions to your dog’s current food portion may also cause issues with increased hunger levels which may reduce compliance with your dog’s weight loss program.\nIf your dog needs to lose greater than 10% of their starting weight we highly recommend feeding a calorie restricted diet dog food for the duration of this 12 week dog weight loss program.']"	['<urn:uuid:0db8bc28-da77-43e6-88c7-4784388abedb>', '<urn:uuid:c3eec2f1-225d-4558-85e7-beedb97be957>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	6	53	2518
36	climate change affects swiss settlement regions wisconsin dairy farms weather patterns history	The area where Swiss immigrants like the Zweifel family settled in Wisconsin in the 1850s has become a major dairy farming region, with Wisconsin now ranking first in cheese production and second in milk and butter production. However, climate change threatens this agricultural legacy with increased heat waves, droughts, and floods, which can reduce milk production, threaten livestock health, and make traditional farming methods more challenging.	"['Part 2 - Becoming AmericansIf you missed Part 1 of the story, go here . . .\nIn the middle of the 19th Century, six brothers, the sons of Johann Heinrich and Ursula would join the growing migration from Canton Glarus, Switzerland to New Glarus, Wisconsin. There is still some speculation as to the exact date or dates the brothers came over and what ship or ships they might have traveled on. What we do know is that all, except one, were recorded in the church records at New Glarus by 1854 and all seemed to settle in the town of New Glarus or the Town of Washington in northern Green County, Wisconsin.\n|A typical Wisconsin pioneer log house. The Zweifel|\nbrothers may have encountered and lived in houses\nsimilar to these when they first arrived.\nAdam was the third son of Johann Heinrich Zweifel and Ursula Zweifel and the oldest of the six who came to America. He was born in 1819 in Linthal. He married Verena Durst (b.1826, d.1965) in 1847 and already had four children by the time if his immigration. Verena was the daughter of Johannes Durst and Magdalena Legler. Of all of the brothers, his passage to America seems to be the most verifiable. Adam, Verena and their four children were listed on the passenger manifest of the ship Cotton Planter which sailed from Antwerp, Belgium and arrived at New York on June 10th 1853. Family history recorded that one of their children died prior to their departure in Linthal and another on the voyage. Ships records, however, list all four of the children and there is no death notation for any of them. While the death on board cannot be fully verified, it does seem certain that none of the children died in Switzerland. One other discrepancy is that the ship\'s records list the family as being from Germany, but because all of the names and ages are so accurate, it seems likely that this is Adam Zweifel from Linthal.\nAdam purchased a farm on Section 24 in the Town of New Glarus in November of 1853. Adam and Verena started a family and raised 10 children on the farm. Verena died in 1865. In 1871 Adam married Louisa Figi (b.1824, d. 1898). Born Loiusa Holsi, she was a widow with seven children, four of which were still at home at the time of her marriage to Adam. He formally adopted her youngest child, Margaretha. Adam would live out his life on the farm and die at the age of 80 in 1900. Adam and Verena\'s eldest son, Heinrich apparently left New Glarus for parts unknown after a family squabble. All of the rest of the children, except one daughter, moved on to Iowa. The farm was purchased by John Zweifel, the son of Adam\'s brother Bernhard. Adam is buried in the New Glarus Cemetery.\n|Part of the Ship\'s Manifest of the Cotton Planter listing|\nAdam Zweifel and Family on lines 222 - 227.\nThe fifth child of Johann and Ursula, Fridolin reportedly came to America in 1854. He was born in 1823 in Linthal. He married Regula Oswald (b.1836, d.1906) in either 1854 or 1855. She was the daughter of Fridolin Oswald and Maria Stussi who were reportedly from Canton Bern, Switzerland. It is unclear if Fridolin and Regula were married in Switzerland or Wisconsin. Additional information on Regula\'s family history has yet to be found. There is a Fridolin Zweifel listed in two passenger manifests. One is from the ship Rotunda (from LeHavre, France) which also lists Regula Zweifel and Albrecht Zweifel (see Albrecht below). The ship arrived in 1854 and the ages of the three seem correct. If Fridolin and Regula were married in Switzerland, it would have been just a few months before their departure. There is also a single man named Fridolin listed on the ship Mecadonia, which also arrived in that same year. There were a number of Zweifel\'s listed on that ship\'s manifest but Fridolin is grouped with a David Zweifel and his age is off by a few years so that record seems suspect.\nFridolin raised a large farm in the Town of Washington, just south of New Glarus and right next to his brother Bernhard\'s farm. He accumulated over 200 acres in three purchase made in 1860, 1864 and 1869. Fridolin and Regula had 11 children over an 18 year period. He died in 1879 and per a doctor\'s note, his death was caused by his refusal to undergo surgery for a hernia. After Fridolin\'s death, his eldest son Johannes wanted to buy the farm but Regula would not let him. She insisted on owning the farm and having her children run it for her. After a court battle, Johannes left and cut off contact with the family. Eventually, Regula moved to Monroe and most of the children quit the farm. She finally sold it to her son Fridolin in 1901. He in turn sold it to his son, also named Fridolin, and it remained in the family until 1967. Fridolin is a direct ancestor of this writer and more information about his family is found in part three of this report.\n|A contemporary view of the Fridolin Zweifel farm on Sections 4, 8 and 9 in the|\nnorthwest corner of the Town of Washington, Green County. At the top of\nthe map, between the two roads, is the beginning of Bernhard Zweifel\'s Farm.\nThe sixth child of Johann and Ursula, Peter came to America in 1854. He was born in 1824 in Linthal. There was a Peter Zweifel listed on the ship Mecadonia which sailed from LeHavre, France and arrived in New York in 1854. He is listed with two others (see Jost, below) and his age is correct so it could be this Peter. He married Barbara Zweifel (b.1839, d.1897) in 1869. She was many years younger than him and the daughter of Jakob Zweifel (d.1865) and Margaret Zweifel. It is unclear how Peter was related to his wife but her family was noted to be from Linthal so he was probably a distant cousin. Peter fought in the Civil War. He enlisted in Monroe in August of 1862, fought for the duration of the war and was mustered out in June of 1865. At his enlistment, he was noted to be 37 years old, medium build and a farmer from New Glarus.\nPeter served with the Company B of the 31st Wisconsin Infantry Regiment. They were organized at Prairie du Chein and trained at Camp Utley in Racine. In 1863 they headed to Kentucky. They initially performed a number of rear-duty operations that ranged from guarding prisoners in Wisconsin to protecting rail lines and bridges around Nashville and Chattanooga. Later they finally saw action at the siege of Atlanta. In the summer of 1864, they spent almost a month dug-in about 1/4 mile from the southern defenses and were under constant fire. After Atlanta, the 31st continued with Sherman on his march to the sea where the Company was engaged in foraging for supplies, building corduroy roads and a number of small battles in Georgia and South Carolina and then the Battle of Bentonville in North Carolina. They ended the war by participating in the “Grand Review” at Washington, D.C.\nThe seventh child of Johann and Ursula, Albrecht reportedly came to America in 1854. He is a bit of a mystery as there seems to be little information about him. Swiss records indicate he left Linthal but are unsure about his destination. Zweifel ancestors in New Glarus do not remember him and he was not recorded as a member of the church. He does seem to be recorded as dying and being buried in New Glarus in 1857. There is no record of him at the cemetery but records that early are often incomplete. There was an Albrecht listed as holding a mortgage for Adam Zweifel. There was also an Albrecht Zweifel on the voyage of the ship Rotunda, which sailed from LeHavre, France and arrived at the Port of New York on May 17, 1854. He is listed as being from Switzerland and is of the right age, though the handwriting of the age is hard to make out. On that voyage, he is listed along with a Fridolin Zweifel and Regula Zweifel.\nThe eighth child of Johann and Ursula, Jost came to America in 1854. He was born in 1827 in Linthal. He married Verena Zopfi (b.1834, d.1887) in 1854, reportedly, in Switzerland. She was the daughter of Johannes Zopfi and Anna Streiff. There was a Jost Zweifel listed as a passenger on the ship Mecadonia which sailed from LeHavre, France and arrived in New York in 1854. This Joist is grouped with a Peter Zweifel and Verena Zweifel. Jost\'s age is correct so at first glance, this might seem to be two brothers and a wife, however, Verena\'s is listed as only eight years old when she would have actually been 20. Her name is spelled correctly so it might be possible that the age is recorded wrong but that cannot be verified. Jost fought in the Civil War. He enlisted in Monroe in September of 1862. Family stories say that he was so angry over the outcome of an election that he abandoned his family and joined the army. They did not hear from him until he returned three years later. At induction, he was noted to be a 34 years old, middle-sized, grey-eyed, light-haired, fair-complexion, 5\'-11"" tall and a farmer from New Glarus.\nJost joined the 9th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment in October of 1862 where he served in Company B and F. The unit was known as the German regiment because it contained many veterans of the German Army. They were experienced, well trained and very disciplined. The regiment expected to be thrown into the war in the east but instead, ended up as part of the ""Southwest Expedition"" into Kansas, Missouri, Indian Territory as well as engagements in Mississippi and Arkansas. They spent most of the war performing the arduous task chasing small bands of guerrillas and Indians. Jost did see action in a number of small campaigns including such interesting locales as: Ferre Noire, Prairie D\'Ane and Poison Shrimps. His final battle would be at Jenkin\'s Ferry, where he was wounded in April of 1864. The battle was fought on mud soaked fields and in flooded swamps as the Union Army was trying to build a pontoon bridge to retreat across the Saline River in what would be the last battle of the Arkansas campaign. Jost was taken prisoner and held until July of 1865. It is reported that he was shot through the lung and never fully recovered from his wounds. When he returned home, he was so malnourished that his family did not recognize him. Despite this, he went on to live another 30 years.\n|Barbara Zweifel, the fifth born child of Jost.|\nThe ninth child of Johann and Ursula, Bernhard came to America in 1853 or 1854. He was born in 1829 in Linthal. There was a Bernhard Zweifel listed as a passenger on the ship Mecadonia which sailed from LeHavre, France and arrived in New York in 1854. This was the same record that lists Fridolin, Peter and Jost, though Bernhard is not grouped with any of these other Zweifel names. His age is correct so it could be this Bernhard. He married Barbara Kundert (b.1836, d.1922) in 1860. She was the daughter of Thomas Kundert and Elsbeth Voegeli from Ructi, Glarus. Bernhard farmed in the Town of Washington right next to his brother Fridolin. He bought 135 acres in 1860 and and additional 40 acres in 1872. His son, Thomas took over the farm in 1904 and ran it until 1955. Bernhard and Barbara had six children and after selling the farm, they lived a quiet life of retirement in the Village of New Glarus. They are buried in the New Glarus Cemetery.\n|Map of the Town of New Glarus (top) and northern half of the|\nTown of Washington (bottom). The farms of five Zweifel brothers\ncan be seen. From the 1873 Atlas of Green County, Wisconsin.\nThe next generation, the children of the Fridolin Zweifel, can be found here . . .', 'Global Warming Likely to Hurt Wisconsin Agriculture\nAgriculture has been a critical dimension of Wisconsin from early settlement and the logging era, through industrialization, and remains an important economic, social and cultural component of the Dairy State. Wisconsin ranks first nationally in cheese production, and second for milk and butter production. Yet Wisconsin is also second in milk cows, oats, carrots, and sweet corn used in processing. It remains the national leader in processed snap beans, cranberries, corn for silage, mink pelts and milk goats. It is also among the top five states for important agricultural commodities such as potatoes, maple syrup, mint for oil, and cucumbers for pickles.\nContinue global warming is predicted to bring increases in both the frequency and the severity of droughts and floods, resulting in increased challenges for Wisconsin farmers and livestock operations. Warmer water temperatures are also likely to cause the habitat ranges of many fish species to shift and disruption of ecosystems already stressed by human activity. Overall, climate change in Wisconsin resulting from global warming will make it more difficult to grow crops, raise animals, and catch fish in the same ways and places as in the past.\nChanges in the frequency and severity of droughts and floods could pose challenges for farmers and ranchers. Meanwhile, warmer water temperatures are likely to cause the habitat ranges of many fish species to shift, which could disrupt ecosystems. Overall, climate change could make it more difficult to grow crops, raise animals, and catch fish in the same ways and same places as we have done in the past.\nHeat waves, which are projected to increase under climate change, could directly threaten livestock. A number of states have each reported losses of more than 5,000 animals from just one heat wave. Heat stress affects animals both directly and indirectly. Over time, heat stress can increase vulnerability to disease, reduce fertility, and reduce milk production.\nDrought may threaten pasture and feed supplies. Drought reduces the amount of quality forage available to grazing livestock. Some areas could experience longer, more intense droughts, resulting from higher summer temperatures and reduced precipitation. For animals that rely on grain, changes in crop production due to drought could also become a problem.\nClimate change may increase the prevalence of parasites and diseases that affect livestock.The earlier onset of spring and warmer winters could allow some parasites and pathogens to survive more easily. In areas with increased rainfall, moisture-reliant pathogens could thrive.\nIncreases in carbon dioxide (CO2) may increase the productivity of pastures, but may also decrease their quality. Increases in atmospheric CO2 can increase the productivity of plants on which livestock feed. However, studies indicate that the quality of some of the forage found in pasture lands decreases with higher CO2. As a result, livestock would need to eat more to get the same nutritional benefits.\nThe negative effects of climate change will be exacerbated by continuing declines in the acreage of Wisconsin farmland. Wisconsin lost more than 620,000 acres of farmland from 2007 to 2012, a 4% decrease according to the Census of Agriculture, which is conducted every five years by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Likely causes of these declines are urban sprawl development, enabled by federal, state and local highway expansions which replace vegetation and topsoil with heat-absorbing Portland cement or asphalt in order to facilitate continued growth in motor vehicle driving (more fossil fuel burning) and more employment and profits for the construction and bridge building industry.\nSources: U.S. EPA; U.

38	best safety measures halloween costume fire hazards detailed info	While no Halloween costume is completely safe from fire, there are several safety measures to follow. Look for garments labeled with 'This garment has undergone additional safety testing for flammability' which indicates slower flame spread. Avoid costumes with trailing fabrics, and have children wear long layers underneath for extra protection. It's safer to use battery-operated LED candles in pumpkins instead of real candles. When using real candles, always put them on heat-resistant surfaces, supervise children around them, and never leave them unattended.	"['Most kids LOVE Halloween, and rightly so – who doesn’t want to parade around looking terrifying and eating loads of yummy sweets?? But whilst it\'s lots of fun, there is also potential for danger – and we’re not talking bumping into Dracula or ending up in a witch’s cauldron! So as a parent, what should you be alert for on Halloween? Here’s our handy guide . . .\nBrutal boiled sweets and mean marshmallows\nLots of sweets are unfortunately choking hazards, with round / oval boiled sweets being the worst. Check what sweeties are being handed out and siphon off those that don’t feel safe – anything that is very round / grape shaped and hard should be avoided. If your child is older and out with friends, ask them to leave any boiled sweets until they are at home – running around excitedly with friends is really not a sensible time to be consuming these.\nMarshmallows, especially the mini ones are definitely ones to avoid. They are roughly the same size as a 2-3 year old’s airway, and if swallowed whole can get lodged in the airway, completely obstructing breathing.\nIf you are concerned you would not know what to do in a choking incident, sign up to one of our Mini First Aid classes today\nIt’s really hard when trick or treating in the dark to see the ingredients on a random product handed out by a stranger, so it’s not surprising that cases of allergic reactions can peak at Halloween.\nThe Anaphylaxis campaign recommends the following to parents of allergy sufferers:\n- Remind your child what their food allergens look like, and which products they need to be careful with\n- Ask your child not to eat any treats until you have checked them, or for older children, ask that they bring their treats home. Have other safe treats available at home so you can do swaps for the unsuitable treats\n- Be aware that “treat size” versions of popular brands can contain different ingredients, so make sure you check ingredients lists\n- Keep adrenaline auto-injectors on you at all times, even if this means tucking it into their costume or putting in their goodie collection pot\n- Brief adults and children who are with your child – what are they allergic to, what are the signs and symptoms to look out for – and teach them how to administer emergency medication if possible\nDon’t forget that some children may also have an allergic reaction to face paints and / or fake blood used as part of their costume.\nNo Halloween costume is completely safe, because all fabrics will burn on contact with a naked flame, but there are steps you can take to make sure your child’s costume is as safe as it can be. Take a look at this great infographic from Trading Standards UK:\nYou also need to be careful when buying online. Always read product reviews and check for any product recalls. The Trading Standards website is a good place to look.\nIn addition to the above precautions, there is one more thing you can look out for - companies may also choose to label garments with the additional statement ""This garment has undergone additional safety testing for flammability"" if they have passed the additional testing requirements of the British Retail Consortium Code of Practice. This means that if a dress-up costume catches light it may still burn, but the speed at which the flame spreads is slower. Homemade dress-up costumes or those not tested to the same flammability standards may ignite easily and burn quicker.\nIt sounds obvious but if you can, avoid any costumes with trailing fabrics, as these are much more likely to accidentally catch on fire. And as an extra safety precaution, make sure your child wears long layers on both top and bottom half underneath their costume, as this will give their skin an extra layer of protection should the worst happen and their costumes catches alight.\nIt’s obvious, but the safest thing is to not use real flame candles in your pumpkins. However, whilst you might use battery operated LED candles yourself, this doesn’t mean other people will – the amount of doorsteps I have seen over the years laden with lit pumpkins is unbelievable. The risk of kids costumes trailing innocently into a lit pumpkin decoration is truly terrifying. So, make sure you warn your children to be wary about pumpkins either on the ground or being carried as they may have a lit flame in them, and supervise children, especially when approaching decorated doorsteps.\nIf you have candles lit in your home, remember the following safety advice:\n- Never leave candles or a fire unattended\n- Put candles on a heat resistant surface\n- Supervise children and pets around lit candles\n- Always extinguish a candle completely after use\nLet’s be honest, carving a pumpkin (or a rock hard swede as it was in my day!) is not the most sensible idea! When it comes to cool and quirky Halloween decorations, pumpkin carving isn’t the only way to go.\nFor a safer option, why not try painting your pumpkin face with a bright cartoon character or be inventive by painting the whole pumpkin in tasteful gold or silver sparkly paint? Turn ordinary pumpkins into brilliant DIY decorations - there is loads of inspiration online!\nAbove all, after all the restrictions of last year we hope you and your families have a really fun filled Halloween – don’t get spooked out there folks!\nThe Mini First Aid Team xx']"	['<urn:uuid:34b85484-68b5-4c6c-a5ff-9613788b8b59>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	9	82	933
39	What's the difference between puppies that score mostly 1's versus mostly 5's in temperament tests, and how reliable are these tests in predicting adult behavior?	Puppies scoring mostly 1's are extremely dominant and aggressive, easily provoked to bite, and best suited for working roles like police dogs. In contrast, puppies scoring mostly 5's are extremely submissive, lacking self-confidence, and do best with patient owners in structured environments. However, research shows that these early puppy temperament evaluations have negligible value in predicting adult behavior. Studies of hundreds of puppies have found little correspondence between puppy and adult behavior, with some initially fearful puppies even becoming the most friendly adults or vice versa.

A puppy that consistently scores a 1 in the temperament section of the test is an extremely dominant, aggressive puppy who can easily be provoked to bite. His dominant nature will attempt to resist human leadership, thus requiring only the most experienced of handlers. This puppy is a poor choice for most individuals and will do best in a working situation as a guard or police dog.\nMostly 2’s. This puppy is dominant and self-assured. He can be provoked to bite’ however he readily accepts human leadership that is firm, consistent and knowledgeable. This is not a dog for a tentative, indecisive individual. In the right hands, he has the potential to become a fine working or show dog and could fit into an adult household, provided the owners know what they are doing.\nMostly 3’s. This pup is outgoing and friendly and will adjust well in situations in which he receives regular training and exercise. He has a flexible temperament that adapts well to different types of environment, provided he is handled correctly. May be too much dog for a family with small children or an elderly couple who are sedentary.\nMostly 4’s. A pup that scores a majority of 4’s is an easily controlled, adaptable puppy whose submissive nature will make him continually look to his master for leadership. This pup is easy to train, reliable with kids, and, though he lacks self-confidence, makes a high-quality family pet. He is usually less outgoing than a pup scoring in the 3’s, but his demeanor is gentle and affectionate.\nMostly 5’s. This is a pup who is extremely submissive and lacking in self-confidence. He bonds very closely with his owner and requires regular companionship and encouragement to bring him out of himself. If handled incorrectly, this pup will grow up very shy and fearful. For this reason, he will do best in a predictable, structured lifestyle with owners who are patient and not overly demanding, such as an elderly couple.\nMostly 6’s. A puppy that scores 6 consistently is independent and uninterested in people. He will mature into a dog who is not demonstrably affectionate and who has a low need for human companionship. In general, it is rare to see properly socialized pups test this way’ however there are several breeds that have been bred for specific tasks (such as basenjis, hounds, and some northern breeds) which can exhibit this level of independence. To perform as intended, these dogs require a singularity of purpose that is not compromised by strong attachments to their owner.\nThe remainder of the puppy test is an evaluation of obedience aptitude and and working ability and provides a general picture of a pup’s intelligence, spirit, and willingness to work with a human being. For most owners, a good companion dog will score in the 3 to 4 range in this section of the test. Puppies scoring a combination of 1’s and 2’s require experienced handlers who will be able to draw the best aspects of their potential from them.', 'Heritability has a very specific meaning in genetics. The heritability of a trait is the fraction of the total variation in the trait among the animals in a population that can be accounted for by genetics. The variation that is not a consequence of genetic differences among individuals is lumped into the ""non-genetic"" category, which is called ""environment"". Values of heritability go from 0 to 1. If a trait is genetic but there is no variability in the population, the heritability is zero. If all of the variation from one individual to the next can be explained by differences in genetics, the heritability is 1; that is, 100% of the variation in the trait is accounted for by genetics. A trait that has no genetic influence, like hair color in a group of teens with neon spray-on paint, is not heritable.\nSince heritability reflects the relative influence of the genes that a dog has for a particular trait, it tells you how successful you\'re likely to be in improving a trait through selection. If heritability is high, then dogs with the preferred phenotype are likely to have the preferred genes. If heritability is low, the phenotype of the animal is significantly influenced by non-genetic factors, and the ""best"" animal by phenotype might not be the one with the ""best"" genes. As a familiar example, hip dysplasia has a low heritability, which means that the phenotype (assessed from an X-ray) is not an especially good predictor of the hips that will be produced in a litter of puppies, so it\'s not surprising that hip dysplasia continues to be a significant problem despite many generations of selection.\nThe problem with the low heritability of behavioral traits in dogs is that behavior is usually evaluated very carefully when making breeding decisions - and the evaluator usually feels that they are making a useful assessment - yet all the studies and mounds of data generated over the last 50 years indicate that these assessments are very poor predictors of the genetic breeding value of the dog, as you will see.\nThis is well known among organizations that breed dogs for specific purposes, such as the military and guide dog organizations. A dog must meet certain standards of performance and behavior to be acceptable for work, and it is expensive and time-consuming to breed, raise, train, and evaluate a dog. Being able to identify at a young age the dogs that are most likely to make the grade is of huge importance, so the challenge becomes one of figuring out what can be assessed or measured in a puppy or young dog that will reflect its future behavior and performance. Just as important is the selection of animals to be bred, in which case you are hoping to choose the animals that are best suited genetically and therefore likely to pass their genetic value on to their offspring.\n- Wilsson E & P-E Sundgren. 1998. Behaviour test for eight-week old puppies - heritabilities of tested behavior traits and its correspondence to later behaviour. App. Anim. Behav. Sci. 58: 151-162.\n- Riemer S, C Muller, Z Viranyi, L Huber, & F Range. 2014. The predictive value of early behavioural assessments in pet dogs- a longitudinal study from neonates to adults. PLOS One 9(7): e101237.\nHow useful are those tests that evaluate temperament in puppies? With a quick Google search, you can come up with a bunch of examples, and many people swear by these. But it is really difficult to prove that they are useful.\nThe goal, of course, is to determine some traits in the puppy that will predict behavior and performance as an adult, but the tricky thing is that the tests you would use on a puppy aren\'t appropriate for an adult and vice versa. So right from the start, you know you are evaluating things that are ""proxy traits"" - that is, you expect them to tell you something useful about some entirely different behavior when the animal is older.\nThe two papers noted above are worth reading. The first one convincingly showed that evaluations of puppies were of little use in predicting behavior as an adult. They evaluated 630 German Shepherds at 8 weeks and again at 450-600 days (roughly 1.5-2 yrs). They found that heritability of some of the behavioral traits they looked at was modest, so selection for those would result in some improvement. But the ""correspondence of puppy test results to performance at adult age was negligible and the puppy test was therefore not found useful in predicting adult suitability for service dog work"".\nThe second study is recent so the information is up to date, and it does a good job of recognizing the potential pitfalls of studying puppies to predict adult behavior. But again, they ""found little correspondence between individuals\' behaviour in the neonate, puppy and adult test. Exploratory activity was the only behaviour that was significantly correlated between the puppy and the adult test. We conclude that the predictive validity of early tests for predicting specific behavioural traits in adult pet dogs in limited"".\nAn especially interesting outcome in this study is in the evaluation of fearfulness, which is the most common behavioral reason for a puppy to be rejected from a guide dog training program. They found that in evaluating fearfulness, ""...some major changes were observed over time, with the initially most fearful individuals becoming most friendly to people or vice versa"". That statement should give you pause. Could eliminating a puppy from a breeding program because of fearfulness be culling the dogs that will have the best temperaments as adults?\nPeople that have been breeding dogs for decades and have much experience working with puppies might feel that they have some skill at evaluating temperament and behavior, but the studies that have tried to confirm the value of these evaluations have uniformly failed to validate them. Mind you, these studies used hundreds or even thousands of puppies from dozens of litters; the testing conditions were uniform, the protocols carefully followed, and the data analyzed with appropriate statistics. In the absence of properly done studies that demonstrate otherwise, there is no evidence that puppy evaluations have any value at all.\nSo what about the breeders of guide dogs? Do they do temperament testing on young puppies? Analysis of over 10 years of data from one guide dog center showed that selecting breeding stock on the basis of puppy tests did improve the performance of puppies on the tests, but did not improve the success rate of dogs finishing the program (Scott & Bielfelt 1976; Goddard & Beilharz 1986). Consequently, they wait to evaluate the suitability of dogs for further training until they are older.\nEVALUATING DOGS BEFORE TRAINING\n- Duffy DL & JA Serpell 2012 Predictive validity of a method for evaluating temperament in young guide and service dogs. App. Anim. Behav. Sci. 138: 99-109.\nSince assessments of very young puppies are not very predictive of adult behavior, at what age should they be assessed? This study tested a group of dogs at 6 and 12 months of age, before they entered their training period to become a guide dog. They noted which dogs were successful in graduating from the program and looked for associations with any of the measured traits. The test they used (which was developed by one of the authors, Serpell) was the C-BARQ, which has been widely used for behavioral assessment of dogs. Note that they combined data from 5 different guide and service dog breeding programs, so they had a huge sample size - nearly 8,000 dogs. These were not anecdotal observations!\nThey found that dogs that successfully completed the guide dog training program ""scored more favorably on 27 out of 36 C-BARQ traits at both 6 and 12 months of age compared to those that were released from the programs"". Although they didn\'t find a trait that was very useful for predicting success, they were able to do a better job of rejecting dogs that were likely to be unsuccessful. In particular, owner-directed aggression was a very sensitive indicator of failing the program, and this at least is useful; eliminating dogs that are not likely to succeed spares the time and expense of training a dog that will ultimately wash out of the program. The other (rather unlikely) trait most predictive of failure in the guide dog program was ""pulls excessively hard on a leash"".\nThis study concluded that the C-BARQ test was useful in identifying the dogs that were least likely to succeed, but it was not a reliable indication of which dogs were most likely to be successful.\nASSESSING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BREEDS AFTER TRAINING\n- Ennik I, A-E Liinamo, E Leighton, & J van Arendonk. 2006. Suitability for field service in 4 breeds of guide dogs. J Vet. Behav. 1:67-74.\nThis study looked at the success rates of these three breeds and the Golden x Labrador cross in becoming guide dogs, and it also looked for effects of sex and whether a dog received additional training (was ""passed back"") because there was no suitable match with a person when it finished training, there was a temporary medical issue, or it wasn\'t progressing adequately.\nREASONS FOR FAILURE\nThe most common behavioral reasons for failing out of a guide dog training program are fearfulness, dog distraction, and excitability. Although the heritabilities of dog distraction and excitability are low and can differ between males and females, the heritability of fear is relatively high (0.46 over both males and females; Goddard & Beilharz 1982).\nFrom these studies (and many more like them), we can conclude that evaluating behavior in dogs and using that information for selective breeding has proven to be extremely difficult, even in well-managed breeding programs in which the dogs are bred and raised under controlled conditions, receive similar treatment and experiences, and are assessed by trained handlers.\nIf we believe in genetics (which of course we do!), we would expect that dogs from selective breeding programs should have low rates of behavior problems, but still 70% of the dogs that fail to complete the program are removed because of behavior. Perhaps a better way to judge whether these specialized breeding programs are successful is to note that in the early days when dogs for guide dog training programs were donated by the public, the success rate was 9%; selective breeding improved the success rate to 90% in just a few generations (Pfaffenberger 1963). It is the remarkable early success of the guide dog breeding programs that provided the convincing evidence that broad differences in behavior among breeds are heritable, and that improvement within breeds is possible.\nWHAT ABOUT TEMPERAMENT TESTING PUPPIES?\nThere are two very important messages to take away from this.\n1) Be very skeptical of claims that temperament can be assessed through evaluation of young puppies. If there is somebody who can reliably do this, they should document their success in a publication, because it would revolutionize the breeding of dogs. Otherwise, the best way to predict the temperament and behavior of a dog as an adult is to assess it as an adult.\n2) Nobody wants to produce puppies that will grow up to have behavior problems, but in breeds where low genetic diversity and small population sizes are resulting in high rates of genetic disorders and low fertility, excluding dogs from breeding based on evaluation of behavior, especially as puppies, should be done very carefully. Aggression and fearfulness have reasonable heritabilities and can be selected against if evaluated as adults, but for most other traits heritability is very low and therefore evaluations of behavior don\'t tell you much about a dog\'s genetic value for these traits.\nOne final point. The efficiency of selection can be improved by estimating breeding values statistically using information about not just the dog of interest but about parents, siblings, and progeny (i.e, estimated breeding values, EBV). The guide dog organizations have been using EBVs to select for the traits of interest to them (both behavioral and physical) for a couple of decades with good success (Leighton 2003), and the technique should be similarly useful to dog breeders if they are willing to collect the appropriate data to set up the program.\nIf you have a dog, you can do your own C-BARQ assessment from their website at the University of Pennsylvania vet school:\nEnnik I, A-E Liinamo, E Leighton, & J van Arendonk. 2006.

40	As a veterinarian specializing in calf health, I've noticed varying approaches to managing respiratory risks. What are the environmental conditions that affect respiratory health in calves, and what specific preventive measures are recommended for their housing setup?	Environmental conditions significantly impact respiratory health in calves, with draughts being particularly problematic. Calves are extremely sensitive to cold air movements as they cool down quickly, which destroys their microclimate and weakens their immune function. The optimal temperature range for calves is between +4° and +20° Celsius, with ideal humidity levels between 35-50% at temperatures below 15°C to reduce germ levels. Regarding preventive housing measures, several specific recommendations exist: calves should be provided 32 square feet per pen, with solid separation panels to prevent nose-to-nose contact. They should be housed in clean, dry environments and removed from maternity pens as soon as possible. While cold-temperature housing can be used, it's crucial to ensure adequate ventilation while avoiding draughts. Air exchange should occur four times per hour for good air quality, but incoming cold air must be slowed down and warmed up before reaching the calves. Additional protection can be achieved using windbreak fences or straw bales, and proper bedding depth is essential.	['Draughts are an enemy of cows. Calves in particular are extremely sensitive to them. Draughts weaken the immune system and increase morbidity of cows. Respiratory diseases are a frequent consequence.  \nThe following article deals with draughts and their consequences, such as respiratory diseases. We tell you more about how smaXtec helps you to detect respiratory diseases early and thus shorten the treatment period. Some useful tips on how draughts can be avoided are also listed below.\nDRAUGHTS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES\nIn general, the term draught is understood as incoming air that is clearly cooler than the air in the barn. \nIt cannot be clearly defined which wind speed is necessary to reduce performance and impair health in cows. An approximate guideline for the air movement in cold weather is up to 2m/s and in warmer seasons up to 4 m/s. Problems become apparent when animals lay down or stay close to other animals due to a lack of protection options. \nThe circulation of the mucous membranes is particularly affected by draught. This may lead to more infections. The greater the temperature difference, the more damaging the influence of a draught on the health of the animals. For this reason, problems often arise, especially in periods of cold, wet weather. Furthermore, high wind speeds occurring during this time are a big problem. A common consequence of poor air quality and draughts are respiratory diseases. Stagnant air or draughts considerably increase the likelihood of pneumonia.\nCalves are particularly sensitive to this because they cool down quickly and the microclimate, meaning the temperature immediately above the skin surface under the coat, is destroyed. The immune function of the young animals is weakened by the reduced blood flow. \nRESPIRATORY DISEASES IN CALVES AND COWS\nRespiratory diseases can be caused by poor air quality and draughts. But the animals do not only suffer in autumn and winter. Even in summer, on particularly hot days, they can become seriously ill. Calves for example sweat and draughts created by the air movement for cooling increases the risk of respiratory diseases. \nRespiratory diseases have a major impact on the economic success of calf rearing and on the performance of adult animals. Long-term consequences in females include a higher first calving age, higher herd turnover rates and a lower milk yield.  It is even more dramatic in male calves. Once they become ill, consequential damage is inevitable. Their growth is insufficient.  In addition, high treatment costs, decreased weight gain and death as a result of treatment can also be seen as negative results.\nConsideration must also be given to the economic impact of respiratory diseases. These types of diseases are among the most complex and most costliest in bovine medicine. Significant financial losses are often the result of increased occurrence of respiratory diseases. The losses are caused by\n- the losses of calves,\n- the reduced daily weight gain in sick animals,\n- poor development of chronically ill calves,\n- costs for treatment by veterinarians and for medication\n- and the increased time required to care for sick calves\nA calculation of the monetary loss is as follows: with a morbidity rate of 30 % and a loss rate of 5 %, there are losses of € 50 per stalled calf. \nBut it is not only the short-term losses mentioned above that are associated with respiratory diseases – long-term consequences must also be expected. It must be remembered that only a healthy calf can grow into a high-performance dairy cow. The influence of respiratory diseases and the resulting (possibly long-lasting) breathing difficulties on the later performance of the animals is often underestimated. \nSMAXTEC SUPPORTS YOU IN THE EARLY DETECTION OF RESPIRATORY DISEASES\nWith the smaXtec bolus, typical symptoms of respiratory diseases can be detected early on. By continuously measuring inner body temperature, even the smallest deviations from the animal’s normal temperature can be detected at an early stage.\nFurthermore, sick animals are usually less mobile and show reduced activity. This is also detected by the smaXtec Bolus. The success of the treatment depends largely on the stage of the disease. Early treatment of pneumonia is therefore essential for full recovery.\nMEASURES AGAINST DRAUGHTS\nThe optimum temperature for calves is between + 4 ° and + 20 °Celsius. Dairy cows are most efficient at temperatures ranging from – 15 ° to + 20 °Celsius. <sup<< sup=””>In addition to the right temperature, humidity also plays an important role. Low humidity (35 % – 50 % at < 15 ° C) provides optimal air quality for calves as it reduces germ levels. In adult cattle, on the other hand, the optimal relative humidity is between 35 % and 70 %. \nWith the help of the smaXtec Climate Sensor, the decisive parameters are collected, measured and presented in a user-friendly way. In addition to the temperature and humidity, the so-called THI (temperature-humidity index) value is also calculated. This value provides information about heat stress in hot summer months.\nThere are several ways to fight draughts in the barn. Especially for calves, it is important that they are provided with well-protected shelter. However, making a barn draught-free does not mean sealing it off. It is important to allow air exchange. Even in winter, air exchange should take place four times an hour in order to ensure good air quality and humidity. If fans, light ridges or curtains are missing in the barn, then draft-free sides should be opened. There are also other ways to ensure sufficient air circulation. For example, three sides of the barn can be closed with only one remaining fully open. This may mean it gets pretty cold in the barn but there are no draughts. Other simple tools such as windbreak fences or straw bales can be used to protect animals. Fans are becoming increasingly popular because they do not extract used air from the barn but press fresh air through hole channels into the barn.  In combination with the smaXtec Climate Sensor, fans can be used efficiently and economically, which means they only have to be used if, for example, humidity is too high or there is a risk of heat stress.\nAs already mentioned above, it is the least harmful for cows if they experience a draught in the feeding area. This is why doors/openings to the feeding table can be left open to guarantee air exchange. Not recommended are draught holes directly above the lying area of the cows, as the cold air falls directly on the cattle and these usually have no way of avoiding the draught. \nWhichever measures are taken, the most important thing is that incoming cold air is slowed down and warmed up before cows come into contact with it.2', 'Respiratory disease is a major concern when raising calves.\nBy: Tracey Erickson, Dairy Field Specialist, SDSU Extension\nRespiratory disease is the second leading cause of death in un-weaned heifer calves (scours is the first). Unfortunately, heifers that experience respiratory disease also continue to perform poorly later in life. To effectively address these problem producers must consider both determinant and predisposing causes of respiratory disease.\nFirst what is the level of passive immunity being transferred unto the calf? Current guidelines suggest baby calves should receive high quality colostrum right after birth, 3-4 quarts within one hour and 3 additional quarts within twelve hours.\nQuality of colostrum is important. Collecting colostrum under strict sanitary conditions is also vital to help minimize bacterial growth. Some producers pool colostrum to increase protection from a wider diversity of pathogens the calf might be exposed to. However, when doing this, one also needs to make sure not to use colostrum from Johnes infected cows or first calf heifers. Secondly, storage of colostrum is important to minimize the growth of bacteria. Colostrum should be refrigerated or frozen as soon as possible after collection.\nPasteurization of colostrum has also shown in research trials not to impede immunoglobulin’s (IgG) availability while decreasing the total bacteria counts (Johnson et al. 2007). However, pasteurization should be done by heating the milk to 140 ° F (60°C) for 60-120 minutes in a batch pasteurizer, which uses lower temperatures and longer heating time which does not damage milk immunoglobulin’s s. Unfortunately, these types of pasteurizers can be quite expensive with some producers using them also to pasteurize their waste milk in order to offset this expense.\nCleanliness is very important to help minimize risks; a clean and dry calf living environment is critical. Calves should not have shared housing with cows during the first week of life and should be removed from maternity pens as soon as possible. Cleanliness of the calving pen is also important to reduce bacterial concentration.\nWe know that raising calves in barns is convenient and protects from the weather both calves and employees. However, there are environmental risk factors that need to be addressed. The following should be used as a guide to reduce respiratory disease when using calf barns.\n- Reduce microbial contamination in the pen via adequate sanitation.\n- Increase pen area (ideal: 32 square feet per calf).\n- Avoid nose-to-nose contact between calves (solid separation panels if possible).\n- Increase bedding depth.\n- Use cold-temperature housing.\n- Provide adequate ventilation while reducing drafts.\n- Provide additional nutrients via calf starter in cold-temperature housing.\nIf calves have received adequate immunity via colostrum, the next step is to reduce the microbial challenge. This means removing the calf from the dam as soon as possible. Calves should then be placed in individual pens avoiding nose-to-nose contact with other calves.\nVaccines are now being marketed for prevention of clinical respiratory diseases. Traditional views have held that the antibodies calves receive through colostrum usually inactivate the vaccines administered to them. More recent research indicates that, in certain instances, modified live viral vaccines stimulate a protective response in calves challenged with these agents. As example of this protection is the use of intranasal IBR/Pi3 vaccines in calves less than 1 month old (Garcia & Daly, 2010). Vaccine programs against respiratory disease in calves should be developed in consultation with your veterinarian.\nTo learn more about respiratory diseases in baby dairy calves and how to use a scoring system to identify calves with respiratory disease please refer to Respiratory Diseases in Young Dairy Calves authored by Alvaro Garcia and Russ Daly.']	['<urn:uuid:494542e1-d4f9-4e8f-a721-3b0fd4f6cf53>', '<urn:uuid:16e092bd-75c5-4ebe-9bdf-31edb0ea4f35>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	37	162	1716
41	health guarantee requirements florida foreign dogs	In Florida, all breeders must provide written health guarantees and have dogs examined by licensed veterinarians, who perform thorough exams of knees, hips, elbows, heart, internal parasites and vaccinations. For dogs entering Florida from abroad, health certificates are mandatory even if arriving by car, and documentation must demonstrate freedom from communicable diseases.	"['What do you mean when you say Manchesters are not for everyone?\nDogs are a long-term commitment, and each household has a different lifestyle. Potential dog owners should first assess whether they are ready to make a commitment to any dog before moving on to breed selection.\nWhile Manchesters are small, clean dogs who shed minimally, they are also dogs that require a great deal of training and socialization. The keys to a properly trained and socialized Manchester Terrier are TIME, COMMITMENT, and CONSISTENCY.\nWhat is your Breeding Philosophy?\nBreeding and raising quality dogs with any consistency is not an easy thing to do. It takes planning, patience, commitment, objectivity, and a certain amount of luck. There are no perfect dogs -- every dog carries positive and negative traits.\nDo you guarantee the health of the puppies you sell?\nYes. We offer a written, contractual health guarantee for the pups we sell. Our guarantee is detailed in our written sales agreement. Further, in accordance with Florida State Law, we are required to have each dog we sell examined by a licensed Veterinarian and to provide a health certificate to the buyer. We take this obligation seriously, and our vet performs a thorough exam including knees, hips, elbows, and heart along with the required testing for internal parasites and vaccinations. If you live in Florida, ALL breeders in the state are required to provide health certificates and any breeder sending a dog into the state must provide a certificate, as well, even if the dog arrives via car.\nWhat s a responsible breeder?\nResponsible breeding encompasses a range of behaviors rather than one narrow path. In general, responsible breeders strive to produce healthy, well socialized dogs that meet the standard for their breed. They provide lifetime support to those who purchase puppies, and they care aboutthe well-being of every dog they produce. There are a number of different ways to accomplish those goals. Health testing alone does not make a breeder responsible nor does success in the show ring. Most of the responsible breeders that we know have a genuine passion for their dogs and the breed.\nWhat health testing do you do, and what are the results?\nWe DNA test for Von Willebrand\'s disease as well as performing routine x-rays on hips for displasia and Leggs-Calves-Perthes, manual exams for luxated patellas, and routine exams for overall health. We have also begun detailed cardiac screenings of our breeding dogs. We will be happy to make written results of tests available upon request.\nPlease be aware that the only genetic test available for Manchester Terriers at this time is a DNA test for vWD. All other tests (x-rays for hips, CERF for eyes, BAER for hearing, blood assays for Thyroid function, etc.) are \'clinical\' or observational. They demonstrate whether a dog exhibits symptoms of a disorder (""affected"") or not. These tests are important, but the results for a puppy\'s parents are of limited value on their own. For negative recessive traits, a dog can be free of clinical symptoms yet still carry for the disease. Particularly if you are looking for a young puppy, it\'s important to ask about the health not only of the puppy\'s parents but also his grandparents and siblings from the parents\' prior litters.', 'The world has developed to where you can take your pets with you almost everywhere. Your furry friend can enjoy the sunshine with you on a foreign island. However, there are strict requirements for entering any country with a pet. What requirements does the US have to bring a dog into the country?\nThe primary requirements to bring a dog into the US are up-to-date vaccinations and general health. As long as your dog is free from communicable diseases and has the correct documents, it’s free entry all the way.\nThis article will look at the documents you need to bring your dog into the US. I also discuss the requirements to get a dog into the US and circumstances that demand quarantine for your dog on entry to the US\nWhat Documents Do I Need to Bring My Dog into the US?\nTo bring your dog into the US, you need vaccination certificates for diseases including rabies, screwworm, tapeworm, and foot and mouth disease. A licensed veterinarian from your country must also fill and sign a pet health certificate.\nIn July 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) temporarily suspended dogs from entering the US from high-risk countries for dog rabies. Only US citizens and lawful residents could receive a CDC Dog Import Permit.\nFortunately, from December 1, 2021, new rules were set in place. According to the rules, if your dog has been in a high-risk country for the past six months, you can enter the US through an approved port of entry.\nThe 18 airports with a CDC quarantine station are approved ports of entry. Getting an import Permit is straightforward, and it is best to apply for one at least thirty days before you intend to enter the US.\nIf your dog qualifies for an Import Permit and you bring it into the US without one, it will be returned to your country of departure at your expense. Email the CDC requesting the permit. Once it has been granted, you can travel down to the US.\nDogs that haven’t been in high-risk countries do not need to show an Import Permit or a rabies vaccination certificate on arrival. Your dog just needs to be healthy and look healthy.\nAny certificate or document in a foreign language must be translated into English, and it should be a certified English translation. This statement is written on official letterhead and signed by a licensed translator. It must have the name, contact information, and address of the translator and an elevated seal that includes the translator’s number.\nWhat Are the Requirements to Bring a Dog into the US?\nThere are only three requirements to bring your dog into the United States, and they are:\n- Your dog must be vaccinated.\nTo protect its citizens, the US requires vaccination against diseases such as dog rabies, tapeworm, and screwworm, amongst others.\n- You must have the proper documents.\nAll certificates necessary to prove your dog’s clean bill of health should be handy. You don’t want to hunt for a tiny piece of paper in your bags after a long flight.\n- Your dog should be healthy.\nAlthough there are no specific parameters in place, your dog should look healthy and be free from any communicable disease.\nPlease check the requirements of all the government organizations concerned with pet entry and make sure that you follow the regulations. It’s a sad thing to watch your dog being returned or to have to take it back to your country of departure.\nDoes My Dog Need to Be Quarantined in the US?\nHawaii and Guam are the only territories in the United States with quarantine requirements for pet dogs coming into the regions. Their quarantine requirements are in place because they are rabies-free, and they plan to keep it that way.\nOther states are okay with your dog if it meets other veterinary conditions and is healthy. The United States has stringent rules concerning rabies vaccination, and this is where you need to be careful.\nIf your dog is immunized against rabies, you show the vaccination certificate and enter—no need for quarantine. An unimmunized dog has a different set of rules to follow, depending on whether you have been in a rabies-free country or not.\nAccording to the CDC, a dog is unimmunized if it has never been immunized, it was vaccinated less than thirty days before coming to the US or vaccinated when it was less than three months old. Phew!\nIf your dog is coming from a country that is considered rabies-free, you have the option of applying for an unimmunized dog permit. With this permit, unimmunized dogs will be allowed entry into the country, provided you meet all the other essential conditions.\nAs a US resident or visitor staying for less than 30 days, you can apply for a dog permit to bring an unimmunized dog into the US. Please ensure you apply for this permit at least two weeks before your travel date. Also, the CDC does not give this permit to everyone who applies.\nThis unimmunized dog permit comes with a confinement agreement (similar to quarantine) you must sign. Your signature proves that you agree to keep your dog at home or in an enclosure until your dog is wholly immunized against rabies.\nHow Soon Can an Unimmunized Dog Get the Rabies Vaccine?\nThe rabies vaccine must be given within the first ten days of entry into the US and four days of arrival at a final US destination. After vaccination, the dog must be confined for at least thirty more days.\nPuppies have a longer confinement time because they must first be confined until they are old enough to receive the vaccine, and they also have the standard thirty days’ confinement after vaccination.\nIt is in your best interest to be adequately prepared before traveling to the US with your dog. If you follow the regulations, everything will turn out well.']"	['<urn:uuid:393795d6-7be8-410b-a37c-c0e6fc05342b>', '<urn:uuid:ee4847d5-3aee-445b-8043-a59e418b323a>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	6	52	1540
42	target eu ireland emissions comparison	The EU and Ireland have different target dates for achieving net-zero emissions. The EU aims to be climate-neutral by 2050 as part of the European Green Deal and Paris Agreement commitments. Similarly, Ireland has set a legally binding target through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. However, Ireland has an additional interim target of 51% emissions reduction by 2030, while the EU faces warnings about a potential 3.2-degree global temperature rise without additional decarbonization commitments.	['2020 was meant to be the start of a ‘decade of delivery’ for the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – with a target date of 2030 for many global economic and environmental changes to take hold.\nThen Covid-19 struck, delivering a potential blow to these pressing goals. While the climate crisis may ostensibly be a slower moving enemy than the whirlwind of the current pandemic, it’s arguably a greater long-term threat. It’s vital that SDG stakeholders continue to push the agenda forward.\nWith many of the world’s industry and commercial businesses in forced lockdown, there’s actually been a sharp fall in C02 emissions. But, as more ‘normal’ economic activity is resumed, greater effort will be needed to prevent climate inaction. The UN is warning that, ‘without additional commitments to decarbonization, the planet is on for a 3.2-degree global temperature rise and beyond’.\nSDGs like #12 ‘Responsible Consumption and Production’ and #13 ‘Climate Action’ are therefore more important than ever. The world cannot afford to let progress slide, despite the unprecedented upheaval Coronavirus has unleashed. As the world gets back up from its knees, rebuilding economies and societies, it presents an opportunity to embrace renewable energy and green technologies. It is hugely timely, therefore, that we are investigating EU Critical Raw Materials in Norway that will help keep Europe on the path to its net zero energy transformation and help feed the world in a more environmentally-friendly way.\nThe EU aims to be climate-neutral by 2050: an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. This objective is at the heart of the European Green Deal and in line with the EU’s commitment to global climate action under the Paris Agreement. Experts believe vanadium could play a major role in helping the EU achieve this. Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries (VRFBs) are able to store vast amounts of renewable energy and their long lifecycle helps contribute to a more circular economy. We believe Norway is sitting on vast reserves of vanadium, and our results so far are providing further evidence that this is true.\nAt present, vanadium is mostly mined in South Africa, Russia and China. And yet, the importance of locally sourced products and less dependence on complicated global supply chains has suddenly became much more pressing this year. Europe also relies on countries like Kazakhstan, China, Morocco and Tunisia for phosphorus – another EU critical mineral. Phosphate fertilisers are a more natural alternative to nitrogen-based ones, that release harmful nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. Yet there is high risk associated with the supply of phosphorus. Again, Norway’s phosphorus reserves could provide copious quantities of this valuable mineral to Europe in the future.\nWith this in mind, we are extracting geological samples from depth in the Bjerkreim area in southern Norway for the first time. The results from our geologists and drilling teams are extremely positive so far. Core samples from the drilling programme will provide further insight into potentially world-class deposits of vanadium and phosphorus (as well as titanium and magnetite). We have aligned our investigations in Norway with seven of the UN’s Sustainable Goals, and we are proud that our programme has gone ahead despite the global pandemic.\nMore about our SDG pledges', '“The journey to net zero emissions has begun,” the Government said after the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act was signed into law, setting Ireland a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.\nThe Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 was signed into law by Uachtarán na hÉireann, Michael D Higgins on 23 July. The legislation’s enactment means that Ireland is legally obliged to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, but also to achieve a 51 per cent reduction in emissions by the end of the current decade. The Act provides the framework for Ireland to meet its international and EU climate commitments.\nSpeaking upon the signing into law of the Act, the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Eamon Ryan TD, said: “Today is a landmark day, as we turn climate ambition into law, and set out on a journey to net zero emissions. The extreme weather events around the world over the past month have shown us all that we must act quickly, to protect ourselves and our planet.\n“Our immediate target of halving emissions by 2030 is challenging, but it is also an opportunity to transform our economy, create new jobs, protect our environment, and build a greener and fairer future. We will all need to work together to achieve this, in renewable energy, active and sustainable travel, in business, agriculture and across government. But the signal we are sending today is that now is the time for action.”\nThe next stage on the journey to net zero will be the preparation of regulations on carbon accounting, which will be developed in consultation with the Climate Change Advisory Council and consistent with the Paris Agreement and EU rules. Following this will be the production of carbon budgets by the Climate Change Advisory Council; these budgets will then be presented to the Oireachtas and approved by Government. It will then fall on the Government to set sectoral emissions ceilings, which will determine how each sector of the economy will contribute to the achievement of the budgets.\nHighlights of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act\n- The Act embeds the process of setting binding and ambitious emissions-reductions targets in law, providing for a national climate objective, which will commit the State to pursuing and achieving the transition to a “climate resilient, biodiversity-rich, environmentally sustainable and climate-neutral economy” no later than 2050.\n- The Act lines out that the first two five-year carbon budgets proposed by the Climate Change Advisory Council will equate to a total reduction of 51 per cent over the period to 2030, relative to a baseline of 2018.\n- The role of the Climate Change Advisory Council has been strengthened, enabling it to propose carbon budgets to the Minister which match the ambition laid out within the Act and the State’s international obligations. The Government is also given the power to appoint an extra three members to the Council.\n- The Government must adopt carbon budgets that are consistent with the Paris Agreement and other international obligations. All forms of greenhouse gas emissions including biogenic methane will be included in the carbon budgets, and carbon removals will be taken into account in setting budgets. However, the decisions on trajectories for sectors remain the Government’s to make.\n- Following consultation, the Government will decide how to apply the Plan across the sectors and how each sector will contribute to given five-year budgets.\n- Actions for each sector will be detailed in the Climate Action Plan, which must be updated annually.\n- Government ministers will be responsible for achieving the legally binding targets for their own sectoral area with each Minister accounting for their performance towards sectoral targets and actions before an Oireachtas Committee each year.\n- Local authorities must prepare individual Climate Action Plans which will include both mitigation and adaptation measures and will be updated every five years. Local authority development plans must be aligned with their Climate Action Plan.\n- Public bodies will be obliged to take account of Climate Action Plans in the performance of their functions.\nThe Climate Action Plan 2021, where the path towards these goals will be laid out, is expected to be published “in early autumn”. This Plan will include the measures to be taken in order for these sectoral targets to be met. The Act also provides for the appointment by the Government of an extra three members to the Climate Change Advisory Council, whose new Chair, Marie Donnelly, was appointed in February 2021, along with climate scientist Peter Thorne and economist Ottmar Edenhofer, both appointed as members.\nThe Act was passed in the Dáil in June by a majority of 129 votes to 10. It has, however, come in for criticism from opposition TDs and campaigners, particularly after a number of amendments were passed in the Seanad on 9 July, just two weeks before the signing of the Act into law. These amendments revised how emissions will be calculated for the different sectors, particularly around land use for agriculture.\n“It is a very important bill and we all wanted to work with the minister to make it stronger and to future-proof it to make it a bill for future generations and governments,” the Social Democrat TD Jennifer Whitmore said. “Unfortunately, these amendments have undermined that completely.” Climatologist Professor John Sweeney of Maynooth University also opined that the Act had “taken the guts out of the Climate Bill and destroyed the principles under which it was established”.\nThe Act will have its greatest implications across the transport and agriculture sectors, which count for over half of Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions when combined. Minister Ryan has said that success of the Act will be dependent upon collaboration “in renewable energy, active and sustainable travel, in business, agriculture and across government”. While the reception has not been unanimously positive, some environmental campaigners have been optimistic about the potential the Act has to affect change in Ireland’s climate performance.\n“This is an historic day for Irish climate policy and a landmark reform of public administration in Ireland,” Friends of the Earth Director Oisín Coghlan said. “Now the real work begins.”']	['<urn:uuid:dcb32b7c-ac2c-48e4-814b-cb1e839d72e4>', '<urn:uuid:19a98fd6-719a-477b-a0c6-0b8e44e83909>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	5	87	1562

However, this amount will be included as wages on your W-2 form and will be subject to income tax withholdings.	['Per diem in the context of companies travel refers to the sum of money staff members can dedicate to daily travel expenses, like hotels and dinners.В\nEg, your company’s travel coverage says that you’re allowed a $64 per diem dinner allowance when planing a trip to New York City for company uses.В\nCompanies arranged per diem rate for businesses vacation due to the fact IRS places restrictions how a lot an organization can write-off to lower their unique income tax burdens. If a member of staff really wants to save money as compared to each diem price on a meal or resorts in their businesses travels, they might getting refunded for any each diem quantity and shell out the others out-of-pocket.\nOffering staff each day allowances for foods and lodging during businesses trips also simplifies accounting for organizations.В\nIf a member of staff does not have usage of a business credit card, they pay for business costs with your own money and also the providers reimburses them after.В\nThere have been two different compensation projects: answerable and non-accountable. Each strategy has its own rules and income tax effects.В\nWhen utilizing an accountable arrange, there isn’t any appropriate limit throughout the daily quantity spent. Costs could be refunded assuming that they are business-related and properly noted.В\nHowever, when it chooses to do so, an organization can choose ready a higher threshold maximum on reimbursement through an answerable arrange.В\nAccountable Compensation Methods\na responsible arrange occurs when a company reimburses workers or produces all of them an allowance under the soon after circumstances:В\n- The expenditures become businesses costs\n- The reimbursement ought to be for some thing a worker could take on the taxation\n- The expenditures become corroborated, usually by itemized receipts\n- Staff members must come back any difference between total allowance and substantiated spending within a reasonable time frame\nTo meet the requirements as an answerable arrange, the allowance or reimbursement must fulfill all requirements above.В Any levels compensated to a member of staff on a responsible plan isn’t tape-recorded as income or reported on a W-2.В\nNon-Accountable Compensation Projects\nAlternatively, any reimbursement or allowance compensated to a worker that will not meet with the skills for an answerable program is recognized as section of a non-accountable arrange.В\nNon-accountable plans don’t require staff members to submit receipts. Additionally, if a member of staff spends not as much as her daily allowance, they’re able to keep consitently the staying amount.\nAmounts settled to workforce under a non-accountable program are included as wages on the W-2 type and at the mercy of income-tax withholdings.В\nThus, are there any regular per diem prices for meals, incidental costs, and hotels while traveling for work? Indeed, however they may vary by venue.\nRead On to know about per diem prices, based on the Standard Treatments Management (GSA).В\nThe GSA’s Per Diem Price\nThe U.S. General solutions government (GSA) is actually a national institution accountable for promoting some other national firms.

Their own costs match the most the IRS allows enterprises state in spending for travel-related buys.\nAgencies can reimburse employees for longer than the GSA’s per diem price. But staff members will are obligated to pay fees from the excessive quantity paid back.\nFor 2021 fiscal season, the GSA’s basic each diem rate try $55 for foods and $96 for accommodations. But the GSA sets specific prices many different places. Per diem rates is higher in locations where in actuality the cost-of-living is far more costly as compared to segments accustomed ready the useful link typical per diem speed.В\nLike, the GSA’s a diem rates for business go to La include $181 for lodging and $66 for meals and incidental expenses (MI&E).В\nThe MI&E reduces as a result:\n- $16 for morning meal\n- $17 for lunch\n- $28 for dinner\n- $5 for incidental costs\nThere s an additional $49.50 for MI&E on the very first and last day’s trips. The GSA calculates this quantity as 75per cent associated with the complete per diem price for non-travel weeks.\nYou can search per diem rate by location on GSA’s site. Summary: How Much Does Per Diem Indicate?\nWhenever talking about per diem work, the expression means jobs on an as-needed factor this is certainly typically paid every day, instead of per change, hours, or annually.\nIn the context of company vacation, per diem makes reference to allowances for food, place provider, hotels, and incidental spending that employers reimburse for workers whenever they travelling for work.\nHourly makes it possible to monitor your own every diem workers, make sure you outlay cash, that assist']	['<urn:uuid:fd28155b-a612-4509-826f-40a5984176b2>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	20	33	788
44	protein powder isolate vs concentrate differences	Protein isolates are more pure, containing at least 90% protein after being extensively extracted and purified from the original source. In contrast, concentrates are less purified and contain greater amounts of other substances, primarily carbohydrates and fats. There's also a hydrolyzed form, which has been enzymatically treated to partially pre-digest the protein, potentially making it easier and faster to digest and assimilate in the body.	['By Jenna Corbin, MS, RD, LD, CSSD, CLT, PES, CESProtein Powder in the Bigger PictureTake the quiz now for 1 SPIN® CEC Protein powder supplementation has been a common practice in the fitness industry for decades, particularly in the bodybuilding community; but it is growing in popularity among other groups such as the weight loss population (as meal replacement) and even in critically ill patients who need extra nutrient-dense calories (e.g., cancer or immunosuppressed patients). The food industry has responded to consumer demand by manufacturing a variety of protein powder products to meet the diverse needs of today’s health-aware demographic. Consequently, it has become increasingly difficult to select the best protein powder product for a given objective because the numerous options available. With all the different types of protein powders out there, the question often becomes “which is best?” There’s technically no right answer, as it will depend on individual goals, beliefs, tolerance, preference and taste. Even the “best” protein powder isn’t going to be very beneficial if it cannot be stomached.Protein is a nutrient of particular interest after training and throughout the day because it is critical for optimizing protein synthesis (to repair muscle tissue and optimize muscle mass). However, protein is not the only important focus for daily and post-exercise nutrition. Adequate total calorie, macro- and micronutrient intake around training and throughout the day should also be prioritized.Thus, an effort should be made to obtain protein requirements through whole food because it provides synergistic nutrients in the “whole package”. This helps contribute to overall dietary variety and diversity and provides the body with a broad spectrum of nutrients (macronutrients, micronutrients and phytochemicals). If ‘nutrient timing’ after a workout is of concern, remember in most cases there is up to a 1-2 hour window of time to optimally replenish nutrient stores—so a whole food-based meal is feasible in most circumstances. Plus, consistent and adequate intake throughout the remainder of the day may be just as important, if not more.However, tolerance issues, time and convenience may make protein powders a more practical option. They can be used to make shakes or smoothies, mixed into foods such as hot or cold cereals, yogurt, cottage cheese or even used in a variety of ways when baking or cooking (homemade snack bars, muffins, pancakes, granola, etc.). The options are endless and supplementing with extra protein is a great way to boost any foods’ protein content. With that said; let’s explore some of the options available.\nProtein Powder 101 Protein powders can come from both animal and plant sources; including animal sources such as dairy (whey and casein) and egg; and plant proteins such as soy, rice, hemp, and pea. Within each source may be different types of powder—concentrate, isolate, or hydrolyzed--that are classified based on differences in processing.In a general and simplified sense, protein isolates are a more “pure” source of a protein since more protein has been extracted and purified out from the original source (animal or plant). An isolate is made up of at least 90% protein. A concentrate is less purified from the original source, and thus has a greater amount of other substances (namely carbohydrate and fat). Finally, hydrolyzed protein has been enzymatically treated to partially pre-digest it, which reportedly helps ease and hasten its digestion and assimilation by the body.The major marker of quality and usefulness of protein powders is their bioavailability—expressed as their amino acid composition (amount and variety) and how well they are digested, assimilated and utilized by the body after ingestion (with ultimate delivery to target tissue). There are various methods used to determine the quality of the different proteins (Biological Value, Net Protein Utilization, Protein Efficiency Ratio, and Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score or PDCAAS), with PDCAAS being considered the most precise and commonly used of those currently available. Whey and egg protein rank the highest among all the methods, while whey, casein, egg, and soy protein all have PDCAAS of “1” on a scale of “0-1”. All other known plant-based proteins have PDCAAS lower than 1.Regardless of the classification system utilized, however, protein quality ultimately depends on its amino acid profile. Complete protein sources that contain the greatest amounts of essential amino acids generally have higher protein quality.Whey Protein:For a variety of reasons, whey protein is currently the most popular source marketed to active individuals and athletes. It’s one of the two milk proteins, comprising ~20% of the protein in milk. Like all animal proteins, it’s considered a complete protein—containing all of the essential amino acids in adequate amounts to meet currently suggested requirements for physiologic needs. Not only is it digested and assimilated quickly (considered a “fast” protein source), it contains high levels of the essential and branch chain amino acids—particularly leucine. As a result, it possesses special anabolic properties (muscle building) and has been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis to a greater extent than other types of protein. It has also generally been reported to be one of the better tasting and easier to use protein powders.Even though whey does have some pretty impressive properties, it isn’t the only option for a quality protein supplement. Depending on tolerance, beliefs or preferences, trying one of the following alternate options may be appropriate.\nCasein ProteinCasein makes up the other ~80% of protein in milk, and is considered a “slow” protein due to the rate of digestion and delivery of amino acids to the body. Therefore, casein protein is suggested to be a good option for those looking to increase satiety throughout the day. It is also speculated to be the best protein option at night (to minimize any muscle losses throughout the nightly “fast”) again due to its “slow” properties. This is purely anecdotal at this point, and in fact other proteins (such as whey) or a mix of proteins (whole food) are good choices as well—especially in the interest of variety.\nEgg ProteinEgg protein, most often found in the form of egg white powder, is not as popular a powder as whey or casein—possibly related to taste. Nevertheless, it is still a very high-quality, complete protein that has a medium rate of digestion and delivery. Egg white protein powders are a good alternative for those who cannot consume soy or dairy and can be used similar to whey in shakes, baking/cooking, or added to foods. This may be an especially good case to consume the whole food (egg) due to its rich nutrient content beyond just protein (i.e., micronutrients) and functional food properties.\nSoy Protein Soy protein is a plant-based protein that is generally considered complete based on its amino acid profile and also has a medium rate of digestion and delivery. As a protein powder, it can be found in both concentrate and isolate forms. It does not have as high of leucine content ounce-for-ounce as animal proteins, especially whey, and thus is not as efficient of a protein source for muscle protein synthesis. Soy is also high in isoflavones, which are compounds that have potential estrogen-like effects on the body. So although there are some possible hormonal concerns with soy protein, especially in isolated powders and with high consumption, much of the concern regarding soy’s estrogenic or ‘feminizing’ effects appear to be overstated. Regardless, the general recommendation is not to consume too much soy protein, staying around ~25g/day—especially for men or those with hormone balance concerns. Try to choose whole food-based soy options as much as possible (whole soybeans, miso, soy milk, tofu and tempeh).\nAdditional Plant-Based Proteins: Rice, Hemp, and Pea The protein portion of rice (PDCAAS ~0.47), hemp (PDCAAS ~0.48) and pea (PDCAAS ~0.69) is extracted to create powders that are plant-based, so they are ideal for those looking for vegetarian or vegan options, or with allergies or intolerances to milk or soy--although they’re good alternative options for anyone. These proteins are often labeled as “incomplete” since as a natural, independent source they have inadequate amounts of at least one essential amino acid to meet requirements. However, incorporating various plant-based proteins into a balanced, well-rounded diet can ensure all essential amino acid needs are met. One thing to note, tastes of these various protein powders can vary and are often acquired. Typically, rice, hemp, and pea proteins are higher in carbohydrate (and fat, especially in the case of hemp) with a lower overall protein content. As a result, more total protein powder would need to be consumed in order to get the same amount of essential amino acids and beneficial physiologic effects as animal-based powders.One last word of caution, no matter what type of protein powder you choose, make sure it comes from a trusted, reputable company. And preferably is third-party tested for quality and purity—to increase confidence that is has in it what it says it has, and doesn’t have anything it doesn’t say it has. Read the label and choose a product with as few “extra” ingredients as possible—the closer it is to having just “protein” on the label the better.Protein powders are not a necessity in order to reach health and performance goals, and the first go-to strategy should in fact be a whole-food based meal as much as possible. However, a variety of factors may not make this most practical. Choosing alternatives, such as a protein powder, can help fill in the gaps and meet needs within the context of an overall, sound training and nutrition plan. Although whey protein is often touted as the “best” choice for a protein powder, there are actually many options that are good, high-quality choices. What specific protein powder one chooses to use should be based on individual preferences, beliefs, schedule, goals and needs. In the interest of variety, quality, and effectiveness, it in fact wouldn’t be a bad idea to try-out and appropriately incorporate various types of protein powders in a well-balanced, whole food-based plan.Jenna has an undergraduate degree in Foods & Nutrition and a Master’s degree in Human Movement.

45	How do serverless business flows work and what deployment options exist?	Serverless business flows operate through asynchronous chains of Lambda functions with atomic responsibilities, communicating via events. For example, a flow might involve message queuing through SQS, notifications via SNS, data storage in DynamoDB, and indexing in Elasticsearch. For deployment, organizations can either use cloud providers like AWS, Google, Microsoft, or IBM for Platform-as-a-Service, or adopt Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) where code can be directly uploaded and run without managing any infrastructure, with providers automatically handling all environment setup and maintenance.	['Microservices paradigm lets application teams develop production-ready applications with independent modules communicating with each other through asynchronous events. By taking advantage of this modularity, application teams have started delivering software faster with small slices that communicate with each other using asynchronous event sources. Serverless took that modularity one step further by breaking the application into even smaller pieces (a.k.a. functions) running nearly atomic tiny business logic. Thanks to serverless’ nature with less-ops and more reusable modules, application teams can now deliver faster with ultimate scalability.\nThanks to the amazing folks in the serverless community, serverless developers are gifted with many great tips for building serverless apps at the production scale. However, best practices for serverless application development has not been prescribed in a holistic way until today. To fill this gap, AWS just launched Serverless Lens for AWS Well-Architected tool in the console. Serverless Lens enlights the path of application teams to deliver well-architected serverless applications from operational excellence, reliability, security, performance efficiency and cost optimization perspectives.\nIn this post, we will demonstrate how Thundra can help you easily apply one of the best practices recommended in the Operational Excellence pillar. We’ll explore through the distributed tracing enhanced with additional context to understand the application behavior and maintain operational excellence.\nWe will use a blog application to demonstrate how distributed tracing can boost the visibility of your Serverless application. This application has two different personas - blog authors and editors. Using the blog application, blog authors can submit their drafts, get feedback, and edit/delete their blog posts. It allows editors to review drafts, submit feedback, and publish the blogs when it’s ready.\nHow do event-driven business flows work?\nThe blog-application is designed with a serverless paradigm and decomposed into many small Lambda functions with nearly atomic responsibility and least privileged permissions. When a first request comes into the system, an asynchronous chain of invocation begins through events flowing between Lambda functions. This is called “business flow” which represents a meaningful chain of invocations that achieve a real job for the users of the software. As an example, When an author submits a blog post, a business flow of making that blog post ready for review gets started. Let’s have a closer look.\nYou can see the whole picture of the business flow drawn automatically by Thundra above. Let’s walk over those operations one by one:\n- The blog application should immediately display a message explaining that the post is saved and will be reviewed by editors.\n- The new blog post is ingested into an SQS queue.\n- A worker Lambda consumes from SQS and publishes a message to SNS to notify the editors.\n- The same Lambda saves the blog post so that it can be used for review by editors.\n- From the DynamoDB record, another Lambda gets triggered and writes the content to an Elasticsearch table with necessary indexes so that it can be searchable among millions of blog posts.\nHow to evaluate the health of Serverless business flows?\nWe have gone through a happy-path scenario in which everything worked harmonically. However, every system will fail at some point, and when that happens we should be able to answer the question – How do we know our system is working as expected?\nDetermining the health of each function individually can help us spot one error in one part of the system, but it’s cumbersome to see the effect of that error in the business flow it belongs to.\nFor this reason, we need a way to track the request coming from the customer all the way to the Elasticsearch– We can do exactly that with distributed tracing. With distributed tracing, engineering teams can quickly visualize how their system behaves, its integrations and potential performance bottlenecks, and can use it to pinpoint issues in an asynchronous architecture a lot faster than they would normally do.\nDistributed tracing can be achieved either by the development teams manually either in an automated fashion with observability solutions like Thundra.\nWhile Thundra makes it incredibly easy to enable tracing for your Serverless Applications with no code change, you can harness the full power of Thundra with the Tags feature to add additional context to your transactions as suggested by the Serverless Lens.\nHow does Thundra help with distributed tracing enhanced with additional context?\nWhen you plug Thundra into your serverless environment, it automatically starts generating distributed traces revealing the asynchronous business flows end-to-end.\nEnd-to-end means understanding and managing the aggregate set of distributed services an application consumes down to the line level of the runtime code for every Lambda function.\nIn our example, when we submitting a new blog post, Thundra automatically generates a trace map without modifying any message written to any resource. Thundra’s distributed tracing functionality makes it possible to build detailed visual trace maps, track message exchanges between Lambda functions and cloud services, and analyze overall app behavior.\nIn the Trace Map view, Thundra automatically lays out the whole transaction, where you can see what happened at each line of the invocation, including values of local variables.\nHaving that visibility already helps to analyze the behavior and maintain the health of your application – However, there’s a lot more we can do by introducing tagging.\nWith Thundra’s tagging mechanism, you can report on any business transaction or identifiers to help your engineering teams easily correlate what performance incidents directly or indirectly impact customer experience.\nFor our example, it’s wise to tag the name of the author in order to filter out the traces related to this person. To do this, you simply use our Thundra library and set a tag as a key-value pair as shown below.\nHow to make the best use of distributed tracing with additional context on Thundra?\nIn the Thundra console, you can quickly use tags at the top of the screen to filter transactions accordingly, and even set up compound alerts based on them.\nFor this trace, you can see an invocation in which the username is set to `Emrah Samdan`. From here, we use our SQL-like expressions to find all transactions with this author that took longer than 2 seconds.\nTaking a step further, you can set up an alert on top of that query and be notified for the traces that match our criteria. Thundra lets you define your own alerting conditions and follow the business flows very closely in this way. You can forward alerts to your email, Slack, and incident management platforms like Opsgenie and PagerDuty.\nIn summary, I frankly believe that the Serverless Lens introduced by AWS Well-Architected team will help software teams adopt serverless for any size of application fast and more safely. We are proud of being an integral part of achieving the operational excellence defined by AWS Well-Architected.\nFor any software team, distributed tracing enhanced with additional context plays a key role in the operational excellence of any serverless application. Additional context is more meaningful when developers can make it an integral part of their monitoring and alerting system.\nYou can start with Thundra through AWS Marketplace or directly from our console for free and upgrade the paid plans when your need grows. Getting started with Thundra is pretty easy by following the below steps:\n- Step 1: Connect Thundra to your AWS Account (Optional): By installing the AWS CloudFormation stack provided by Thundra, developers can instantly list all of their serverless functions and their invocations with logs associated. Although Thundra stack requires the least permissions needed for its operation, this step is still optional for the teams that don’t want to install a third-party CF stack to their functions.\n- Step 2: Auto-instrument the Serverless Applications with Thundra Libraries: In order to generate distributed and local(showing what happened in a Lambda line-by-line) traces, you need to add Thundra libraries into your application by adding Thundra Layer to your application. This makes Thundra automatically wrap your Lambda and instrument the AWS SDK calls, HTTP calls, or requests to non-AWS resources such as Redis. Instrumentation can be done with a single click from Thundra console if you plug Thundra to your AWS account as explained in Step 1. If you didn’t, it’s still achieved by AWS SAM.', 'Serverless Computing: Will Amazon Lambda Be a Game Changer?\nCloud computing (Amazon Lambda) has changed the game for system administrators.\nOnce upon a time there were physical boxes, one for each sever. Then there was a physical box that hosted many “virtual” servers. Then there were hosted servers in the cloud with no boxes. All the servers, regardless of the server environment, ran the same software and served the same function. They all had to be maintained by experts and kept patched, monitored, and secure.\nBut now, some of those environments are going away all together. Instead of maintaining a server to use for running your applications, Amazon AWS will take care of all the administrative work for you, and simply allow you to input code. Lambda runs the code for you on an environment they manage. You never have to patch, backup, or monitor the environment. You don’t even have to provision the server beforehand; Lambda does it for you. This has led to a new acronym: FaaS, or Function-as-a-Service.\nWhat’s Amazon Lambda?\nAWS Lambda is a serverless computing platform. You give it code, it runs the application for you. This saves countless hours of infrastructure support. But that’s not all. As we will see later, it also utilizes a cost-effective pay-per-use model. You don’t pay for server time when your code isn’t running.\nA colleague of ours works for a biotech startup that engineers microbes that make useful molecules. Their approach brings together technology, automation, and biology with the most sophisticated capabilities in each. A common daily task is analyzing the results of thousands of trials.\nA typical analysis involves examination of 1,000 trials. The team found that each trial analysis required about 10 seconds of CPU time. A complete analysis of all trials took about 10,000 seconds. This means that after uploading the trials and data samples and triggering the system to run, the results would not be known for almost three hours.\nA software engineer had an idea to use AWS Lambda After initial setup of the service, he wrote a few lines of code that detailed the algorithm and sample size. Lambda proceeded to set up 1,000 instances, so that each trial analysis would run in its own instance, in parallel. The same ten seconds was needed for each trial analysis, BUT since they were running the analyses in parallel, the total process time was under a minute.\nDo you want to guess how much it cost? … 40 cents!\nNot only did it save time, but it saved money. It saved hours of time maintaining the environment and down time for the system. It saved labor costs for programmers, planning, maintaining, upgrading, backing up, duplicating, and securing.\nThis is one example of how FaaS can benefit any organization running custom applications. While there’s no catch line for Lambda, it could be something like “Upload and run anything in seconds, no headaches, results guaranteed.”\nPaaS, or Platform-as-a-Service, is already well established. An organization can go to Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM or another platform provider and provision servers; there are fewer compelling reasons to directly maintain servers. Boxes are nearly gone, who thought environments would be next?\nThe future looks to be cloud-based computing for all your needs. We’ve already seen applications such as CRM and email be supplanted by Software-as-a-Service offerings. Organizations are increasingly using PaaS to quickly provision servers on an as-needed basis. With FaaS, the future seems to be serverless functions for all computing needs. It’s much cheaper, much faster, much easier, much more reliable and much more secure than trying to use systems you control.']	['<urn:uuid:54d1e286-6396-42b0-b41a-a5057086e666>', '<urn:uuid:c2b86253-75e6-4431-92e9-dec636967d1f>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	11	78	1973
46	What role did the Celtic priests play in ancient rituals, and how did their practices evolve after the Roman conquest of Britain and Gaul?	Celtic priests called Druids were extremely important in Celtic society, serving as scholars, judges, and advisers to kings. While the Romans claimed they practiced human sacrifice, this claim is disputed. The Druids performed sacred rites during festivals like Samhain, wearing white robes and masks to disguise themselves from evil spirits. They interpreted omens by studying sacrificial rituals. However, in the 1st Century B.C., Roman Emperor Claudius Caesar outlawed the Druids' religion and their sacrificial rites. The Romans massacred Druids on the Island of Anglesey and burned their sacred oak groves. While history books claim all Druids were killed, some believe some escaped and still practice today.	['DAILY LIFE IN CELTIC BRITAIN\nBy Tim Lambert\nAbout 650 BC the Celts introduced iron into Britain and they made the first swords.\nWarfare was common during the iron age and many hill forts (fortified settlements) were built at that time. (Although there were also many open villages and farms). The Celts fought from horses or light wooden chariots. They threw spears and fought with swords. The Celts had wooden shields and some wore chain mail.\nMost of the Celts were farmers although were also many skilled craftsmen. Some Celts were blacksmiths (working with iron), bronze smiths, carpenters, leather workers and potters. (The potter’s wheel was introduced into Britain c.150 BC). Celtic craftsmen also made elaborate jewelry of gold and precious stones. Furthermore objects like swords and shields were often finely decorated. The Celts decorated metal goods with enamel. The Celts also knew how to make glass and they made glass beads.\nCeltic society was hierarchical. At the top was a class of nobles headed by a king or chieftain. Below them were the craftsmen (of whom metalworkers were the most important). Then came the farmers who provided the food supply and also fought for the chief. There was also a class of slaves in Celtic England. However the Celts were divided into tribes. There was no political unity among them and a great deal of fighting.\nThe Celts grew crops in rectangular fields. They raised pigs, sheep and cattle. They stored grain in pits lined with stone or wicker and sealed with clay. The Celts also brewed beer from barley.\nTrade with Europe was common. Metals like copper, tin, iron and lead were exported from England. Wool, cloth, skins and grain were also exported. Luxury goods like fine pottery and expensive metal goods were imported from Europe. At first the Celts used iron bars as a form of currency but by about 50 BC they were using gold coins.\nThe Celts lived in round houses. They were built around a central pole with horizontal poles radiating outwards from it. They rested on vertical poles. Walls were of wattle and daub and roofs were thatched. Around the walls inside the huts were benches, which also doubled up as beds. The Celts also used low tables.\nCeltic men wore tunics and trousers and women wore long dresses and mantles. They used bronze mirrors. Women wore belts around their dresses made of cloth, leather or bronze rings. Celtic men soaked their hair in lime water to make it stand up straight. They wore mustaches but not beards. Wealthy Celts wore gold ornaments around their necks called torcs or torques.\nThe Celts made dyes from plants, woad, for blue, madder, for red and weld for yellow.\nFor amusement Celts played board games. They were also very fond of music and played flutes and lyres. In good weather they held horse or chariot races. The Celts also enjoyed hunting wild boar on horseback.\nThe Celts had priests called Druids. The Druids were very important in Celtic society. As well as being priests they were scholars, judges and advisers to the kings. The Celts were polytheists (they worshiped many gods and goddesses). They did not build temples but instead worshiped at natural sites such as groves of trees, springs, rivers and lakes. Sometimes the Celts sacrificed valuable goods by throwing them into lakes and rivers.\nIn Celtic times the old practice of building barrows to bury the dead in died out. Instead people were interned in individual graves. They were still buried with grave goods showing the Celts had a strong belief in an afterlife. They believed that when you died your spirit went to a place called the other world.\nThe Romans claimed the Druids practiced human sacrifice but this claim is doubtful. (See The Druids)\nThe main Celtic festivals were Imbolc at the beginning of February at the start of the lambing season, Beltane at the beginning of May, when cattle were sent out to graze in the fields after being kept indoors and fed on hay during the Winter, Lughasad in August when the crops were growing ripe and Samhain at the beginning of November. That was the time when animals were brought in from the fields for the Winter. The Celts could not grow enough hay to feed them all so those not needed for breeding were slaughtered.\nAlthough the Romans regarded the Celts as barbarians they created a sophisticated and advanced society. Women certainly had more freedom than in Roman society and Celtic craftsmen were superb.\nReligion in the Ancient World\nLife in Roman Britain\nA history of England', 'Evolution of Halloween: History & legends page 1\nOver 2,000 years ago the Celtics in France and the British Isles followed a\ncalendar that began November 1st and ended with a festival on October 31st\ncalled Samhain (pronounced Sow-in). Samhain means “Summer’s end” and it\nmarked the “death” of the old year and the birth of the new one. During this\ntime the Celts believed the invisible barrier between the worlds of the living\nand the dead was the thinned to the point the living and dead could contact\nThe Celts believed the spirits of those who died during the year were\nconfined in the bodies of animals and only on Samhain would a diety known as\nthe Lord of the Dead gather the spirits and set them free to begin their\njourney to the Celtic Underworld of Tirna-n’Og. On Samhain, with the barrier\nbetween worlds so thin, a spirit who was homesick could enter the mortal\nworld to return home and visit loved ones left behind. To welcome the spirits,\nfamilies prepared offerings of food and drink and lit bonfires to help guide\nIn Ireland, the Druids, who were the caste of priests, performed animal and\nhuman sacrifices on the eve of Samhain. These sacrifices were done to\nappease the Lord of the Dead and allowed priests to see omens of the future.\nCats were a common animal chosen for the sacrifices. Cats were believed to\nbe one time humans who were turned to cat form as punishment for evil\nBecause many of the spirits returning to earth on the eve of Nov 1st were\nevil, the priets performing the sacred rites of Samhain would wear white\nrobes and masks to disguise themselves. They felt this would trick the evil\nspirits into thinking they were also spirits, not mortals, thus leaving them\nalone. Following suit, the rest of the community would likewise dress as\nspirits to avoid being dragged into the spirit world.\nSamhain was an important time to interpret omens because the season\nprovided a special psychic climate. Predicting the future provided a sense of\ncontrol to the community who was facing the coming long dark winter with it’s\nunknown challenges. The priests would interpret the omens by studying the\nsounds, smells, smoke, color of the fire, etc that occurred during the\nsacrifices of animals and humans.\nWith the heightened spiritual energy abound on Halloween, many divination\npractices evolved. Throughout Northern Europe, many marriage divinations\nwere performed by young men and women who wished to know their future\nlove lives. In England, a tradition called Apple Snapping was practiced by the\nsingle people in the community. This was played by partially inserting a coin\ninto an apple that is hung from the ceiling by a string. Then two people at a\ntime try to pull the coin out of the apple using only their teeth. The one who is\ngets the coin is said to be the next to marry.\nThe Celts in Ireland believed that on Samhain a race of goblin-like creatures\nwith occult powers would be free to roam and pillage the land. These\ncreatures were sinister looking with dark green skin. Celts would leave\nofferings of food outside their doors at night on Samhain to appease these\ncreatures and avert property damage and theft of food and livestock that\nwould otherwise occur.\nSamhain was a powerful night for fairies. There were hundreds of different\ntypes of fairies in the Celtic lands and on Samhain fairy mounds would open and\nfairies, mostly evil ones, would be free to walk the earth and do mischief. On\nthis night it was even possible for fairies to pull unsuspecting humans who\nwalked over the mounds, down into the world of the fairies where they would\nCharms were developed to protect oneself from the fairies. Iron horseshoes\nwere commonly hung above doorways to keep the spiteful fairies at bay. Still\ntoday iron is used in the making of magical amulets for protection and of\ncourse horse shoes are still hung over door ways of the superstitious. Another\nway to ward off fairies is the ringing of bells, especially church bells.\nIn addition to fairies, the Pooka (phooka) was another creature that was\nfeared in Ireland. This supernatural creature could shape shift and usually\nchoose the form of a black horse with hideous features. Farmers had to\ngather all their crops before October 31st because whatever was left would\neither be destroyed or contaminated by the Pooka.\nIn the 1st Centruy B.C. the Romans invaded Britain and Gaul (present day\nFrance). The Roman Emperor Claudius Caesar outlawed the Druids religion and\nthe sacrificial rites associated with Samhain. The Island of Anglesey (\npresent day Wales) which was the center of Druidic practice saw a bloody\nmassacre where the Romans slaughtered the Druids and burned their sacred\noak groves. History books claim that all Druids were killed, but many believe\nsome escaped and still practice today.\nRomans Influenced Halloween in Northern Europe\nFollowing the Roman invasion of Northern Europe and the outlawing of Druid\npractices, the introduction of Roman festivals occurred across the lands. The\nRomans had their own festival that honored the spirits of the dead. This was\ncelebrated on February 21st by reciting special prayers and leaving offerings\non graves. In November the Romans also had a festival to honor the Goddess\nPomona who presided over orchards and gardens. It was over the next four\ncenturies that several of these customs of the Romans merged with those of\nthe native peoples’ Samhain.\nIn the 4th Century A.D. the Roman Emperor Constantine declared Christianity\nto be the lawful religion of the land. In doing this he launched a holy war on\nPaganism and all the rites and symbols associated with it. The Christians\nfeared the old Celtic beliefs and thought the Celtic underworld was Hell and\nthe Celtic Lord of the Dead was the Devil. The Christians used mostly violent\nmeans to abolish the “evil” practices of the Celts, but they also sought to\nconvert and pagans to Christianity and to Christianize the practices that they\nstill celebrated at Samhain. They did this by changing the names and meanings\nof the old rites and symbols used in the pagan practices.\nThe 7th century saw Pope Boniface IV implement All Saints Day on May 13th\nto honor God and all Christians who died for their belief. But later Gregory\nIII in the 10th century changed the day to November 1st in an attempt to\nfinally abolish the old Samhain festival of the dead. All Saints Day was also\ncalled All Hallows’ Day and the day before, October 31st was called All Hallow’\ns Eve. Over time this evolved into the word Hallowe’en ( later spelled\nHalloween Brought To American by the Irish\nIn Ireland in the 1840s, the potato famine prompted over 700,000 Irish to\nimmigrate to the U.S. They brought their old Halloween customs of Jack-o-\nlanterns, trick-or-treating (originally called guising), and performing love\ndivinations. But because pumpkins were more plentiful in the autumn in the U.\nS., they adopted then in place of the turnips they used to use. This lead to the\npumpkin Jack-o-lantern we now know of today. The celebration of Halloween,\nwith its distinctively pagan roots caused controversy among many religious\ngroups in America during the 19th century. Overtime, however, the popularity\nof Halloween continued to grow and outweighed all the efforts of the\nOrigin of Modern Halloween Practices\nThe modern tradition of trick-or-treating as we know it has its origins from\nmany different countries and traditions.\nOrigins of Modern Halloween From Scotland\nIn Medieval times in Northern England an Scotland a custom known as “souling”\nevolved. “Souling” was a practice whereby the poor dressed up in masks and\ncostumes to disgusie their identities and went house to house to beg for food\nin exchange for offering prayers for recently departed loved ones. Often the\nfood given was called “soul cakes” (oat cakes or bread with currants). The\nchurch actually approved of this practice and made it a religious practice\nbecause they saw it as a way to replace the old pagan customs. Over the\ngenerations, however, this religious practice changed into nothing more than\nchildren going door to door on Halloween night begging for apples and nuts in\nexchange for singing songs.\nIn Scotland and still today a slightly different custom called “guising”\ndeveloped. Children dress up in costumes and go door to door to perform a\n“trick”. These tricks usually involve telling jokes or singing songs in exchange\nfor a “treat”.\nOrigins of Modern Halloween From Ireland\nIreland also lends it roots to Halloween with it’s centuries old tradition of\nappeasing to Muck Olla. This was a feared creature that if made unhappy\nwould punish the household with drought, famine or death. Homage to Muck\nOlla was accomplished by a member of the community dressing up in a “Liar\nBhan“. This was a white robe and on the head was a mask shaped like a horse’s\nhead. The Lair Bhan would lead a procession from house to house collecting\nmoney and food in exchange for the recitation of verses insisting that all good\nfortune that befalls the home is due to the goodness of Muck Olla. The only\nway to receive this good fortune was through donations to the Lair Bhan.\nOrigin of Modern Halloween Practices From Northern Europe\nThe Halloween practices that have played out in Northern Europe over the\ncenturies do differ from those that evolved in Latin American countries and\nSpain and Italy. There is however, a common belief in these regions that the\nend of October and beginning of November sees the doorway to the spirit\nrealm open. At this time the souls of departed ancestors are allowed to visit\ntheir loved ones. Families will light firecrackers in front of their homes to\nhelp the spirits find their way. In Santa Cruz, yellow marigold petals are\nscattered from the loved ones’ grave sites to the door of their home. This\npractice is believed to not only lead loved ones’ spirits home, but also ward off\nOrigin of Modern Halloween Practices From Mexico\nMexico celebrated the Festival of the Dead on November 1st which is a\nnational holiday dedicated to honor the dead. The celebration includes brightly\ncolored cakes and cookies many in shapes of skeletons and skulls. Families\nspend the night at loved one’s grave sites lighting candles, singing songs, and\noffering feasts of food to the spirits.\nRogers, N.

47	What are the key functions of RNA Polymerase?	RNA Polymerase, assisted by other special molecules, scans DNA until finding a legal start sequence. It then attaches and crawls along the chain, matching RNA bits to the DNA pattern and connecting them together to construct specific RNA chains. This process produces three types of RNA molecules: m-RNA, t-RNA, and r-RNA.	['Prokaryotes are the “simplest” known living organisms. Bacteria flagellum are such prokaryotes. This overview is grossly over simplified but it is designed to reveal the extremely complex and nano precision and cascade of events required for prokaryotes cellular function. Many functions are left out of this overview and many functions remain well beyond the grasp of human understanding at this time in science.\nDNA: Is a base-4 information storage molecule, comprised of phosphates (sugars) and four chemical code constructs abbreviated as A, T, G, and C — paired A-T and G-C. The structure in a double helix much like rungs in a flexible ladder. Every three of these pairs (43 or 64 possible combinations) specifies either one of 20 amino acid molecules to make proteins.\nRNA Polymerase molecule: RNA Polymerase, with the help of many other special molecules, scans the DNA until it finds a legal start sequence, attaches itself, and “crawls” along the chain matching bits of RNA (similar to DNA but different in a few critical points) to the pattern on the DNA, connecting them together, and thereby constructing very specific RNA chains (specified by the exact pattern of the DNA molecule. These chains fold into complex and specific shapes (DNA doesn’t fold like this), some of which are themselves little machines. Three types of these produced RNA molecules are m-RNA, t-RNA, and r-RNA.\nThe Messenger RNA molecule: m-RNA is, like DNA, a data carrier — except that it doesn’t replicate or do many other things the DNA molecule does. Unlike DNA’s information, RNA’s information is easily accessible (but also more subject to damage). It is short-lived but can be read by another piece of cellular machinery; specifically the r-RNA molecule.\nThe Transfer RNA molecules: t-RNA hunts around the cell for specific amino acids. There is a different t-RNA for one of each of the 20 different amino acids used by life. Each t-RNA is also coded with three RNA markers (kind of like a bar code) also called a “codon” which identifies what amino acid it carries so that the ribosome can determine what kind of amino acid it is and thereby assemble to protein chain to the recipe.\nThe Ribosomes r-RNA: Ribosomes, whose actual structure includes more than fifty different proteins in addition to their RNA, are tiny nano-tech numerically-controlled molecular assembly machines. They take individual amino acids (sorted and delivered to them by t-RNA molecules), select the correct ones (using the pattern supplied by m-RNA molecules and the “bar codes” on the t-RNA), align them (using little alignment jigs), then connect them together into a chain (while driving away water molecules, that would inhibit chemical bonding, by hitting them with tiny little hammers that fly back and forth at about 10 or 20 times a second), and finally check for errors (discarding incorrectly assembled amino-acid protein chains).\nThese tiny machines are powered by ATP molecules which prokaryotes produce directly in their cell wall and cytosol. In other types of cells (called eukaryotes), this ATP is produced in a different piece of chemical machinery called mitochondria (which have there own slightly different DNA and genetic code). Prokaryotes do not have mitochondria. This is how Ribosomes produce the many different kinds of proteins, including RNA Polymerase (see #2 above) and the 50 or so different proteins which they themselves require.\nIn conclusion, all very simple really.']	['<urn:uuid:e672429b-84d9-4921-9448-c4d51cee5e47>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	8	51	559
48	solitary play vs parallel play age difference	Solitary play typically occurs in young toddlers between 6 months to 2 years old, while parallel play is common in toddlers between ages 2½ and 3½. During solitary play, children play alone and are uninterested in others, while in parallel play children play side-by-side and may mimic each other though there's still limited interaction.	"[""Now that school’s been in session for a bit, I’m sensing a lot of ambient anxiety from other parents about what’s normal in terms of kids and friendships. A handful of recurring fears are showing up in my group chats, like: My son told me he’s playing alone at recess, does that mean he has no friends? My daughter got excluded from a game of house — is mean girl behavior starting in preschool now?\nThere’s also the array of emotions that you may feel watching your kid toddle out into the world without you. I can attest to thinking deeply unkind and possibly demented thoughts about someone else’s 4-year-old the first time I saw my older girl get pushed down on the playground. Those protective feelings are a “biological instinct, we’re designed to help our offspring survive,” said Sally Beville Hunter, Ph.D., a clinical assistant professor in the department of child and family studies at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I didn’t exact revenge on that pushy preschooler, but I understand the urge to get involved when you believe your child is getting emotionally or physically hurt.\nI spoke to two child psychologists, a psychotherapist and a school counselor about what is developmentally appropriate for children when it comes to making friends, why playing alone doesn’t necessarily mean anything is amiss and when healthy kid conflict edges into bullying.\nWhat’s happening developmentally: Before kids are around 3, they will mostly be engaging in parallel play — which means they will be doing the same activity next to each other, but not really interacting. Between 3 and 5, kids are just learning how to play together. “They may not yet prefer peers over parents,” Dr. Hunter said, but they should have the desire to play with other kids. Which is to say, don’t fret if your kid doesn’t want after-school play dates just yet — as long as he enjoys socializing with other children at school and in general, he’s on track.\nTypically kids will engage in dramatic play at this age (playing family, or animals, or cartoon characters), and rough and tumble play is also to be expected. Sometimes kids just need to hit things with a stick, and as long as they’re not hitting other kids, that’s an expected part of their development.\nBefore kindergarten, kids are “very egocentric, and mostly worried about themselves,” said Vanessa Green Allen, a school counselor in North Carolina and the author of “The No More Bullying Book for Kids.” They are working on building skills like sharing, waiting their turn and participating in group dynamics.\nThey don't start to build true empathy — putting themselves in someone else’s shoes — until age 4 or 5. In developmental psychology, it’s called “theory of mind,” and it’s the knowledge that others have different beliefs or thoughts than you do. Kids “have just learned words can be hurtful,” Dr. Hunter said — but it doesn’t occur to them at that age to stay mad at someone who has insulted them. In kindergarten and first grade, children are quick to get offended, and quick to forgive.\nPlaying alone isn’t always a red flag. All the experts I spoke to said that unless a child tells you she is lonely or feels excluded, playing alone isn’t a problem. “Any preschool director will tell you it’s not uncommon for one kid to be sitting off alone,” said Katie Hurley, a child psychotherapist based in California and the author of “The Happy Kid Handbook.” Because school is very academically focused from the start now, there isn’t much time for quiet space during the day, and it’s good for kids to take the down time they may need. It’s also important to remember that there’s enormous variation in children’s personalities, just as there is for adults. Some kids are introverts and some are extroverts. “Some kids love loud and noisy play, some kids like puzzles and quiet play and digging in the sand alone,” Hurley said.\nSome conflict is normal. If your child comes home complaining that a friend was “mean” to him, he may just be venting. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a larger problem or that you need to get involved. He’s likely just expressing frustration that recess didn’t go the way he wanted it to — your kid wanted to play kitty family, and the other kid wanted to play doggy family. If you’re getting the garden variety complaint list, just listen and let him process his day without trying to fix it. “You’re their soft landing,” Hurley said.\nWhen to get involved: If your child comes home day after day saying that the same kid is targeting her, either emotionally or physically, it’s time to talk to her teacher. They can give you context that may be more nuanced than what your child is reporting at the end of a long school day, Hurley said.\nHowever, at this age, sometimes kids won’t tell you if something is very wrong, so look out for changes in their behavior: If they’re no longer eating or sleeping well, acting out at home or refusing to go to school, said Lauren Knickerbocker, Ph.D., a child psychologist at N.Y.U. Langone’s Child Study Center, speak to their teacher about what’s happening at school.\nIf your child is struggling to make friends and is telling you he’s lonely, you need to figure out the root of the issue, Dr. Knickerbocker said. To help build his friendship skills and confidence, schedule play dates where he can get practice sharing and taking turns with parental help around the corner. When you have play dates, “Focus on the positive things they’re doing, rather than focusing on what they’re not doing,” Dr. Knickerbocker said.\nReading your children books about making friends can help, too, said Vanessa Green Allen, the school counselor. Maria Russo, the Times’ children’s books editor, recommends the Elephant and Piggie series from Mo Willems; “Be a Friend” by Salina Yoon, which is inclusive of kids on the autism spectrum; and “Pie Is for Sharing” by Stephanie Parsley Ledyard with illustrations by Jason Chin.\nP.S.

This is where the child seems to be not engaged or actively playing with others at all. They may remain still and be engaged in random movements with no objective. This stage of play is mostly seen in new-borns and infants, between birth and one year old. This is an important setting stage for future play exploration and development. Lots of hand and mouth development is learnt at this age, and this can be misinterpreted as teething. At this age, children learn most form their senses and by putting things in their mouth, they are discovering preferences and control and an understanding of the work around them.\nChildren then move on to Solitary Play. During this stage of play, children will often play alone, with toys away from others, and be uninterested or unaware of what others around them are doing. This stage of play is most commonly seen in young toddlers between the ages of six months to two years, but it is important for children of all age groups to participate in from time to time. Solitary play is common at a young age because cognitive, physical and social skills have yet to fully develop. This type of play is important because it teaches children how to entertain themselves. A good thing to do at this age is to offer your child lots of variety in their toys, so they can spend time exploring it by themselves. Treasure Baskets are a great way of doing this without spending lots of money. Messy play is another good thing to provide for them at this age, as they love to explore, and it also helps if you have a with fussy eater, as they can get used to touching different things. Sand, water, Gloop (cornflour and water), playdough, shaving foam, jelly, dry pasta, bubbly sand (sand mixed with washing up liquid) all make fabulous messy play activities.\nThe next stage is Parallel play. This is when children play side-by-side from one another, but there is a lack of group involvement amongst them. They will typically be playing with similar toys and often they will mimic one another. Parallel play is common in toddlers between the ages of 2 ½ and 3 ½ but can take place at any age. Although it looks like there is very little contact between them, these children are learning valuable social skills and actually learn quite a lot from one another. For this reason, parallel play is important as a transitory stage for the development of social maturity, which is key to later stages of play. Children are also starting to enjoy Imitative Play and enjoy role play at this age. Introducing things such as dolls or a ‘shop’ will enable them to act out what they see every day, when they go shopping their parents. It is always very interesting to watch children playing I this way, as you will see a lot of yourself in their play, the things they say are likely to be what you say!\nHelp children to play together and help them to share, by role modelling this even if it is for a short period of time.\nAfter that, Associative play starts – At this stage, children will begin to play together, but not focused towards a common goal. A child will be more interested in playing with other children around them than the individual toys they play with. Associative play is slightly different than parallel play as children may continue to play separately from one another, but they start to become more involved in what others around them are doing. You may find children playing or trading with the same toys or actively talking with or engaging one another, but no rules of play are being set. This type of play typically begins around ages three or four years, extending into the pre-school age. This is an important stage of play because it develops necessary skills such as cooperation, problems solving, and language development.\nBoard games and physical play is great for children of this age, as they can work together, help each other and start to understand team working.\nCooperative play – Cooperative play is where play finally becomes organised into groups and teamwork between children is actually seen. Children are now interested in both the people that they are playing with as well as the activity at hand. The group is more formalised with a leader, as well as other assigned roles, and play organises around accomplishing group goals or specific tasks. Cooperative play begins in the late preschool period, between the ages of four and\nsix years. It is uncommon to see children reach this stage until these later years, as it requires an evolved set of organisational skills and a higher degree of social maturity. Cooperative play brings together all the skills learned across previous stages into action, giving the child the necessary skills for social and group interactions.\nBy this time, children are starting to form friendship groups and seek out other children with the same interests as them to play with.\nSpend some time thinking about how your child plays, what stage of play are they in?']"	['<urn:uuid:e8716a5d-17ee-48b9-9105-d37ff10da393>', '<urn:uuid:3945a9ab-1207-414f-88d4-f879470a1c41>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	7	54	2310

Regarding environmental impact, while large farms have better resources for environmental controls, small farms can sometimes be less reliable - for example, some small producers may abuse food safety requirements like antibiotic use. Large farms' environmental effects include significant contributions to methane emissions and loss of wild areas to agriculture.	"['Eugenia Serova: Big and small farms will coexist in the future\n22 October 2018\nLarge farms are getting larger – a trend that has been recently observed worldwide. Large farms use modern methods of irrigation and farming techniques and achievelower costs due to economies of scale. This way they may be considered to positively contribute to the society by providing food at an affordable price. However, there are a number of societal concerns related to large scale farms, in particular with regard to their impact on the environment and their sustainability. Eugenia Serova, Senior Economist at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Liaison Office in Moscow, Russia, shares her view on the trade-offs between the large farms’ needs to generate profits and provide benefits to society.\nWhat do you think are the main drivers of large scale farming today?\nIn principle, the development of large scale farming is a natural way of farm owners and managers to act according tothe principles ofmarket economy and achieve economies of scope and scale.Another driver of large scale farming which is characteristic of the time after the break-up of the centrally planned system is big Soviet farms’ heritage.\nAre large scale farms more efficient than medium or small scale farms in your opinion?\nIt is not about efficiency of the big farms; it is about efficiency of the entire value chain.The individual small farms can be much more productive then big farms. But, being included in an inefficient value chain, they can lose. To exemplify, for the dairy plant it is much easier in terms of transaction costs to collect milk from one big farm than from 10,000 small producers. However, to be honest, I wonder why agricultural economists always want to know whether a specific farm typeis more efficient than the others. Why do we always try to compare them and why do we try to define which one is more productive? I think that farms are diverse and different on purpose.\nIs large scale agriculture in conflict with sustainability objectives?\nIt is dubious. On the one side, large scale agriculture seems to be better in terms of environmental, quality and safety issues because large farms have better management control systems, more financial resources to buy modern technologies ofdealing withanimal waste and plant diseases, as well as other technologies that make the environment clean and safe for the generations to come. Small farms are not so reliable in this respect. People think that the label “product from the farmer” means that the product is organic. However, small producers can abuse food safety requirements even more often than bigger farms. I recently visitedasmall Chinese farm participating in the organic value chain where Inoticeda massive use of antibiotics for chicken breeding. On the other side, lobbying power of the big farms may allow them to avoid the public environmental and safety control in order to reduce their cost. In the USA, there is a special term – ag-gag – describing legal resources of the big agricultural companies to affect the policy.\nDo you see any differences or similarities between large scale farms in different parts of the world?\nLarge farms in different countries arequite different. They are established in different ways and drivenby different incentives. For example, if you look at the top ten largest Australian farms, you notice that their land area of one or two million hectares per farm is enormous in comparison to the land area of top ten Russian or Ukrainian farms. The biggest Chinese industrial farms operate even five to nine million hectaresper farm – really unbelievable. Then, if you take a look onthe number of employees such farms employ, you will notice that huge areas of land and huge herds of cattle on Australian farms are managed by only five to ten employees, whereas smaller farms in Russia or Ukraine employ 20,000 to 50,000 people per farm. The farm landscape is different in different parts ofthe world.\nWhat do you think are the long-term perspectives of large farms?\nI think that large farms will exist in the future and will continue to develop. Consolidation in the agricultural and food sectors will continue. But it does not mean that small farms will cease to exist. No. Small farms have their advantages. Small farms are able to produce products of special sorts and flavors which large farms are not able to produce. Large farms are specialized in producing large amounts of standardized products. So, in the future, there will always be a place for small and medium-size producers which can find their niches. I observe changing consumer preferences. Earlier consumers wante djust a tomato or an apple, but nowadays they increasingly want a tomato or an apple of a specific form or taste. They want variety and exclusivity. These attributes have their price. Small farms can specialize in production of such exclusive types of products in small quantities and at a special price.', ""Environment soccer us politics business tech the upside rooftop farming: why vertical gardening is blooming in animals farmed europe's meat and dairy production must halve by 2050, expert.

50	At what height is the Tropopause in the United States?	In the Contiguous 48 US States, the average Tropopause height is roughly 36,000 feet.	['In Avoiding Other Aircraft, we highlighted the cruise altitudes available to pilots depending on the type (VFR/IFR) and direction of flight. With this post, we’ll take cruising altitudes a step further and examine how to choose the best altitude for existing circumstances. As you might imagine, a variety of factors affect the altitudes pilots and dispatchers ultimately decide on. Let’s get started.\nThe Tropopause: Finding the Sweet Spot\nHave you noticed how so many airliners tend to level off near 35,000 ft (“F[light] L[evel] 350” in aviation parlance)? This popular flight level is far from coincidence. The most congested altitudes for enroute airliners result from the performance advantages associated with the Tropopause.\nThe Tropopause is the boundary between the Troposphere, the lowest atmospheric layer, and the Stratosphere. Its height varies with the earth’s curvature, ranging from around 24,000 ft at the poles to approximately 56,000 ft near the equator. In the Contiguous 48 US States, the average Tropopause height is roughly 36,000 ft. A few benefits of operating near this altitude include lack of general aviation (slow) traffic and the ability to summit most weather. However, the performance advantages of Tropopause-area flight are the primary reasons for the deluge of jets at these heights.\nAtmospheric Pressure: As you probably know, atmospheric pressure decreases as altitude increases. This decrease in pressure diminishes engine performance, but results in two significant advantages: 1. Total aerodynamic drag on the aircraft decreases, and 2. The lower the air density, the less fuel is required by the engines. Operating in these fuel-efficient altitudes saves airlines several million dollars each year in fuel expenses alone.\nTemperature: While I’ve stated that decreased atmospheric pressure does diminish aircraft performance, this engine-robbing reduction in pressure is partially offset by the cooler temperatures aloft. Cold air, with its relatively low energy, tends to condense. As temperatures decrease with increases in altitude, the natural tendency of this cool air to compress helps counteract the overall rate of decreasing atmospheric pressure. This cooling of air with increases in altitude is a significant benefit for jets, but is only an option up to the Tropopause.\nThe Game Changer: Besides marking the top of virtually all weather, the Tropopause also denotes the end of decreasing temperatures with increases in altitude. Above the Tropopause, temperature actually increases with altitude, which rapidly diminishes aircraft/engine performance. Above the Tropopause, significant performance reductions eliminate virtually all benefits to be found at higher altitudes.\nOverall, the Tropopause is the sweet spot for airline operations. Reduced aerodynamic drag, low fuel consumption, minimal (if any) weather, and the absence of slow aircraft all increase the efficiency of flight at this level. With this many benefits, it should come as no surprise when your captain announces, “We’ll be cruising along today at 35,000 ft.”\nWhile the Tropopause usually offers the best overall conditions for airliner flight, at times it’s impractical/unwise to climb to the altitudes around FL 350. Let’s look at some reasons why it’s occasionally better to choose altitudes not in the neighborhood of the Tropopause.\nWinds: Winds have a general tendency to increase with altitude. Depending on the direction of flight, this can be a huge blessing or a significant curse. As a tailwind, performance and speed work in the flight’s favor. As headwinds, Jet streams (often in excess of 100 knots) lengthen flight time and burn significantly more fuel. With strong headwinds aloft, it’s often better to seek a lower altitude without the gales.\nLength of Flight: Short flights often negate the advantages of going high. For instance, airplane engines burn more fuel while climbing than in cruise. It doesn’t make sense to spend 30 minutes at climb power to spend 10 minutes in cruise. In many cases, the lengthy climb easily erases any performance savings of the short cruise. For passenger comfort, a period of level flight will also be more tolerable than a flight profile that resembles an inverted V.\nPilots and airline dispatchers usually have many options when deciding on a cruise altitude. For the reasons outlined above, the Tropopause if often a good choice. However, at times conditions make flight at lower levels much more practical.']	['<urn:uuid:021eeb31-8833-4a3d-81b7-24573d1c1730>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	10	14	690

Ismail Bukhary|', 'The Effects of Drug Abuse & Addiction\nDrug abuse can result in short- and long-term negative consequences ranging from issues such as disrupted sleep patterns to loss of employment and problems with relationships.1, 2 Problematic substance use can also increase a person’s risk for developing long-term medical issues such as heart disease, cancer, as well as certain co-occurring mental health conditions.1\nWhich specific type of drug or drugs, how much and how they are used, and an individual’s health are some factors that can contribute to the potential range of adverse effects a person may experience.3 While some consequences result directly from drug abuse and addiction, others may occur indirectly in relation to drug use.\nLearn more about the effects of drug abuse and how a substance use disorder (SUD) may negatively impact your life below.\nHealth Effects of Drug Abuse\nThough the associated, substance-related effects may vary from one drug to the next, general short-term health consequences of drug use can include issues such as:3\n- Changes in appetite.\n- Disturbances in sleep patterns.\n- Cardiovascular issues including stroke and heart attack.\n- Overdose toxicity or death.\nLong term use of some drugs may also increase the likelihood of certain cancers; developing heart, liver, and kidney disease; as well as experiencing neurological issues such as seizures.4, 5 Injecting drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine is also associated with an increased risk of contracting hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, and other infections.6,7 Drug use may also negatively impact cognitive functioning, resulting in impaired responses, planning, decision-making, and memory.8\nDrug use can alter the activity of several brain chemicals—or neurotransmitters—including dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure, reward, and satisfaction, and several different drugs have been found to influence dopamine pathways in the brain.9\nThough the neurochemical details are complicated, consistently elevated dopamine activity as a result of substance use can strongly reinforce drug seeking behavior and compulsive drug use. Additionally, as someone’s brain and body adjusts to frequently being high, they may experience relatively diminished reward from otherwise normally reinforcing activities like sex or eating food.9\nSubstance abuse and mental illness commonly coincide, with research showing that about half of those who experience a mental illness during their lives will also experience a substance use disorder and vice versa.10 Commonly co-occurring mental health disorders include depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder.10\nImpact of Substance Abuse on Relationships\nDrug abuse can affect more than just the person getting high, it can also be detrimental to their relationships with friends, family members, and coworkers.11 Often, couples in which one or both partners abuse drugs are less happy than couples who don’t.11 Using drugs seems to cause significant conflict between intimate partners; these couples tend to fight more often than couples in which both partners don’t use drugs.11 Unfortunately, substance abuse can sometimes lead to violence in intimate relationships as well. 11\nDrug Addiction and Financial Problems\nThe use of illicit drugs can not only affect an individual’s health and relationships but can cause issues for individuals financially—both in their personal and professional lives. It has been estimated that substance abuse—including alcohol, prescription opioids, illicit drugs, and tobacco—has cost the nation more than $740 billion annually in lost work productivity, health care costs and crime.13\nResearch has shown that drug use is related to a number of problematic work behaviors such as decreased performance levels and increased accident rates.14 Additionally, those using illicit drugs may be prone to absenteeism at work, abuse of work benefits, and low workplace rule abidance.14 These issues, in turn, could result in the loss of employment and difficult obtaining new work in the future.\nWhen it comes to the cost of drugs, paying for them can also begin to be a burden on an individual’s income, especially as increasing amounts of the drugs may become necessary to overcome a growing tolerance to their effects. Since drug use can also result in serious health problems, those struggling with addiction may be faced with increased medical fees and/or insurance premiums.\nDrug use can also lead to costs associated with criminal activities such as DUI charges, bail, attorneys, court-mandated classes, court fines, and public transportation due to the loss of a vehicle or license.\nDangers of Overdosing\nRegardless of how often a person uses certain types of substances—such as cocaine, sedatives, heroin, or other opioids—there is always some risk of overdose, especially when these drugs are mixed with other drugs and/or alcohol. In 2018, more than 65,000 Americans died as a result of overdoses, including those that involved illicit drugs and prescription opioid medications.15\nOverdoses can occur when a drug is used to excess, resulting in toxicity or injury and, in some cases, death.16 Various factors can play into whether someone overdoses on a drug, such as a person’s body weight, gender, tolerance, the potency of the drug, and the other drugs that may have been taken with it.17\nWarning Signs of Overdose\nThe signs and symptoms of overdoses can vary based on the drug. Some signs include:17\n- Pale and/or clammy face.\n- Changes in pulse rate and blood pressure.\n- Shallow, erratic breathing.\n- Loss of consciousness.\n- Severe stomach pain.\nIf you believe someone is experiencing an overdose, call 9-1-1 immediately and wait for medical assistance.\nGetting Help For Drug Addiction\nDrug abuse and addiction can greatly impact your life, resulting in negative consequences to every part of your life.

52	how propeller governor work after engine failure in single engine piston aircraft	In single-engine piston aircraft with constant speed propellers, the governor has a 'Fail to Fine' behavior. When there is an engine failure causing loss of oil pressure, the propeller will automatically go to the low-pitch (high RPM) stops. This happens because the propeller is mechanically or aerodynamically driven to fine pitch while the governor normally uses oil pressure to coarsen the pitch (lower the RPM).	['X-Plane simulates governors for constant speed propellers that can have various failure modes. Depending on the type of engine/propeller combination on the aircraft, the behavior of the governor in case of an engine failure will be different. X-Plane 11.30 allows you to select the type of governor to simulate, to accommodate a wide range of different engine types.\nAuto-feather vs governor failure modes\nThe first thing to understand is that failure modes of governors are conceptually different from an auto-feather system. Normally, a propeller governor will have a certain behavior when an engine stops running, which will cause a loss of oil pressure to the governor. This is purely mechanical, and will work regardless of electrical power or other systems in the airplane. An active auto-feather system is different: It electronically senses engine torque and can act on unexpected partial loss of engine torque, even when the engine is still providing some power and oil pressure.\nX-Plane has simulated an auto-feather system comparable to those found on Beechcraft KingAirs for a long time now. To equip your aircraft with this system, check “feather after engine failure” on the Engine page in Plane Maker. The system is armed with the\nswitch. Note that this system is electrical, and will act on the sensed torque, which in turn can depend on a working inverter, if so selected in Plane Maker. When the torque sensors are working, the system itself has power, and the switch is in the armed position, the system will monitor the torque of both engines, if the thrust levers are advanced more than halfway. You will see the respective lights\nfor each engine light up when you’ve throttle up enough and the system was armed.\nNow, if one engine drops below the disarming torque (400ft-lb on the KingAir) the opposite side auto-feather will dis-arm (to avoid feathering both engines at the same time!). If on-side torque continues to drop below activation torque (260ft-lb on the KingAir), this engine is automatically feathered, regardless of other parameters like oil pressure. Now the system has done its job and is dis-armed. The absolute torque values depend on the set engine power and will scale accordingly with larger engines.\nNegative torque sensing\nThis is a different form of Auto-feather. NTS is found on geared-turboprops, where the propeller is directly driven off the same shaft as the compressor. In X-Plane, it is active when the plane is equipped with a fixed-gear turboprop engine and a propeller that has start locks. Then, during flight the propellers are monitored for negative torque, which would be an indication of an engine failure. The prop pitch is automatically adjusted towards coarse when negative torque is detected. Like on a real Honeywell TPE-style engine, NTS has no switch to be turned on or off, and only needs oil pressure to work, which can be tested during engine start (by running the unfeathering pump during start and watching the beta lights). The NTS will retard the prop to the maximum blade angle allowed for the governor. The pilot can engage full feather by pulling the prop speed lever to the feather position.\nGovernor failure modes\nIndependent from an active auto-feather system, constant speed props have different behavior after an engine failure, which can be selected on Engine Page in Plane Maker. These are purely driven by loss of oil pressure that accompanies the engine failure, and do not depend on any sensors or electrical system to act.\n- Fail to Fine: This is the default in single-engine piston aircraft with constant speed propellers. The propeller is mechanically or aerodynamically driven to fine pitch (high RPM) while the governor uses oil pressure to coarsen the pitch (lower the RPM). Upon loss of oil pressure, the propeller will go to the low-pitch (high RPM) stops.\n- Fail to Coarse: This is the default in twin-engine piston aircraft. The propeller defaults to the coarse pitch (low RPM) position and uses oil pressure to achieve finer pitch angles. Upon loss of oil pressure, the prop goes towards coarse pitch, but not necessarily feather (which is just extremely coarse pitch), because on piston twins the propellers are usually equipped with anti-feathering springs that will keep the prop from feathering if the engine is shut down from idle RPM, unless you actually pull the blue knobs all the way back to feather.\n- Fail to Feather: This is the default for free-turbine turboprop aircraft, single or twin. Upon loss of oil pressure, the propeller goes towards coarse pitch all the way to feather. This also happens on shutdown, because a free turboprop engine can start against a feathered prop with no problem, as the core turbine is not locked to the propeller.\n- Fail to Start Lock: This is the default for fixed-shaft turboprop engines, which can’t start against a feathered prop. Upon loss of oil pressure, the propeller will want to go to feather, but there are mechanical locks that need to be engaged for regular engine shutdown, that will keep the propeller in the fine pitch position for shutdown.\n- To engage start locks: During engine shutdown, with shaft RPM below idle but still high enough to produce sufficient oil pressure, pull the thrust lever into reverse.\n- To disengage start locks: With the engine running and shaft RPM at or above idle, pull the thrust levers into reverse.\n- To engage start locks when the engine is shut down and the prop is not locked already: Engage the electric unfeathering pump for the respective prop. This will drive the prop into the beta pitch and the start lock will engage if the power levers are retarded far enough for the locks to catch.\nAt runtime, the selected system is reflected by the dataref\nwhere the number corresponds to the above list. If you have equipped your aircraft with start locks, the data refs\ntells you the status of the start locks, and with\nyou engage the unfeathering pump.\nare the beta lights as array and bitfield respectively, which really tell you the oil pressure towards beta pitch. These lights will tell you when the oil pressure is sufficient to sustain beta, provide a visual cue for when the prop transitions to reverse, and also show you when the NTS system drops the pressure when performing a preflight test of the NTS system.\nFree-turbine turboprops with fail-to-feather governors have another governor that is set to 104% of maximum governed RPM, which cannot be reached in normal operation. In case of a primary governor failure, the overspeed governor will try to coarsen the prop pitch as to not exceed 104% of redline RPM. That means, in order to experience an overspeed beyond 104% you not only need to fail the governor, but also fail the prop pitch control to fine pitch.\nFree-turbine turboprops with fail-to-feather governors also come with a second level of protection, which keeps the engine from overspeeding in case of a prop governor and overspeed governor failure (which you can experience in X-Plane). In case the redline RPM is exceeded, the fuel topping governor will reduce the Py pressure to the fuel control unit, thereby causing the gas generator turbine to create less power. That will reduce the power to the prop and slow it down, even if both the primary and the overspeed prop governor are failed or the prop blades are stuck at a low angle. Note that the fuel topping governor kicks in earlier in beta mode than it does in alpha mode, to prevent the overspeed governor from reducing blade angle in reverse, which would make the situation worse.\nUnderspeed governor and fuel delivery control\nFixed-shaft turboprops equipped with start-locking propellers are equipped with an underspeed governor that regulates the idle fuel supply to keep RPM up in the governed range in alpha operation, and also modulates the idle speed of the engine in beta and reverse modes, to keep the engine at the speed selected by the prop speed lever when prop blade angle is modulated through beta and reverse. It is important to set two parameters in Plane Maker for this to work correctly: “minimum prop governor RPM” is the lowest RPM selectable by the prop speed lever, which is usually 65-75% of the engine design (maximum) speed. “bottom of green arc RPM” is the lowest RPM selectable in flight/alpha mode, the lowest that can be achieved by the prop governor. It also serves as the floor for the underspeed governor in alpha mode. This is usually 96% of design (maximum) engine speed. See the article on fixed turboprop governors for more information.\nTo bring a feathered and stopped propeller out of feather back into alpha pitch, oil pressure is needed to move the prop blades. This oil pressure is typically provided by the oil pump of the engine, as it is rotated by the starter motor. However, the prop can also be unfeathered in other ways:\n- A fixed shaft turbo prop engine with start-locking propeller can be unfeathered with the electrical unfeathering pump providing the oil pressure. Note that the condition lever must not be in the cutoff/feather position, otherwise the oil-pressure is immediately dumped through the feather valve\n- Any other propeller can be equipped with an accumulator. In Plane Maker you’ll find this setting as “unfeathering accumulator keeps oil pressure”. In this case, oil pressure is stored in an accumulator that can be used to unfeather the prop even when the engine is stopped. In that case, the engine can be re-started in the air without the starter motor if needed.']	['<urn:uuid:78122a2c-e566-448c-8e48-4a28d5285fb3>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	12	65	1599
53	task management tools visual collaboration remote distributed teams	While physical Kanban whiteboards and Gantt charts both support visual task management, they have different strengths for distributed teams. Physical Kanban boards are most effective when team members are co-located, as they provide a central gathering point and encourage face-to-face collaboration. However, they present challenges for geographically distributed teams, where digital versions or frequent photos of the physical board may be necessary to keep everyone in sync. Gantt charts, being primarily focused on timeline visualization and task dependencies, can be effectively used regardless of team location, as they help keep everyone aware of project schedules and milestones. Both tools aim to keep team members 'on the same page,' but physical Kanban boards specifically benefit from the immediate visual presence and ability to annotate with hints and initials, while Gantt charts excel at showing long-term planning and resource allocation across distributed teams.	"['I continue to be staggered at the effectiveness, as a process management technique, of simply sticking cards representing tasks onto a whiteboard. Whatever your industry or project management methodology, the ability it offers to visualise the flow of work is immensely powerful. It lets us plan the current work and the near future to maximise our productivity.\nIt\'s valuable whether you\'re working on your own or working as a team. When working as a team, it can be used to schedule work among team members. When on your own, it merely helps with clarity of thought (we\'ll look at why a little later).\nYet this is largely unknown outside of software development. All sorts of industries would benefit from this approach, from farming to law.\nThere\'s lots of variation in the terminology around kanbans, so let me lay out the terms as I use them.\nThe idea of a kanban originates in manufacturing in Japan. The word itself means sign board and refers to the board itself. Specific processes built around a kanban are called kanban methodologies. Scrum calls the kanban a ""Scrum Board"" and naturally there are all manner of other terms and practices for using a similar approach in other methodologies too.\nOnto the kanban we need to stick cards representing tasks - small pieces of work that are easy to pick up and get done. Sometimes tasks will relate to bigger projects. Some call these bigger projects epics, and may use additional cards to represent the relationship of tasks to epics.\nA backlog is the totality of the work yet to do (and again, terms differ; some practices may exclude work that is already scheduled).\nHow to run a kanban\nFirst of all, get yourself a real, physical whiteboard. If you can get a magnetic whiteboard, you can stick task cards to it with magnets, which is nice and clean. But otherwise your tasks can be cards stuck to the board with blu-tak, or post-it notes. I favour index cards of a weighty paper density, about the size of your hand when flat. This lets you write large, clear letters on them, which are easier to see from a distance, and they are somewhat resistant to being scuffed as you stack them into a deck and riffle through it.\nNext, you need to come up with your backlog. If you\'re in the middle of a piece of work, you can start by braindumping the current state. Otherwise, get into a quiet room, with the appropriate people if necessary, and a stack of index cards, and write out cards, or break them down, or tear them up, until you have a set of concrete tasks that will get you to your goal. Make sure everyone agrees the cards are correct.\nThe cards can include all kinds of extra information that will help you plan the work. For example, you might include deadlines or an estimate (in hours, days or your own unit - I like ""ideal hours"").\nSometimes tasks are easy to describe on a card but if you were to pick up the card as something to work on, it wouldn\'t be immediately obvious where to start. These should be broken down into smaller pieces of work during this planning phase. This allows you to see with better granularity how much of the large piece of work is done. I like tasks that are of an appropriate size for each person to do several of them in a week. However, it\'s OK to break down the card into smaller tasks later if the task is probably going to be something to tackle further in the future.\nNow, divide the whiteboard into columns. You will need at least two: something like backlog, and in progress. But you could have many more. Kanban is about flow. Tasks flow through the columns. The flow represents the phases of working on a task. You might start by quoting for work and finish by billing for it. Or you might start by making sure you have all the raw materials required and finish by taking inventory of materials used.\nNone of these practices are set in stone - you can select them and reselect them as your practices evolve. For example, you could focus on longer-range planning:\nSo with your whiteboard drawn, you can put your tasks on the board. Naturally many of your cards may not fit, so you can keep your backlog stack somewhere else. Choosing what to put on the board becomes important.\nNow, just move the cards to reflect the current state. When a task is done, you update the board and choose the next most valuable task to move forward. You might put initials by a card to indicate who is working on it.\nVisit the kanban regularly, as a team. Stop and replan frequently - anything from a couple of times a week up to a couple of times a day - especially when new information becomes available. This might involve pulling cards from the backlog onto the board, writing new cards, tearing up cards that have become redundant, and rearranging the board to reprioritise. Make sure the right people are present every time if possible.\nLess frequently you might make a bigger planning effort: pick up all the cards from your backlog pile or column, and sit down again with the relevant people to replan these and reassess all their priorities. Some of the cards may be redundant and some new work may have been identified.\nThe value of the kanban will then naturally begin to flow:\n- Higher productivity as you see how what you\'re working on fits into a whole\n- A greater ability to reschedule - for example, to park work in progress to tackle something urgent\n- Team collaboration around tasks that seem to be problematic\n- Estimates of when something might get done or which deadines are at risk\nA physical whiteboard seems to be very important. A lot of the practices don\'t seem to evolve properly if you use some sort of digital version of a kanban. There are lots of reasons for this. One obvious one is that physical whiteboards offer the ability to annotate the kanban with little hints, initials, or whatever. Another one is that an online whiteboard doesn\'t beg to be looked at; a physical whiteboard up in your workplace is something to notice frequently, as well as offer a designated place to get away from a screen and plan work.\nNaturally, having a physical whiteboard is only possible if your team is not geographically distributed. Geographically distributed teams are challenging for a whole host of reasons, and this is just one. A digital version of a kanban may be a good approach in those cases. Or perhaps frequent photos of a physical whiteboard elsewhere in the world can help to keep things in sync.\nReadability from a distance helps get value from your kanban. Write in capital letters because these are more readable from a distance. Use a broad felt pen. Use differently coloured index cards or magnets to convey additional information.\nIt\'s somewhat important to ensure that the kanban captures all streams of work. There\'s a tendency to think ""This isn\'t part of the project we\'re planning; let\'s not get distracted by it"". But that reduces the value of the kanban in tracking what is actually happening in your workflow. Obviously, different streams of work can be put in a different place on the kanban, or use differently coloured cards.\nYou can also track obstacles to delivering work on the board. I like to reserve red cards to indicate obstacles. Removing those obstacles may require work!\nWhy Kanbans work\nKanbans are certainly a form of process visualisation. Enabling you to visualise how tasks are flowing will let you spot problems in the process, such as too much work building up that only a certain team member can do. You can design workarounds to a problem like this also right there on the kanban.\nStepping back from this, the reason I\'ve found having a kanban useful even for solo work may be related to the psychological idea of transactive memory, where we use our memory not as a primary store of information, but as an index over other stores of information, such as those in other people\'s heads, or on paper. The model of thought is then very much like a database transaction - we might ""read"" a number of facts from different sources into working memory, generate some new insight, and ""write"" that insight back to an external source.\nBy committing our understanding of our backlog of work to index cards, we can free our memories to focus on the task at hand. And when that task is done, we waste no time in switching back to a view of our workflow that can tell us immediately ""what\'s next"". Or say we encounter new information that we suspect affects something in the backlog - being able to go straight back to that card and recover exactly how we defined the task turns out to be useful: it allows us to quickly assess the impact of new information to our existing ideas and plans.\nThe final reason I believe kanbans work so well is that both the kanban and the stack of cards that represent your backlog are artifacts that are constructed collaboratively in a group. Taking some concrete artifact out of a meeting as a record of what was said cuts down a lot on misremembered conclusions afterwards. Some people try to take ""action points"" out of meetings for the same reason, and then quote them back to everyone by e-mail afterwards. This doesn\'t seem to work as well - I often find myself thinking ""I don\'t recall agreeing that!"" One reason for this is that the record of the action points is not written down for all to see and approve/veto, but a personal list written by the person taking the minutes.\nWriting tasks out on index cards in front of people, and reading them out repeatedly or handing them around (or laying them out on the table for people to move around and reorganise - related in principle to CRC Cards), means that everyone gets a chance to internalise or reject the wording on the card.\nSimilarly, the organisation of kanban is not only a concrete artifact that is modified with other people standing around: it is ever-present to consult and correct. Nobody can have an excuse to leave the kanban in an incorrect state. Thus the kanban is a reliable source of truth.\nSo whatever your industry, whatever your process methodology, set yourself up a kanban and give it a try. Happy kanbanning!', 'What Is The Gantt Chart In Project Management?PHCS\nWhat Is The Gantt Chart In Project Management?\nTable of Content\nOrigins of the Tool\nDefinition Of A Gantt Chart\nReasons to use the Gantt Charts\nHow to create a Gantt Chart Basic Procedure\nCommon mistakes to avoid when using a Gantt chart.\nA Gantt chart is a popular project management tool for visually representing a project timetable. It enables project managers to track progress, anticipates potential delays, and efficiently allocate resources. In this guide, we’ll go over the fundamentals of Gantt charts and how they may help you with project management.\nORIGINS OF THE TOOL\nIn the late 1800s, Polish engineer Karol Adamiecki developed a visual workflow chart that he called a “her monogram.”\nIn around 1910, Henry Gantt, a management consultant, and the engineer took Adamiecki’s concept to the next stage. His chart was designed to help manufacturing supervisors see whether their work was on, ahead of, or behind schedule, and it formed the foundation of the tool we use today.\nDEFINITION OF A GANTT CHART\nA Gantt Chart is a step-by-step visual timeline of all the activities included in a project. Its two main components – a timeline table and a timeline bar chart – present the information both textually and graphically.\nA Gantt Chart normally includes the project’s start and finish dates, as well as its terminal and summary tasks. Each step is shown graphically as a bar against a horizontal time scale (Gantt Chart History, Gantt Chart Software, and Gantt Chart Information, 2012).\nWhy Use Gantt Charts?\nBecause of the many advantages offered by Gantt charts, thousands of companies use Gantt charts to become more productive, enhance their communications, forecast over the long term, and track results. While some naysayers believe they limit the size of the project that can be tracked, those using Gantt charts note an array of key benefits, including the five listed here.\nREASONS TO USE THE GANTT CHARTS\nWhile there are several reasons to use Gantt charts below are five key reasons they are often advantageous:\nAvoid Completion Confusion: Gantt charts were created to keep users on track, providing a visual timeline for starting and finishing specific tasks. By providing a visual overview of milestones and other key dates, these charts offer a more understandable and memorable method of maintaining timescale-based tasks and deliverables whether tracked on a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis.\nKeep everyone on the Same Page: Where there is a visual framework for the work to be done, there are fewer chances for misunderstanding, especially when it comes to highly complex tasks. Using Gantt charts allow all types of stakeholders to have the same information, set mutually understood expectations, and conduct their efforts according to the desired protocol.\nUnderstand Task Relationships: These charts can make clear how various tasks are interrelated and perhaps rely on the completion of another to meet specific objectives. These task relationships revolve around understanding the timing of each task, which then impacts other tasks listed. This can better assure the optimum workflow, maximized productivity and overall project success.\nEffectively Allocate Resources: By being able to look ahead on the Gantt chart, users can discern where resources need to be anticipated, allocated or shared to maximize the use of those resources. The more closely the chart is followed, the better chance there is of keeping project costs within budget while also better assuring on-time completion.\nGet a Handle on the Future: While it is often easy to get caught up in day-to-day tasks as detailed on a chart, Gantt chart advantages include helping decision-makers look farther ahead to ensure each given project is working toward the achievement of the organization’s long-term strategic objectives.\nWhen you set up a Gantt chart, you need to think through all of the tasks involved in your project. As part of this process, you’ll work out who will be responsible for each task, how long each task will take, and what problems your team may encounter. This detailed thinking helps you ensure that the schedule is workable, that the right people are assigned to each task, and that you have workarounds for potential problems before you start.\nThey also help you work out practical aspects of a project, such as the minimum time it will take to deliver, and which tasks need to be completed before others can start. Plus, you can use them to identify the critical path – the sequence of tasks that must individually be completed on time if the whole project is to deliver on time.\nFinally, you can use them to keep your team and your sponsors informed of progress. Simply update the chart to show schedule changes and their implications, or use it to communicate that key tasks have been completed.\nCreating the Gantt Chart\nGantt charts show all the key stages of a project and their duration as a bar chart, with the time scale across the top. The key stages are placed on the bar chart in sequence, starting in the top left corner and ending in the bottom right corner (Figure 1). A Gantt chart can be drawn quickly and easily and is often the first tool a project manager uses to provide a rough estimate of the time that it will take to complete the key tasks.\nSometimes it is useful to start with the target deadline for the completion of the whole project because it is soon apparent if the time scale is too short or unnecessarily long. The detailed Gantt chart is usually constructed after the main objectives have been determined. Below is an example of a Gantt chart.\nGANTT CHART BASIC PROCEDURE\nThe basic procedure must be followed to build a Gantt chart.\n1). Identify the steps or activities needed to complete the project.\n2). Identify milestones within the project.\n3). Identify the expected time required to complete each task.\n4). Identify the sequence of tasks and the order of precedence of tasks.\n5). Draw a horizontal time axis on the bottom of a page.\n6). Select a proper time scale to represent the length of tasks.\n7). Prepare a column on the left side of the paper; write down each activity and milestone of the project in their corresponding order of occurrence.\n8). Activities or milestones that occur at a specific point in time represent them using a diamond under the time the activity must happen.\n9). Activities that occur over a determined period draw horizontal bars, or an empty rectangle starting from the first day the activity will take place and finishing the day the activity ends. Do not fill inside the rectangle.\n10). Each activity or task must be listed in the Gantt chart.\n11). Fill up the diamond or the rectangle as each activity is being performed.\n12). Use a weight or plumb as a vertical marker to illustrate the actual time and progress of the project.\nGantt Chart Considerations\nGantt charts are also modified with additional columns showing details such as the amount of time estimated to perform each task, how many resources are needed to complete each activity and/or the person responsible to execute the activity.\nSpecific meetings or reviewing processes are not recommended to be listed on a Gantt chart because they might occur over a long period. Gantt chart will transmit a clear idea to construction professionals about what must be done to complete a specific task and can promote a healthy scheduling process.\nYou can see an example in Figure 1, below:\nCOMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID WHEN USING A GANTT CHART.\nWhile Gantt charts can be extremely valuable tools for project management, there are certain typical flaws that can impair their usefulness. One error is forgetting to update the chart on a regular basis, which can result in erroneous information and missed deadlines.\nAnother common error is failing to include all essential activities and dependencies, which can lead to incomplete or unrealistic timelines. Overcomplicating the chart with too much detail might also make it difficult to read and understand.\nBy avoiding these typical blunders, you can ensure that your Gantt chart is a useful tool for project management.\nAlso read: How can we assess the needs of the community\nGantt Chart – Gantt Chart History, Gantt Chart Software, and Gantt Chart Information, Retrieved from http://www.ganttchart.com/index.html\nGantt Chart – Wikipedia, Retrieved from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart\nDoran, George T. “There’s a S.M.A.R.T. way to write management’s goals and objectives.” Management Review 70.11 (Nov. 1981): 35.

54	What role do electronic patterns play in superconductor development, and how are their production costs calculated in manufacturing accounting?	In superconductors, electronic liquid crystal patterns form 'stripes' in cuprate materials that are a few atoms thick and are disturbed by tornado-like vortices. These patterns may inhibit regular electricity flow while helping electrons work together. As for calculating their production costs, the Cost of Goods Manufactured (COGM) method is used, which includes direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. The work-in-progress inventory must be considered, with companies adding beginning work-in-process and deducting ending work-in-process from the total manufacturing cost to determine the cost of goods manufactured.	['Sometimes your worst enemy can become your best friend.\nThat idea provided motivation for the latest breakthrough from Binghamton University physicist Michael Lawler and his colleagues, who are searching for the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity.\n“Bad” metals, ones that have trouble carrying any electrical current, can become superconductors under the right conditions. “How is it that something that doesn’t conduct normal electricity well becomes such a great superconductor?” asked Lawler, a theorist. He hopes to answer that question, in part by studying materials called cuprates and examining their electronic structure.\nThe data he and his colleagues analyzed have been available for several years, but have not been well understood. Their findings, that liquid crystal phenomena appear active in cuprate materials, were published this week in the journal Science.\nSuperconductors are materials that conduct electricity without resistance below a certain temperature. For decades, it was thought that these materials could conduct electricity only at temperatures far below freezing. Since 1987, however, scientists have discovered several compounds that superconduct at much higher temperatures. Development of this technology could lead to dramatic advances in the delivery of electricity to homes and businesses as well as to improvements in cell phone towers and even high-speed trains.\nIn low-temperature superconductors, the vibration of the atoms is the mechanism of superconductivity. Put simply, Lawler says: “Electrons like to do things together.” Positively charged atoms and negatively charged electrons work together to produce the effect. In high-temperature superconductors, on the other hand, how the electrons begin to work together is not clear.\nLawler and his colleagues believe that the “pseudogap phenomenon,” the vanishing of the low-energy electronic excitations in high-temperature superconductors, is the key to understanding these materials. The team developed a theory related to electronic liquid crystal patterns in these materials and then put it to the test.\nWhat they found can be compared to the design of the American flag. Think of the stars; that’s a crystal pattern. Now think of the stripes; that’s the sort of pattern formed by atoms in “smectic” liquid crystals. It turns out that such “stripes” also arise in cuprate superconductors — keep in mind that each one is only a few atoms thick — but are frequently disturbed by tornado-like vortices. These disturbances take the form of an added or missing stripe in the pattern.\nWhen the physicists examined the sites of these disturbances using a scanning tunneling microscope, they found that there was a direct connection between the vortices and another pattern they discovered earlier. The earlier study revealed a broken symmetry in which electrons flow more easily in, say, the X-direction than the Y-direction.\n“In a problem that has gone unsolved for more than 20 years, it is remarkable to find a connection between theory and experiment at this level,” Lawler said. “It is possible that the patterns we focus on inhibit the regular flow of electricity but also help electrons act together to overcome this obstacle. In other words, this could be an enemy that becomes a friend.”\nLawler, who joined the Binghamton University faculty in 2008, collaborated on this paper with researchers at Cornell University, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Harvard University and institutions in the Netherlands, Japan and the United Kingdom.

Therefore, to compute the cost of goods manufactured, think about all product costs, including not only direct materials but also direct labor and overhead. The cost of goods manufactured (COGM) is a calculation that is used to gain a general understanding of whether production costs are too high or low when compared to revenue. The equation calculates the manufacturing costs incurred with the goods finished during a specific period. In other words, the total amount of expenses for a company to turn inventory into the finished product.\nThe costs of goods manufactured is an accounting term used to describe a statement or schedule that depicts the total costs of production for a company during a specific time period. The COGM is the total amount a company spends to produce goods, turn them into inventory and put them up for sale. This calculation takes into account all expenses related to the manufacturing of inventory including direct materials, factory overhead and labor expenses.\nThe value of an accurate COGS calculation can provide a company with insight into profitability, allow long term strategic planning, improve the pricing of products and act as a guideline for taxes and investment. Whether done manually or using software, the COGS calculation should be accurate and based on real data to provide these things. Start with the Beginning Raw Materials Inventory value and add all raw materials purchased during the selected accounting period.\nThe cost of goods manufactured is a calculation of the production costs of the goods that were completed during an accounting period. Manufacturing overhead is all costs tied to your organization’s manufacturing operations. These are the ancillary costs in addition to direct materials and labor, and they all must be listed under the cost of goods sold on a financial statement. Accountants within your company have to note the overhead cost for each unit created by your production team. Property taxes and insurance costs need to be factored in when you’re coming up with the total overhead cost per unit as well.\nCOGS may also be affected depending on the inventory costing method used by the company such as First in First Out (FIFO), Last in First Out (LIFO), or Average Cost Method. As companies have different levels of complexity and scale, each will have to choose the method that works best for their business.\nThe costs of goods manufactured may also be referred to as the cost of goods completed. The work in progress inventory is the next step in completing the cost of goods sold statement. After adding different materials to the production line, there are three additional production costs. These costs include direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing. All three costs are collectively called the “Manufacturing Costs.” The total inventory will be added to the Total Manufacturing costs and from this figure, the ending inventory will be deducted.\nCost of goods manufactured$1,100,000Note how the statement shows the costs incurred for direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. The statement totals these three costs for total manufacturing cost during the period. When adding beginning work in process inventory and deducting ending work in process inventory from the total manufacturing cost, we obtain cost of goods manufactured or completed. Cost of goods sold does not appear on the cost of goods manufactured statement but on the income statement. This formula will leave you with only the cost of goods that were completed during the period.\nRaw materials are inventory that is waiting to be used in the production of goods. To calculate the cost of goods manufactured, you must add your direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead to get your businesses’ total manufacturing cost. Next, you will add the beginning work-in-process and subtract the ending work-in-process from the total manufacturing cost to get the cost of goods manufactured. The last part of the calculation you need to make for the cost of goods manufactured formula is for the ending WIP inventory. This concept describes all inventory that shows signs of completion, but it stills needs to be confirmed if production can be finalized.\nThis statistic must be known so it can be reported after each accounting period. You might be able to see if your production is on schedule or if you have to make key decisions on production costs. Make sure to subtract this figure once you add up the previous figures to get your total cost of goods manufactured. The direct labor part of the total manufacturing calculation refers to how much was paid in labor costs for a certain time period. This is usually straightforward and can be calculated by multiplying the number of hours of work with the hourly rate for each employee.\n- Cost of goods manufactured$1,100,000Note how the statement shows the costs incurred for direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.\n- The statement totals these three costs for total manufacturing cost during the period.\nAgain, the total manufacturing cost is the aggregate of direct labor cost, direct material cost and factory overhead. Cost of goods manufactured is based on the amount of work-in-process completed. This work-in-process includes costs of direct materials put into production, plus direct labor and overhead. As a reminder, COGS is it’s the amount of money a company spends on labor, materials, and certain overhead costs relating to producing a product or service.\nThis inventory is the initial inventory that is placed right at the beginning of the cost of goods sold statement. It includes all the raw materials purchased for manufacturing a specific product. While making the cost of goods sold statement, make sure that all direct and overhead raw material costs are accounted for. After adding all raw materials, subtract the ending inventory from the raw material inventory account towards the end of one period. These materials await for transfer to the work in progress inventory, where the labor costs are included in the statement.\nWhat Does Cost of Goods Manufactured Mean?\nThe total manufacturing cost consists of the total cost of all goods the company has at least begun to sell during a given period. To this the owner must add work in process, or work in progress, which is the cost of goods that have begun production but are not yet ready to be sold. Using the beginning Work in Process (WIP) inventory, subtract the ending WIP inventory value and add to the Total Manufacturing Costs in step 2.This is the Cost of Goods Manufactured (COGM). Companies can also hold onto materials they receive from suppliers and list the value of them for accounting purposes.\nExample calculation of Cost of Goods Manufactured (COGM)\nBe sure you know the number of products you have waiting to be completed to document your inventory properly, and add them your manufacturing overhead, direct materials and direct labor costs. Unfortunately, it is not as simple as it seems, as each working part has multiple equations within. The schedule reports the total manufacturing costs for the period that were added to the work‐in‐process (WIP). It then adjusts these costs for the change in the WIP inventory account to arrive at the cost of goods manufactured.\nManufacturing overhead costs refer to indirect costs that are paid regardless of the production of inventory. For example, rent for a factory building and depreciation on equipment are considered manufacturing overhead costs. The cost of goods manufactured schedule is used to calculate the cost of producing products for a period of time. The cost of goods manufactured amount is transferred to the finished goods inventory account during the period and is used in calculating cost of goods sold on the income statement. Prepare a schedule of cost of goods manufactured; assume all raw materials used in production were direct materials.\nThe $500 of light bulbs purchased was included in the Raw Materials Inventory account, but since the bulbs are not direct materials, they were not recorded as part of the direct materials cost. Later, Friends Company used $100 of light bulbs in the manufacturing process, and this cost was recorded as part of the Factory Overhead cost. These platforms provide real-time data and advanced analytics that can help improve accurate costing in areas such as WIP calculation, manufacturing overhead, and direct labor.\nDetermining Direct Labor and Manufacturing Overhead\nThis is nothing but the cost sheet of the company and it includes prime cost as well. Hence adding all of the manufactured stage inventory and all the direct expenses will sum up to cost of good manufactured and when one divides the same by the number of units produced will yield the cost of goods manufactured. (Factory overhead will include factory expenses like rent and utilities). The total manufacturing portion of this formula refers to the direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead that was paid for during a certain period of time for the production of goods. The direct materials can be calculated by adding the beginning raw materials to the purchases made and subtracting that total from the ending raw materials.']	['<urn:uuid:c836d99c-4301-44e6-b9cf-41f3d185794e>', '<urn:uuid:15bfa14b-66f9-4fd2-bd65-ebeb7cc671d2>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	19	86	2065
55	ethnomusicologist research compare performance contexts spanish rondalla indonesian gamelan traditions	The rondalla traditionally performed serenades and was played by groups including the murza (who begged for alms), comparza (stage performers), and estudiantina (university musicians). In contrast, gamelan typically accompanies ceremonies, theater, dance, and puppet plays, particularly the wayang kulit shadow puppet theater which traditionally lasts all night during public holidays, religious festivals, and weddings.	"['The rondalla is an ensemble of stringed instruments played with the plectrum or pick and generally known as plectrum instruments. It originated in Medieval Spain, especially in Catalunya, Aragon, Murcia, and Valencia. The tradition was later taken to Spanish America and elsewhere. The word rondalla is from the Spanish ronda, meaning ""serenade.""\nThe rondalla has its origins in the folk playing bands from Spain (as well as \'New Spain\', namely Mexico) that were forerunners of the present-day rondalla and included four types: groups of young men who played and sang regularly in front of homes, bands of musicians known as murza or murga who begged for alms, a group of musicians known as comparza who played on stage, and groups of university musicians known as estudiantina, dubbed “tuna”. The usual musical instruments used by estudiantina members were mandolins, violins, guitars, flutes, cellos, basses, tambourines, castanets, and triangles. Estudiantina musicians in Spain and Mexico, before and during the age of musical romanticism, wore 16th century attire such as ""short velvet breeches, ornate shirts and a short cape with multicolored ribbons"".\nRondalla instruments in Spain\nSome instruments used for the early rondalla were influenced by the Mozarab musical instruments of the time, including the guitars, flutes and vihuelas. Mandolins, castanets and tambourines were also used and today a full range of instruments can be heard, such as the Mexican vihuela, violins and cellos, marimbas, xylophones, harps, and timbales.\nRondallas in Spain, Mexico and the United States\nToday, rondallas are more modern and expressive, using lyrics that are vibrant, yet still keep with the traditional theme of melancholy love and evening serenades. Currently, there are many groups in Spain (such as \'La Rondalla Sierra Almijara\' and \'La Rondalla de la Costera\'), and Mexico (such as \'La Rondalla de Saltillo\', \'La Rondalla Voces del Corazon\') and United States (\'La Rondalla del Sagrado Corazon\' de Richmond) that carry on the tradition\nDuring the Spanish period in the East Indies, the rondalla was brought to the Philippines by the Spaniards. In the early Philippines, certain styles were adopted by the natives, especially guitar and banduria used in the Pandanggo, the Jota, and the Polka. The use of the term comparza was common, however, during the American period in the Philippines, the term rondalla became more used. At present, rondalla, in the Philippines, refers to any group of stringed instruments that are played using the plectrum or pick. The Filipino instruments are made from indigenous Philippine wood and the plectrum, or picks, are made from tortoise-shell. Other stringed instruments composing the standard Filipino rondalla are the bandurria, the laúd, the octavina, the Twelve-string guitar, the Ukulele, the bajo de uñas or double bass, the Guitarrón mexicano, and other Filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar. The Philippine rondalla’s repertoire include folk songs such as the collar de sampaguita, la bella filipina, No te vayas a Zamboanga, Balitaw, the Kundiman, the ""Zarzuela"", the ""Subli"", the ""Harana"", the ""Tinikling"", and the ""Cariñosa"".\n- Coromines; Max Cahner (1980).

In a few weeks, there will be a performance organized by Gamelan Pacifica.\nWhat is a gamelan?\nAccording to Kathryn M. Duda’s article, “The Javanese Gamelan: Ancient Music with Contemporary Appeal,” gamelan is an Indonesian musical ensemble of “mainly percussive instruments, with occasional winds, strings, voices … and dancers.”\nThe key instruments include various kinds of gongs, metallophones, xylophones, and drums. The word gamelan is likely related to the Javanese word gamel, meaning “to handle.”\nThe gongs are of different sizes, as some are positioned vertically and some are suspended horizontally in wooden cases, resembling rows of pots. The Javanese names for many of the instruments mimic the sounds they produce.\nThere are typically 25 musicians in an ensemble, and the group has no conductor. The musicians depend on the drummer to control the tempo and to signal the end of a piece.\nA gamelan often accompanies “ceremonies, [theater], dance, and puppet plays.” In the United States, gamelan music is often performed in concerts.\nThe multi-layered gamelan music has a few basic elements: a core melody played by the metallophones, an elaboration of the core melody played by a combination of small kettle gongs, xylophones, rebabs, bamboo flutes, and zithers, and punctuations of the melody played by different gongs.\nThere are only a few written records that document the origins of gamelan. Many scholars believe that cultural influences from China, Southeast Asia, and India contributed to the development of gamelan music.\nLong before Islam was spread to Java in the 15th century, Hinduism and Buddhism were the predominant religions on the island. The traditional Javanese performing arts of gamelan, theater, and dance were rooted in the older Hindu-Buddhist culture and it prevailed long after Islam had become the island’s dominant religion.\nGamelan music has influenced musical development in the West. A couple of Debussy’s piano pieces, in the years after the 1889 Paris Exposition, were found to be influenced by gamelan sounds.\nGamelan music has since attracted a legion of admirers in the West, including such well-known composers as John Cage, Lou Harrison, Colin McPhee, Francis Poulenc, Benjamin Britten, and Béla Bartók.\nGamelan was introduced to the United States at the Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition in 1893.\nToday, gamelan music performance, along with other Javanese arts, is growing in the United States. There are gamelan ensembles in most states, and some were founded in colleges. Gamelan music CDs can easily be found in the world music section of CD stores or online.\nA gamelan ensemble is often featured in shadow drama, or wayang, a general term referring to different kinds of shadow drama in Indonesia. Wayang kulit, a type of play featuring flat leather shadow puppets, is one of the most popular forms of theater on Java.\nTraditionally, wayang kulit lasts all night, starting after the night falls and finishing at dawn. It is performed on public holidays, religious festivals, and weddings.\nThe puppeteer, or dalang, manipulates the leather puppets by means of tiny sticks that are attached to them behind the screen. The puppeteer also does the voice-overs, sings for the characters, and leads the gamelan accompaniment. Another popular form of puppet theater is wayang golek, featuring rod puppets carved from wood and dressed in cloth costumes.\nThe stories of wayang borrow characters from indigenous myths, Hindu epics, and Islamic stories. The performance techniques have been passed down orally from one generation to the next within the families of puppeteers and musicians.\nIn 2003, the wayang puppet theater of Indonesia was proclaimed a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). ♦\nOn Sept. 25, there will be a Gamelan Pacifica performance at the Chapel Performance Space at the Good Shepherd Center.

56	looking for plant milk with high protein what milk alternatives have most protein	Among plant-based milk alternatives, soy milk has the highest protein content with 7-8g per serving, similar to cow's milk (8g). Pea milk is another high-protein alternative. Hemp milk contains about 4g of protein per cup, and oat milk provides around 4g per serving. Other alternatives like almond milk, cashew milk, and rice milk are generally low in protein.	"['When embarking on a new eating lifestyle, many people are concerned with finding plant-based substitutions for their old favorite recipes. Whether it’s dairy, eggs, meat, or seafood, don’t fret – you have many fantastic options!\nBelow I’ve outlined all those and more. Consider this your comprehensive guide to plant-based alternatives to animal-based products, although if you find something missing, please let me know.\nAlso, remember that eating a plant-based diet means whole foods, for the most part. Therefore, you should only eat meat substitutions, usually higher in fat and salt, sparingly or only while you\'re making the transition.\nDairy-Free Milk Choices\nWith so many choices on the market today, milk is probably one of the easiest non-plant-based items to find suitable plant-based substitutes. Whichever type you choose as your plant-based milk substitute, you’ll want to stay clear of the sweetened versions to avoid unnecessary sugar intake.\nIf you want to try making your own plant milk, you can use a high-speed blender for nut milk and others. Here\'s my article on making nut milk. Or, try this smaller version from Nutr. I\'ve written a review of it and am offering a discount code if you\'re interested.\nWhile it mostly comes down to personal taste preference, from almond to soy, and everything in-between, here’s the lowdown on unsweetened, dairy-free milk:\n- Oat Milk is the new darling of the plant milk movement. Like most of the rest, it often has additives that aren\'t considered a whole food, so become a label reader and choose wisely. For flavor, the Oatly brand is quite pleasant, and you can purchase it without added sugar.\n- Almond milk is probably the most well-known non-dairy milk available. It’s a low-calorie option and is usually fortified with B12, which is a nice plus for plant-based eaters. However, if you’re looking for a milk alternative that provides some of your daily protein needs, you’ll want to keep looking as it only has 1 gram per 8-ounce serving. If you\'re ambitious, you can make your own almond milk which will not have any additives.\n- Coconut milk is another popular option, though it is even lower in protein than almond milk. It also is high in B12, with one 8-ounce serving giving you 50% of the USRDA. It contains several other vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D, magnesium, calcium, iron, and zinc.\n- Cashew milk is becoming more popular as it’s become more commercially available. Many people are fans of this milk alternative because of its flavor and thicker consistency, closer to that of dairy milk. Unless you’re making it yourself, it is similarly low in protein to almond milk. It also contains generous amounts of B12, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin E, and iron.\n- Soy milk is a long-standing favorite for many; this alternative is calorically similar to dairy milk, with about 80-130 calories per 8-ounce serving. Soy milk has the most protein of the non-dairy milk (7 grams per cup) and contains good amounts of B12, calcium, and vitamin D. magnesium, phosphorous, folate, and riboflavin.\n- Hemp milk is another nutrient-dense option. While it only has 2 grams of protein in an 8-ounce serving, it contains substantial amounts of calcium, vitamin D, riboflavin, B12, phosphorous, magnesium, iron, and zinc. It can be harder to find, and not everyone enjoys its earthier flavor.\n- Rice milk is a good option for those with nut and soy sensitivities. It, too, is low in protein (1 gram per cup) and is higher in calories than all of the other options mentioned here. Also, rice has arsenic, so you may want to stay away for that reason. If you are going to go with rice milk, make sure to get one fortified with calcium and other vitamins and minerals (though the levels will be lower than the others mentioned here). Learn more about arsenic in rice and how to mitigate it when working with rice. Organic has arsenic, too, by the way.\n- Pea Protein Milk from Ripple. These come in different varieties, from unsweetened to regular and vanilla flavored. This brand is fortified with calcium and has added fat. It\'s a good substitute for those wanting to stay away from nuts or soy.\n- Flax Milk also comes in unsweetened, regular, and vanilla. It\'s fortified with Vitamin D2 and B12 and naturally has calcium.\nTo replace buttermilk, add one tablespoon lemon juice or apple cider vinegar to 1 cup of non-dairy milk. Let stand for 10 minutes. The milk may curdle somewhat.\nThere are also a remarkable number of non-dairy cheeses available commercially. Some are delicious; some could easily be confused with plastic. Here are of few of the best plant-based cheese substitute options and why I think they’re worth giving a try.\n- Treeline is a brand of artisanal cheeses that are sure to please any cheese-lover seeking a plant-based cheese alternative. Made from cultured cashews, they’ve got both soft kinds of cheese and aged hard cheeses. If you can find this brand in your area and love cheese, this might be a good choice, although they are rather pricey, as are most vegan substitutions.\n- Follow Your Heart brand is a great go-to for a huge variety of plant-based vegan options, including cheeses. From blocks to slices to shreds, they’ve got you covered. Their shreds even MELT, which is pretty awesome if you’re familiar with cheese alternatives. Some of their products contain soy, and some don’t. If you’re looking for meltiness, make sure you get one that contains soy.\n- Kite Hill makes truly delicious spreadable cheeses. These go great on bread and crackers, making them great for any party where you need quick hors d\'oeuvres. They also offer a lovely soft-ripened ricotta cheese, as well as pre-made ravioli stuffed with their cheeses! You can find the Kite Hill brand in Whole Foods stores nationwide.\n- Go Veggie is another brand worth mentioning. Some of their products do have dairy so check carefully when you\'re looking. These are a wonderful choice if you’re a plant-based grilled cheese fan!\n- If you\'re adventurous and want to make your own, try the recipes from this new book by Julie Piatt, ""The Cheese is Nuts!"" From what I\'ve seen, the recipes look delicious.\nButter & Oils\nBelieve it or not, there are quite a few good choices to use to replace oil and butter. From broth to various foods, here are my top choices for a plant-based butter substitute. If you want to cook with less oil, you might like this article, ""Cooking without Oil.""\n- Vegetable broth: I use this to sauté vegetables. You can add a couple of tablespoons at a time, being careful not to drown your veggies. You want the veggies simmering nicely in just enough broth to keep wet but not fill up the entire pan you’re using. You can also use broth in baked-veggie recipes as a fat replacement – make sure to keep checking as they’re cooking in case you need to add more broth. In a pinch, water can be used in the same way.\n- Bananas: Bananas are a great replacement for cookies, quick bread, or things like pancakes, but be aware that your recipe will have a banana flavor! Start with half of the number of mashed bananas, as there is oil in the recipe, and if your batter is too dry, add more in, little by little. It might take some experimenting to get it right with this one.\n- Applesauce: If you don’t want all your baked goods to taste like bananas, applesauce is a good replacement option. It will work well for dense things, like cakes and muffins. You can do a 1-to-1 swap of applesauce for a plant-based butter alternative.\n- Prune puree: To make prune puree, put your pitted prunes in a food processor with a little bit of water until it’s smooth. Use 1 tbsp of water with every ounce of prunes that you use. Prunes work best in chocolate-flavored recipes like brownies because, in lighter-flavored things, you will taste the prunes. Use an amount of puree equal to the amount of fat that is called for in the recipe.\n- Nut butter: When baking, you can use a nut butter fat replacer. This works especially well in cookie, muffin, and bread recipes. While you’re still adding calories to the recipe, you’re also adding more protein, minerals, and fiber than you would be if you were using oil. Swap it out of the recipe cup-for-cup. You’ll want to use a creamy variety of whatever nut butter you choose. Expect a dense end-product.\nThere are a lot of simple ways you can replace eggs when baking, a lot of which you probably already have the ingredients necessary. The following are ways to replace one egg:\n- Mix 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed with 2 ½ tablespoons of water and let it sit 10 minutes before using.\n- Mix 1 tablespoon chia seed with 3 tablespoons water and let sit for 15 minutes before using\n- Use ¼ cup applesauce\n- Use ½ of a mashed banana\n- Use ¼ cup of silken tofu\n- Mix 3 tablespoons of chickpea flour with 3 tablespoons of water\n- Mix 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with 3 tablespoons of water\n- Mix 1 tablespoon soy protein powder with 3 tablespoons of water\n- Mix 2 tablespoons arrowroot powder with 3 tablespoons of water\n- 3 Tablespoons unwhipped aquafaba (juice from a can of chickpeas)\n- Two tablespoons for egg yolks\n- One tablespoon for egg whites.\nThere\'s also this egg replacement from the Follow Your Heart brand. Not only can you use it in baking, but you can also make plant-based omelets and scrambled eggs with this plant-based substitute for eggs!\nTry this homemade version and keep it on hand for making delicious tempeh salad or crunchy Waldorf salad. It\'s made with tofu and is your healthiest option. Otherwise, there are vegan versions in your market, like Vegenaise\nDid you know that honey is not actually vegan? It\'s up to you whether you want to eat it or not. While there are other ways to substitute for honey, a whole food version is maple syrup. You can also find vegan honey but it may take a litter hunting. Try a Google search for ""vegan honey.""\nGelatin presents a challenge for anyone looking to stick to a plant-based diet since it’s an animal product. Here are a couple of options for you:\n- Agar powder: Though this will give you a texture that is less “jiggly” than gelatin, it’s a nice replacement for things like firm plant-based jellies. You can replace this 1-to-1 for gelatin powder. It\'s sometimes called Agar Agar.\n- Pectin is in the cell walls of many fruits. It forms a thick gel-like substance when it\'s heated and mixed with sugars and acids. It’s a popular, common ingredient in store-bought jellies and jams.\nThere are new vegan fish substitutions and others coming to market, but as with all of these substitutions, they often contain high amounts of fat and salt. Try these 5 Delish Ways to Enjoy Seafood Flavor without Eating Any Fish from One Green Planet! Also, try my plant-based fish substitute recipe, Sheet Pan Fish & Chips.\nSome whole foods meat substitutes or replacements are less processed and more whole food than others, so choose wisely. If you\'re starting to eat less meat, some of the more processed meat replacements might help you through but aim for healthier versions, ultimately.\n- Tofu: There are so many ways to use tofu! So many, in fact, that I have an entire article dedicated to it. For all the ways you can use tofu as a meat replacement, check out my article here.\n- Tempeh: Made from fermented soybeans, tempeh is another excellent meat substitute. I’ve got another full-length article on the topic that will help explain how you can use it in your plant-based recipes.\n- Seitan: Another meatless alternative I’ve talked about before is seitan. You can make it yourself or use store-bought. For more on how to use seitan in your recipes, read my article here.\n- Beans: Any variety of beans, either ground or mashed, can be a great filling for things like burritos and sandwiches. You won’t get the same texture as meat, but you will get a filling, nutritious meal. And as most plant-based eaters know, a black-bean burger is a truly wonderful thing!\nAside from quick swaps you can make as plant-based substitutions, there are many products on the market that are made specifically for plant-based eaters who miss eating meat. Here are a few of the best brands out there today. But, again, be careful with these as they often have more fat and additives. I\'ve listed a couple here, but you can find the complete list at Peta.org.\n- Beyond Meat is a relatively new company that touts itself as the “future of protein. Their plant-based burger patties look and cook like fresh-ground beef, and have passed the taste tests of vegetarians and meat-eaters alike!\n- Yves Veggie Cuisine has been around for quite a while, offering anything from falafel balls to Bologna to ground-meat replacement. If you’re looking for easy-to-prepare options, check out what Yves offers.\n- Gardein not only has beef and poultry alternatives but fish replacements as well. They’ve got some mini “crab cakes” that look amazing!

Let me know if you find anything missing and I’ll add it to the list.\nThanks for giving more options and tips.\nThank you Diane for making my life easier by sharing your expertise in plant based diet. I’m going to start the diet with you in my mind. It will be hard for the first time but I’ll give it a try. God bless you.\nThanks and wishing you the best of luck! Let me know if there’s something more that would help.\nHi, Thank you for sharing useful information. I am living in India and new to plant-based diet. I am looking for a substitute for ghee (clarified butter) which is widely used in many Indian dishes. Could you please help with this?\nHi, I’m afraid I don’t have a substitute for ghee as we use very little oil for plant-based meals. I have seen people suggest substituting with a vegetable oil, maybe a good olive oil. I’m not sure if that would work for you. I hope that helps and good luck with the new diet. ????\nCan you provide a recommendation for a substitution of a plant based replacement for PAM or other non-stick spray? The issue I run into is if I try to make pancakes or waffles they will stick even to teflon or other non-stick material.\nHey Adam, Pancakes, and waffles do tend to stick even with non-stick pans. Maybe some of the newer types would work better, I’m not sure. I really don’t have a perfect solution for you. I think a little non-stick spray would be ok if used infrequently. I believe you’re not supposed to use it on non-stick pans, though. I’ve seen the plant-based brain docs, wife and husband neurologists Drs. Ayesha & Dean Sherza, use non-stick spray on their recipes. Scroll through their Instagram or YouTube channel to see some of their delicious recipes. Usinging a little spray would depend on how strict you’d like to be.', 'Cow’s Milk or Plant-Based Alternatives: What’s the Difference and Which One Should You Choose?\nSome of the controversy surrounding cow’s milk is due to a perception that growth hormones and antibiotics were given to the cows and are thus present in the milk. However, in Canada dairy cows are not given growth hormones and choosing organic guarantees they also haven’t received any antibiotics.\nUnless you are lactose-intolerant (lactose is the natural sugar present in milk, which by the way the total amount of sugar that is listed on a milk label are entirely from this natural sugar, no sugar is added!) or have an allergy to bovine protein, cow’s milk offers many healthy nutrients. It is a rich natural source of protein, calcium, riboflavin (vitamin B2, an essential water-soluble vitamin that is not stored in the body and thus needs to be taken through food, milk and dairy products being good sources) and potassium. Although, some plant-based alternatives may offer an interesting nutrient profile, none comes close to that of cow’s milk for these nutrients. Furthermore, all the vitamins and minerals in plant-based milks are added to them.\nCow’s milk contains 8 g of high quality protein per one cup serving, which is more than the amount of protein found in one egg (6 g/large egg). No other plant-based alternative, except for soy milk (6-8 g/serving) comes close to this amount. The quality of plant protein is generally not as high as animal protein which contains a better balance of all the amino acids. Furthermore, the combination of casein and whey protein it contains is highly effective for muscle damage repair.\nIt is a rich natural source of highly absorbable calcium (about 300 mg per serving), a mineral essential for healthy bones and teeth and that is considered beneficial for bone development in children. It is also fortified with vitamin D, which together with calcium benefits bone health and helps prevent osteoporosis.\nIt is a potassium-rich food (about 400 mg per serving) which can benefit heart health by reducing blood pressure and increasing vasodilation. Potassium levels also increase with the lower fat content of milk.\nBeing a food that comes from animals, milk does contain saturated fats and cholesterol. The higher the percent milk fat you choose, the higher the amount of these two fats will be. If you are concerned about your heart health, choosing a lower fat milk (1%) or non-fat milk will not only considerably decrease your intake for both these fats, while giving you more potassium!\nSoy milk is definitely a winner when it comes to having the best protein content (7-8 g per serving) of all the plant-based milks and when fortified with calcium and other vitamins and minerals, it is the one that most closely resembles the nutrition profile of cow’s milk. Soy milk also contains plant-based omega 3 fatty acids and it is also one of the few plant-based alternatives that has a creamy and slightly thicker texture, which many enjoy and look for. Furthermore, soy milk contains isoflavones, a plant compound that research has linked to a decrease in the growth of cancer cells and the risk of early death in breast cancer patients, and studies have found it has no bad effects on women with estrogen fueled breast cancer. (add links to studies)\nDue to soy crops often being genetically modified or doused in the nasty pesticide Roundup, make sure you go organic to avoid both these issues. For those allergic to soy protein and wanting a plant-based alternative to cow’s milk with a comparable protein content, a new arrival on the market, pea milk (https://www.ripplefoods.com/plant-milk/) may be an interesting contender.\nThe main ingredients here are almonds and water. Almonds are a good source of healthy fats and minerals such as calcium and iron. It is also a popular choice because it is the plant-based alternative that is the least caloric. Unfortunately, almond milk contains fewer nutrients than the actual nuts themselves. Due to the fact that the amount of almonds used to produce each carton of almond milk is not much (for most brands the almond percentage is only 2-3%) it contains very little protein and most of the vitamins and minerals listed on the package are added to the beverage. Being fortified is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is like when we take supplements, it helps meet our needs, but is not as good as when we get our nutrients from a whole food instead.\nCashew milk has a slightly nutty flavor and a creamier texture than the other nut beverages. For those of you who prefer a creamier texture, especially for your cup of coffee, this nut milk, along with soy milk, would be what I recommend. Cashew milk and other nut milks (we now can even find macadamia milks) are essentially similar to almond milk in many ways. Essentially, their protein content is low, most of their vitamins and minerals are added to the beverage and not naturally present, and they often contain many additives and preservatives, consequently they fall short as a good replacement for cow’s milk. If you choose to make your own nut milk at home, this would be the easiest one to make, as the nut is buttery soft and once thoroughly ground and blended it doesn’t need to be strained through a cheesecloth or nut milk bag!\nHemp milk can contain as much as 4 g of protein per cup (this amount may vary depending on the brand), making it an interesting alternative when you compare it to most plant-based milks which barely contain any protein. It also contains healthy plant-based omega 3 fatty acids, but the funky, strong grassy taste isn’t always a crowd pleaser. Like all other plant-based milks, it may also contain carrageenan and other less interesting additives, and all the vitamins and minerals are added via fortification.\nThis is a less interesting option. The flavor and texture may be appreciated, but nutrition wise, this beverage gives you much more carbohydrates and sugars per serving than any other plant-based version, and is also very low in protein. It also is the one that may have the blandest flavor. Yet it is the least allergenic one, so for those with allergies, they may consider it a good option, although because rice is a leading dietary source of inorganic arsenic (which has been associated with higher risks of skin, bladder and lung cancers, as well as heart disease), it would not be a plant-based alternative that I would recommend. Overall, rice milk really doesn’t have much going for itself!\nIn the grain category, I would say this one is my favorite. Oat milk is the one with the most protein than other grains and most plant-based alternatives, providing about 4 g per cup. It also has an interesting creamy texture and milky flavor, so if you can’t have milk and miss it’s taste, this may be the option for you! Actually, for those of you who like me enjoy the taste your cow’s milk has at the end of your cereal bowl, you’ll love the taste of this plant-based alternative.\nWe’ve all heard or read about the virtues of coconut oil, butter, milk and now even yogurt. The type of fat in coconut milk may have some benefits; it’s also rich in important B vitamins and minerals such as calcium and iron. Unfortunately, it is like most plant-based alternatives, very low in protein and you need to read the ingredient lists to make sure there aren’t too many undesired ingredients added. Also, if you don’t like the taste of coconut to begin with, this is definitely not the right choice for you. Coconut milk blends or hybrids also exist in almond-coconut flavor, making the taste smoother and not so intense! So if you are debating between the two, this could be a good choice!\nIf you choose the canned variety, the most important thing to watch out for is that the can is BPA-free. Also the canned varieties are not fortified with vitamins and minerals like the carton varieties, and are a very concentrated and not watered-down like the carton variety; consequently they contain a lot more fat and calories. Being aware of the size of your portion becomes important in this case!\nUnless you suffer from lactose intolerance (you can always choose a lactose-free cow’s milk) or from an allergy to cow’s milk, or have chosen to follow a diet that excludes animal products, I would strongly recommend you don’t replace your entire cow’s milk intake with plant-based milks. There is nothing wrong with adding variety to your diet, in fact I strongly urge you to have a diet that contains a variety of different foods and ingredients in order to get the most nutrients into your daily diet, but try to keep at least 1 serving daily of a good quality cow’s milk and not the low or fat-free kind. If you are otherwise healthy, I recommend and also consume 2% milk, especially if I am only taking 1 serving a day. When the fat is taken out of the milk, its fat, protein and carbohydrate profile changes. In fact, the less fat there is in cow’s milk, the higher the carbohydrate (sugar i.e. lactose) content, this disrupts different systems in our bodies and leads to hormonal imbalances, weight management issues (studies have shown that children who drank skim or 1% milk gained more weight than those who drank 2% milk and that fattier milk is linked to a lower risk of weight gain in adult women!), increased acne (especially skim milk seems to have the strongest effect), etc. Once again, real, whole foods win!\nFinally, if you choose to forgo milk and prefer the plant-based alternatives, nutrition-wise soy milk is the one that comes out on top and has been declared the winner by various scientific reviews. Whichever way you choose to go, make sure to read the labels and ingredient lists carefully. You want to make sure you opt for an organic product and that it doesn’t contain too many added ingredients such as carrageenan, an additive derived from seaweed that is used as a thickener and stabilizer, but has been linked to causing inflammatory gastrointestinal issues in some people.\nYou should also always choose a plant-based milk that is fortified in vitamins and minerals (our calcium and vitamin D needs are high and there are not many food sources that are rich in these nutrients, so choosing an enriched/fortified plant beverage is important) and that is plain and unsweetened! Some chocolate flavored versions may have as much sugar as an equal serving of Coca Cola! If you don’t like unflavored varieties, at most try an unsweetened vanilla. Finally, due to the vitamins and minerals being added and naturally present in these alternatives, make sure to give your carton a quick shake prior to serving yourself in order to ensure you cup provides you all the added nutrients!\nOr why not give making your own plant-based milk at home a try? All you need is a high powered blender, good quality, organic nuts or seeds or grains and water, as well as cheesecloth or ideally a nut milk bag. You can even flavor you homemade beverage with good quality ingredients you choose yourself, like maple syrup, raw honey, vanilla, plus it won’t have all the extra additives and ingredients you’ll find in the store bought versions. Finally, it may even save you a few dollars!']"	['<urn:uuid:bb2f63d8-82c8-47db-aae9-f4ffd5cf86a3>', '<urn:uuid:51221c13-7588-4f26-bca3-d8b10f6405b7>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	13	58	4703
57	compare lifecycle stages development time fruit fly bee colonies different	Fruit flies show rapid generational turnover, with each generation spanning less than a dozen days, allowing for quick population expansion that can reach up to 100,000 flies in a single enclosed space. In contrast, honey bees have a more complex lifecycle with distinct stages: eggs hatch after 3 days, followed by a larval stage where feeding differs by caste (queens continue royal jelly diet while workers and drones receive different food), and finally a pupal stage. The total development time varies by caste: 16 days for queens, 21 days for workers, and 24 days for drones.	['When we think of evolution, we often think of slow, gradual changes made over millions of years. However, new research suggests that the process could be happening quite quickly, driving major changes over the course of a single year in response to seasonal changes.\nThe paper describing that research was released last week and studies evolution in fruit flies over around 10 generations, with each generation of flies spanning less than a dozen days. While fruit flies are notoriously short-lived, and the distance between their generations is tiny, evolution could be happening quicker than previously anticipated even in longer-lived organisms. That’s according to Seth Rudman, assistant professor in the school of biological sciences at Washington State University and one of the authors of the paper.\n“Over the last few decades, there has been a growing appreciation that evolution can occur fairly rapidly,” he told Ars.\nI just wanna fly\nFor the new study, the research team released 1,000 fruit flies into 10 outdoor enclosures. The enclosures were finely netted, and each had its own small tree to help recreate a habitat similar to the wild. Over the course of four months, the researchers let the flies hang out in the enclosures, and each group of flies was fed the same diet. The set of enclosures “allows you to track multiple populations that are all evolving in response to the same abiotic and, largely also, biotic factors over time.”\nThroughout the course of the experiment, there were roughly 10 generations of the flies, and the populations expanded rapidly. At its peak, the experiment saw a maximum of 100,000 flies in a single enclosure.\nThe team periodically checked on the flies to get a sense of how the insects’ genes and traits were changing. The researchers identified various characteristics, such as reproductive success and heat or cold resistance. To ensure that these altered characteristics were due to genetic changes, the researchers removed 2,500 eggs from each enclosure and raised the new populations separately for three generations before testing to ensure the changes persisted.\nAt each check-in, the team also randomly selected 100 flies from each enclosure and sequenced their entire genomes. Since the DNA of all 100 flies was mixed before sequencing, this gave a picture of the average fly’s base changes. But it may have missed some less common differences.\nLive fast, die young\nOver the four months, the researchers saw changes in the frequency of some variants across 60 percent of the flies’ genomes. That’s a particularly large change that Rudman called a “staggering number.” Only a small fraction of this represents variants that were selected for by the changing conditions as summer shifted to fall, however. As those variants were selected for, they pulled along nearby areas of the chromosome, altering the frequency of neighboring variants as well.\nThe researchers could tell the changes were adaptive rather than just genetic drift. They could tell because the changes appeared in the populations of most enclosures rather than just one or two.\nAccording to Rudman, the speed of all these changes was unexpected and showed that the flies had evolved and adapted to their environment faster than anyone had previously measured—along the timeline of ecological changes in the enclosures.\nRudman noted that, though the fruit flies have short lives and breed quickly, evolution and adaptation might happen across generations faster than originally thought in other species as well. However, he added that evolution is much harder to study in creatures that live more than a few days. But, “Evolution can occur really, really rapidly,” Rudman said.', 'How Long Do Bees Live?\nThe bee life cycle differs between the castes; - Worker bees live between 6 weeks and 6 months. - Drone bees live between 30 and 60 days. - The queen bee live between 3 and 6 years.\nThe bee life cycle is relatively short when compared to our own. But their lives are purposeful and productive as they pollinate plants and prepare the hive for the future. Within every colony, bees operate in three castes: queen, worker, and drone bees, each with different roles.\nIn a colony of bees, 99% are female worker bees who undertake the pollination; the remainder includes one queen who lays eggs to populate the colony and supply the labor force and a few hundred male drones who have the sole function of servicing the queen to fertilize eggs.\nOutside factors that influence the bee life cycle are habitat, climate, parasites, pesticides, and predators. Still, a colony of bees can exist for years, even though the roster of residents will change frequently.\nGenerally, a honey bee colony has a longer average lifespan than a bumblebee colony. If the hive becomes too crowded, a new queen may take a swarm of bees to a new location to form a new colony.\nStages Of The Honeybees Life\nEven though any bee’s life varies by caste, the four key stages are of the honey bee life cycle are:\nThe queen will lay each egg in a single cell in the honeycomb, which will hatch after about three days to become part of a brood of baby bees.\nIn hobby hives and commercial beekeeping operations, the queen’s honeycomb is located in the brood box, a separate chamber for the queen to live, eat, and lay eggs.\nIn most brood cells, the queen bee lays fertilized eggs that will become worker bees, deposits unfertilized eggs in fewer larger cells to develop into drones, and in special queen cells, lays fertilized eggs to become the succeeding queen bees. There is little difference between castes before the eggs hatch to become larvae.\nWhy do the eggs come from the queen when the hive consists of female worker bees? Female bees usually develop no ovaries due to chemicals known as brood recognition pheromones.\nHowever, in some colonies, a small percentage (1%) of females develop ovaries that allow them to lay unfertilized eggs. When these bees, known as “laying worker bees,” produce eggs, they may deposit multiple eggs in a single honeycomb cell.\nWhile the queen, who has a longer body, lays one egg at the bottom of a cell, the laying bees have shorter abdomens that cannot reach the cell bottom so that they may deposit eggs on the side of the cell or off-center. Before these eggs hatch, other worker bees may remove them.\nLaying worker bees only lay a few eggs in colonies with a functioning queen.\nIn three days, each egg hatches into a larva which appears like a small white grub that is blind and legless. Young worker nurse bees provide nutrition to the tiny larvae with jelly made in glands in the head and the salivary glands in the mouth.\nAt first, the entire brood feasts on royal jelly, the food of queens that contains water, protein, vitamins, fats (lipids), sugar, and some mineral salts.\nThe queen larvae continue to dine on royal jelly until they become queen bees, but after a few days, the food changes to meet the particular needs of workers and drones.\nWorker bee jelly, for example, is a blend of honey and pollen (bee bread) that contains less protein and more carbohydrates.\nBy the time the larvae are five days old, they are 1,500 times their size at birth and have shed their skin several times. Nurse bees cap the cells with wax, and the larva spins a cocoon around itself as it enters the pupal stage.\nThe queen bees have a shorter larval period, while drones have the longest.\nDuring the pupa stage, the larva begins to look like an adult bee as its legs, eyes, and wings develop and hairs cover its body.\nDepending on the type of bee, the now-adult bee chews its way out of the cell within seven to 14 days to pursue its work as an adult bee. This stage is shorter for the queen, longer for the worker bees, and longest for the drones.\nThe journey from egg to adult takes 16 days for the queen, 21 days for workers, and 24 days for drones.\nOnce they are born, both their jobs and their lifespan are defined.\nHow Long Do Queen Honey Bees Live?\nQueen bees will often live for over a year, often up to five years, depending on their ability to produce a sustainable colony.\nThe primary duty of the queen is to lay eggs and build a strong workforce. The queen bee lays fertilized eggs that develop into female worker bees and unfertilized eggs that grow to become male bees or drones. There is only one queen in the entire colony.\nThe queen, well-nourished by royal jelly, takes the shortest time to mature from the larva stage -specifically, five days from larva to pupa and then eight days to develop into an adult. When the virgin queen emerges, she is not fertile and requires around seven days to be ready for mating.\nA queen lives longer than the other castes because she functions inside the hive, which preserves her body parts from wearing out quickly, like her wings and other parts. She can survive for two or more, even up to five years.\nThe queen’s pheromone production and egg-laying ability decline with aging. Once the worker bees note a weakening queen, they nurture a new queen and eliminate the old queen using a process called Queen Balling.\nBeekeepers keep track of the queen’s age by painting a small dot on her thorax and may replace the old queen yearly or after two years. Purchasing a new queen bee can cost as little as $25, but as much as $200.\nHow Long Do Worker Bees Live?\nWorker bees range in tens of thousands in a hive and do most of the work, including defending the beehive.\nThey take longer to transform in the larva and pupa stages than the queens, and after maturing, they spend their first weeks working in the hive before working outside collecting nectar and pollen. They will sting when they sense invasion.\nWorker bees existing during spring or summer have the most work to do, which wears them out quickly. They build the honeycomb, feed larvae, store nectar, produce honey, and forage for food. These worker bees live for a short period, usually forty to sixty days.\nThe worker bees that emerge during the autumn time of year survive for a more extended period because of reduced work. The queen quits laying eggs; therefore, there is no brood to support.\nThe workers clump around the queen to be warm throughout the winter period. Such bees can live up to six months. When spring comes, any survivors once again forage for pollen.\nHow Long Do Drone Bees Live?\nMale drones take the longest to become adults. Their role is purely for reproduction purposes as they do not work apart from looking for virgin queens to mate. Mating happens away from the hive to reduce the chances of mating with their mother queen.\nDrones die shortly after a successful mating flight because the mating rips off their reproductive organs. Their life span ranges from 38 days until they mate.\nIf the mating flight is unsuccessful and the fall season approaches, worker bees drive out drones from the hive to prevent feeding them over the winter months. Ultimately, they do not survive the coming low temperatures and hunger.\nHoney Bee Diseases\nAside from pesticides and weather, bee colonies are subject to diseases, especially during their development phase. While the condition can affect any beehive, beekeepers are particularly attentive to diseases and parasites that affect the honey bee colonies, especially the members in the larva stage.\nAs the bee brood progresses from egg to pupae, beekeepers should regularly monitor beehives to safeguard their health and ensure a perennial honeybee (Apis mellifera) lifecycle.\nHere are a few diseases that affect the lifespan of honeybees and concern beekeepers:\nSacbrood is a bee virus affecting honeybee species globally that often appears in early spring colonies having a poor brood arrangement. The virus spreads from infected nurse bees to bee larva during feeding.\nThe infected larva fails to pupate and dies in the capped brood cells. The larva dies gradually by changing color from grey to dark brown for uncapped cells.\nAdult bees remove the dead larva to prevent the spread of the disease. These bees do not show symptoms of the virus, but high infection rates may reduce their lifespans and weaken the colony.\n2. American Foulbrood (AFB)\nAFB caused by the bacteria Paenibacillus larvae is the most severe and fatal bacterial infection in an apiary. It is resilient to harsh weather and can persevere in used honeycombs and wood stuff for years. Beekeepers should avoid previously owned beekeeping kits.\nNurse bees spread the bacteria by contaminating the larval food. After capping the brood cells, the larva dies. The infection weakens an apiary, and stronger colonies rob weaker ones, spreading the disease quickly to other beehives. High infection rates can kill the whole apiary.\nAFB symptoms include;\n- Brood capped cells have sunken and hollow capping\n- Spotty brood pattern instead of being uniform\n- The larva continuously darkens and sticks to the bottom of the cells, making it hard for adult bees to remove them.\n- Unfriendly smell\nYou can confirm AFB by conducting a “ropiness” test, and since there is no cure for the disease, you need to destroy the infected hives by burning them on site.\n3. European Foulbrood (EFB)\nBacteria Melissococcus Plutonius causes EFB. Though the disease is not lethal as AFB, it is highly infectious. Only young larva are susceptible to EFB after nurse bees fortuitously transfer the bacteria to the brood food.\nThe bacteria kills the larva before capping; beekeepers can detect early infections by inspecting the brood nest.\nBeehives may appear healthy when the bacteria are dormant and visible when the colony is straining to keep up with the infection.\nSymptoms of the disease are:\n- Discolored larvae which are not white but yellowish, brownish, or grayish\n- Malformed larvae that are twisted, curled, or melted\n- In a highly infected brood, a spotty pattern with an acidic smell\nA colony infected with a mild EFB can recover from the disease, so the hive’s destruction is not required as with AFB.']	['<urn:uuid:e966feee-b0de-4987-b1f3-fb66f8b3fa4f>', '<urn:uuid:2cb7651c-67de-4419-bba4-40dcaa0f1467>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	10	96	2380
58	What are the common reasons people get injured during flight turbulence, and what methods does the fear of flying course offer to help nervous passengers cope with it?	People primarily get injured during turbulence because they aren't properly buckled into their seats, including flight attendants walking in the aisles and unrestrained passengers who try to avoid using seatbelts. The fear of flying course addresses this issue by helping passengers understand aircraft safety systems and offering several coping strategies. These include becoming knowledgeable about how aircraft handle turbulence, separating fear from actual danger, and understanding that anxiety often tricks common sense into perceiving danger when the situation is actually safe. The course provides hands-on experience in a flight simulator with qualified pilots who explain all flight stages and aircraft noises, helping passengers understand that they are safe even when experiencing intense anxiety.	"['Frequent fliers know the routine: seat up, bags stowed, phones in airplane mode, keep your seat belts fastened at all times as we can never predict rough air. When flight attendants go over their safety speech at the beginning of a flight, they\'re not doing it because they have to. The information is presented to help keep you safe. Rough air — polite airline-speak for turbulence — really can be unpredictable and dangerous if you\'re not strapped in when it happens.\nTurbulence is caused by an aircraft flying through unstable air. Planes experience turbulence when they encounter an area with winds changing direction or speed (like a jet stream or air flowing over the peaks of mountains), or when they encounter swiftly rising air like one would find in a thunderstorm or fair-weather cumulus clouds on a hot summer day. As veteran airline pilot Patrick Smith notes on his ""Ask a Pilot"" website, turbulence is more of an inconvenience than a threat to the structural integrity of the aircraft.\nThe danger to the passengers in the cabin, however, is very real.\nLast Friday, Yahoo News published an article declaring that turbulence-related injuries are on the rise and consulted with climate change experts to speculate as to what\'s causing all of this lap-baby-flinging turbulence.\nIn the last month, three major incidents of turbulence-related injuries made international news. A flight attendant for United Airlines was taken to the hospital in critical condition after she cracked the ceiling with her head during extreme turbulence. Eight people were hospitalized after a transpacific Cathay Pacific flight hit major turbulence. A flight attendant on a regional flight in Australia broke her leg during another bout of turbulence.\nThe Yahoo News article cites numerous reasons why experts believe turbulence itself seems to be an increasing phenomenon, but aside from mentioning unrestrained lap babies becoming projectiles, the article largely ignores the big question: ""why are people getting hurt?""\nThe answer to the question has nothing to do with climate change or flight paths or any of that fake intellectual reporting that Yahoo is trying to pull. The reason people are getting hurt during extreme turbulence is because they aren\'t buckled into their seats. It\'s that simple.\nThe next time you get on an airplane, listen for the ""clicks"" around you. For every person who buckles up, another one or two likely won\'t. Just as people found stealthy ways to hide iPod use from flight attendants before the electronics ban was dropped last year, people will find every way possible to fake buckling their seat belts without actually doing it.\nThe reason turbulence-related injuries are on the rise is because people aren\'t strapped into their seats to keep from flying around like popcorn when rough air occurs. Every one of the incidents Yahoo News cited referred to injuries inflicted on people who weren\'t wearing their seat belts — including lap babies and flight attendants walking around in the aisles.\nSometimes unpredictable rough air will cause injuries. That\'s a given when people are moving around the cabin. But the ""growing problem"" can be eliminated using the only two words that matter, and the ones they didn\'t mention until the very end of the article: buckle up.\n[Photo via United Airlines]', 'FEAR OF FLYING Course\nFEAR OF FLYING COURSE\nAviation Insiders Fear of Flying Programme is specifically tailored to help anyone overcome their phobia of travelling in an aircraft. We offer these sessions to anyone who wants to face their fears and gain a greater understanding of how an aircraft is controlled by seeing first hand all the safety measures and systems that pilots have to keep their passengers safe. We will go through in detail, every stage of flight and will start with a briefing before the session on the basics of the aircraft and other important information. You will have the opportunity to ask as many questions as you want before our fully qualified pilot instructor will then take you to the simulator of the aircraft you have chosen, to go through a session that will be built around your personal specifications.\n8 PROVEN WAYS TO HELP YOUR INFLIGHT EXPERIENCE:\nLATCH ON TO TRIGGERS THAT SET YOU OFF\nFigure out what frightens you and examine how your anxiety reaction is triggered. Your goal is to identify your particular triggers, so you can manage your fear when anxiety levels are low. Learning what sets you off makes it easier to turn it off.02\nSTEP ONTO THE AIRPLANE WITH KNOWLEDGE\nAnxiety thrives on ignorance and feeds off “what if?” catastrophic thoughts. But once you become knowledgeable, your “what if?” thoughts are limited by the facts. Become familiar with the facts. They will not eliminate your anxiety, but they will help you manage it.03\nANTICIPATE YOUR ANXIETY\nAnticipatory anxiety is what we experience in anticipation of a fear. It is often the most intense anxiety you will experience during your flight, but it is not an accurate predictor of how you will feel on the flight. It is frequently far greater than what you actually experience.04\nSEPARATE FEAR FROM DANGER\nIt is often difficult to separate anxiety from danger because your body reacts in exactly the same way to both. Be sure to label your fear as anxiety. Tell yourself that anxiety makes your frightening thoughts feel more likely to occur, and remind yourself that feeling anxious doesn’t mean you are in danger. You are safe even when feeling intense anxiety.05\nRECOGNISE THAT COMMON SENSE MAKES NO SENSE\nPart A: Anxiety tricks common sense.\nAnxiety will trick you into thinking you are in danger when you are perfectly safe. Your gut feelings in these instances will always tell you to avoid, but if you follow these feelings, you will always be reinforcing your anxiety.\nPart B: You can outsmart anxiety.\nAs a rule, do the opposite of what anxious feelings are telling you to do. Fight what the anxiety is telling you to do, but embrace the discomfort that anxiety brings.06\nSMOOTH OVER THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN THE FLIGHT\nTo manage anxiety when turbulence hits, learn about airplanes and how they are designed to handle turbulence. Focus on managing your anxiety, rather than when the turbulence will end or how severe it might get. Remind yourself that you are safe.07\nEDUCATE FELLOW FLIERS ON HOW TO HELP YOU\nOther fliers need to know what frightens you, along with what helps you most to cope with anxiety during a flight. Your task is to be clear about your triggers and ask specifically for what you find most useful.08\nVALUE EACH FLIGHT\nExposure is the active ingredient in overcoming your phobia. Every flight provides you with the opportunity to make the next one easier. Your goal is to retrain your brain to become less sensitized to the triggers that set you off.\nTRY OUR EXPERIENCES\nCome and take the controls of one of the most advanced flight simulators in Europe with an experienced airline pilot to guide you through the flight. Normally reserved for airline pilot training, this is a fantastic opportunity to experience flying a nearly 80 tonne Airbus a320 anywhere in the world! Our instructors are hand-picked for their flying experience, piloting capabilities, and friendly and approachable personalities.\nAll simulator experiences are on our state of the art Airbus A320 simulator. The Airbus A320 is the most common airliner in use at the moment, with one taking-off somewhere in the world every 2.5 seconds.\nOur fully qualified instructors will guide you through the processes, explaining in great detail what is happening and why during various stages of flight to put you right at ease. We will explain the procedures involved in flying any aircraft, explain all the noises that aircrafts make during flight and explain what happens in various emergencies and the systems to prevent collisions. We will offer a demonstration and then give you the chance to experiment with the aircraft as much as you want in the safety and comfort of a simulator that you can control. We can also go through various failures and emergencies that are a rare event in aviation and show you how the pilots trained and how the aircraft are built to handle them whatever the issue. There will be plenty of opportunity to stop and go through things again for your piece of mind and comfort, at your pace.\nWe will make sure you leave happy. Going through the process of flying a commercial aircraft, we hope we are able to remove some of the mystery. We can make you feel confident enough to sit back, relax and enjoy the next flight you take on holiday or business, making the whole experience one to look forward to with happy memories at the end.']"	['<urn:uuid:eb6863e2-a60b-4811-80c7-06ba75c0f265>', '<urn:uuid:a7f46ab0-d214-485c-ac1c-879a090a157c>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	28	113	1460
59	compare red color pluto mars what causes their similar appearance	While both Pluto and Mars appear reddish in color, their coloration comes from different sources. Mars gets its red color from iron oxide (rust), while Pluto's reddish-brown coloration is caused by hydrocarbons called tholins, which form when cosmic rays and ultraviolet light interact with atmospheric and surface methane.	"['Nine years ago, in 2006, NASA launched the New Horizons spacecraft to the outer reaches of the Solar System in order to study the Pluto system.\nNew Horizons is the fastest spacecraft ever launched, and has traveled more than three billion miles to reach its primary target: Pluto. The flyby of the Pluto system on July 14 will complete our initial exploration of the Solar System while opening the door to an entirely new realm of mysterious small planets and planetary building blocks in the Kuiper Belt.\nReaching the Kuiper Belt, or the “third” zone of our Solar System — a region beyond the inner, rocky planets and outer gas giants — has been a priority for years, as it holds building blocks of our Solar System that have been stored in a deep freeze for billions of years.\nPluto, the largest known body in the Kuiper Belt, offers an extensive nitrogen atmosphere, complex seasons, strangely distinct surface markings, an ice-rock interior that may harbor an ocean, five moons. And that’s just what we know.\nThe flyby will also cap a five-decade-long era of solar system reconnaissance that began with Venus and Mars in the early 1960s, continuing through first looks of Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn in the 1970s and Uranus and Neptune in the 1980s. The July 14 flyby of Pluto will occur 50 years to the day after humans first explored Mars with NASA’s Mariner 4 on July 14, 1965.\nThe Pluto system is unique in that it contains the only binary planet system in our Solar System. Pluto and its largest moon Charon are what scientists refer to as a double-dwarf system. Pluto is currently classified as a dwarf planet; while Charon is technically labeled a moon, both bodies orbit the same point in space—a point that isn’t within the circumference of either body.\nJust like the Earth and the moon, Pluto and Charon are tidally locked in an orbital dance. The two orbit like unbalanced weights on a dumbbell, each pulling on the four smaller moons—Nix, Styx, Hydra, and Kerberos—that orbit the pair.\nUsing the Hubble Space Telescope, the researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of the system and concluded that the two largest moons, Nix and Hydra, wobble chaotically as they orbit. Styx and Kerberos are expected to behave in the same manner, although further observations are needed to confirm this prediction. We can tell that the wobble is intensified by the fact that the four moons are not spherical in shape; they’re elongated, much like a football.\nPluto was discovered in 1930 by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, AZ. Shortly after the New Horizons mission was launched in 2006—and after the discovery of another Kuiper Belt Object (Eris) —astronomers voted to demote Pluto from its planetary status. In honor of Tombaugh, a small New Horizons carries some of his ashes on board as he passed away before the mission could get off the ground.\nAstronomers want to know how a system like Pluto and its moons could form. The prevailing theory: Pluto collided with another large body in the distant past, and much of the debris from this impact went into orbit around Pluto, eventually coalescing to form Charon. Scientists believe that a similar collision led to the creation of Earth’s moon, so the study of Pluto and Charon could help scientists decipher the history of our own planet.\nScientists want to figure out why Pluto and Charon look so different. From Earth, the Hubble Space Telescope and New Horizons, we have seen that Pluto has a reflective surface with distinct markings indicative of polar caps. Charon’s surface is far less reflective, with indistinct markings. Pluto has an atmosphere, and Charon does not. Is the sharp contrast between these two bodies a result of evolution or is it due to how they formed? New Horizons will hopefully be able to solve this mystery.\nPluto’s density, size and surface composition are strikingly similar to those of Neptune’s largest satellite, Triton — a captured body from the Kuiper Belt. One great surprise of Voyager 2’s exploration of the Neptune system was the discovery of ongoing cryovolcanic activity on Triton. Will Pluto or other KBOs display such activity?\nAnother fascinating aspect of Pluto is its surprisingly complex atmosphere. Although Pluto’s atmosphere is about 300-600 times less dense than Mars’ — which is, in turn, about 150 times less dense than Earth’s — it offers unique insights into the workings of related planetary atmospheres at Triton and Titan. Whereas the Earth’s atmosphere contains only one gas (water vapor), Mars contains two (water vapor and carbon dioxide), and Pluto’s atmosphere contains three: nitrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. Pluto’s atmosphere has also puffed up over the years instead of dissipating. Scientists hope to determine why.\nNew Horizons is outfitted with a suite of nine different instruments including two cameras—Ralph and LORRI. Until recently, the only images of the dwarf planet were in black and white. With the release of the first color images, and now the first color map, we can see that Mars may not be the only red planet.\nScientists have known for decades that Pluto is reddish brown; however, now we can see it in detail and in living color. Although Mars and Pluto have similar hues, they are due to two very different reasons. Mars gets its red coloring from iron oxide (aka rust). Pluto’s reddish coloration is likely attributed to hydrocarbons (tholins) formed when cosmic rays and ultraviolet light interact with atmospheric and surface methane.\nAs a result of chemical reactions, the tholins are formed and drop to ground, forming a reddish gunk that gives Pluto its color. Tholins are found in other parts of the Solar System as well, such as Saturn’s largest moon Titan and Neptune’s largest moon Triton—thought to be a twin of Pluto.\nNew Horizons is expected to give us unprecedented data on the whole Pluto system for many months following the flyby, including data about its surface, its moons and its environment, refining our knowledge of the dwarf planet and its system.\nPluto is not the last stop for New Horizons. In 2014, the Hubble Space Telescope identified three possible KBO’s beyond Pluto for the probe to flyby. If NASA approves and there’s funding, the spacecraft will visit one in 2019.', ""michigander See Bro! Look over there, I told you, if we waited long enough, another one of these scooters would show up!! That one's probably better than this one I'm riding. Hop on up there and we'll see if we can find another one of those shiny thingies we've been dragging behind this slow POS!\nRegister to post comments and participate in contests.\nThis contest is fueled by the following news: Spirit, NASA's robotic rover which is not on the surface of Mars, has extended its mechanical arms for the first time. It is now taking extraordinarily close photos of the rush colored soil of Mars. Mars is 300 million miles from Earth.\nRed Planet: Mars\nIn our solar system, planet Mars is located at fourth position from the Sun and according to size it is the seventh largest planet. Planet Mars received its name from the Roman god of war, corresponding to the one called as Ares in Greek mythology. Mars is sometimes also referred as the ‘Red Planet' because of its reddish surface, which can be attributed to iron oxide.\nMars belongs to the family of terrestrial planets with an atmosphere that has very low-density. Features of the topography of Mars surface can be compared with the lunar craters and volcanoes, valleys, deserts and polar ice caps like the ones seen on Earth. Extinct volcano Mount Olympus on Mars is the highest mountain in our solar system, and Mariner Valley on the planet is the largest canyon. In addition, three articles were published in the journal Nature in 2008 that put forward the evidence that Mars has an impact crater on its northern hemisphere that is the largest known in the solar system. Its length is 10,600 km and width is 8500 km, and it is roughly four times larger than the earlier known largest impact crater, also located on Mars near its south pole. In addition to the similarity of its surface topography, rotation intervals and changing of seasons on Mars are also similar to Earth, but its climate is much colder and drier than on Earth.\nUntil the first fly-by mission to Mars ‘Mariner 4' in 1965, many researchers were of the view that its surface is water in liquid state. This opinion was based on the observations of periodic variations in light and dark areas, particularly in the polar latitudes, which looked like continents and oceans. Dark fossae on Martian surface were interpreted by some experts as irrigation canals for liquid water. Later it was discovered that it was just an optical illusion and there were no such depressions.\nBecause of low-pressure on the surface of Mars, water can not exist in liquid state there, but it is quite possible that conditions were different in the past, and therefore the existence of elementary life on the planet can not be ruled out. On July 31, 2008 NASA's Phoenix lander discovered water in the form of ice on Mars.\nCurrently (as of February 2009), there are three operational spacecraft engaged in the research of Mars: ‘Mars Odyssey', ‘Mars Express' and ‘Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter', and the number is more than on any other planet except Earth. Mars at the moment also has two exploring rovers viz. Spirit and Opportunity. Mars also has on its surface many inactive landers and rovers that have already completed their mission. Geological data, collected by all these missions, suggest that a large part of Martian surface was covered with water in the past. Studies over the past decade have also revealed geyser like activity at some places on the surface of Mars. Based on the observations from NASA's ‘Mars Global Surveyor' some parts on the southern polar cap of Mars have been gradually receding.\nMars has two natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos (in Greek they mean ‘panic/fear' and ‘terror/dread' - the names of two sons of Ares that accompanied him to battle), which are relatively small and irregular in shape. These may be the asteroids, captured by the gravitational field of Mars, and similar to Asteroid 5261 Eureka from the Trojan group.\nMars can be seen from Earth with the naked eye. Its apparent magnitude is about 2.91 m (at closest approach to Earth), and its brightness is exceeded only by Jupiter, Venus, Moon and Sun.\nMinimum distance of Mars from Earth is 55.75 million miles (when Earth comes exactly between the Sun and Mars), and the maximum is about 401 million km (when the Sun is exactly between Earth and Mars). Average distance from Mars to Sun is 228 million km (1.52 AU), its orbital period around the sun equals 687 Earth days. The orbit of Mars has quite noticeable eccentricity (0.0934), that is why its distance from the Sun varies from 206.6 to 249.2 million km. Inclination of Martian orbit is equal to 1.85 °.\nMars is almost half the size of Earth and its equatorial radius is 3396.9 km (53.2% that of the Earth). The surface area of Mars is approximately equal to the land area on Earth. Sufficiently fast rotation of the planet has led to significant flattening which is evident from the fact that polar radius of Mars is about 21 km less than the equatorial one. Mass of the planet is 6,418 × 1023 kg (11% of Earth's mass). Gravitational acceleration at its equator is equal to 3.711 m / s² (0.378 that of the Earth), orbital velocity is 3.6 km / sec and its escape velocity is 5.027 km / sec.""]"	['<urn:uuid:ab0f1518-e673-4512-ba9a-4546b02b0604>', '<urn:uuid:3d8b08ea-95f5-4dfc-a56e-c64bacd7860d>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	10	48	1970
60	Can you tell me who was responsible for the initial archaeological excavation of the Abinger Pit Dwelling site and when did this work take place?	The site was excavated in 1950 under the direction of L S B Leakey, who was staying in the area at the time.	['Early in 2010 English Heritage approached Surrey Archaeological Society. They had been asked to assess the Abinger Pit Dwelling museum, owned by Cherry Clarke, as the passage of time had left the premises in a state of disrepair. For those of you not familiar with the site it was discovered in 1948 and excavated in 1950 under the direction of L S B Leakey, who was staying in the area. Owned by Major E Beddington-Behrens, living in Abinger Manor, it was regarded of importance and a museum was established, in the field, by the erection of an agricultural building over the site. The excavation, published in 1951 by L S B Leakey, has been visited by interest groups since then. As it is still visited it was decided we should take some action.\nThe first refurbishment was conducted in 1974 by the current owner, Mrs Cherry Clarke, assisted by family members and J Wymer, of lithics fame. The cabinets were relined with hessian and information boards developed, including the painting of a board, defining the animals of the time, by Cherry’s aunt. Rose Hooker grasped the nettle and presented the idea of refurbishment to the Lithics Working Group. The group agreed to visit the site and assess what was required. We found the museum to have suffered from ingression by birds, and marauding cattle, which had disturbed the displays.\nThe cabinets had suffered from the damp environment, and the cattle. The wall boards had also succumbed to the damp environment and were stained and peeling.\nPrior to any work Alan Hall visited the site and took a series of excellent photos, a reference point for future work. These enabled us to plan the work with respect to the existing style and layout. At each stage we involved the owner, Cherry Clark, who naturally has a great sensitivity to the site due to her early involvement together with her family.\nA three pronged approach was decided upon to spread the workload and allow us to tackle three main areas, repairing the cabinets and bird proofing the building, resetting the displays and re developing the wall boards. Ken Waters and Robin Tanner, both skilled in carpentry, were ably assisted by Keith Winser. They visited the site to repair the frames and hinges of the cabinets. A second visit was made to linseed oil the frames, and clean the glass. Keith and Ken also meshed the louvres and inserted corrugated foam into the gaps in the spaces in roof to prevent ingression by birds. Inside the cabinets new hessian was sourced (isn’t eBay wonderful!) to re line the displays. Alan’s photos of the cabinet signage were used to produce new laminated signs. The major task was to re develop the wall boards and retain the integrity of the 1974 refurbishment\nIt was decided to try to replace the boards with a modern Foamex type board which is lightweight and damp resistant. Budget being tight we researched the job and once again the internet supplied the solution. The group’s limited graphic skills were pooled to produce drafts for the printers. Using a montage of photos of the old boards, new pictures and script we produced eight boards to overlay the originals.\nDelivering the boards September 2011\nThroughout the works we hope we have been sensitive to the original nature of the museum and liaised on a regular basis with Mrs Clark, seeking her approval.\nPart of the refurbished display\nThe concept of a pit dwelling has moved on since the 1950’s and we have referenced this with a new board showing the current thinking on Mesolithic dwellings, together with information on the major players. I hope we have enabled the valuable site to be informative and attractive to future visitors.\nIt is important to mention that without the time and labour, generously given over 18 months, it would not have been possible to complete this task, and leave the Museum fit for future visitors. Thanks go to Judie English, Rose Hooker, Ken Waters, Keith Winser, Robin Tanner, and Alan Hall for their contributions.\nShould anyone wish to arrange a group visit please contact Cherry Clarke on 01306 730760 for an appointment.']	['<urn:uuid:1138f871-ef03-4859-a98d-2b62ac2c5787>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	25	23	697
61	forex market nyse afterhours trading timing compare	The Forex markets operate around the clock five days a week, while the NYSE has more limited trading hours with a late trading session from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM EST. This makes Forex more accessible for continuous trading compared to stock markets, with only cryptocurrencies having more extensive trading availability than Forex markets.	['The Forex market is an open, global market where buyers and sellers of currencies from all over the world interact. Because of its importance in international trade, commerce, and finance, the foreign exchange market, or Forex, is one of the largest and most dynamic in the world.\nThis article’s goal is to look at how news affects the Foreign Exchange markets and to provide some ideas for making money off the ensuing price fluctuations.\nTable of Contents\n- The Impact of News on the Forex Market\n- High Impact News and its Effect on Forex Trading\n- Trading Strategies Following a News Release\n- A Comprehensive Calendar of High Impact Forex News\n- Effective Forex News Trading Strategies\nThe Impact of News on the Forex Market\nThe foreign exchange (Forex) markets are open to traders around the clock, five days a week—only digital currencies (cryptocurrencies) are always accessible.\nAll markets—stocks, commodities, Forex, and cryptocurrencies—are susceptible to external shocks. Markets are sensitive to global events like natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and policy decisions made by the Chinese government.\nIn particular, the foreign exchange (Forex) market reacts strongly to news from all around the world, as well as domestic economic statistics from the United States (such as interest rates or employment numbers). Most large brokerages provide trading in eight major currency pairings, including the USD/JPY and CHF/USD. Hence, the Forex market will be affected by news from at least eight different countries’ economies.\nForex traders can utilize the up to seven pieces of data released each weekday to inform their trading decisions. Since more and more news is being released all the time, it has a greater potential to affect the foreign exchange markets. News that New Zealand’s central bank is becoming more hawkish or aggressive with interest rates, for instance, can have an effect on the foreign exchange market. News pertaining to interest rates is useful for traders because they have a direct impact on the value of a currency.\nWhen a trader learns in the morning that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will not reduce interest rates, the value of the New Zealand dollar is likely to rise. In the hours and days following the release of this news, currency traders will consider it when making choices about trades involving the New Zealand dollar.\nHigh Impact News and its Effect on Forex Trading\nCertain news stories are given a lot of weight in the foreign exchange market. Traders should pay special attention to these announcements because of their potential impact on the foreign exchange markets. Data releases, such those of unemployment rates or consumer price indices, central bank meetings, news about a country’s gross domestic product, and interest rate choices by the government can all have significant effects on the market.\nTrading Strategies Following a News Release\nThere are several economic and political elements that affect the state of the global foreign exchange (FX) market. Foreign exchange dealers are always on the lookout for major news that could affect the value of currencies. The most consequential of these press conferences usually involve central banks.\nMaintaining the stability of a country’s currency and keeping inflation under control are two of the central bank’s most important responsibilities. A key tool in their arsenal is the capacity to manipulate interest rates to bring about their desired outcome. Currency traders pay close attention to central bank meetings to learn if and when interest rates will be adjusted. This announcement is crucial for currency traders since the interest rates set by central banks affect the value of a country’s currency.\nCurrency traders also pay special attention to unemployment statistics in addition to interest rate data. The US Non-Farm Payrolls report, which shows the monthly change in the number of individuals employed in the United States, is the report with the most influence (excluding those employed in the farming industry). The US Federal Reserve uses this report as input for setting interest rate policy, making it relevant to FX traders. The Federal Reserve could lower interest rates to encourage hiring if unemployment rates are particularly high. In turn, this would cause the value of the US dollar to decline, encouraging traders to take short bets.\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation by reporting price increases across a wide range of goods and services, is another important news release that forex traders keep an eye on. The Federal Reserve uses data on price increases as an indicator of inflation when setting interest rates. As a result, forex traders place a high premium on CPI data because it forecasts the Fed’s interest rate moves.\nThird, GDP data is closely watched by currency traders. The annualized change in the value of goods and services produced in an economy, adjusted for inflation, is a crucial indication of economic health. In general, a rising trend in GDP is indicative of a strengthening economy, which may prompt the central bank to raise interest rates. The value of the currency would rise as a result.\nNotwithstanding the importance of these four major news releases, forex traders should constantly be on the lookout for the unexpected, as it is possible for currency values to be affected by unforeseen circumstances. A sudden political or economic catastrophe is an example of a black swan occurrence that could drastically affect the market. Hence, forex traders must keep their eyes peeled for any fresh information that can affect the value of the currency they are trading.\nIn conclusion, forex traders who wish to make smart trading selections should pay close attention to economic news releases and current events. Significant news releases that affect the foreign exchange market include central bank meetings, unemployment data, consumer price indexes, and gross domestic product. But, due to the unpredictability of world events, traders must always be on the lookout for rapid shifts in the market and be prepared to react accordingly.\nA Comprehensive Calendar of High Impact Forex News\nMarket participants that need to keep up with the latest developments may find it difficult to manage the constant stream of relevant data releases from different countries. Several calendars have been made to keep track of crucial data and news releases to help traders keep an eye on breaking news.\nEffective Forex News Trading Strategies\nTrading the news has several advantages for traders. One of the benefits is that traders know exactly when to trade, and they can expect a price movement when they do trade. The most common trading strategy in forex involves identifying a currency in a period of consolidation or uncertainty before a high-impact news item is released. If there is a breakout because of the news release, traders can trade this movement in the value of the currency on intraday time frames such as the 1-hour time frame and below.\nTo use this strategy effectively, there are several things a trader should do. Firstly, they should select relevant news to trade. Not all news is suitable for forex trading, but news releases listed above are usually suitable. The most important news typically comes out of the United States, so any news from there should also be considered. Once a trader has determined which news release they will trade, they should analyze the chart of the currency they will trade. The groundwork for price movements is often laid beforehand, so studying the chart will help a trader determine the best way to trade the news.\nIt’s essential for traders to remember not to rush into opening a trade. Although it may be tempting to open a position as soon as possible to capitalize on momentum, the momentum of the news typically lasts over an hour. Traders should use this time to analyze the chart using their technical analysis techniques. If a trader already has an open position before the news is released, it is recommended to consider closing the position until after the news release. This may be frustrating, especially if there is a loss on the current position, but it can be the best practice to minimize risk. There is no way to know what the news release will reveal or how the market will react, and proper risk management is key to long-term trading success.\nAt first glance, forex trading can appear to be as easy as tracking interest rates and developing a plan based on whether they are rising or falling. Trading is rarely that simple, though, as the truth shows. If it were, everyone would be engaged in forex trading and would continuously make large gains.\nThe release of economic news from many nations throughout the world can generate short-term price swings, and the FX markets are particularly susceptible to these price changes. Interest rates are significant, but there are a lot of other things to take into account while trading in any market. Success in forex trading will always depend on maintaining personal development and practicing sound risk management.\nBefore risking real money, forex traders should practice trading current economic events on a trial account and stay up to date on all of the latest news in the economy.', 'When Is The Aftermarket Or Late Trading Session Nyse\nIs the NYSE already closed, but arent you done yet?

62	difference between macedonian baked beans yellow split peas nutrition cooking preparation	Macedonian baked beans (tavče gravče) and yellow split peas are quite different in preparation and characteristics. Macedonian baked beans require overnight soaking, cooking with onions, and baking with paprika, while split peas simply need boiling. Nutritionally, while both are legumes, split peas have a low glycemic index value of 32, making them suitable for blood sugar control. Both foods are nutritious - beans are rich in protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, and B vitamins, while being cholesterol-free and high in fiber. The main difference in preparation is that Macedonian baked beans require a multi-step process involving soaking, cooking, and baking, resulting in a hearty side dish with a distinctive paprika flavor.	"['Macedonian baked beans (tavče gravče) are a classic side dish present for every holiday, and on many days in between. Large, flat beans are softened to the just-before-falling-apart level, and then baked with chunks of onion in an abundant amount of sweet paprika.\nThere is a general direction we take to make them, plus the tweaks. Many of those are considered ""the right way."" So it\'s a balancing game to achieve a version that will satisfy the requirements of the tried, true and traditional taste we\'re used to. The trick to do it on our own terms while not straying from the pillars.\nAn earlier version of these Macedonian baked beans featured on the site was a quick way to make this side dish.\nToday we delve into the conventional way.\nIn the earlier recipe I\'ve mentioned the importance of this dish. Macedonia is most known for this delicacy. There they call the dish tavče gravče, or \'beans in a pan.\'\nThe best pan baked beans are made with a special type of regional bean called tetovac. Tetovac originates from Macedonian city of Tetovo. For a long time it was the most known bean in the region. Back in the day it was planted throughout Serbia and parts of Bosnia too.\nTetovac is a large, white, flatter bean. Not completely flat though. There is a certain meatiness to it. When prepared well it achieves the softness of a chestnut. When you bite into this bean, there is a lot of substance.\nThis is a hearty side dish. Eat too much of it, and you\'ll be too stuffed to eat the rest of your meal. Eat too little, and you\'ll be left with a lingering for more.\nThe taste leans towards sweet achieved with paprika and soft, simmered onion. This delicacy\'s recognition factor is the paprika. In Bosnia and Serbia sweet, but not too sweet paprika is used. The kind without the spiciness factor. Paprika just accents the already successful, sweet taste of combined bean and onions.\nIn Macedonia however, sharper, spicier tones of paprika are used. The taste is spicier, and will be more up your alley if you are a lover of spicier things.\nThis translates into more choices for you.\nOriginal tetovac is harder to find today. And if you\'re in the US, it\'ll be near impossible.\nHowever the white butter bean is a great substitution. White lima beans also work. Just look for the flatter, larger version. You\'ll need them dry, not canned.\nFirst clean it from the debris. Soak it overnight in plenty of water, with a pinch of baking soda. The following day strain and wash thoroughly. Transfer to a pan, bring to a boil, then cook until the beans are soft. Strain again and combine with simmered onions. And let them take a journey in the oven together.\nAs I mentioned before, the easiest version is to go with 1:1 bean to onion ratio. However it\'s not strictly so. You can do a little less onion, or a little less beans. The first time you make it, make the ratio even. After that, let your taste guide you.\nMacedonian pan beans are great as a roast side.\nThey make a fantastic sandwich too, along with a glass of beer.\nMacedonian Baked Beans (Tavče Gravče)\n- 1 teaspoon baking soda\n- 24 ounces dry white flat beans lima, butter bean or tetovac\n- 24 ounces yellow onion cleaned, diced into half moons\n- ⅓ teaspoon ground pepper\n- 1.5 teaspoons seasoned salt or vegeta or 1 bouillon cube\n- 3 teaspoons paprika\n- 7 ounces vegetable oil\n- In a large bowl, soak beans overnight in plenty of water and baking soda.\n- The following day strain the beans and wash thoroughly. Transfer to a large pan and cover with 6-8 cups of water. Bring to boil on high, then lower the temperature to medium. Continue cooking beans for the 60 minutes or until they are soft, but not falling apart. During cooking, keep removing the foam that forms on top of the pot and stir.\n- About 40 minutes after you\'ve put beans to cook, heat oil in a large pan on high. Add onions and lower the temperature to medium. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until onion crystalizes but isn\'t completely brown. Heat oven to 480°F.\n- Remove beans and onions off heat. Strain beans, however keep 8-10 ounces of water in which it was cooked. Transfer to a baking pan by first layering the onion, then the beans. Add spices on top. Finally, add the bean water. Mix thoroughly and transfer to the oven. Lower heat to 390°F.\n- Bake 30 to 40 minutes. Check once or twice. The beans should be baked and soft with a slight, non-dry crispiness in parts.\n- Serve warm.\nTraditional Macedonian baked pans ask for sharper, spicier paprika. We used the sweet paprika usually used in Bosnia and Serbia.\nGluten-free: Use vegeta or a gluten-free bouillon cube.', ""|GI Rating of the Beans, Peas|\n|GI Value of Split pea, yellow, boiled|\nSplit pea, yellow, boiled\nGlycemic Index Value: 32\nGlycemic Index Range: Low\nLow GI foods\nGI value less than 55\nMedium GI foods = GI value between 55 and 69\nHigh GI foods = GI value greater than 70\nFood's Personality: Beans\nBeans are from the the\ngenus Phaseolus in the pea family.|\nO Beans generally are warm-season annuals.\nO Beans are excellent antioxidants, especially Kidney, Pinto, and Black varieties.\nO Beans are useful as a meat substitute.\nO Beans contain no cholesterol.\nO Beans are the perfect food for a fat-restricted diet.\nO Beans are one of the richest sources of fiber.\nO Dried beans are rich in protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, and B Vitamins.\nO You can Store fresh beans in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\nO The flatulence caused by dried beans is created by oligosaccharides, complex indigestible sugars that are fermented by friendly bacteria resulting in gas.\nO Beano, an enzyme supplement, can break down oligosaccharides in the beans reducing flatulence.\nO If beans bother your digestive system, try canned beans, or get exercise.\nO The Aztecs in Mexico used beans as a staple food in the 10th century.\nO The Incas introduced beans to South America.\n|Glycemic Value of the other Beans, Peas:|\nBaked Beans canned\nBlack Beans (South American)\nBlack Eyed Beans\nBroad Beans (Canada)\nBrown Beans (South Africa)\nButter beans (Canada)\nButter beans (South Africa)\nChick peas dried boiled (Canada)\nHummus (chickpea salad dip)\nKidney Beans boiled (Canada)\nKidney Beans boiled (India)\nKidney Beans boiled (USA)\nKidney Beans canned\nLentils boiled (Canada)\nLentils boiled (USA)\nLentils green/canned in brine\nLentils green/dried/boiled (Canada)\nLentils red/split/boiled 25 min\nMarrowfat peas dried/boiled (Canada)\nMarrowfat peas dried/boiled (USA)\nPinto Beans canned\nRed kidney beans soaked overnight/boiled 60 min\nSplit pea (Wil-Pak- USA)\nSplit peas yellow boiled\n|Select Another Food Category:|\n|Breads - Beans, Legumes - Bread Rolls - Bread Snacks - Muffins - Ice Cream, Dessert - Milk - Yogurt - Fruit - Fruit Juices Cakes - Candies - Cookies - Crackers - Pancakes - Pizza - Snacks - Noodles - Pasta - Rice Potatoes|\n|Glycemic Index for Split pea, yellow, boiled, GI Value of Split pea, yellow, boiled Glycemic Response to Split pea, yellow, boiled, Effect of Carbs in Split pea, yellow, boiled on Blood Glucose, Glycemic Index Information for all Types of Split pea, yellow, boiled, Nutritional value of Split pea, yellow, boiled, GI Rating of Split pea, yellow, boiled,شاخص گلیسمی ,Glycemic Index Rating of Split pea, yellow, boiled, Glycemic Index Value of Split pea, yellow, boiled, Le Facteur IG,La Solution Par L'index Glycemique,Nie Musisz Liczyc Kalorii,De GI-factor,La Revolucion De La Glucosa,Det glyk�miske indeks, glykemisk indeks,GI Revolusjonen,L'index Glycemique du Split pea, yellow, boiled,Índices Glicémicos,glykämischen Index,indice glicemico, Split pea, yellow, boiled Facts|\n||Bests of Low GI Foods:|\nO Cicer arietinum\nO Fabaceae Family\nFood: Garbanzo Beans\nGlycemic Index Value: 28\nGlycemic Index Range: Low\nO are a good source of fiber\nO are a good source of zinc and protein\nO are useful as a meat substitute\nO contain no cholesterol""]"	['<urn:uuid:c76d9b54-7494-4971-b263-7215f8a0279d>', '<urn:uuid:2c2dc067-8df7-4354-ae80-071e83b7c461>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	11	110	1356
63	mechanical watch features vs maintenance needs	GMT and dual-time watches offer different features for tracking time zones - GMT watches use a 24-hour bezel and independent GMT hand, while dual-time watches display two time zones simultaneously with a main dial and sub-dial. Regarding maintenance, mechanical watches require servicing every 4-5 years for lubrication and movement overhaul, and those used in water need seal checks every 3 years. They also need 20-30 winds if not worn for a day or two, as they typically have 40-44 hour power reserve.	['The watch world has several types, including GMT, dual-time, world-time, and UTC watches. Every seasoned watch enthusiast has had to deal with this choice, especially if you’re a frequent traveler. For the most part, these two watch types, GMT and dual-time, have different mechanisms for telling the time. Knowing the main difference between them can help you pick the perfect kind of timepiece to suit your preference. Here’s a guide to help you understand the worlds of GMT and dual-time watches.\nWhat is a GMT Watch?\nThe best way to approach this GMT vs dual time watches debate is to look at their respective history and backgrounds. GMT is the acronym for Greenwich Mean Time. It’s used to tell the local time in the UK and other countries on the Greenwich Meridian. On the 24-hour scale of international time zones, GMT, defined with a zero, acts as the starting point.\nThe prime meridian that influences the GMT format is an imaginary line splitting the Earth into two equal parts. Therefore, the timezone for the Western Hemisphere begins with a (-1), while you’ll find world time zones to the East beginning with (+1). This type of watch usually has a 24-hour bezel that syncs with the second time zone. In addition, most true GMT watches have the main hour hand and minute hand operating with the 12-hour format.\nThe 24-hour hand can be manipulated independently, and like most Rolex watches, they may come in a different color or design.\nGMT models that make the 24-hour hand unadjustable can only help a wearer keep track of time and determine if the time is in the AM or PM. To read GMT in the home time zone, you may need to set the GMT bezel at 12:00, so the GMT hand can be consistent with the hour and minute hands.\nYou can also use the GMT hand to tell the hour in a second-time zone. But depending on how the second time zone is ahead or behind the GMT function, you may have to manipulate the bezel. Popular GMT watch brands include the Omega Sea Master and the Rolex GMT Master, informally known as the Rolex Pepsi because of its blue and red color scheme.\nWhat’s a dual-time watch?\nDual time watches have several features different from GMT and other watch types. Unlike the GMT or the world time watch, a dual time watch can simultaneously display two different time zones without the need for a rotating bezel. The primary time zone sports a larger dial, with the second time zone acting as a sub-dial using the 12-hour time display.\nA typical dual time feature you’ll find in dual time model watches is the AM-PM indicator. When monitoring the second time zone on a 12-hour scale, this indicator helps to determine whether it’s day or night. The standard template for a regular traveler using a dual time watch is to set the main dial to display the visiting destination’s time. The sub-dial can then serve as a reminder of their home time zone to avoid losing sight of the time difference. Famous examples of dual-time watches include the Patek Philippe Nautilus Travel Time Chronograph and the Vacheron Constantin Overseas Dual Time 41mm.\nWhich one is better?\nThere’s no template or criteria to choose either GMT or dual watches based on performance and design. Instead, a traveler may opt for the dual time function to keep track of time between two specific time zones. Take an individual who resides in New York, United States, and travels to Mexico for periodic meetings, for instance. The dual time watch can help set the time specifically between these two time zones so you can always be in sync. GMT watches can provide the same perk, but you may need a little math and some adjustment to pull through.', 'A timepiece is something most people have and wear everyday…. to the office, to scuba dive or to the opera. A watch is one of the few devices that we most rely on in our daily lives. But the inner workings of a mechanical watch are more intricate than most people think and as such require some care and maintenance.\nIts important to understand the purpose and limitations of your timepiece. A knowledgeable sales person at an authorized retailer is most suitable to answer all of your questions. Please note that buying your timepiece from an authorized retailer is the only way to ensure that you will get the proper manufacturers warranty. If you choose to buy your watch from a non-authorized source, you will likely be promised a “warranty” provided by the retailer themselves and sent to a local watchmaker as opposed to proper factory service. Service on timepieces can be expensive so having a proper warranty can usually outweigh the savings you think your getting from buying from a “non-authorized” source. Servicing on your timepiece can be a lengthy and expensive, often time 3-4 months and be in the range of $300 – $400.\nGenerally speaking a quartz watch, which uses a battery, generally doesn’t require any service until the battery needs to be replaced, usually 2-3 years from the time it leaves the factory, not from when you buy it. Mechanical watch movements, meaning automatic or watches needing to be wound daily, require a different level of maintenance. Because these watches have hundreds of moving parts inside, they require lubrication to ensure optimum performance and minimal friction and wear on the movement. Most watch companies suggest that you send your mechanical watch in for general servicing and a movement overhaul every 4-5 years. This is a safe and conservative way to think about perserving your investment in a fine timepiece. In the last 10 years, several advancements in movements, assembly and lubrication have made the need for service even more infrequent. If you don’t get your watch wet and it is continuing to keep good time, you can often go 1-3 years longer. For users who swim or regularily or get their watches wet, its important to have the seals on your watch checked every 3 years and the watch pressure tested as part of the service.\nWatch Preventative Care Guidelines\n- Timepieces with water resistance under 100 meters, shouldn’t be considered for regular water submersion. – If you have a screw down crown, always check that it is completely screwed down before getting the timepiece wet.\n- If you get your watch wet regularily, make sure the seals are tested when serviced and a pressure test is performed.\n- Never press any buttons or adjust the crown when the watch is wet or underwater.\n- Realize that if you wear a timepiece with a leather strap in hot weather, perspiration will require you to replace it more frequently.\n- If you have a chronograph (stopwatch), NEVER, push both buttons at the same time.\n- Most automatic watches have a 40-44 hour power reserve, when fully wound, if you don’t wear your watch for a day or two, make sure you wind it 20-30 times before wearing it.\n- If you put your watch on a winder, keep in mind that some watches need a more aggressive winder regimen to keep them wound. Also, some watches have rotors that only wind in one direction, if the winder isn’t keeping the watch wound, it may be the winder and not the watch.\n- Numerous watch companies have a close marketing affiliation with the sport of golf. Golfing while wearing a mechanical watch and the shock that occurs can often cause the watches to become very inaccurate. Take your watch off for golf or wear your Timex Triathlon Watch.\nPreventative Care For Complicated Watches\n- These watches by definition are more delicate and deserve special care. As a rule, do not subject these timepiece to any agressive activity.\n- With very few exceptions, NEVER wind the hands of a perpetual calendar watch backwards, advance the hands clockwise only.\n- If you are setting a perpetual calendar, check the instructions, but as as rule, make sure the hour hand is in the bottom hemisphere of the dial before using quick-set features.\n- Avoid exposing Minute Repeaters (or any mechanical chiming watch) to any shock. Also when engaging the Chiming function, pull the lever completely and do not repeat more often than every 30 seconds.\nEnjoy your timepiece! If properly cared for, it should provide you, and perhaps your children, with years of enjoyment.']	['<urn:uuid:321491bc-eac4-404d-9f33-5da2261fab72>', '<urn:uuid:fa3457aa-a2fd-4705-8fbb-1495d2cf445a>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	6	82	1414
64	Is Tularemia transmission more diverse in mice or ticks?	Tularemia transmission is more diverse in mice. While ticks transmit Tularemia through tick bites, mice can spread it through multiple ways including handling infected animals, eating/drinking contaminated food/water, breathing contaminated dust/aerosols, and through various forms like ulceroglandular, glandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, pneumonic, and typhoidal tularemia.	['Introduction: The prevalence of Francisella tularensis in Minnesota ticks is unknown. Ticks collected at seven sites were tested to determine the infection prevalence of F. tularensis in Dermacentor variabilis in Minnesota.\nMaterials and Methods: Ticks were collected from two properties at an epizootic site and at five long-term tick research sites. Ticks were pooled by species, sex, date, and site with a maximum of 10 ticks per pool. Ticks were bisected and homogenized; DNA from supernatant was extracted and tested by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Twice, additional ticks were collected for bacterial culture and isolation of F. tularensis. Proportion of positive pools and minimum infection rate (MIR) were calculated.\nResults: A total of 3527 ticks were tested for F. tularensis including 1601 male D. variabilis and 1926 female D. variabilis. Across all sites, 128 (34%) of 378 pools were RT-PCR positive for F. tularensis. Of 128 positive pools, F. tularensis from 96 (75%) was identified as type A; F. tularensis from 32 pools was unable to be subtyped. The overall MIR was 3.6%. The MIR was significantly lower at the epizootic site compared with Morrison County 1 (3.9% vs. 7.2%; p = 0.02) but did not differ between the epizootic site and Pine County 1 (3.9% vs. 2.1%; p = 0.49). Within the epizootic site, the MIR was significantly higher at Washington County 2 compared with the adjacent property (5.7% vs. 2.3%; p < 0.001). F. tularensis was cultured from 6 (15%) of 40 pools.\nConclusions: F. tularensis was found in ticks at a majority of sites tested. The MIR of F. tularensis in D. variabilis ticks in Minnesota varied geographically. Our findings support the hypothesis that D. variabilis plays an important role in the natural history of tularemia in Minnesota. Further ecologic studies are needed to fully understand the importance of tick species in the maintenance and transmission of F. tularensis in Minnesota.\nThe Dermacentor variabilis tick is a hard bodied tick, also known as the American Dog tick or Wood tick and is widely known. It transmits Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) and tularemia to humans as well as canine tick paralysis to dogs. http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/in781\nDorsal view of American dog ticks, Dermacentor variabilis (Say), with male on left, and female on right. Credit: J.F. Butler, University of Florida\nIt was been suggested that adult ticks move to the edge of the roads and trails in an attempt to find a host, or “quest.” Some have hypothesized that because many animals typically follow trails, they leave an odor that attracts these ticks causing them to move toward and quest alongside trails in attempts to find a host (Mcnemee et al. 2003).\nMore on Tularemia: https://madisonarealymesupportgroup.com/2016/10/25/of-rabbits-and-men/\nNormally thought of as inhabiting areas east of the Rocky Mountains, the Wood tick is obviously defying entomology maps and traipsing all over – from Minnesota to Missouri, California, and most probably everywhere in-between.\nI remember hearing Timothy Lepore, MD, FACS, surgeon at Nantucket Cottage Hospital, at a Lyme conference. He explained that Tularemia is also a disease of those who work with the land such as landscapers and farmers, as well as those who get bit by a tick. There are cases reported in every state but Hawaii, and many other wild and domestic animals can be infected. The highest rates of infection are in Arkansas. Please see this link for more details but know that this is a bioweaponized pathogen: https://madisonarealymesupportgroup.com/2016/10/25/of-rabbits-and-men/ The WHO estimates that an aerosol dispersal of 50 kg of F. tularensis over an area with 5 million people would result in 25,000 incapacitating casualties including 19,000 deaths.\nTransmission: Transmission can occur through the skin or mucous membranes when handling infected animals as well as through tick bite, contact with fluids from infected deer flies, mosquitoes or ticks, handling or eating undercooked rabbit, drinking contaminated water, inhaling dust from contaminated soil, and handling contaminated pelts or paws of animals. It can also be inhaled from infected hay, grain, or soil. Dr. Lepore had patients who contracted it from their pet dog who shook rain water on them after chewing on a dead rabbit, as well as from folks eating road kill, a person who held sick animals, and a gentleman who slept with his pet bunny.\nAnother reminder – don’t sleep with pets!\nThe fact that 35% of Minnesotan ticks are infected with Tularemia is concerning. Spread the word.', 'Mice and Rats: Health Hazards and How to Prevent Them\nMice and rats are some of the most damaging and dangerous pests to have in homes and businesses. Their habits cause extensive damage, and they are known carriers of many diseases. It is important to be aware of the risks posed by mouse and rat infestations, so we put together a guide detailing the causes, symptoms, and prevention methods of the main rodent-borne illnesses in the United States.\nHantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome\nHantavirus is a virus spread primarily by deer mice, white-footed mice, cotton rats, and rice rats. Typically, it is contracted after coming into direct contact with rodents or their urine and droppings, or by breathing in dust contaminated with urine or droppings. It can also be contracted through rodent bites, but that is not as common. Symptoms develop between 1 and 8 weeks after exposure, and they occur in two phases. Universal early symptoms include fatigue, fever, and muscle aches. Other early symptoms that occur in about half of all Hantavirus cases include chills, dizziness, headaches, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Late symptoms begin between 4 and 10 days after the early symptoms phase. These symptoms include coughing, shortness of breath, and lungs filling with fluid. Hantavirus has a mortality rate of 38%.\nLeptospirosis is a bacteria spread by rodents, as well as other animals. It is contracted by eating or drinking contaminated foods and water, or by contact of skin or mucous membranes with contaminated soil or water. Symptoms will typically arrive abruptly between 2 days and 4 weeks after exposure to the bacteria, although some people show no symptoms at all. The illness may occur in two phases. The first phase may consist of fever, chills, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, headache, muscle aches, red eyes, jaundice, and rash. If a person experiences a second phase, it will be more severe and may occur after a period of recovery from the first phase. The second phase may include liver or kidney failure, respiratory distress, or meningitis. Without treatment, recovery from leptospirosis may take months, and in some cases can lead to death.\nPets can also get leptospirosis, although it is rare in cats. Symptoms that are commonly seen in dogs include fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, refusal to eat, severe weakness and muscle pain, stiffness, severe depression, and the inability to have puppies. Younger animals are usually affected more than older animals.\nLymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM)\nLymphocytic choriomeningitis, or LCM, is a disease caused by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, or LCMV. It is typically spread by house mice. It can also be spread by pet rodents, but that is not as common. An estimated 5% of house mice in the United States carry LCMV. It is contracted either by direct contact with rodents or rodent urine and droppings, or by breathing in dust contaminated by rodent urine and droppings. It can also be spread through bite wounds from infected rodents, although this is much rarer. LCM may occur in two phases. Symptoms of the first phase appear between 8 and 13 days after exposure. Common symptoms of the first phase include fever, nausea, vomiting, lack of appetite, malaise, headache, and muscle aches. Less common symptoms include sore throat, cough, chest pain, joint pain, testicular pain, and pain of the salivary glands. If a second phase occurs, it will do so after a few days of recovery from the first phase. Symptoms of the second phase include, meningitis, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, acute hydrocephalus, and, in rare cases, myelitis. As LCM is an infection of the nervous system, it can cause temporary or permanent neurological damage, including nerve deafness and arthritis. If a pregnant woman becomes infected with LCMV, she may pass the infection to the fetus. This can result in fetal death during the first trimester, or serious and permanent birth defects during the second and third trimesters. LCM is rarely fatal, with a mortality rate of less than 1%.\nRat-Bite Fever (RBF)\nRat-bite fever, or RBF, is caused by one of two bacteria that are spread by rats and possibly mice as well. Only one of the two RBF-causing bacteria is found in the United States, and that is streptobacillus moniliformis, which causes streptobacillary RBF. As the name suggests, RBF is typically contracted through a bite or scratch wound from an infected rodent, or through contact with a dead rodent. It can also be contracted by eating or drinking food or water that is contaminated with rat droppings, in which case it is referred to as Haverhill fever. Symptoms appear between 3 days and 3 weeks after exposure to the bacteria, by which time any bite or scratch that caused the illness would likely be healed. Common symptoms of Streptobacillary RBF include fever, vomiting, headache, and muscle pain. In addition, approximately 5 out of 10 patients experience joint pain or swelling, and approximately 3 out of 4 patients experience a rash. This rash will appear on hands and feet and look like flat, reddened areas that have small bumps. People with Haverhill fever may also experience sore throat and more severe vomiting. Complications with Streptobacillary RBF include abscesses inside the body, liver or kidney infections, pneumonia, meningitis, and infections involving the heart. Approximately 1 out of 10 people who get Streptobacillary RBF die.\nSalmonellosis is an infection caused by the bacteria salmonella, and can be spread in many ways, including by rats and mice. When spread by rats or mice, it is contracted by eating or drinking food or water that is contaminated with rat droppings. Symptoms typically appear between 6 hours and 6 days after exposure, although some people may not develop symptoms for several weeks. Symptoms usually last between 4 and 7 days, but can last for several weeks. Common symptoms of salmonellosis include fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Some strains of salmonella can cause severe disease, as well as infections of the blood, bones, joints, nervous system, or urine.\nTularemia is caused by a bacteria and can be spread in many different ways, including by rats and mice. There are multiple forms of tularemia, which are categorized by how the bacteria was contracted. Symptoms vary by form, but all forms cause fever. Causes and symptoms of the main forms of tularemia are listed below. Please keep in mind that this list only includes the causes pertaining to rodents. The forms of tularemia that are listed may have other causes that are not included in this list.\n- Ulceroglandular tularemia is caused by handling an infected animal. Symptoms include a skin ulcer where the bacteria entered the body, fever, chills, exhaustion, and swollen and painful lymph glands.\n- Glandular tularemia is the same as ulceroglandular tularemia in all ways, except that it does not cause skin ulcers.\n- Oculoglandular tularemia is caused by the bacteria entering through the eyes, usually when someone is butchering an infected animal and touches their eyes. Symptoms include irritation and inflammation of the eye, an ulcer on the inside of the eyelid, sensitivity to light, and swelling of the lymph glands in front of the ears.\n- Oropharyngeal tularemia is caused by eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, sore throat, tonsillitis, mouth ulcers, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck.\n- Pneumonic tularemia can be caused either by breathing in contaminated dust or aerosols, or by leaving another form of tularemia untreated, allowing it to spread through the bloodstream to the lungs. Pneumonic is the most serious form of tularemia. Symptoms include chest pain, difficulty breathing, and a dry cough.\n- Typhoidal tularemia is a combination of general symptoms of tularemia, without any of the localized symptoms of other forms. Such general symptoms include extreme exhaustion, enlarged spleen or liver, vomiting, diarrhea, and pneumonia.\nMost cases of tularemia can be treated fairly easily with antibiotics, although some cases are life-threatening.\nFor more information about these and other rodent-borne illnesses, visit this page of the CDC’s website.\nDiseases spread by mice and rats can be avoided if necessary precautions are taken. For one, avoid any contact with rodents that are not pets. Take steps to make your home or business an environment where rodents cannot or do not want to live. Do not swim or wade in water that could potentially be contaminated with rodent urine or feces. If your job requires you to come into contact with anything that is potentially contaminated- such as soil, water, or infested buildings- always wear protective footwear and clothing. When mowing, check the area beforehand for any sick or dead rodents, and do not mow over them if there are any. Clean up any rodent nests, as well as any urine and droppings. For information on how to safely clean up dead rodents, rodent nests, or rodent urine and droppings, visit this page on the CDC’s website. When handling nests or wild rodents, dead or alive, always wear gloves and wash your hands with soap and warm water after.\nAlthough it is rare, diseases can also be spread by pet rodents, so precautions should be taken when handling them as well. When choosing a rodent pet from a pet store or breeder, avoid any that look sick or otherwise unwell. Do not choose any that are in the same cage as rodents that look unwell, either. If possible, clean your pet’s habitat, food and water bowls, toys, and any other objects outdoors. If outdoor cleaning is not an option, then use a large bathtub or sink that can be easily disinfected. Avoid using a kitchen sink. Always wash your hands with soap and warm water after handling your pet or its belongings.\nIf you are bitten or scratched by a rodent, wild or domestic, clean the wound immediately with soap and warm water. Contact a health care provider as soon as possible and tell the provider about the bite or scratch. Get treatment if need be.\nIn addition to spreading illnesses, mice and rats tend to cause extensive, and usually expensive, damage to homes and businesses. They will chew through just about anything they can get their teeth into, including walls, floors, insulation, pipes, wires, upholstery, important documents, family heirlooms, and more. The damage to insulation can make temperature regulation very difficult and expensive. Lack of insulation means having to run air conditioners and heaters much more than usual, in addition to the fact that insulation can be expensive to replace. Chewed wires are quite dangerous, and actually cause about 25% of the house fires in the United States each year. Mice and rats also cause fire risks when they tunnel into and build nests inside of appliances, causing them to short-circuit or malfunction. When an infestation is severe, the urine of the mice or rats can soak into wood and compromise the structural integrity of a building. For information on how to prevent infestations, check out our mouse and rat FAQ pages\nA few mice or rats can quickly turn into an infestation. Rodent infestations are not something to be taken lightly or ignored, as they can be potentially dangerous.

65	Which requires more author attribution: Free JUSLINE or Creative Commons?	Free JUSLINE License has stricter attribution requirements, mandating author naming in both the heading and chronology, while Creative Commons only requires attribution as one basic building block that can be combined with other conditions like commercial use or modification rights.	"['Why commenting law?\nJUSLINE´s Open Law Commentaries provide the opportunity to make a contribution to the general public (""Open Content"") with a minimal investment of time and to call attention of experts and persons seeking legal assistance.\nYou can actively participate in the legal development!\nMany authors analyse certain judgements or laws in order to criticise or to promote the legal development, in any case to influence it. Another ambition is to advance your own career and to call attention of experts or potential clients.\nThe professional reputation of an author is expressed by the number of readers or how often the contribution is cited in other articles. Empirical studies show that Open Access considerably increases the frequency of the reading and citing of an article (for example ""The Open Citation Project"", a bibliography of American studies). One reason for this development is the fast linking and distribution via ""Blogs"" respectively ""blawgs"".\nFor this reason Open Law Commentaries are the ideal platform for specialised legal publications, especially for lawyers, jurists and juridical interested people who don\'t have the chance to contribute to a printed law commentary due to their limited time budget or the ""closed-shop-character"" of traditional publishing houses.\nThis project also aims to overcome the frustration of the fast obsolescence of traditional law commentaries caught between two printed editions. New judgements and doctrines can only be incorporated after many years.\nWho should contribute?\nUsually the collaboration on Legal Commentaries is reserved to a small group of authors. As a result of the small number of specialised publishing houses there exist only few commentaries on laws and consequently only a small number of authors.\nThis is regrettable because a large part of the available potential of creativity, experience and knowledge gets lost:\nMany jurists or judges give innovative judgements which receive no public attention because they are not rendered by court of ultimate resort.\nStatements of lawyers questioning accepted theories are not adopted by courts or not taken into account by legal publications.\n(Young) lawyers shape up new perspectives for which they can\'t find an appropriate platform and which are ignored by leading commentators.\nEverybody can contribute to the Open Law Commentaries! Judges, lawyers, administrative jurists, inhouse counsels, lecturers, students at Law Schools as well as retired lawyers may join the Net-community to collaborate voluntarily on this joint project.\nBut you don\'t have to be legal practitioner to contribute to the Open Law Commentaries. If you receive for example a judgement which throws a new light on a legal provision you can write a contribution as well as a person who browses the Internet for judgements or other legal information with the aim to incorporate them into an Open Law Commentary.\nFrequently people external to the subject are those who formulate questions unconventionally and initiate new theoretical developments. Albert Einstein was seeking the contact with young students who confronted him with - at first view - simple questions, whereas the answers opened on occasion unexpected and in this respect even for the celebrated scholar advanced perspectives.\nThe ""social control"" by the JUSLINE-community which carefully examines, discusses and if necessary modifies contributions finally provides a favourable result for everybody. Furthermore all former versions of the commentary are saved and made accessible as to enable the users to control each contribution and its modifications.\nOpen Content are texts, pictures, data bases and other contents for which an author can claim protection of intellectual property (in particular copyright), but which are freely accessible via Internet and may be copied and distributed and partly modified by everybody. The rules of use are summarised in Open Content Licenses which base on licenses originally made for the free circulation of software (Open Source Software). For the simple use of a creation, for example reading a text, there is no license necessary, this authorization results from legal provisions.\nThe beginning of the Open Content movement was characterised by the altruistic idea that software should circulate freely as expression of opinion. Open Content projects are also characterised by the wish to facilitate the exchange of knowledge. The distribution of information which is important for society but not state-aided should be made available free of charge in the framework of voluntary cooperations. The content of those data-bases is regularly updated through contributions of third persons.\nOpen Access characterises the aim to make scientific literature and materials free accessible (free of charge and without license restrictions) in the world wide web. Valuable sources are made freely available by their authors on servers of free internet-journals, specialised servers or at their own homepages. Thereby state-aided results of research of universities is made freely accessible instead of being sold costly.\nA milestone in the Open Access movement was the ""Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities"" from October 2003. Many other international organizations as OSI, SPARC and CERN joined this appeal.\nOpen Law Commentaries as Open Content\nOpen Law Commentaries are provided by JUSLINE as Open Content. Open Content is characterized by the granting of comprehensive rights of use but also by assumption of obligations. Who acquires rights by writing or modifying a contribution has to submit these rights under the Free JUSLINE License which means that he has to permit third persons the use of the new version according to the provisions of the JUSLINE License. The Open Content License protects the licensor and the general public against a subsequent restriction of use by third persons. This is provided by the so-called ""copyleft-effect"" which ensures that a creation (including all modifications) subordinated under an Open Content License may be only used according to the provisions of the license.\nDirectly linked to the right of modification granted to third persons is the right of authors and holders of the exclusive rights of use on naming. An Open Content License aims generally to protect the interests of authors and holders of rights as far as possible. The naming of authors and holders of exclusive rights is compulsory, partly already in the heading, partly in the chronology.\nThe Free JUSLINE License\nThe contents of JUSLINE\'s Open Law Commentaries are subject to the Free JUSLINE License which follows the provisions of the GNU Free Documentation License which was developed for free software respectively manuals for free software. This means that everybody may freely copy, distribute and modify the content of the Open Law Commentaries stating the origins and the individual authors and administrators. Texts derived from the Open Law Commentaries have to be free in the same manner.\nIntention of the Free JUSLINE License is to make the Open Law Commentaries freely accessible i.e. to allow everybody to copy and to distribute them with or without modifications. The license is addressed to people who want to make available their achievements without the requirement of obtaining the permission for use or modifications. Thereby the Free JUSLINE License provides the drafting and distribution of Legal Commentaries by any number of persons who don\'t have to be connected institutionally.\nThe interests of authors of contributions to Open Law Commentaries are protected by the Free JUSLINE License and it is intention of this license to properly protect and adequately appreciate the creative work of authors and other ancillary copyright legitimated people. The author should be associated with his contribution by naming him or - in case that his contribution was modified by other persons - adding a notice to him in the chronology. Thereby it is assured that authors and administrators are gaining compliment for their creation without being liable for modifications of others.\nBasic Information on Open Content and Open Access Projects\nBerlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities\nBjörk, Bo-Christer, Open access to scientific publications - an analysis of the barriers to change.

66	I'm curious - what was the original messy way of celebrating carnival in Goa?	The Portuguese started this carnival as a fun-filled bawdy game. People would fling gloves filled with flour, eggs, lemon, orange, mud, sand and dirty water at passersby. People threw out pots, old pans, kitchen utensils out of the window as a symbolic gesture of discarding the old and dirty before Lent.	"['We invite you to explore India - the Land with infinite beauty ! Whether you soar high into Himalayas or peer under the ruins of the Ancient monuments dotting the landscape of India, you will cherish the experience long after your visit ! This India Travel Guide on Goa Carnival is free from any commercial interest! This site is dedicated to promote India - the vast subcontinent, its glorious past, magnificent landscape and its infinite variety.\n\'Intruz\' or the famous Goan carnival is held for 3 to 4 days in the month of February every year. Carnival means \'to take away meat\'. This is fitting as the carnival is celebrated before the month of Lent - the Roman Catholic period of penance - as this Carnival has its origin in the Catholic Portuguese colonial past. The strumming notes of the guitars, gaily-decorated tableaus and floats alongside the enticing rhythm and dancing mark the festivity of the Goan carnival.\nHistory of the Goa carnival\nThe legendary King Momo (these days, a person is elected to take over as the King for the 3 days) takes to the streets and the entire state comes alive with music and color. During his rule of the colonies, King Momo ordered his subjects to party from the opening day. King Momo is also known as King of Chaos.\nThe Portuguese who established their colony in Goa introduced the carnival to Goa. The Goa carnival is an integral aspect of the Portuguese heritage in Goa. The Portuguese started this carnival as a fun-filled bawdy game. People would fling gloves filled with flour, eggs, lemon, orange, mud, sand and dirty water at passersby. People threw out pots, old pans, kitchen utensils out of the window as a symbolic gesture of discarding the old and dirty before Lent. Lavish feasts, cakes and pastries were distributed. Though many of the rituals have been dropped or modified these days, the spirit of the festival continues.\nThese days, people smear color on each other. People participating in the event wear colored costumes and elaborate masks. The music and dance performances are composed and choreographed by the locals, replete with the history of Goa. Mock battles are carried out with packets and cartridges filled with husk, bran, sawdust and the like.\nThe carnival marks the beginning of the forty day period of Lent. However the spirit of the festival has lured people from all religions to celebrate it with equal fervor. Today it is representative of Goan culture rather than being a religious event. This carnival epitomizes the merry making culture of Goa. The streets of Goa come alive with zealous and enthusiastic people. Nights turn colorful with floats, processions, colorful lights, music, dance and non-stop festivity. The lavish floats are the highlight of the festival. Floats depict popular lullabies and nursery rhymes. Cultural functions and competitions are held during the week.\nYou can hear cymbals, bagpipers or even Roman music. People dance to the tunes of old Roman numbers. The area often resembles scenes from fairy tales; fortune tellers, dancers, fireworks and more. The conclusion of the carnival is marked by the famous red and black dance. The largest celebration takes place in Panaji, the capital city of Goa.\nThe villages of Goa celebrate the carnival with a different spirit. Villagers sit around an oil lamp as they shake to the beat of the drums. They sing songs in praise of their ancestors.\nGoa carnival 2013\nThough the carnival is celebrated only for 3 days, the preparations begin much in advance. In 2013, Goa carnival is to be celebrated from 9th to 12th of February.

67	rural areas library access book donations	There is a significant lack of libraries in rural South African areas, with most rural areas having no public libraries. Where libraries do exist, they often lack adequate reading materials. To address this, some initiatives involve donating books to rural libraries and communities that lack resources. Budget constraints particularly affect rural libraries, which face greater difficulties in recruiting staff compared to urban libraries, further limiting access to resources.

I am proud to have produced leaders who will take reading culture to the greater heights.\nWhat challenges did you experience in life?\nI couldn’t register for the qualification I wanted at the university because there was no space. I grew up in a big family where I could not afford to fail because I had my siblings who were behind me and needed to be taken care of. There is a lack of reading culture among students at the University. Students read for academic purposes only and don’t read to improve their knowledge. It becomes difficult as a lecturer to encourage students who are not reading to participate in class.\nYou are an award winning Librarian, tell us how you became a Librarian and define a Librarian?\nI became a Liberian by accident. My dream was to enrol for Bachelor of science in Agriculture. I fell in love with the profession during the course of my studies because information is a necessity in many areas of our lives. a Librarian is the person responsible for the management of a library services by managing and organizing all library materials and the vast amount of information available for the benefits of the users.\nYou are Librarian of the Year, tell us about the award.\nI was nominated for the national award after winning the Liasa librarian of the year in Limpopo. The national competition was for all provincial winners. I was crowned the South African Librarian of the year in Durban and I am proud to have represented Limpopo.\nDo you think young people have access to libraries?\nThere is a lack of libraries in South African. Most of the rural areas do not have public libraries and where there are libraries, there is a lack of reading materials. The government need to build more libraries and Private sectors need to help in order to achieve this goal.\nAs a bibliophile, how do you promote reading culture?\nI donate books to young people who do not have access to libraries. I also donate books to rural libraries which the lack of resources in the province that I want to use to promote the culture of reading. There is also a lot of young people who are not reading because there are no reading materials. I will be going around the communities to donate books so people can read.\nYou are involved in farming, what do you produce?\nI have a livestock farming and I produce vegetables like cabbage, spinach, tomatoes, and butternuts. My childhood revolved around agriculture because my parents had livestock and few pieces of land where they would plant mealies.\nYou are a Leader in your own right, what keeps you motivated?\nI am from humble beginnings therefore my family background motivated me a lot. I want to work hard for my kids to have a better life and bright future. I take my responsibilities serious as a leader in academia responsible for the future of young people.\nWhat advice do you have for young people aspiring to be in Academia?\nYou need to read and read and read. The field of academia is for people who like reading.', 'The Impact of Library Budgets on Access to Information in the Digital Era\nLibraries play a crucial role in providing access to information in the digital era. However, in order to effectively serve their communities, libraries require adequate funding. Unfortunately, budget constraints and economic problems often hinder libraries’ ability to provide the necessary resources and programs for their users . This essay aims to explore the impact of library budgets on access to information in the digital era, specifically focusing on the limitations it imposes on digital resources and subscriptions , as well as the implications for physical collections .\nOne of the major challenges faced by libraries with limited budgets is the impact on their ability to subscribe to digital resources and databases. With shrinking budgets, libraries often struggle to allocate funds for subscriptions, which limits access to a wide range of electronic publications and databases . This directly affects researchers, students, and library users who rely on these resources for their academic and professional needs. Furthermore, inadequate budget allocations also hinder the acquisition of additional computers and equipment necessary for accessing and utilizing these digital resources effectively . Moreover, the migration to electronic journals and publications has brought about additional financial implications for libraries. While this transition offers benefits such as increased accessibility and reduced physical storage requirements, it also places a burden on library budgets . The cost of electronic subscriptions and licenses can be significantly higher than traditional print subscriptions, leading libraries to reallocate funds from other areas to cover these expenses. This further limits the budget available for other essential library services and programs . Additionally, the budget constraints faced by libraries have a direct impact on the acquisition of up-to-date and diverse digital resources. Libraries strive to provide a comprehensive collection that caters to the needs of their users, including access to databases, e-books, and online journals . However, limited budgets often force libraries to prioritize certain resources over others, resulting in gaps in their digital collection. This can hinder the research and learning potential of library users who rely on these resources for their academic pursuits .\nWhile the digital era has brought about a shift towards electronic resources, physical collections still hold value and importance in libraries. However, constrained budgets have implications for the acquisition and maintenance of physical materials . Libraries are faced with difficult decisions regarding the allocation of funds between electronic and physical resources, often resulting in a reduction in the acquisition of new print materials . Furthermore, limited budgets affect the overall fiscal management of collection development in libraries. With fewer funds available, libraries are forced to carefully select materials that align with their users’ needs and demands . This can result in a narrower range of physical materials available, potentially limiting the diversity and breadth of the library’s collection. Moreover, budget constraints may also impact the ability to replace outdated or damaged materials, further hindering the quality of the physical collection and the overall user experience . Despite the shift towards digital resources, there is still a need for physical collections in libraries. Many users prefer the tactile experience of reading a physical book, and certain materials may not be available in electronic formats.\nThe limited budgets faced by libraries have a significant impact on staffing and the ability to provide essential services to their users. Budget constraints often hinder the recruitment and retention of qualified library staff, which in turn affects the quality of services offered . According to a report, budget restraints were cited as the most common barrier to recruiting new staff . Rural libraries, in particular, reported having more difficulties in recruiting staff compared to urban libraries . This can result in understaffed libraries, leading to longer wait times for assistance and decreased access to resources for library users. Furthermore, limited budgets also affect the ability to invest in professional development and training for library staff. Professional development is crucial for librarians to stay updated with the latest trends in information management and to enhance their skills . However, inadequate funding restricts the opportunities for librarians and staff to attend workshops, conferences, and training programs . This can result in a lack of skills and knowledge needed to effectively serve library users in the digital era. Additionally, budget constraints have implications for the implementation of new programs and services in libraries. Libraries are constantly evolving to meet the changing needs of their communities. However, limited budgets often force libraries to scale back or eliminate certain programs and services . This can have a negative impact on the overall user experience and limit the library’s ability to provide innovative and inclusive services to its users. Moreover, the impact of budget constraints on staffing and services extends beyond the immediate implications. It can also lead to a shift in the role of librarians and staff. With limited resources, librarians may be required to take on additional responsibilities and tasks, such as IT support or marketing, in order to compensate for the lack of specialized staff . This can result in a dilution of the librarian’s primary role as an information professional and impede their ability to provide dedicated support and expertise to library users .\nDespite the challenges posed by limited budgets, there are strategies that libraries can implement to mitigate the impact on access to information. While long-term solutions require systemic changes and increased funding, there are immediate actions that can be undertaken to alleviate some of the constraints . Firstly, partnerships and collaborations with other organizations and institutions can help alleviate the burden on library budgets. For example, libraries can partner with schools, community centers, and other public spaces to provide access to digital resources and services . By leveraging existing infrastructure and resources, libraries can extend their reach and ensure that individuals have access to information outside of traditional library spaces. Additionally, libraries can explore partnerships with technology companies or internet service providers to secure funding or resources for expanding access to digital resources . Furthermore, libraries can seek external funding through grants and fundraising efforts to supplement their budgets. Initiatives such as the Internet for Libraries program, supported by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), provide opportunities for libraries to secure funding for technology infrastructure and digital resources . Grant programs like these not only provide financial support but also offer guidance and resources to help libraries navigate the grant application process and set fundraising targets . Advocacy is another crucial strategy for addressing budget constraints. Libraries can engage in advocacy efforts at the local, regional, and national levels to raise awareness about the importance of library funding and the impact it has on access to information . By collaborating with library associations and other advocacy groups, libraries can amplify their voices and advocate for policies that support increased funding for libraries . Additionally, libraries can foster relationships with local policymakers and elected officials to educate them about the value of libraries and their role in providing access to information . In conclusion, while budget constraints pose significant challenges for libraries in providing access to information in the digital era, there are strategies that can be implemented to mitigate their impact. Partnerships, external funding, and advocacy efforts are key approaches that libraries can employ to address these constraints and ensure that individuals have access to the resources and services they need. By taking immediate action and advocating for long-term systemic changes, libraries can continue to fulfill their crucial role as facilitators of equitable access to information and knowledge.\nIn the digital era, library budgets have a profound impact on access to information. Limited funds often restrict the acquisition of digital resources and subscriptions, resulting in barriers to research and learning . Additionally, budget constraints affect the development and maintenance of physical collections, narrowing the range of materials available to library users . Staffing and services also suffer due to budget limitations, leading to understaffed libraries and reduced program offerings . Furthermore, technology infrastructure, outreach, and community engagement are affected by budget constraints . However, despite these challenges, libraries can employ strategies such as partnerships, fundraising, and advocacy efforts to mitigate the impact of budget constraints . By taking immediate action and advocating for long-term systemic changes, libraries can continue to provide access to information and knowledge in the digital era.\n1.

68	Hi, I'm interested in both safety and cost aspects of industrial inspections - how do drones compare to traditional inspection methods in terms of cost savings, and what backup systems do they have in case of failure?	Regarding costs, drone inspections offer substantial savings compared to traditional methods - they're much cheaper than helicopter inspections (which cost up to $1,250 per rotor hour) and can reduce overall inspection costs by up to 50%. Some companies have achieved 66% cost reduction for well pad inspections. As for backup systems, drones can be equipped with failsafe algorithms that allow them to maintain stable flight even after losing a propeller. These algorithms can detect failures automatically, maintain control through continuous rotation, and execute controlled landings, making them suitable for safety-critical applications without requiring the additional weight and cost of redundant propellers.	['Quadrocopter failsafe algorithm: Recovery after propeller loss\nIn this video update, we show that a quadrocopter can be safely piloted by hand after a motor fails, without the aid of a motion capture system. This follows our previous video, where we demonstrated how a complete propeller failure can be automatically detected, and that a quadrocopter can still maintain stable flight despite the complete loss of a propeller.\nIn the earlier video, we relied on an external motion capture system to measure the quadrocopter’s position and orientation. By moving more of the algorithm onto the vehicle, the quadrocopter can now be piloted by hand after the failure. The algorithm is executed on the quadrocopter’s onboard micro-controller, and the only sensors required are the quadrocopter’s angular rate gyroscopes. We use blinking LEDs, mounted on the quadrocopter’s arms, to indicate a virtual yaw angle, so that the pilot can control the vehicle with the same remote control commands after the failure. As an alternative to the LED system, an onboard magnetometer could be used to track the vehicle’s yaw angle. Alternatively, by using more sophisticated algorithms, the system could be made to work using only the rate gyroscopes.\nORIGINAL STORY 02/12/2013\nThe video in this article shows an automatic failsafe algorithm that allows a quadrocopter to gracefully cope with the loss of a propeller. The propeller was mounted without a nut, and thus eventually vibrates itself loose. The failure is detected automatically by the system, after which the vehicle recovers and returns to its original position. The vehicle finally executes a controlled, soft landing, on a user’s command.\nThe failsafe controller uses only hardware that is readily available on a standard quadrocopter, and could thus be implemented as an algorithmic-only upgrade to existing systems. Until now, the only way a multicopter could survive the loss of a propeller (or motor), is by having redundancy (e.g. hexacopters, octocopters). However, this redundancy comes at the cost of additional structural weight, reducing the vehicle’s useful payload. Using this technology, (more efficient) quadrocopters can be used in safety critical applications, because they still have the ability to gracefully recover from a motor/propeller failure.\nThe key functionality of the failsafe controller is a novel algorithm that I developed as part of my doctoral research at the Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control at ETH Zurich. This new approach allows such a vehicle to remain in flight despite the loss of one, two, or even three propellers. Having lost one (or more) propellers, the vehicle enters a continuous rotation — we then control the direction of this axis of rotation, and the total thrust that the vehicle produces, allowing us to control the vehicle’s acceleration and thus position.\nEven if the vehicle can no longer produce sufficient thrust to support its own weight, this technology would still be useful: one could, for example, try to minimize the multicopter’s velocity when it hits the ground, or steer the multicopter away from dangerous situations such as water, or people on the ground.\nThis control approach can also be applied to design novel flying vehicles — we will be releasing some related results soon.\nThis technology is patent pending.\nIf you liked this article, you may also be interested in:\n- Three new quadrotor videos demonstrate agile control and the power of machine learning\n- Live at TED Global 2013: Tweets, photos and video for quadrotor fans\n- Behind the scenes at TED Global: Raffaello D’Andrea and team demo amazing quadrotor “athletes”\n- Quadrocopters learn from prior experience to improve slalom flying', 'Taking to the Skies: Launching an Oil and Gas Drone Inspection Program\nThe United States is home to more than 2.4 million miles of pipeline, making its network of energy pipelines the largest in the world. For an oil and gas firm, managing that amount of pipeline requires regular inspections that often come with inherent risks and significant costs.\nDriving trucks can be hazardous due to lease roads that develop potholes and washed-out areas thanks to inclement weather. While performing routine inspections and maintenance — such as walking a pipeline or checking well pad equipment — field workers frequently encounter hazards related to their sheer proximity to the equipment. The larger the stand-off distance a technician has while inspecting assets, the better, but other methods of inspection that increase the stand-off distance of crews carry additional cost. Manned aircraft, such as helicopters, can cost up to $1,250 USD per rotor hour and image quality is generally lackluster.\nDrones have proven to be an effective tool in improving oil and gas asset management due to their ability to collect quality images and geospatial data while keeping inspection crews away from hazardous equipment. Using this technology, leading oil and gas enterprises have replaced manned aircraft inspections with drone deployments, ultimately gaining unprecedented insight into the condition of critical assets.\nDrone inspection programs not only offer a more flexible and cost-effective way to manage assets, but also a data-intensive structure for tracking conditions over time. These programs can be deployed across the hydrocarbon supply chain. Oil and gas operators have found success across a variety of upstream, midstream and downstream applications with some achieving up to a 50 percent reduction in inspection costs. So, how do you go about deploying a drone-based inspection program that not only increases the overall efficiency of your asset management processes, but also makes conditions safer for your staff? Here are the five key steps to planning and launching a successful oil and gas drone inspection program.\nStep 1 Discovery\nThe launch of any new program should begin with identifying the problems you’re trying to solve and the resources available to you to address those problems. But, before you dive into researching the difference between the various commercial drones on the market, take the time to create a summary of what you want to get out of a drone program.\n- What are your key pain points?\n- What types of data are you looking to collect?\n- Who is going to collect the data — internal or external drone pilots?\n- How will the data be processed?\n- What analytics are required for this data to be useful in the field?\nThe question of who should collect data about your assets’ health is a big one and the answer depends on your requirements, timeline, budget and appetite for risk. There are three common strategies to consider, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks.\nIn an outsourced approach, a third-party provider will manage the drone deployment from end-to-end. This approach allows you to save on costs and offers great scalability options, however the drone operations will be separate from general maintenance procedures.\nAnother approach to consider is insourcing. This entails hiring your own drone operators and purchasing the required equipment yourself. The main benefit of this approach is that you can cross-train existing staff and integrate the drone program fully into existing operations. However, there are greater upfront costs associated with this model, and you’ll also be fully exposed to aerospace regulatory and safety risks.\nThe third option for launching a drone program is to take a hybrid approach. Like the name suggests, this approach incorporates aspects of both outsourced and insourced models. A hybrid strategy involves establishing a staff of drone operators and augmenting that staff with third-party providers when needed. Drawbacks to this approach include higher up-front costs, similar to those associated with insourced programs, and increased coordination requirements between internal and third-party teams.\nWhether you decide to go it alone or bring in a third party (or a little of both), you’ll need to define a comprehensive drone strategy. With a complete strategy in place, you can identify cost centers and forecast your return on investment, as well as determine existing processes that need to be updated or integrated into the new drone program. It’s also important to consider current operations and safety protocols as they may impact future drone operations.\nWith a thoughtfully designed program based on these details, you’ll be taking to the skies in no time.\nStep 2 Waivers and Certifications\nSecuring the correct certifications and waivers is essential to a successful drone program. Penalties for flying a commercial drone without a license, or hiring a non-licensed drone pilot, can result in the suspension or revocation of existing licenses, denial of an application for a pilot’s license and significant civil penalties. Although rare, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) may also impose criminal sanctions for unlicensed or illegal drone operations.\nIf you decide to proceed with launching an insourced drone inspection program, you will need to confirm that whoever will be operating your drones is fully certified and that all necessary waivers are secured. All commercial drone pilots must be certified under the FAA’s Small Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Rule (Part 107). This certificate demonstrates that the pilot understands the regulations, operating requirements and procedures for safely flying drones. Any drone pilot who is not Part 107-certified is not authorized to fly drones for any commercial purpose.\nWhile Part 107 offers a general license for commercial drone operations, some types of missions aren’t permitted. For instance, in order to fly beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) to capture more area in a single deployment, flying drones over people, flying in restricted areas of airspace and nighttime operation requires a waiver from the FAA.\nIf you decided to adopt an outsourced drone program, these certification and waiver requirements will be a non-issue, as any reputable drone service provider only employs credentialed drone operators and flight planners.\nStep 3 Equipment\nNow that you have your Part 107-certified drone operator and all the necessary waivers to fly drones commercially for your business, it’s time to look at the technology itself.\nA safe and productive flight is dependent on good hardware, but oil fields and pipelines present a challenging environment for any aircraft as they are often in windy, wet or rugged terrain. Drone operators need hardware that’s purpose-built for these challenging environments. In order to remain agile in high-wind operations, drones must be lightweight and robust. They also need to include guards for the propellers to mitigate damage or personal injury (this also allows for deployments in close quarters).\nHowever, one of the most important aspects of using drones for aerial inspections is the addition of a quality, cutting-edge sensor. By adding the correct sensor to your hardware, your drone operator can balance advanced data fidelity while ensuring the safety of your drone mission.\nMultiple types of data are required in order to effectively manage oil and gas assets. Drone operators working with oil and gas firms today typically deploy a range of sensors including thermal, infrared and LiDAR sensors as well as methane detection lasers and optical gas indicators (OGI). In short, the higher the quality of the sensor payload, the higher the quality of the data.\nLeading-edge drone software allows operators to deliver enhanced data analytics from their inspections, rather than simply delivering imagery.\nBy using software that provides increased analytical outputs, operators can create 2D and 3D orthomosaics that offer a more detailed view of damage, such as cracks or erosion, without having to halt production. Advanced flight software also allows operators to automate flights, review surveys offline and process and analyze data to better optimize the management of assets and infrastructure.\nStep 4 Safety and Insurance\nWhile pilots licensed under Part 107 have already demonstrated that they have the proper certifications for commercial drone activities, operating in the oil and gas industry requires that you take additional safety precautions. While drone crashes that result in damage or injury are rare, accidents can still occur. Independent drone service providers should carry their own hull and liability insurance, both for the equipment and for bodily injury, but if you’re planning to launch a fully-fledged drone inspection program, you should consider carrying additional, internal policies. It’s also recommended that oil and gas firms develop a dedicated safety manual for drone operations that’s compliant with OSHA and consistent with existing safety protocols.\nBeyond the quality of the drones and flight software, the skills of your drone operators are critical to the safety and effectiveness of your drone-based inspections. The pilot in command must understand your objectives and follow rigorous procedures, regardless of whether they’re your own staff or a third-party drone service provider. Pilots should understand the assets and area of interest to be inspected and should complete training specific to the oil and gas environment. They should also follow flight standards, maintain safety management systems and protect mission data. These are just a few of the requirements you should demand of your pilots in order to ensure safe and secure operations.\nStep 5 Data Management\nAs discussed in the equipment section, drones are more than just flying cameras. When equipped with the right sensors, multiple high-resolution cameras and cutting-edge software, the data that can be collected and delivered via drones is unparalleled in both quantity and quality. As such, having a strategy in place for data analysis and delivery is crucial to getting the most out of your drone investment.\nSimilar to the approach you took to designing your drone program, you’ll need to evaluate if you want to keep the data analysis process in-house or outsource it to a third party. Consider the security and privacy requirements for your organization and ensure that you have complete control over the data value chain for your drone program. Even if you decide on an outsourced approach, having a comprehensive data management strategy will ensure that you’re converting data into actionable insights.\nCongratulations on launching your drone inspection program. If you followed these steps, found the right partners and did your due diligence, you should soon see the fruits of your labor. The cost savings resulting from drone inspection programs are significant: one oil and gas firm determined that the use of drones reduced inspection costs by approximately 66%, from $80–$90 per well pad from traditional inspection methodology to $45–$60 per well pad.\nBy removing the necessity of manual inspections, oil and gas companies can use technicians to focus on either higher value-added inspections or maintenance alone. The real economic benefit isn’t in the cost reduction or an increase in the number of well pads you can inspect in a day — it’s in having your technicians available to focus on uptime and drive or maintain overall revenue. If you can make that happen, you can consider your drone inspection program a success.\ndrones, July August 2019 Print Issue, pipeline inspection, PrecisionHawk, UAV, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)\nNehemiah Katz is vice president of oil and gas operations at PrecisionHawk, leading the company’s energy consulting efforts.

69	What's the main difference between how Mark Dailey and the Weather Guys helped their local communities understand important topics?	Mark Dailey and the Weather Guys had different approaches to community service. Mark Dailey helped his community as a founding member of Toronto Crime Stoppers and by raising awareness about health issues, particularly by chronicling his own battle with cancer on television and encouraging men to be proactive about health issues. The Weather Guys (Professors Steve Ackerman and Jonathan Martin) helped their community understand weather and climate topics through their radio show and newspaper column, making science more accessible to the general public and helping people view scientists as regular people while maintaining a connection between the public and university scholarship.	"['June Monthly Faculty Highlight- Jonathan MartinJune 28, 2019\nWhile awards and appointments attract much of the news attention, the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences department has a large variety of work going on behind the scenes. As part of a new Monthly Highlights series, the AOS news page will be featuring different faculty and student projects once a month. These highlights will be showcasing published papers, community outreach events, field campaigns, Q&As on climate change and weather phenomenon, and other topics as they come up.\nOn the last Monday of every month, Professors Steve Ackerman and Jonathan Martin go on air to and answer questions and discuss recent weather phenomenon. The Weather Guys have covered everything from strangely shaped clouds to discussing how weather technology has changed over time. Aside from their monthly radio appearances, the Weather Guys post weekly articles to their blog and the Wisconsin State Journal.\nThe Weather Guys blog can be found here.\nWhere did the idea of the Weather Guys come from?\nSometime in the late part of the spring semester in 1998 the SSEC publicist at the time, Ms. Terri Gregory, made a call to WHA Radio and suggested that Steve and I might be part of an interesting radio show concerning weather and climate issues. Weather has always been an important issue in our state and, at the time, the climate crisis was really beginning to enter the public consciousness as well. The timing was right and we had our first show in July 1998. The column in the Wisconsin State Journal came along some years later (I think we started that in 2007 or 2008).\nHow do you and Professor Steve Ackerman decide on a topic for the week?\nWe most often consider either recent weather, perhaps weather in history as a direct or indirect player, or we very occasionally will comment on some public policy debate that involves understanding or consideration of weather or climate. Sometimes we think of a topic based on what either of us is currently working on in research or talking about in class. We try to make sure we don’t repeat a topic too frequently or too close to our last comment on the same issue. The newspaper editors help us a lot with that.\nWhat kinds of research goes into each of the segments? How long does each one take to produce?\nDepending on the topic for a given week, a considerable amount of research can go into it. Sometimes when we are commenting on whether or not a particular week, month or season has been abnormal in some regard, it will take a couple of hours to track down the data that makes the case. After securing the data, the writing commences so in such cases it might be approaching 3 hours of total work. This is probably the extreme so I would guess that the average amount of time to put 250 words together on an interesting meteorological topic takes us about 1 to 2 hours.\nWhat kinds of topics do you enjoy answering?\nWe enjoy answering any topic because most weeks we have to make up our own question and it can get tiring! I would estimate that only 5% of our columns have been directly prompted by a question from the readers. Despite this grim statistic, alot of people do tell us that they are regular readers of our short column.\nWhat has been one of the strangest asks you have received?\nI don’t have a very good memory about this kind of thing. I do recall that one time a reader was interested in knowing if there really is anything to the old local sense that there is a snowstorm that coincides with the Boys State Basketball Championship in March. The answer is that it occurs about half the time - nowhere near as prevalent as local legend might have you believe.\nWhat do you think has been the most important impact of the Weather Guys?\nI think there are two really important services provided by the show. The first is perhaps the most obvious - we talk about a topic that a lot of people have at least a casual interest in discussing, the weather. Sometimes a weather phenomenon that one witnesses stays in one’s mind for a very long time in search of explanation or a chance to talk excitedly about it. The show provides one outlet for that energy and the column perhaps helps to sustain a level of interest in the weather among the general population that really sets our science apart from nearly all other physical sciences. People make daily contact with the weather in very visceral ways and the show and column engage that conversation.\nThe second important benefit of the show is that it may help people to view science, and scientists, in a more human way than they might otherwise. Steve and I very clearly enjoy what we do professionally but I think we also come across as people with other active interests and that helps us to demonstrate that scientists are just regular people with a particular interest in the physical world. I think it also allows our fellow Wisconsinites to make a weekly contact with some of the scholarship that is going on at this fantastic university. In an era when a substantial amount of energy has been spent demonizing intellectuals and universities, we get a chance to fight back against that distressing effort and remind people, at least in a small way, that the University of Wisconsin-Madison is a miracle worth preserving and nurturing.\nIf you have any suggestions for a Monthly Highlight, please send an email to firstname.lastname@example.org.', 'Rock Radio Heaven (D)\nBorn: August 1, 1953, Youngstown, Ohio\nDied: December 6, 2010, Toronto\nAlso known as: Nicknamed ""The Voice,"" Full name was Mark Edward Dailey\nStations: WNIO, WYTV Youngstown, Ohio; CKLW, CILQ (Q-107), CHUM, CITY-TV Toronto\nNotes: Best known for his work as anchor, reporter, and image voice of CITY-TV, Dailey got his start in radio at the age of 16 at WNIO.

70	What preparation steps ensure a long-lasting concrete foundation?	To ensure a long-lasting concrete foundation, proper site preparation is essential: level the ground and remove clay/loam soil to allow 6-8 inches of fill, install 1/2-inch rebar for strength, establish square and level forms, and implement effective water management including damp-proofing and proper drainage to prevent foundation damage from wet-dry cycles.	"['Concrete types and putting a concrete piece foundation can be daunting. Your heart races due to the fact that you understand that any mistake, even a kid, can quickly turn your piece into a huge mess, a mistake literally cast in stone.\nIn this article, we\'ll stroll you through the slab-pouring procedure so you get it right the very first time. We\'ll pay particular attention to the hard parts where you\'re most likely to goof, like the best ways to make concrete.\nIf you have not worked with concrete, begin with a small sidewalk or garden shed floor before trying a garage-size piece foundation like this. In addition to standard woodworking tools, you\'ll need a number of special tools to complete large concrete forms or a slab (see the Tool List below).\nThe bulk of the work for a new piece is in the excavation and type building. If you need to level a sloped site or generate a great deal of fill, hire an excavator for a day to assist prepare the site Then figure on spending a day developing the kinds and another pouring the slab\nIn our location, employing a concrete specialist to pour a 16 x 20-ft. slab like this one would cost $3,000 to $4,000. The quantity of loan you\'ll save money on a concrete slab expense by doing the work yourself depends mainly on whether you have to hire an excavator. You\'ll conserve 30 to 50 percent on concrete piece expense by doing your own work.\nStep 1: Prepare the site for the concrete slab in Dallas TX\nBefore you get going, contact your local building department to see whether an authorization is needed and how close to the lot lines you can build. You\'ll determine from the lot line to position the piece parallel to it Drive 4 stakes to approximately suggest the corners of the new slab. With the approximate size and place significant, utilize a line level and string or home builder\'s level to see just how much the ground slopes. Flattening a sloped site implies moving tons of soil. You can develop the low side as we did, or dig the high side into the slope and include a low keeping wall to keep back the soil.\nYour concrete slab will last longer, with less splitting and movement, if it\'s built on solid, well-drained soil. If you have clay or loam soil, you must remove enough to enable a 6- to 8-in.\nIf you need to get rid of more than a few inches of dirt, consider renting a skid loader or hiring an excavator. An excavator can also help you get rid of excess soil.\nKeep in mind: Prior to you do any digging, call 811 or visit call811.com to organize to have your local utilities locate and mark buried pipes and wires.\nStep 2: Construct strong, level kinds for a perfect piece around Dallas\nStart by selecting straight kind boards. Cut the two side kind boards 3 in. You\'ll nail the end boards between the side boards to develop the right size form.\nShow how to develop the forms. Step from the lot line to place the first side and level it at the preferred height. For speed and precision, use a home builder\'s level, a transit or a laser level to set the height of the types.\nBrace the types to make sure straight sides Newly put concrete can push type boards outside, leaving your slab with a curved edge that\'s practically impossible to fix. Place 2 × 4 stakes and 2 × 4 kickers every 2 ft. along the kind boards for support.\nStretch a strong string (mason\'s line) along the leading edge of the type board. As you set the braces, make sure the kind board lines up with the string. Change the braces to keep the form board directly.\nReveals measuring diagonally to set the 2nd form board completely square with the. (In our case, this is 15 ft.) Then mark a numerous of 4 ft. on the adjacent side (20 ft. for our slab). Adjust the position of the unbraced type board till the diagonal measurement is a multiple of 5 (25 ft. in this case).\nSquaring the second type board is most convenient if you prop it level on a stack of 2x4s and move it back and forth till the diagonal measurement is correct. Drive a stake behind the end of the type board and nail through the stake into the type. Complete the second side by leveling and bracing the form board.\nSet the third type board parallel to the first one. Leave the fourth side off until you have actually taken and tamped the fill.\nPointer: Leveling the forms is easier if you leave one end of the kind board a little high when you nail it to the stake. Then adjust the height by tapping the stake on the luxury with a maul up until the board is perfectly level.\nAction 3: Build up the base and pack it.\nConcrete needs support for extra strength and crack resistance. It\'s well worth the small extra cost and labor to install 1/2-in. rebar (steel enhancing bar). You\'ll discover rebar at home centers and at providers of concrete and masonry products (in 20-ft. lengths). You\'ll also require a bundle of tie wires and a tie-wire twisting tool to link the rebar.\nCut and bend pieces of rebar to form the boundary strengthening. Wire the border rebar to rebar stakes for assistance. You\'ll pull the grid up into the center of the concrete as you pour the slab.\nIf you\'ve never poured a large slab or if the weather is hot and dry, that makes concrete harden quickly, divide this slab down the middle and fill the halves on different days to lower the quantity of concrete you\'ll need to end up at one time. Get rid of the divider prior browse this site to putting the second half.\nMark the position of the door openings on the concrete types. Mark the area of the anchor bolts on the kinds. Location marks for anchor bolts 6 in. from each side of doors, 12 in. from corners and 6 ft. apart around the boundary.\nStep 5: In Dallas Fort Worth Prepare for the concrete truck\nPouring concrete is fast-paced work. To decrease tension and avoid mistakes, make certain whatever is all set before the truck arrives.\nTriple-check your concrete forms to make sure they\'re square, level, straight and well braced. For large pieces, it\'s best if the truck can back up to the concrete forms. If the projection calls for rain, reschedule the concrete delivery to a dry day.\nTo figure the volume of concrete needed, multiply the length by the width by the depth (in feet) to arrive at the number of cubic feet. Remember to represent the trenched border. Divide the overall by 27 and include 5 percent to determine the number of backyards of concrete you\'ll need. Our slab required 7 lawns. Call the prepared mix business at least a day ahead of time and describe your project. The majority of dispatchers are quite valuable and can suggest the very best mix. For find this a big slab like ours that may have occasional car traffic, we purchased a 3,500-lb. combine with 5 percent air entrainment. The air entrainment traps tiny bubbles that help concrete stand up to freezing temperature levels.\nStep 6: Pour and flatten the concrete to form a perfect concrete slab\nBe prepared to hustle when the truck arrives. Start by positioning concrete in the concrete types farthest from the truck. Usage wheelbarrows where essential.\nConcrete is too heavy to shovel or press more than a few feet. Place the concrete close to its last area and roughly level it with a rake. As soon as the concrete is positioned in the concrete forms, start striking it off even with the top of the type boards with a straight, smooth 2 × 4 screed board.\nThe technique to easy screeding is to have an assistant with a rake moving the concrete in front of the screed board. You desire enough concrete to fill all voids, however not a lot that it\'s challenging to pull the board. About 1/2 to 1 in. deep in front of the screed board has to do with right. It\'s better to make several passes with the screed board, moving a little concrete each time, than to attempt to pull a great deal of concrete simultaneously.\nStart bull-floating the concrete as soon as possible after screeding. The goal is to get rid of marks left by screeding and fill in low spots to produce a flat, level surface. Bull-floating likewise forces bigger aggregate below the surface area. Keep the leading edge of the float just a little above the surface by raising or lowering the float handle. If the float angle is too high, you\'ll plow the wet concrete and create low spots. 3 or 4 passes with the bull float is generally adequate. Too much drifting can weaken the surface by preparing excessive water and cement.\nAction 7: Float and trowel for a smooth finish in Dallas\nAfter you smooth the slab with the bull float, water will ""bleed"" out of the concrete and rest on the surface area. Wait for the water to vanish and for the piece to solidify slightly before you resume completing. When the piece is firm enough to withstand an imprint from your thumb, start hand-floating. On cool days, you might have to wait an hour or two to start floating and shoveling. On hot, dry days, you have to hustle.\nYou can edge the piece prior to it gets firm given that you do not need to kneel on the piece. If the edger sinks in and leaves a track that\'s more than 1/8 in. deep, wait on the slab to harden slightly before proceeding.\nYou\'ll have to wait until the concrete can support your weight to start grooving the piece. Cut 2-ft. squares of 1-1/2- in.-thick foam insulation for usage as kneeling boards. The kneeling board disperses your weight, permitting you to obtain an earlier start.\nGrooving produces a weakened area in the concrete that enables the unavoidable shrinking cracking to happen at the groove instead of at some random area. Cut grooves about every 10 ft. in large pieces.\nWhen you\'re done grooving, smooth the concrete with a magnesium float. You might have to bear down on the float if the concrete is starting to harden.\nFor a smoother, denser surface, follow the magnesium float with a steel trowel. Troweling is one of the trickier actions in concrete finishing. For a really smooth surface, repeat the shoveling step two or 3 times, letting the concrete harden a bit in between each pass.\nKeep concrete damp after it\'s put so it treatments gradually and establishes maximum strength. The simplest method to make sure appropriate curing is to spray the ended up concrete with curing compound. Treating compound is available at home centers. Follow the directions on the label. Use a regular garden sprayer to use the compound. You can lay plastic over the concrete rather, although this my company can cause discoloration of the surface area.\nLet the ended up piece harden over night before you carefully get rid of the kind boards. Pull the duplex nails from the corners and kickers and pry up on the stakes with a shovel to loosen up and remove the kinds. Considering that the concrete surface area will be soft and simple to chip or scratch, wait for a day or two before building on the slab.', 'If there’s one thing you don’t want to hear as a homeowner, it’s that you have problems with your foundation. Some foundation issues are minor and easily fixable yourself, while others are more complex and require a team to fix your slab.\nThe good news is that if caught early, most foundations can be fixed and brought back to their original condition—or better. We’ve compiled a list of the top slab foundation repair methods so you can know what route to take when problems arise.\nPolyurethane foam jacking is one of the most effective ways to repair problems in your sinking or settling foundation. Technicians create a checkerboard pattern over the problem area, then drill holes into your slab, injecting high-density foam under the foundation. Seconds after injection, the foam expands, raising the concrete and filling in empty spots.\nThis method is typically very cost effective, and it’s quick, making it a favorite of contractors. However, you’ll want to check your plumbing for leaks. Due to the expanding nature of the foam, it can enter into holes in your pipes, solidify inside, and cause serious damage to your already compromised plumbing.\nMasonry Patches and Sealants\nThis method of repair is ideal if you have cracks in your foundation due to shrinkage. Shrinking foundations are not a cause for alarm. Cracks associated with shrinkage usually occur in the corners of your foundations. Though they aren’t severe structural issues, they do need to be remedied before further damage occurs.\nUsually, patches and sealants are found in the form of hydraulic cement. Similar to mortar, it sets extremely fast and hardens after mixed, stopping water and leaks in your foundation.\nAn epoxy sealant is similar to a hydraulic cement sealant, but it goes a few steps further. You opt for epoxy resins when you have more severe foundational cracking. Epoxy can be in either pourable or injectable form, allowing you to choose the method of application that works best for your specific situation.\nIf your foundation is sinking, there’s a chance that the concrete was poured on dirt that wasn’t compacted correctly before construction. While that’s unfortunate for a homeowner, it can be remedied with slabjacking, also known as mudjacking.\nIn slabjacking, your contractor drills holes into your slab. They then fill those holes with a grout-like mixture which then raises the concrete to the desired height. This method of foundation repair only takes a few hours, can be done in almost any weather, there’s no disruption to your landscaping, and nothing needs to be moved off the concrete.\nThere are many different types of piers and pilings that are used for foundation repairs. These methods are more invasive than those mentioned above, but they also provide more long-term solutions and do a better job of restoring your foundation than other options on the table. Below are a few pier and piling approaches to address your foundation issues.\nSteel piers are fantastic solutions for permanent foundation repair. They’re incredibly strong and can be drilled 100 feet into the ground, offering long-lasting and trustworthy stability that you’d be hard-pressed finding anywhere else. Steel piers can—and should—be driven down into the bedrock. This prevents any shifting that might occur in soils closer to the surface of the ground.\nAs you can gather from their name, helical piers are steel piers with spiral-shaped heads that are screwed into the ground. These piers are a good option when the soil beneath your foundation is difficult to penetrate with conventional piers and pilings. They are spaced strategically under your slab and are bored into the earth until they’re stable, providing a place for your foundation to rest.\nIf you have a lighter foundation that needs attention, spot piers are a perfect choice. A spot pier is a shallow hole dug beneath your foundation and filled with concrete. This option is ideal for porches, sheds, or any other structure that has a smaller, and therefore lighter, foundational load.\nThis method of foundation repair might seem a little out of place on this list, but water management is crucial to both foundation repair and prevention of further problems. Next to soil stabilization, poor or nonexistent water management is the leading cause of foundation problems among homeowners.\nYour slab foundation is like a sponge. And when your slab gets wet, then dry, then wet, it compromises the integrity of your foundation, causing breakage, shifting, and other issues that will cost you a lot of time and money. For this reason, it’s crucial that you implement an effective water management plan for your building. This includes damp-proofing, water pumps, and insulation in crawl spaces, to name a few practices.\nProper water management techniques are not only necessary once you’ve repaired a broken foundation, but they’re crucial for preventing foundation damage in the first place.\nYou might be experiencing foundation issues for a number of reasons. When your slab is on the line, you want to address these issues quickly and with the best method for your situation—and budget. After reviewing the methods above, you can see the different ways contractors approach foundation repair. Finding a contractor that knows the method that will work best for your foundation is essential for slab repairs that will stand the test of time.']"	['<urn:uuid:9d9b3d78-9803-40d4-a798-e0651491ce3b>', '<urn:uuid:1ef798ef-4794-4a85-a9f4-749efbe83a2b>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	8	51	2826
71	What are the key differences between jump rings and head pins when it comes to their roles and applications in jewelry construction?	Jump rings and head pins serve very different purposes in jewelry making. Jump rings are small bands, typically metal circles with an opening that allows connecting other rings through the gap, and can be closed using chain nose pliers. They are primarily used for connecting components together. Head pins, on the other hand, have a small head on one end that prevents beads from slipping off and are mainly used for making earrings and attaching dangling beads to bracelet and necklace designs. They come in different lengths and wire thicknesses, with 24 gauge being common as it fits through most bead holes. If a head pin's head is too small for larger bead holes, a small decorative bead can be added first to prevent other beads from falling off.	"['So, you’re really excited about making chain mail, but perhaps you’re not too keen on using jump rings to do it.\nMaybe you have always marched to the beat of a different drum. Perhaps the cost of jump rings just isn’t feasible right now.\nMaybe you’re looking for something that won’t be quite as heavy or are looking for something with more strength.\nWhatever your reason is, one thing’s for sure. You need an alternative to jump rings.\nWhat can I use besides jump rings to make chain mail? In place of jump rings, split rings are often used to create chain mail items like a full armor suit or jewelry. Soda can tabs can be used to make costumes, decorations, and jewelry. Rubber rings can be used in place of solid rings in many jewelry applications.\nKnowing that you have several options when it comes to substituting jump rings may inspire you to think outside the box and test your weaving skills and creativity.\nAfter all, isn’t that what drew you to chain mail in the first place?\nUsing Split Rings for Chain Mail\nMany people new to chain mail assume that jump rings and split rings are the same thing. They are, however, completely different.\nJump rings are small bands, typically metal, used in a wide variety of jewelry and chain mail applications.\nThey can be purchased in many different diameters and gauges for use with a variety of crafts.\nUsually, they’re formed into an open circle with the two ends meeting. Although other shapes, such as ovals, hearts, and diamonds, can be found, circles are by far the most common.\nThe opening of the jump ring allows you to connect other rings through the gap. Once all connections are complete, the ring can easily be closed using chain nose pliers.\nSplit rings, on the other hand, are compressed metal spirals. When you thread a new key onto your key ring, you are likely using a split ring.\nBecause of the thickness of split rings and how tightly they’re wound, they are noted for their strength when used in certain chain mail projects.\nThe tight coils are ideal for holding keys securely, attaching tags to your dog’s collar, and connecting lures to fishing tackle.\nTo attach an object or another split ring, one end of the coil must be pried open and the item guided through the double loop all the way until it passes over the other end of the spiral.\nAt this point, the item is fully secured by the split ring and is very unlikely to work its way free.\nFor this reason, split rings are often used when constructing certain chain mail pieces, such as a hauberk (a knee-length shirt) or a piece of jewelry that contains heavy gemstones or other adornments.\nBest Chain Mail Applications for Split Rings\nIf you have the time, patience, and interest, you can construct an entire suit of mail armor using only split rings.\nThe finished piece will be strong and durable, capable of standing up to a fair amount of abuse.\nMost weavers today, however, prefer to make jewelry items.\nKeep in mind that split rings are bulkier than jump rings and may not work with every chain mail weave, especially the dense patterns.\nHowever, simple, loose weaves, like the European 4-in-1, would definitely work.\nAnother thing to consider when using split rings for jewelry is weight. Due to their size, split rings are naturally heavier than jump rings.\nSome pieces of jewelry, like earrings, might be very uncomfortable to wear when constructed solely of split rings.\nAlso know that the smaller the rings are, the more strength is compromised and the more rings will be needed to complete the project.\nThus, you’ll be looking at an increased work time while sacrificing the key advantages. However, the weakness of smaller rings could be beneficial in certain instances.\nIf, for example, a necklace becomes caught on an object, choking and/or injury could result if the necklace doesn’t break under pressure.\nYou’ll need to decide for yourself what qualities you most desire in your finished jewelry.\nThat being said, split rings are ideal for making jewelry with basic, loose weaves, provided the rings aren’t too small.\nSplit rings are also perfect for attaching heavy, decorative elements to jewelry, such as gemstones, pendants, and stone beads.\nIf you’d like to give split rings a try, I found finished iron split rings by Lanbeide on Amazon.\nThis pack comes with 900 silver rings, though gold is also available, in sizes ranging from 4 to 10 millimeters in diameter.\n- Strength, durability, and security.\n- Can be used to make many weaves.\n- Great for securing heavy adornments in jewelry.\n- Multiple units can be made before joining them together to save time.\n- Will rarely need repairs.\n- Time involved is greatly increased.\n- May detract from the overall design of jewelry.\n- Jewelry items made almost exclusively of split rings won’t break away to prevent injury if snagging occurs.\n- Exposed ends may irritate skin, snag clothing or hair, and be uncomfortable to wear.\nUsing Soda Can Tabs for Chain Mail\nBelieve it or not, those little tabs on the tops of soda cans and other canned beverages you use to pop open the drink can be used to make chain mail.\nOnce they’ve been properly prepared, you can use them just as you would jump rings.\nThere are plenty of easy tutorials that will show you exactly how to prepare and use the tabs.\nThe one by Craftsuprint is well illustrated and very straightforward, but the basics are as follows:\n- Collect tabs.\n- Bend the tiny tab that was attached to the can backwards until it lies flush.\n- Using wire cutters, make one cut on the opposite end, right in the middle.\n- Hold the end with the now-flush tab in a pair of pliers or a manual staple remover, and bend the tab slightly.\n- Repeat for all tabs.\nIf you are remotely interested in using these tabs, start collecting them now, because you’ll need quite a few of them, even for small projects.\nEnlist the help of your friends and family too.\nBest Chain Mail Applications for Soda Can Tabs\nA basic 4-in-1 weave is best for soda tab chain mail, so to some extent, your options are rather limited in terms of what you can make.\nSome people like to make costumes for cosplay events, Renaissance fairs, or school plays because of the very low expense involved.\nOther people use the soda tabs to make unique wall hangings or pretty mobiles. Some jewelry, such as necklaces or bracelets, can be made in this fashion as well.\nJust be sure that the tiny tabs are all completely flush before constructing to avoid scratches.\n- Costs little to nothing.\n- Can be used to make shirts and other garments and some jewelry.\n- Many tabs must be collected.\n- Each tab must be prepared individually.\n- Not very secure – tabs can slip off if the gap isn’t closed fully.\n- Tabs often flip over, especially on the ends.\nUsing Rubber Rings for Chain Mail\nYou may not have ever considered using a material other than metal for making chain mail, but using rubber rings in certain chain mail creations can be advantageous.\nThey are super lightweight and provide a “give” that is not found in metal rings.\nRubber rings suitable for chain mail can be rather hard to find, but Fire Mountain Gems does carry them by the name of Oh! Rings.\nThey are available in many colors and a variety of sizes.\nBest Chain Mail Applications for Rubber Rings\nWhile rubber rings won’t be practical for many forms of chain mail, you can incorporate them into many jewelry creations such as necklaces, bracelets, and earrings.\nThey do, however, only come in a closed version, so take that into account when planning your design.\n- Easy to work with.\n- Wide variety of colors and sizes.\n- Can’t be used in designs that call for strength.\n- Only available in solid rings.\n- Should only be used for jewelry and other decorative items.\nLast update on 2021-09-25 at 22:19 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API', ""Jewelry Findings & Jewelry Components\nFinding is the word used to describe all the components that you can use in making your jewelry designs. Findings are usually functional in nature, but they can also be focal design elements such as fancy, decorative bead caps or a unique clasp that is a major part of your design. Findings include metal components such as head pins, eye pins, clasps, bead tips, bead caps, ear wires, hoops, jump and split rings, and more. There are more unique findings being produced all the time, and it is fun to shop at your favorite bead store to get fresh design ideas.\nHere are some common findings, but check your bead or craft store, or on-line supplier for\neven more findings! Also, be sure to check the Jewelry\nSupply page for more information and a great selection of supplies!\nHeadpins are a staple in making earrings and in attaching dangling beads to bracelet and necklace designs, so make sure you always have plenty of these in stock.\nA head pin has a small head on one end that prevents the beads from slipping off. Head pins come in different lengths and wire thickness (also known as gauge). Use longer headpins if you are planning to use large beads or several beads to make up your\ndesign--you want to leave enough wire at the top to form a loop so you can attach it. TIP: The smaller the gauge number, the wider (fatter) the wire. I typically use 24 gauge headpins because the wire is thin enough to fit through most bead holes. If the head on the pin is too small for the larger diameter bead holes, and your bead slips off, just attach a small decorative bead on the end first, then slide your bead into place and it will rest on the smaller bead without falling off. Order head pins in bulk to save money! Need Head Pins? Click here to find some right now!\nThese are used the same way as head pins, but instead of a head they have a small loop on the end. You can attach dangles to the looped end.\nTIP: You can also make your own eye pins simply by using straight sterling silver or gold-filled wire. Just cut a length of wire and create a loop at one end with your\npliers--and viola, instant eye pins! Need Eye Pins? Click here to find some right now!\nJump rings come in several sizes, and they come soldered\nshut (solid ring), or with an opening (split). Choose the one that works best for your design.\nTIP: To open a jump ring, do not spread and pull the ends away from each other. This will warp the circular shape and you will find it difficult to reshape once you pull it apart this way. Instead, hold each side with a pair of pliers, and push each end away from the other sideways. This will create a small gap between the ends, but will retain the circular shape of the ring. Just push the two ends back towards each other with pliers to close the gap. Need Jump Rings? Click here to find some right now!\nSplit rings look like miniature key rings. They have overlapping double wires, which you can pry apart to slide things onto. They are stronger than open jump rings because you\ncan't pull the ends open, so they are useful in attaching charms and other dangles to your design. Need Split Rings? Click here to find some right now!\nTIP: If you plan to use a lot of split rings, it is a good idea to invest in a pair of split ring pliers. These will\nhold open the double wires of the ring making it easier for you to attach something. Otherwise, just like with an irritating key ring, you could find yourself splitting your fingernails and getting very aggravated!\nClasps come in all shapes and sizes. Clasps are used to close necklace and bracelet designs. However, there are many highly decorative clasps that can also be used as an important design element. Some clasps are adorned with crystals, or inlaid gemstones. You can even make your own clasps by wrapping wire, or creating one-of-a-kind clasps with precious metal clay, or art clay. Be creative! Need Clasps? Click here to find some right now!\nThe toggle bar fits through the toggle ring to close the clasp. These come in many wonderful shapes, sizes, and styles. While a little more expensive than some of the other clasp styles, they are very popular and are often used as a key design element in bracelets or necklaces. You can close your necklace in the back, or leave the toggle clasp in the front if it is pretty. Need Toggle Clasps? Click here to find some right now!\nThese are wonderfully easy to put on and\noff--two strong magnets are used to close the clasp. Magnetic clasps are usually smooth and streamlined in design, but they also now come in more decorative designs like the one below. Due to ease of use, they are great for people with arthritis. Need Toggle Clasps? Click here to find some right now!\nYou've probably all seen and used the spring ring at some point. This is a\ncircular clasp with a little lever that you slide back to open and close the clasp. These are typically inexpensive, yet secure claps. Need\nClasps? Click here to find some right now!\nMuch like the spring ring, you slide the lever back to open and close the clasp. These come in attractive elongated shapes, and some people find them easier to work than the rounder spring ring. Need Lobster Claw Clasps? Click here to find some right now!\nThese come in a couple of styles, and you can even make your own with wire. Very easy to get on and off, you just slide the\nhook through a ring, an eye, or an extender chain on the other end. These often come in decorative designs and can be incorporated as a part of the design. However, because they slide off and on they are a little less secure than some of the other clasps.\nBarrel or Screw Clasp\nThese clasps have two parts, and they simply screw together. These are typically inexpensive.\nTypically a decorative box, with a tab or snap used to close the clasp. These are usually delicate in appearance, often in filigree or another design, so they can be used as a key design element. They are typically more expensive than other clasps. These look great with pearl jewelry.\nThese have two or more holes used for multiple-strand jewelry designs. They can close in any number of ways, but basically they are used for designs that you want to keep from twisting.\nEnds are used to attach your stringing material to a clasp of your choice.\nSpring and Tube Ends\nSpring or tube cord ends are folded over or flattened down to attach leather, suede, or satin cord to your choice of clasp.\nFor memory wire, glue end caps to each exposed end of the wire to hold the beads in place.\nThese are the earring components that you will attach your beaded headpins and other design elements to, creating the finished jewelry. Obviously, choose the style and type that you (or your wearer) prefers. They come in pierced, clip-on, silver, gold, hook, chain, loop, post, and leverback. For heavier earring designs, consider leverback or posts, because wires might pull forward and slip out.\nTIP: Create simple earrings in five minutes or less! Simply attach a favorite bead to a head pin, (with or without a decorative beadcap), and create a loop at the top of the headpin. Attach the loop to your earring component. Ta-dah!!! You just made earrings.\nBead frames are design elements used to dress up your design. A bead frame has a hole in either end, and the center is an open\nframe. To use a bead frame, find a bead that fits nicely inside your frame. Place the bead in the frame with the holes lining up with the holes in the frame, then slide the wire through all of the holes in both the frame and the bead.\nLinks and Components\nLinks are decorative components and very useful in creating interesting jewelry very quickly. Use these to link components in a bracelet or necklace, or to create fast chandelier earrings and pendants.\nMetal Beads, Bali Beads\nThere are many decorative silver beads available. The most popular silver beads come from Bali, India, Thailand, and\nIsrael. These beads are handmade and adorned with filigree, granulation, swirls and other designs. While they will add some cost to your design, these beads are definitely a design element and can make the difference between ordinary jewelry and jewelry with more pizzazz. Experiment with bead caps (a bead fits inside the cap), spacers, and other metal beads to add interest to your designs.\nBead cone are typically used to finish the ends of multiple strand necklaces, and provide a more finished look.\nSpacer bars are used to separate multiple strands on a jewelry or necklace design.\nThey can be decorative elements, as well.\nBe sure to check the Jewelry\nSupply page for more information and a great selection of supplies!\nThis list is probably never going to be complete, as jewelry supply manufacturers are always coming out with fun new jewelry components. This is good news for us jewelry designers as we can always use some fresh inspiration to spark our creativity!""]"	['<urn:uuid:8e782ca4-4a3a-4835-81ac-8542db230c68>', '<urn:uuid:7f0f5d4b-3dbe-4d9e-a50b-99f96e329377>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	22	129	2985
72	How does protein synthesis differ between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?	Protein synthesis differs significantly between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In prokaryotes, translation and transcription are coupled, meaning translation begins during mRNA synthesis, and it occurs in the cell's cytoplasm. In eukaryotes, transcription happens in the nucleus, producing mRNA that must exit the nucleus before translation can occur in the cytoplasm. Additionally, the rate of translation is faster in prokaryotic cells (17-21 amino acid residues per second) compared to eukaryotic cells (6-9 amino acid residues per second). Both types of cells use ribosomes for protein synthesis, but prokaryotic ribosomes have a different structure from eukaryotic ones, which is why antibiotics can specifically target bacterial protein synthesis without affecting eukaryotic host cells.	"['- Translation (biology)\nIn molecular biology and genetics, translation is the third stage of protein biosynthesis (part of the overall process of gene expression). In translation, messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by transcription is decoded by the ribosome to produce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide, that will later fold into an active protein. In Bacteria, translation occurs in the cell\'s cytoplasm, where the large and small subunits of the ribosome are located, and bind to the mRNA. In Eukaryotes, translation occurs across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum in a process called vectorial synthesis. The ribosome facilitates decoding by inducing the binding of tRNAs with complementary anticodon sequences to that of the mRNA. The tRNAs carry specific amino acids that are chained together into a polypeptide as the mRNA passes through and is ""read"" by the ribosome in a fashion reminiscent to that of a stock ticker and ticker tape.\nIn many instances, the entire ribosome/mRNA complex will bind to the outer membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and release the nascent protein polypeptide inside for later vesicle transport and secretion outside of the cell. Many types of transcribed RNA, such as transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and small nuclear RNA, do not undergo translation into proteins.\nTranslation proceeds in four phases: activation, initiation, elongation and termination (all describing the growth of the amino acid chain, or polypeptide that is the product of translation). Amino acids are brought to ribosomes and assembled into proteins.\nIn activation, the correct amino acid is covalently bonded to the correct transfer RNA (tRNA). The amino acid is joined by its carboxyl group to the 3\' OH of the tRNA by an ester bond. When the tRNA has an amino acid linked to it, it is termed ""charged"". Initiation involves the small subunit of the ribosome binding to the 5\' end of mRNA with the help of initiation factors (IF). Termination of the polypeptide happens when the A site of the ribosome faces a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA). No tRNA can recognize or bind to this codon. Instead, the stop codon induces the binding of a release factor protein that prompts the disassembly of the entire ribosome/mRNA complex.\nA number of antibiotics act by inhibiting translation; these include anisomycin, cycloheximide, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin, erythromycin, and puromycin, among others. Prokaryotic ribosomes have a different structure from that of eukaryotic ribosomes, and thus antibiotics can specifically target bacterial infections without any detriment to a eukaryotic host\'s cells.\nThe basic process of protein production is addition of one amino acid at a time to the end of a protein. This operation is performed by a ribosome. The choice of amino acid type to add is determined by an mRNA molecule. Each amino acid added is matched to a three nucleotide subsequence of the mRNA. For each such triplet possible, only one particular amino acid type is accepted. The successive amino acids added to the chain are matched to successive nucletide triplets in the mRNA. In this way the sequence of nucletides in the template mRNA chain determines the sequence of amino acids in the generated amino acid chain.\nThe mRNA carries genetic information encoded as a ribonucleotide sequence from the chromosomes to the ribosomes. The ribonucleotides are ""read"" by translational machinery in a sequence of nucleotide triplets called codons. Each of those triplets codes for a specific amino acid.\nThe ribosome molecules translate this code to a specific sequence of amino acids. The ribosome is a multisubunit structure containing rRNA and proteins. It is the ""factory"" where amino acids are assembled into proteins. tRNAs are small noncoding RNA chains (74-93 nucleotides) that transport amino acids to the ribosome. tRNAs have a site for amino acid attachment, and a site called an anticodon. The anticodon is an RNA triplet complementary to the mRNA triplet that codes for their cargo amino acid.\nAminoacyl tRNA synthetase (an enzyme) catalyzes the bonding between specific tRNAs and the amino acids that their anticodon sequences call for. The product of this reaction is an aminoacyl-tRNA molecule. This aminoacyl-tRNA travels inside the ribosome, where mRNA codons are matched through complementary base pairing to specific tRNA anticodons. The ribosome has three sites for tRNA to bind. They are the aminoacyl site (abbreviated A), the peptidyl site (abbreviated P) and the exit site (abbreviated E). With respect to the mRNA, the three sites are oriented 5’to 3’ E-P-A, because ribosomes move in a 3’ to 5’ fashion. The A site binds the incoming tRNA with the complementary codon on the mRNA. The P site holds the tRNA with the growing polypeptide chain. The E site holds the tRNA without its amino acid. When an aminoacyl-tRNA initially binds to its corresponding codon on the mRNA, it is in the A site. Then, a peptide bond forms between the amino acid of the tRNA in the A site and the amino acid of the charged tRNA in the P site. The growing polypeptide chain is transferred to the tRNA in the A site. Translocation occurs, moving the tRNA in the P site, now without an amino acid, to the E site; the tRNA that was in the A site, now charged with the polypeptide chain, to the P site. The tRNA in the E site leaves and another aminoacyl-tRNA enters the A site to repeat the process. \nAfter the new amino acid is added to the chain, the energy provided by the hydrolysis of a GTP bound to the translocase EF-G (in prokaryotes) and eEF-2 (in eukaryotes) moves the ribosome down one codon towards the 3\' end. The energy required for translation of proteins is significant. For a protein containing n amino acids, the number of high-energy Phosphate bonds required to translate it is 4n-1. The rate of translation varies; it is significantly higher in prokaryotic cells (up to 17-21 amino acid residues per second) than in eukaryotic cells (up to 6-9 amino acid residues per second).\nWhereas other aspects such as the 3D structure, called tertiary structure, of protein can only be predicted using sophisticated algorithms, the amino acid sequence, called primary structure, can be determined solely from the nucleic acid sequence with the aid of a translation table.\nThis approach may not give the correct amino acid composition of the protein, in particular if unconventional amino acids such as selenocysteine are incorporated into the protein, which is coded for by a conventional stop codon in combination with a downstream hairpin (SElenoCysteine Insertion Sequence, or SECIS).\nThere are many computer programs capable of translating a DNA/RNA sequence into a protein sequence. Normally this is performed using the Standard Genetic Code; many bioinformaticians have written at least one such program at some point in their education. However, few programs can handle all the ""special"" cases, such as the use of the alternative initiation codons. For instance, the rare alternative start codon CTG codes for Methionine when used as a start codon, and for Leucine in all other positions.\nExample: Condensed translation table for the Standard Genetic Code (from the NCBI Taxonomy webpage).\nAAs = FFLLSSSSYY**CC*WLLLLPPPPHHQQRRRRIIIMTTTTNNKKSSRRVVVVAAAADDEEGGGG Starts = ---M---------------M---------------M---------------------------- Base1 = TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG Base2 = TTTTCCCCAAAAGGGGTTTTCCCCAAAAGGGGTTTTCCCCAAAAGGGGTTTTCCCCAAAAGGGG Base3 = TCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAG\nEven when working with ordinary Eukaryotic sequences such as the Yeast genome, it is often desired to be able to use alternative translation tables—namely for translation of the mitochondrial genes.

Cell membrane: Every prokaryote has a cabinet membrane, also known as the plasma membrane, the separates the cell from the external environment. Capsule: part bacteria have actually a class of carbohydrates that surrounds the cell wall surface called the capsule. The capsule help the bacterium attach to surfaces. Fimbriae: Fimbriae room thin, hair-like structures that help with to move attachment. Pili: Pili space rod-shaped structures connected in lot of roles, consisting of attachment and also DNA transfer. Flagella: Flagella space thin, tail-like frameworks that help in movement.\nExamples the prokaryotes\nBacteria and also archaea are the two species of prokaryotes.\nDo prokaryotes have actually mitochondria?\nNo, prokaryotes carry out not have mitochondria. Mitochondria room only uncovered in eukaryotic bio cells. This is additionally true of other membrane-bound structures choose the nucleus and the Golgi device (more on this later).One theory for eukaryotic advancement hypothesizes the mitochondria were first prokaryotic cell that lived inside various other cells. Over time, development led to these separate organisms functioning as a single organism in the form of a eukaryote.\nEukaryotes are organisms who cells have a nucleus and also other organelles fastened by a plasma membrane. Organelles are inner structures responsible for a selection of functions, together as power production and protein synthesis.\nThe key structures current in a eukaryotic bio cell.\nEukaryotic cells are large (around 10-100 μm) and complex. While many eukaryotes are multicellular organisms, there space some single-cell eukaryotes.\nEukaryotic cabinet features\nWithin a eukaryotic cell, every membrane-bound framework carries out certain cellular functions. Below is an overview of countless of the primary components of eukaryotic cells.Nucleus: The nucleus stores the hereditary information in dyed form. Nucleolus: found inside of the nucleus, the nucleolus is the part of eukaryotic bio cells where ribosomal RNA is produced.Plasma membrane: The plasma membrane is a phospholipid double layer that surrounding the whole cell and encompasses the oribel within.Cytoskeleton or cabinet wall: The cytoskeleton or cell wall provides structure, permits for cabinet movement, and plays a function in cabinet division. Ribosomes: Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis. Mitochondria: Mitochondria, likewise known together the powerhouses of the cell, room responsible for power production.Cytoplasm: The cytoplasm is the an ar of the cell in between the atom envelope and also plasma membrane. Cytosol: Cytosol is a gel-like substance within the cell that consists of the organelles. Endoplasmic reticulum: The absorbent reticulum is one organelle devoted to protein maturation and also transportation. Vesicles and vacuoles: Vesicles and also vacuoles are membrane-bound sacs connected in transportation and storage.\nOther common organelles uncovered in many, however not all, eukaryotes incorporate the Golgi apparatus, chloroplasts and also lysosomes.\nExamples the eukaryotes\nAnimals, plants, fungi, algae and also protozoans room all eukaryotes.\nComparing prokaryotes and also eukaryotes\nAll life top top Earth is composed of either eukaryotic cells or prokaryotes cells. Prokaryotes were the very first form of life. Scientists think that eukaryotes developed from prokaryotes around 2.7 billion years ago.The primary distinction between these two types of biology is that eukaryotic bio cells have actually a membrane-bound nucleus and also prokaryotic cells perform not. The nucleus is wherein eukaryotes save their genetic information. In prokaryotes, DNA is bundled together in the new closed region, yet it is not stored in ~ a membrane-bound nucleus.The nucleus is only one of plenty of membrane-bound oribel in eukaryotes. Prokaryotes, ~ above the other hand, have actually no membrane-bound organelles. Another important difference is the DNA structure. Eukaryotic bio DNA is composed of multiple molecule of double-stranded linear DNA, while the of prokaryotes is double-stranded and circular.\nKey similarities in between prokaryotes and also eukaryotes\nA comparison mirroring the shared and unique functions of prokaryotes and also eukaryotes\nAll cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, re-publishing these four features:\n2. Plasma membrane\nTranscription and also translation in prokaryotes vs eukaryotes\nIn prokaryotes cells, transcription and also translation space coupled, definition translation starts during mRNA synthesis.In eukaryotic bio cells, transcription and also translation are not coupled. Warrior occurs in the nucleus, producing mRNA. The mRNA then exits the nucleus, and also translation wake up in the cell cytoplasm.\nSee more: Do 4 Strokes Have Power Bands, What Is A Dirt Bike Power Band\nWhat space the an essential differences in between prokaryotes and eukaryotes?Prokaryotes and also eukaryotes vary in several important ways - these differences include structure variation - even if it is a nucleus is current or absent, and also whether the cell has membrane-bound organelles, and also molecular variation, including whether the DNA is in a one or linear form.

73	What damage can space junk do, and who's in charge of managing it?	Even centimeter-sized debris can generate the energy of an exploding hand grenade due to speeds of 16,000 miles per hour in orbit. Multiple agencies manage this threat: the FAA has jurisdiction during launch, while the Federal Communications Commission and NOAA regulate space transportation once satellites are in orbit. The Department of Defense and NASA partner with the FAA to address orbital debris issues, with DOD maintaining a key role due to national security implications.	"['The House Science, Space, and Technology Committee’s Subcommittee on Space held a May 9 hearing to discuss space traffic management with a particular focus on orbital debris. “The threat of orbital debris in key orbits around the Earth is a very real and a serious issue,” noted Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL). The subcommittee was interested in investigating the state of space traffic management and wanted to hear how Congress can ensure a safe and secure space environment.\nBoth sides of the aisle were interested in exploring which federal agencies have authority in space traffic management and how the United States should approach this matter with international partners. Ranking Member Donna Edwards (D-MD) also wanted to hear from witnesses about procedures to ensure that information about orbital debris is shared in order to mitigate and avoid space debris.\nFive witnesses testified. John Raymond, Commander, Lieutenant General14th Air Force, Air Force Space Command and Commander of the Joint Functional Component Command for Space, U.S. Strategic Command spoke about the space environment and the U.S. programs in space situational awareness. He described the technical capabilities of the Joint Space Operations Mission System as a replacement for the former command and control systems. He noted that the U.S. will ”continue to strengthen relationships with allies and industry partners to ensure capabilities derived from and provided by space operations are available for all who peaceably require them.”\nGeorge Zamka, Deputy Associate Administrator in the Office of Commercial Space Transportation of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spoke about the Commercial Space Launch Act as well as the jurisdiction of the various agencies associated with space transportation. The FAA has jurisdiction during launch but once a satellite is in orbit, the Federal Communications Commission or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration become the agencies in charge of regulating space transportation. The Department of Defense and NASA partner with the FAA to address orbital debris issues. Zamka’s recommendations to the subcommittee included that a regulatory agency should authorize space transportation through a licensing system and that an agency with enforcement authority should provide notices of possible debris.\nRobert Nelson, Chief Engineer of the International Bureau of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), described the FCC licenses for communications satellites noting that each license includes an assignment of an orbit. He discussed the roles of the FCC, FAA and NOAA in debris mitigation.\nP.J. Blount Adjunct Professor of Air and Space Law at the University of Mississippi School of Law described the technical components and legal aspects of space traffic. He emphasized the need for coordination in addressing debris mitigation and recommended that the subcommittee consider ways in which to ensure transparency of data sharing and access. He also recommended that government agencies have unambiguous regulatory predictability and stated that there is a need for nations who operate in the space environment to ensure technical competence.\nBrian Weeden, Technical Advisor for the Secure World foundation discussed space debris mitigation, active debris removal and space traffic management. He described the current role of the Department of Defense in space situational awareness and suggested that non-military agencies should step into that role.\nFollowing the testimony, Brooks asked witnesses to comment on the FAA’s authority relating to launch and reentry. Zamka commented that the FAA’s current authority ends at the conclusion of the launch. Raymond stated that it is important to consider the role of different agencies.\nEdwards wanted the witnesses to clarify which groups should be included in policy discussions about space debris removal. Witnesses agreed that industry and federal agencies provide advice on debris and related space issues. Raymond stated that because space situational awareness is a national security issue, the Department of Defense (DOD) should continue to address debris. Edwards asked which entity should assume liability for space debris to which Blount responded that there is a need to preserve the technical capabilities vested in the DOD.\nRep. Larry Bucshon (R-IN) asked witnesses for their recommendations about how to address space debris that is already in orbit. Zamka noted that there are currently 6 scientific studies on debris mitigation while Weeden echoed that the scientific and technical community is looking into that problem. Bucshon was also interested in determining how to assign responsibility to entities that create space debris. Much of the “space junk” in low-Earth orbit is from government satellites so questions of responsibility remain. The Chinese anti-satellite tests in 2007 “resulted in the largest creation of debris in history.”\nThe hearing demonstrated bi-partisan support for space transportation and Members who engaged in a dialogue with the witnesses were interested in further understanding how each of the federal agencies collaborates to address issues caused by space debris.', 'Right now, there are more than 300,000 pieces of debris larger than a centimeter in diameter orbiting Earth.\nThey range from tiny shards of metal to deactivated, decades-old satellites. Most are shrapnel from discarded rocket stages that have exploded after use, or satellites that have collided. Colloquially, all this debris is usually called ""space junk.""\nTogether, the Department of Defense and NASA track the orbits of the 19,000 or so pieces of junk that are larger than a softball, alerting satellite operators when any satellite — including the International Space Station — is in danger, so they can move it.\nBut doing so takes time and resources. What\'s more, the cloud of debris has been steadily growing over time, and some scientists worry that if we\'re not careful, we could trigger a chain reaction: More space junk raises the chance of collisions, which in turn can lead to even more debris, until the sheer volume of space junk makes parts of space unusable.\n""Space is a finite resource — just like the atmosphere, and the water, and the Earth,"" says William Schonberg, an aerospace engineer who designs spacecraft to minimize damage from orbital debris. ""We need to be careful about how we use it.""\nWhy space junk is a problem\nEven small pieces of debris in orbit around Earth can cause a surprising amount of damage because of a basic reason: speed.\n""All the objects in Earth\'s orbit naturally have a high velocity,"" says Holger Krag, head of the European Space Agency\'s Space Debris Office. (If they weren\'t traveling that fast, they\'d simply drop to Earth.) In low Earth orbit, this speed is around 16,000 miles per hour. ""Even a centimeter-long screw can generate the energy of an exploding hand grenade.""\nAs a result, collisions have to be avoided at all costs. Using ground-based radar and other instruments, the Department of Defense and NASA keep track of about 19,000 pieces of debris larger than five centimeters — the ones big enough to cause significant damage.\n""We do an assessment for every operational satellite, looking typically three days into the future, and if we think that some other object is going to come close to hitting it, we notify the owner-operator,"" Nicholas L. Johnson, then-chief scientist at NASA’s Orbital Debris Program, told me in 2012. About once a week or so, satellites are moved to prevent a collision.\nBecause there\'s crew on board, the International Space Station is treated with extreme delicacy and is moved if there\'s more than a 1 in 100,000 chance something will collide with it. In a few cases, warning hasn\'t come in time, and astronauts have had to quickly take shelter in the capsules that serve as the station\'s lifeboats.\nEven with these preventative measures, though, debris are a long-term issue for space operations as a whole. One problem is that a steady stream of even tinier, sand grain-sized particles can gradually erode the surface of all spacecraft in orbit.\nAnd there\'s a bigger concern for heavily-trafficked orbits — such as low Earth orbit and geosynchronous orbits (often used for communication satellites, so they can stay fixed over one location on Earth). As these orbits fill with debris, they become more and more expensive to use. ""Every collision avoidance maneuver means loss of mission time,"" Krag says. ""And you have to use manpower and fuel to carry them out.""\nAll debris eventually falls back to Earth given enough time — and objects in lower orbits fall much faster, over the course of a few years, because traces of atmosphere drag on them and slow them down. But those in higher orbits might take decades or even centuries. And if we\'re not careful, some orbits could become so clogged with junk that they\'re impossible to use.\nWhere all the space junk came from\nA few different factors have contributed to the steady accumulation of orbital debris ever since we started using space in the 1950s.\nOne is the fact that for decades, the rockets we used to lift spacecraft into orbit were only designed with the first few minutes of flight in mind. ""We didn\'t think at all about how the object might behave after years or decades,"" Krag says.\nAs a result, rocket components were commonly left in orbit with tiny amounts of extra fuel and built-up pressure inside. When an object in orbit leaves the shadow of the Earth and is hit by sunlight, its temperature can swing by hundreds of degrees. This has led many rocket stages to explode, sending thousands of shards of metal cascading in orbit.\nIn the 80s, scientists recognized the problem, and now, rockets are designed so that they can be fully emptied after use. These intact rockets, along with deactivated satellites, make up a minority of the pieces of debris in orbit.\nBut two recent events generated another 5,000 pieces of tracked debris, generating about a quarter of the total.\nIn 2007, China intentionally destroyed one of its weather satellites in orbit as part of a military test, generating about 3,000 pieces of debris. Even worse, it was done in a higher orbit than other anti-satellite tests previously conducted by the US and Russia, so the debris will take much longer to come down. Other countries criticized the test, but the damage was done.\nThen, in 2009, two satellites — a deactivated Russian military satellite and an active US communications satellite — accidentally collided, creating a shower of another 2,000 or so pieces of debris.\nWhat\'s going to happen to space junk in the future\nThe 2009 event was especially alarming because it may be a sign of things to come: if space gets too crowded with debris, it could trigger a positive feedback loop, in which collisions beget debris, which beget collisions.\nSome scientists, in fact, believe this scenario (called the Kessler syndrome) is already happening, just slowly. Unlike in the movie Gravity, the chain reaction would accelerate slowly, over the course of decades: right now it\'s estimated that one collision will occur every five years, and if things get worse, the rate could increase to one collision annually within 50 to 100 years.\nStill, there\'s disagreement over whether this is happening yet — and spacefaring nations are generally being more careful nowadays. Rockets are drained of fuel and pressure after use, and satellite operators are now required to move their satellites down to a lower altitude after use, so they\'ll fall back to Earth more quickly, or take them up to an unused ""graveyard"" orbit.\nStill, there\'s tons of debris already in orbit. If we did enter a scenario in which debris accumulated uncontrollably, people have drawn up some ideas for cleaning up our orbits: crafts that would use nets or harpoons to grab derelict satellites to bring them down, for instance, or a spacecraft that would grab debris, throw it down to Earth, and use the resulting momentum to move on to the next object.\nAt the moment, though, these ideas are purely hypothetical, and all of them would be extremely expensive. If we want to continue relying on Earth\'s orbit for communication, navigating, and all other sorts of useful technologies, we need to be more careful with it going forward.\nFurther reading: How NASA steers the International Space Station around space junk']"	['<urn:uuid:1165e67c-72d3-4983-b9a1-4b54ea5277e8>', '<urn:uuid:af09ffe4-73dd-4917-b8ac-4c2ad6170415>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	13	74	1994
74	According to Leibniz's philosophical ideas, what happens to fictional characters like Don Quixote and Sherlock Holmes in terms of their existence in possible worlds?	According to Leibniz, fictional characters like Don Quixote and Sherlock Holmes exist only as possible entities in other possible worlds, where they are actualities in their own worlds. In our world, they are merely fictional and could not have met anyone anywhere except in the pages of a novel.	['‘The Present King of France is Bald’: On Possible Worlds\nLeibniz once stated that ‘many stories, especially those called novels, may be regarded as possible, even if they do not take place in this particular sequence of the world which God has chosen.’ That is, God’s world did not include Don Quixote, although it could have done; it only included a certain Cervantes who ‘invented’ him and his adventures – indeed, invented him so vividly that he ‘lives’ on in readers’ heads to the present. Similarly, God’s London did not include Sherlock Holmes or Mrs Dalloway, nor could they have met, say, on Regent Street or in Kensington Gardens – being fictional, they could not have met anyone anywhere, except in the pages of a novel. In Leibnizian terms, it was not in God’s plan to instantiate or actualise Don Quixote or Sherlock Holmes or Mrs Dalloway: they are possible entities only, whereas we ourselves and all the people who have ever lived or will ever live are not only possible but were, are, or will be, also actual.\nFor Leibniz God was, amongst other things, a sort of master-logician: he chose out of the infinity of possible worlds the one that was best. This was a claim that met an often sceptical response, most famously in Voltaire’s Candide, in which Leibniz was caricatured as Doctor Pangloss. No one but a philosopher could think that we live in the best of all possible worlds – except for a theologian: for it is hard to see why a God who was omniscient, omnipotent, and supremely good would invent a world in which there was unnecessary evil. However, even if Leibniz was orthodox in this sense he was heterodox in another. In line with the science of the day (and, largely, of ours), Leibniz’s universe was a deterministic one: if God had a choice to instantiate the world that he did (and it is hard to see even there that he had much leeway, given the need to maximise goodness), once he had made that choice, it is even harder to see that there is any choice for us.\nThat is, once God has selected this world as the best, and instantiated it, there is no room for manoeuvre: everything in it is already chosen. In what Leibniz calls the ‘complete concept’ of myself is everything that I have done or will do, and this was inherent in the world from the beginning. This runs counter to our intuitions: we like to think that we could have turned left, not right, or taken another path, that our lives could have been otherwise than they are. Robert Frost famously took the road ‘less travelled by, / And that has made all the difference’. Not so, for Leibniz: Frost had no option but to take the road he did. So is it for everyone. On the Leibnizian view I could not have turned left that day or taken another path, because according to the complete concept of Roger Caldwell (which can only exist in the mind of God) it was necessary to the plan of this world that I should have turned right that day and taken this path and not another. The possibility of my doing otherwise exists only as a possibility – a possibility, however, that could not have been actualised in this world but only in another of the infinity of possible worlds. In other possible worlds I did turn left that day: in other possible worlds are counterparts of myself who did or will do things I never did or will do in this world. It is also in other possible worlds that Don Quixote and Mrs Dalloway and Sherlock Holmes and all those others live who are fictions in this world but actualities in their own.\nPhilosophers, from the Greeks onwards, have often found problems in explaining how we can speak of fictional entities – as Parmenides puts it, ‘For you may not know what-is-not – there is no end to it – nor may you tell of it’. To speak of something comprehensibly is in some sense to bring it into existence, if only an imaginary or conceptual one. Thus philosophers such as Meinong are sometimes led to embrace extravagant ontologies in which all sorts of entities from golden mountains to chimeras to the square root of minus one somehow bizarrely coexist in this world along with more familiar objects. Bertrand Russell hoped in his theory of descriptions to avoid such a plethora of unnecessary entities. Famously, he gave a logical analysis of the proposition, ‘The present king of France is bald’. Now, this seems a meaningful proposition, is unambiguous in what it says, but it remains puzzling: in the absence of a present king of France can it be said to be true or false? For Bertrand Russell it was false, because, on his analysis, the statement claims that there is at least one thing that is the present king of France, that there is at most one thing that is the present king of France, and that that thing is bald. The statement is therefore false, because it fails to refer: in our world there is no present king of France. But, of course, its contradiction is also false: it is likewise not the case that the present king of France has a good head of hair. He is in no position to fit either option as he does not exist – at least not in our world.\nIn fiction, of course, things are different. In a fictional world – say in a novel in which the French Revolution never occurred (one that Roger Scruton might like) – there may well be a present king of France, and he may be bald, or he may have a good head of hair. Perhaps an important part of the plot may depend on the issue. But it may likewise be the case that nothing turns on the issue, so that we are not informed one way or the other, in which case the issue is undecidable: the statement that ‘The present king of France is bald’ has a fictional referent, but his baldness doesn’t; again the statement is meaningful but is neither true nor false. Fictional worlds are not completely filled, like ours, in which every hair on our head is counted, but gappy, partial: in these worlds Hamlet is neither left- nor right-handed, Lady Macbeth has an indefinite number of children, and Mrs Dalloway might or might not like oysters. In their respective fictional worlds these are matters of no importance.\nWhat, then, is of importance? If so much is indeterminate, what is essential to a fictional character, and what is accidental? We are told that Sherlock Holmes plays the violin and that he takes tobacco from a Persian slipper. Is a Sherlock Holmes who does neither still Sherlock Holmes? In fact, it seems that neither characteristic is essential – we\nRoger Caldwell: ‘The Present King of France is Bald’: On Possible Worlds']	['<urn:uuid:1433a4e7-7a72-481e-a867-042666e62ad3>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	24	49	1176
75	how many hands needed swing anglo saxon sword	Anglo-Saxon swords were single-handed weapons. The typical size of the grip and the fact that the sword was used together with a shield provide conclusive evidence that Germanic swords of that period were single-handed.	['by Antti Ijäs\nThe study of historical combat arts is comprised of archaeology, philology and practical experimentation. All of these domains have their own methodology and they provide answers for markedly different questions. On one hand, archaeology tells us what kinds of weapons existed at a given time period; on the other hand, philology gives us an idea of how they were used based on textual evidence of historical or instructional nature. Naturally, damage to weapons, armour and bones uncovered by archaeologists will also provide important data on how different armaments were used.\nExperimentation and actual physical exercise, which in this context could also be termed “experimental archaeology”, should be used to verify the plausibility of using the weapons and armour in the assumed way. Sometimes insufficient knowledge and lack of practical experience can result in rather strange conclusions, which could in the worst case be perpetuated in subsequent literature, thus contributing to the ever-growing corpus of common misconceptions. In this essay, I will give an example of the importance of synthesizing knowledge by pointing out an error in the article “Archaeology and Beowulf” by Leslie Webster originally published in an edition of Beowulf (Mitchell & Robinson 1998: 183-194) and later reprinted with the Present-Day English verse translation by Seamus Heaney (Donoghue 2002: 212-236). This essay is loosely based on my earlier off-the-cuff blog post “Anglosaksien miekoista, lähdeviittaamisesta ja relatiivipronominista” (Ijäs 2014), in which I also discuss the only vaguely related topic of Old English relative pronoun.\nIn the natural sciences, experiments must be documented so that they may be replicated by others. Similarly, even in the most humanistic kinds of historical studies, one should indicate the data used so that others may review it and follow the reasoning used to draw the conclusions presented. There are essentially two distinct kinds of referencing in scientific writing. The first kind entails giving a source for the data used for drawing specific conclusions. To give an example from linguistics, this means that instead of claiming that one expression is used more often than the other based on personal assumption (or “reflection”), one would refer to a specific text corpus where the instances of one expression outnumber those of the other. The validity of such a statement is then subordinate to the quality (or, better said, quantity) of the corpus used. Citing a secondary source also falls under this category, since eventually the trail will lead to the primary source. The second kind of referencing is purely ethical and entails giving credit to previous research for having made certain conclusions. Failing to do this can be construed as plagiarism and is punished by the most severe methods available to the academic community. From a methodological point of view, this kind of referencing is, strictly speaking, irrelevant, for a logical conclusion is no less valid no matter who presents it or takes credit for it. Giving credit where credit is due is, however, of utmost importance for the social dynamics of the academia.\nIn the worst case scenario, an innocuous offhand reference to an authority generally considered to be credible might lead to the accumulation of misinformation mentioned earlier. This is especially true of monographs and articles that are likely to be read by a wide audience of students or researchers. However, if referencing to primary sources is done properly, or if at least the trail of references does not end before primary sources, there exists at least the possibility for checking the facts.\nThe purpose of this essay is, ultimately, to provide the reader with an example of an (arguably minor) scholarly lapse and the method of critical reading necessary to correct it. Below is the relevant quotation from Webster’s article (1998: 191):\nThey [the swords] are archetypally the ealde lāfe, powerful heirlooms to be prized for their power and might; some are the work of marvellous smiths (l. 1681), or eotenisc (l. 1558), the work of giants long ago; they may have names, or carry owner inscriptions and images which tell of the mythic past (ll. 1688-98). They have richly decorated hilts (l. 1698) and bear twisting and branching patterns (wyrmfāh l. 1698, ātertānum fāh l. 1459); their iron blades are fearsome double-edged weapons, which need two hands to swing them (l. 1461). Supporting archaeological evidence for much of this has long been recognized.\nLine numbers refer to the primary source, i.e. Beowulf, or, more precisely, Mitchell’s and Robinson edition (1998) of Beowulf the article was published with. Interestingly, a footnote for line 1461 in the text proper refers to the passage quoted above, effectively lending Webster’s claim the authority of the said editors. As for “supporting archaeological evidence”, a passim reference is given to a secondary source, in this case H. R. Ellis Davidson’s book The Sword in Anglo-Saxon England: Its Archaeology and Literature (1962).\nFor anybody familiar with the Anglo-Saxon or similar Germanic swords (though attested in a single late 10th to early 11th century Old English manuscript, the story of Beowulf is set in Scandinavia, not England), the idea that their use would require two hands should strike as rather peculiar. According to the article, however, this proposition seems to be supported by both textual evidence and archaeological findings. To be fair, Webster does not specify which details are supported by archaeological evidence, but weight and handedness are certainly such basic and concrete qualities of a sword that they would be among the first characteristics inferred from surviving specimens.\nI will start my analysis from the reference to the primary source. Below are lines 1459 to 1463 describing Unferth’s sword Hrunting with a literal translation:\necg wæs īren, ātertānum fāh\nāhyrded heaþoswāte; nǣfre hit æt hilde ne swāc\nmanna ǣngum þāra þe hit mid mundum bewand\nse ðe gryresīðas gegān dorste,\n‘the edge was iron, with poison-twigs decorated,\nhardened with battle-sweat; never had it in battle betrayed\nany man who grasped it with hands,\nwho dared to go on perilous expeditions\nto the enemies’ meeting place.’\nWebster seems to assume that the plural mid mundum ‘with hands’ refers to using the sword exclusively with both hands. It should be noted that even though the antecedent manna ǣngum ‘any man’ (lit. ‘of-the-men any’) could arguably be either singular or plural, the verb bewand is singular, so it is indeed obvious that two hands of a single man are meant. But nevertheless, since we are dealing with poetry, two things should be considered. First, it could very well be that the poet has chosen words based on acoustic qualities such as rhythm, in this case bewand instead of the trisyllabic plural bewundon. Secondly, the verb bewindan is by no means the regular word for using, wielding or swinging a sword: the literal meaning is ‘to wind or bind around or about’ (in Gothic biwindan is used in the sense ‘to swaddle’). Its usage here seems rather poetic and could refer to grasping the handle with one hand and the sheath with the other when starting to use the sword. There is, of course, a very remote possibility that we are dealing here with a technical term (or a usage inspired by a technical term) related to the Middle High German winden ‘to turn (the sword)’ familiar to practitioners of historical European martial arts.\nNext I will consider the “supporting archaeological evidence”. Because no specific page number is provided, I had little choice but to look up the relevant passages myself. The one quoted below concerns the size of the hilt (Davidson 1962: 61):\nThe grips of Anglo-Saxon and Viking swords often seem surprisingly small. One sword found at Reading (now lost) is said to have had a grip too small for a grown man’s hand, and it may be noted that the other swords in this museum, including the one from Shifford, have small grips. […] Some of these swords may have been made for boys or slender men, but another possible explanation was given by R. E. Oakeshott, who suggested that grip and pommel might be grasped together, and confirmed this by illustrations from early manuscripts; the brazilnut pommel in particular fitted easily into the hand in this way.\nIn this case, archaeological evidence would definitely suggest single-handedness. In another passage Davidson says that “a good swordsman might be capable of using both hands as the occasion demanded” (ibid. 201), referring to the passage from the Droplaugarsona saga (written probably in the 13th century) quoted below:\nGrim could fight equally well with both hands; he brandished a sword in his left hand, but with the right he struck at Gauss and cut off his leg above the knee.\nAgain, there is no indication whatsoever about the sword requiring two hands to swing it in an effective manner. The Old Norse text (Jónsson 1878) makes it even more obvious that Grímr has indeed two swords, one in each hand:\nGrímr hafði tvau sverð, því at Gauss kunni at deyfja eggjar. Grímr vá jafnt báðum höndum. Hann brá upp sverði með vinstri hendi, enn hjó með hinni hœgri til Gauss ok af fótinn fyrir ofan kné. Nú fell Gauss, ok í því veifði hann sverðinu at Grími ok kom á fótinn, ok varð þat svörðusár. Nú flýði víkingrunn á brott, enn Grímr tók silfrit, ok fekk góðan orðstír af verki þessu.\n‘Grímr had two swords, because Gauss could make edges blunt. Grímr was equally good with both hands. He brought up his sword with his left hand, and with the right he struck at Gauss and cut off his leg above the knee. Then Gauss fell and waved his sword at Grímr and hit his foot causing a surface wound. Now the viking fled away, but Grímr took the silver and got a good reputation of this work.’\n(My emphasis and translation.)\nWith the sword in his left hand Grímr lures his opponent into lifting his defences and immediately uses the opening thus created to strike with the other sword in his right hand at his opponent’s leg, chopping it off. It should be borne in mind that sagas in general do not qualify as a reliable source and the descriptions contained in them should not be taken at face value. In any case, Grímr’s apparent ambidexterity needs not be considered a super-human feat conjured up by the imagination of the anonymous author. On a related side note, in Speculum regale (Konungs skuggsjá), a Norwegian educational textfrom the late 13th century, it is stated that an expert in the use of weapons should be trained to use both hands alike, though swords are not explicitly mentioned in this context (chapter 37).\nThe typical size of the grip and the fact that the sword was used together with a shield constitute conclusive and, as far as I am aware, widely undisputed evidence that the Germanic swords of the period discussed were single-handed. Whereas an interpretation of the Beowulf verses quoted earlier might tentatively suggest otherwise, a simple experiment with any replica sword made according to specifications provided by archaeological specimens will reveal that only a child would actually require two hands to swing the Anglo-Saxon sword or any other similar Migration period Germanic sword based on the Roman spatha. Further experimentation will also confirm that it is indeed within human capabilities to chop off a limb using only one hand, even though such a technique might not have played a decisive part in the ancient battlefields.\nBut despite the overwhelming facts regarding swords enumerated above, it is nevertheless worth discussing whether dismissing the plural mid mundum ‘with hands’ as a product of poetic licenceis a valid approach.Davidson points out that oral poetry can be expected to yield more accurate details than historical works, since the audience would have been intimately familiar with the objects described by the performer (1962: 3). There actually is reason to question the identification of Hrunting as a sword in the modern sense: inaddition to sweord, mēce ‘sword’ (passim)and waegesweord ‘wavesword’ (1489), it is once referred to as a hæftmēce (1457), glossed in Bosworth-Toller as ‘a hilted sword’ (also in Mitchell & Robinson 1998, but more interpretatively ‘sword with a long hilt’ in Wrenn 1958). This rather trivial extension (all swords have hilts) could be taken as a poetic byform of mēce, but in the supplement volume a comparison is drawn to the Old Norse hefti-sax mentioned in Grettis saga. In the saga, the weapon in question is wielded by a giant and is referred to as a fleinn ‘pike’ with a tréskapt ‘wooden shaft’ (66.4):\nEn er Grettir kom at honum, hljóp jǫtuninn upp ok greip flein einn ok hjó til þess, er kominn var, þvíat bæði mátti hǫggva ok leggja með því. Tréskapt var í; þat kǫlluðu menn þá heptisax, er þannveg var gǫrt.\n‘But when Grettir came near him, the giant leapt up, grabbed a pike and struck at him, who had just come, for with [the pike] he could both cut and thrust. A wooden shaft it had, and [a weapon] that was made in such a way men would back then call a haft-seax.’\n(My emphasis and translation.)\nIn a footnote to his critical edition, Boer notes that the word heptisax is not attested outside Grettis saga, where is appears twice, but the striking similarity with hæftmēce would suggest a connection with Beowulf (1900: 231). Davidson, who identifies the weapon as a ‘knife fastened to a wooden shaft’ points out that the weapon would seem to have been unfamiliar to the intended audience of the saga (1962: 134).\nInterestingly, a similar Old English word, stæfsweord ‘staff-sword’ appears in Ælfric’s glossary as a translation (possibly coined by the author) of Latin dolones, plural of dolo ‘iron-pointed staff, pike’ (see Wright 1857: 35ff. for this and other Latin and Old English weapons terms). An exact cognate of the compound stæfsweord is also attested in Old High German, where stabaswert ‘staff-sword’ is used to gloss Latin framea, which according to Tacitus is the Germanic word for hasta ’spear’ (Germania 6.1), but the word was used by later Christian writers to signify ‘sword’ (Green 1998: 185). Accordingly, Ælfric’s glossary gives sweord as the Old English equivalent of Latin framea.\nFollowing the lexical trail further is beyond the scope of this article. In any case, this etymological excursion would seem to indicate that if the weapon referred to in Beowulf was wielded with both hands, as mid mundum would suggest, and if indeed the name Hrunting is derived from hrung ‘rung, staff’, it would seem that the weapon – at least in the archetypal story – was something akin to a pike or a glaive, not the typical Anglo-Saxon or Viking sword or any of their known predecessor.\nThe linguistic surface usually passed through as quickly as possible by non-philologists offers a rich and, admittedly, confusing domain of data for studying not only language but the physical world language has been used to describe. In conclusion, I hope to have demonstrated the importance of not only checking second-hand references and studying the primary sources whenever possible, but also of inter-disciplinary approach combined with practical experimentation. This is especially true when it comes to weapons, since, after all, they are quite concrete tools and should not be treated and studied as philosophical abstractions.\nBoer, R.C. (ed.). 1900.

77	How many soldiers from Company A survived the Battle of the Bulge?	Of the 200 men in Company A that went into the Battle of the Bulge, only 23 made it out alive at the end of the battle.	"[""The last time Glenn Fackler saw Walter Anstey, his company commander, it was aboard a hospital ship on their way back to the States at the close of World War II. They were both recovering from war wounds.\n“Capt. Anstey was hobbling along on a cane and spotted me laying on a stretcher aboard ship,” Fackler said. “‘What are you doing here, Sergeant?’ he asked me. I told him and he said he was going to find out about moving me up to the officers’ quarters on the deck above.\n“It was an English ship and the English were very strict about officers not fraternizing with enlisted men. That was the last time I saw him. He never returned,” Fackler recalled.\n“It wasn’t until recently, when the sergeant began searching the internet for his company commander he came up with three “Walter Ansteys” on the net. One was in Venice, Fla. and two were in other places in the country.\nFackler contacted all three men. It turned out Walter Anstey in Venice was his man. At noon Thursday, the two old soldiers met again after 56 years for lunch at the Olive Garden restaurant in Murdock, Fla. Glenn brought his wife, Clara, and Walter had his wife, Doris, attended the gathering.\nThey talked about their war experiences more than half a century ago. They talked about their part in the six-day battle for St. Vith, Belgium, the key engagement during “The Battle of the Bulge.” This engagement ended the German offensive on the Western Front in Europe during the Second World War.\n“Our outfit, Company A, 38th Armored Infantry Battalion led the 7th Armored Division into ‘The Battle of the Bulge,'” Anstey explained. “I’m proud of that.”\nThe Bulge was the largest land battle of WW II in which United States troops participated. There were 500,000 American soldiers, 55,000 British and 600,000 Germans.\nCasualties in the battle amounted to 81,000 Americans, of which 19,000 were killed, 14,000 British troops of which 200 were killed; and 100,000 German soldiers killed, wounded or captured.\nThe 7th Armored Division was ordered into Belgium from France just before the battle. From the looks of things, the war was almost over, the Germans were whipped and withdrawing. At least, that’s what Capt. Anstey and the men of his company thought.\nTheir division set up its headquarters in St. Vith. It was a key rail center and crossroad for that part of Belgium. Things were quiet and nothing much was happening.\nThe weather was god-awful. Snow blanketed the area, the roads had been churned into a sea of mud by tanks, halftracks and artillery equipment they weren’t designed to handle. Getting around was almost impossible.\nOn Dec. 16, 1944, the Germans attacked with two armies totaling 29 divisions. Allied forces in and around St. Vith and Bastogne were eventually overwhelmed by enemy infantry, artillery and armored that weren’t supposed to be there. But not without a monumental fight.\nAttacking Nazi forces were working on a strict timetable they had to maintain to break through the Allied front. Hitler had decreed his soldiers would win this last major battle for the “Fatherland” or die trying. The Fuhrer was trying to turn “The Battle of the Bulge” into the decisive military engagement in Europe.\nThe German’s plan of attack called for taking St. Vith within 48 hours after their initial attack. For six days, American forces doggedly held the town until they were overwhelmed by enemy forces.\nBy then, it was too late for the Germans.\n“We lost the Battle of St. Vith. We were thrown out,” Anstey said. “That’s why you do’t read too much about it. You read about Bastogne because we won that battle.\n“It was total confusion, Anstey and Fackler and the other men of Company A had no idea what was going on except for right in their field of fire. They couldn’t imagine where all the well-equipped German soldiers were coming from.\nAt one point in the engagement, Anstey called division headquarters.\n“I contacted 1st Sgt. Burns back at headquarters about 10 p.m. Everything had quieted down,” Anstey said. “The sergeant told me, ‘Captain, you better get out of there because St. Vith is burning and the Germans are coming your way.’\n“That’s where Glenn, I and Gilmore (another member of his company) managed to get out after a while. The Germans had overrun our lines and there was mass confusion.\n“We walked down a railroad track in a blizzard in the middle of the night to escape. The Germans fired at us with machine-guns a couple of times, but they couldn’t see us.”\n“As we withdrew, we were holding hands,” Fackler said. “We couldn’t see but a few feet in froth of us because of the snow storm and the dark.\n“Eventually myself and another guy took off across a snow covered field looking for our lies and ran into Sgt. Kenny. He told us we had to go the other way because we were heading toward the German lines. I said, ‘No, we had to go the way we were going.’\n“The sergeant went his way and we went ours. We never heard from Sgt. Kenny again. Even today he is listed as ‘Missing in Action,'” Fackler said.\n“By this time, the snow had stopped. A little further along we came up on one of our field artillery units. We stayed with them for three days,”he said.\nThe men of Company A regrouped and recaptured St. Vith from the enemy. It was exactly a month to the day from the time the American forces were run out of town by the Germans.\nIt was during this second engagement at St. Vith the captain was cut down by enemy fire.\n“I was hit in the leg with shrapnel during the battle to retake St. Vith,” Anstey said. “A little while later, they dropped mortars on us and I was hit in the chest.”\nSgt. Fackler and a couple of his men had captured a couple of German soldiers when they spotted Anstey who had been wounded. They had the enemy soldiers carry the captain to safety at gun point.\nA few days later, on Jan. 28, 1945, “The Battle of the Bulge” was over. The Germans last offensive had been blunted. Never again would the enemy launch a major offensive in Europe.\n“Of the 200 men in our company that went into ‘The Battle of the Bulge,’ only 23 made it out alive at the end of the battle,” Fackler said. “We’re two of those 23.\n“After the war, one of our commanding generals wrote a letter to the Detroit News,” Fackler said. “He wrote: ‘It was the 7th Armored Division’s stand at St. Vith for six days and six nights, the 99th Infantry Division on the north flank and the 101st Airborne Division at Bastogne that saved the day.'”\n“After the war, the German commander at ‘The Battle of the Bulge’ said his troops could’ve bypassed Bastogne because it was of no military value. He added, St. Vith, where we were, they had to capture within 48 hours. We held at St. Vith and completely upset their timetable,” Anstey said.\nFackler would continue on after “The Bulge” to fight his way across the Rhine River into Germany. At Freedburg in April ’45, he would receive his million dollar wound–his ticket home.\n“I made a mad dash for a house and made it, but the Germans opened up on my gunner with 20-millimeter ground fire,” he said. “He went down and I went back to help him.\n“Then they opened up on me. I had just liberated a German officer’s wristwatch a couple of days before. A 20-millimeter round hit my liberated watch and it exploded. I got hit with shrapnel in my face, chest an wrist,” Fackler said.\nHe was airlifted from central Germany to Paris and from there to England for medical treatment. Eventually he made it back to a V.A. hospital in Battle Creek, Mich., where he spent five months recovering from his war wounds.\nIt took Anstey a year to completely recover from his wounds. Eventually he was released from Water Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C. just before New Year’s 1946.\nAs the two couples sat around a tablet at the Olive Garden, Clara, Glenn’s wife, raise her wine glass in toast.\n“Here’s to all of us,” she said.\nThis story was first published in the Charlotte Sun newspaper, Port Charlotte, Fla. on Friday, March 30, 2001 and is republished with permission.\nClick here to view the War Tales fan page on FaceBook.\nClick here to search Veterans Records and to obtain information on retrieving lost commendations.\nAll rights reserved.

He died Aug. 21 at age 92.\nThe memorial service is scheduled for 4 p.m. today at Friendship United Methodist Church, 12275 Paramount Drive, Punta Gorda.\nFackler was a staff sergeant in A-Company, 38th Armored Infantry Battalion, 7th Armored Division of Gen. George Patton’s 3rd Army. In mid December 1944 his unit helped stop the unexpected German advance at St. Vith, Belgium and denied the enemy victory during its last major ground offensive in the west during the war.\nSoldiers of the 38th were ordered to hold St. Vith at all costs. The town was a key railhead that if captured, would allow the German’s to divide American and British forces and possibly defeat the Allies.\nWriting about his part in the massive battle, he noted half a lifetime later, “With sheer guts and combat experience we stopped them cold for six days and nights until the night of Dec. 23rd when a huge force of two divisions from the 18th Volksgrenadiers attacked us in the dead of night.\n“I had the second section of Staff Sgt. Alpino’s machine gun squad and Pfc. Peter Andrelawitch was in charge of the 1st squad. That night was so dark you couldn’t see your hand in front of you when I heard a huge force coming toward us. I waited for Pete’s guns to start firing, but they didn’t.\n“When I felt the Germans were only 100 yards from us, I opened up with my .30-caliber machine gun, followed at once by Pete on the other machine gun. We crisscrossed the whole field out in front of us with 2,400 rounds of ammunition. “Our attack was followed by dead silence, or I should say the silence of the dead as the after action report of the incident stated. The field was littered with German troops. We must have gotten every one of them.\n“Shortly after the war there was a meeting in Washington, D.C., between our Division Commander, Gen. Robert W. Hasbrouck, and the German general commanding the Bulge, Gen. Hasso-Eccard Frelherer Manteuffel. He told Gen. Hasbrouck, ‘We could have bypassed Bastogne at any time, as it had no military value, but St. Vith, where we had been ordered to hold for 48 hours and held it for six days and nights, they had to have or the bulge was lost.’\nThe Germans needed the railhead at St. Vith to transport their supplies on to Antwerp, Belgium and divide the American and British forces. “The units of our division involved in the stand at St. Vith were awarded The Presidential Unit Citation, witch included my 38th Armored Infantry Battalion,” Fackler concluded.\nHe was one of the 800,000 Allied soldiers who took part in the battle around St. Vith and Bastogne survived what would be called “The Battle of the Bulge.” Some 500,000 German soldiers, who took the offensive initially, were finally outgunned by American’s overwhelming firepower. Allied forces lost 19,250 soldiers killed and 89,740 wounded. German losses of killed, wounded and captured totaled 91,000 in this one battle.\nFackler kept on fighting until a month before V-E (Victory in Europe) Day, when he was struck in the wrist by a 20 mm round on April 10, 1945. The round hit the wristwatch he was wearing.\nThe doctor who operated on him said the watch is what saved his left hand. It took him six months to recover from his wounds. Fackler’s military commendations included the Purple Heart, Silver Star, Bronze Star with “V” for Valor, the Presidential Unit Citation for the part his unit played at St. Vith, and the Combat Infantryman’s Badge. Fackler and his wife, Dorothy, moved to Punta Gorda 13 years ago from Farmington Hills, Mich. She died after 52 years of marriage.\nFackler is survived by two sons, Glenn Jr. and Ralph, his partner, Clara Robbinson; and a number of grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.""]"	['<urn:uuid:41478362-a194-4612-b75b-c01746c59490>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	12	27	2161
78	normal blood sugar after meal vs normal blood pressure	Normal blood sugar 1-2 hours after eating should be less than 140 mg/dL, while normal blood pressure is defined as 130/85 or below, with 120/80 being optimal.	['What is blood pressure?\nAs the blood circulates around the body, it is under pressure. The blood pressure is a result of the pumping action of the heart and the resistance of the vessels, through which the blood flows.\nWhen blood pressure is high it puts an unnecessary strain on the heart and blood vessels.\nBlood pressure may rise temporarily due to exercise, excitement, anger or anxiety making your heart beat faster.\nWhat is normal blood pressure?\nYour blood pressure levels will vary during the day and will normally be highest around lunchtime or after exercise and lowest when you are resting or sleeping. Blood pressure is quoted as 2 numbers, the first number known as systolic pressure, is the blood pressure during each heartbeat. The second, known as diastolic, is the blood pressure between beats.\nThe latest guideline from the British Hypertension Sociey (2004) defines blood pressure of 130/85 or below as normal but say that 120/80 is the optimal. 140/90 is the level used to diagnose high blood pressure. If your blood pressure reading is consistently 140/90 or above this is considered high blood pressure and treatment may be required. The high blood pressure reading can be either a systolic reading of 140 or above, a diastolic reading of 90 or above, or both.\nWhat causes blood pressure to be high?\nAnyone can develop high blood pressure and it doesn’t always have an obvious cause. If you have persistent high blood pressure, the condition is called hypertension.\nHigh blood pressure tends to run in families. Blood pressure will also increase, as you get older. This may be why heart attacks are more common in older people. In a few cases high blood pressure can be related to another medical condition.\nThere are many other elements that contribute to high blood pressure that can be avoided, such as being overweight, drinking too much alcohol, smoking, lack of exercise and a poor diet.\nHow can I tell if I have high blood pressure?\nYou may feel perfectly well, as high blood pressure usually causes no symptoms and generally will go undiscovered until a doctor happens to take your blood pressure. If you have very high blood pressure you may experience dizziness, headaches, blurred vision and possible breathlessness. The only way you can tell for sure if you have high blood pressure is to have it measured by your doctor, or purchase one of the many blood pressure monitors that are available from most pharmacies.\nWhat are the dangers of having high blood pressure?\nHow can I reduce the risk of high blood pressure?\nA healthy lifestyle can help prevent high blood pressure. For a healthy lifestyle you should cut down on salt intake and watch your weight, find a weight that is right for you and try to stick to it. You should also give up smoking, drink less alcohol, eat a balanced healthy diet and get regular exercise.\nIf these measures are not successful in lowering blood pressure, then there is a wide range of drugs available to treat high blood pressure. Your doctor will help you decide what treatment is right for you. Some women experience high blood pressure because of the contraceptive pill, your doctor will monitor your blood pressure if you are on the pill. High blood pressure can also occur during pregnancy and usually returns to normal after the birth, always consult your doctor if you are worried.', 'This measures your blood sugar after an overnight fast (not eating). A fasting blood sugar level of 99 mg/dL or lower is normal, 100 to 125 mg/dL indicates you have prediabetes, and 126 mg/dL or higher indicates you have diabetes.\nWhat should my fasting blood sugar be in the morning?\nFasting blood sugar (in the morning, before eating): under 100 mg/dL. 1 hour after a meal: 90 to 130 mg/dL. 2 hours after a meal: 90 to 110 mg/dL. 5 or more hours after eating: 70 to 90 mg/dL.\nWhat should fasting blood sugar be for a diabetic?\nAccording to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines, patients with diabetes should strive to achieve fasting blood glucose levels below 131 mg/dL, and levels following meals below 180 mg/dL.\nWhat should blood sugar be non fasting?\nWhat Are Normal Blood Sugar Levels? They’re less than 100 mg/dL after not eating (fasting) for at least 8 hours. And they’re less than 140 mg/dL 2 hours after eating.\nIs fasting blood sugar 119 high?\nTesting for Pre Diabetes\nThe normal fasting blood glucose level is below 100 mg/dl. A person with prediabetes has a fasting blood glucose level between 100 and 125 mg/dl. If the fasting blood glucose level is to 126 mg/dl or above, a person is considered to have diabetes.\nCan I drink water before fasting blood sugar test?\nFor a fasting blood glucose test, you can’t eat or drink anything but water for eight hours before your test. You may want to schedule a fasting glucose test first thing in the morning so you don’t have to fast during the day. You may eat and drink before a random glucose test.\nIs 130 fasting blood sugar high?\nThe recommended fasting glucose range for a person without diabetes is 70 to 130mg/dL. (The standard for measuring blood glucose is “mg/dL” which means milligrams per deciliter.) If your blood glucose level after an eight-hour (or longer) fast is above 130mg/dL, that’s called fasting hyperglycemia.\nWhat is the highest blood sugar level that is safe?\nThe highest blood sugar level that’s considered safe will depend on the person and whether they have diabetes, but will typically be between 160 to 240 mg/dL.\nNormal blood sugar levels for adults.\n|Normal blood sugar levels for adults|\n|1-2 hours after eating||Less than 180|\nIs fasting sugar 110 normal?\nLess than 100 mg/dL = normal. Between 110–125 mg/dL = impaired fasting glucose (i.e., prediabetes) Greater than 126 mg/dL on two or more samples = diabetes.\nIs 107 high for glucose?\nIn general: A fasting blood sugar level below 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) — 5.6 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) — is considered normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 7.0 mmol/L ) is considered prediabetes. This result is sometimes called impaired fasting glucose.\nWhat is my A1c if my blood sugar is 170?\nAn A1c of 7% is approximately equal to an average blood sugar of 170 mg/dL, with each 1% increase corresponding to an increase of 35 mg/dL in average blood sugar, e.g. a A1c of 8% = 205mg/dL on average.\nIs blood sugar of 135 high?\nA normal blood-sugar range after eating is between 135 and 140 milligrams per deciliter. These variations in blood-sugar levels, both before and after meals, are normal and reflect the way that glucose is absorbed and stored in the body.\nCan prediabetes go away?\nIt’s real. It’s common. And most importantly, it’s reversible. You can prevent or delay prediabetes from developing into type 2 diabetes with simple, proven lifestyle changes.']	['<urn:uuid:c3fbce36-c9f1-4809-8d6f-9c131c877fde>', '<urn:uuid:c713b411-163b-4c25-b857-570e2e6d54b4>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	9	27	1168
79	genealogist researching family records what factors consider record creation background context importance	Understanding a record's background context is crucial before using it for genealogical purposes. You should consider three key factors: 1) The events listed in the record - what specific happenings were being recorded and whether the information is primary or secondary, 2) The locality pertaining to the record - which specific place the record is connected to, and 3) The record's purpose - why authorities created and maintained these records. This understanding allows genealogists to better utilize, interpret and evaluate the information found in those records.	['Creation of Records\nBecause family history depends on finding records about individuals and families, you should understand the nature of the records that you will be searching. In fact, one requirement of the Genealogical Proof Standard is that “the data’s background context [be] considered.” This means, among other things, understanding why and under what circumstances the records were created.\nThis understanding should come before you use data found in the records for genealogical purposes. One professional genealogist comments, “I stress the importance of researching the record type before you use the record for research. Having a clear understanding of how, why, and when a record was created goes a long way in knowing if you are looking at primary, secondary, or later copy of any given record.” Another professional genealogist explains, “It is critical that genealogists appraise the merit of each document studied.” The preeminent book for genealogical source citations rather bluntly states, “We cannot expect to pull a census and scan names or run statistics without thoroughly understanding the circumstances under which that record was created....Every source type has its peculiarities that affect both the meaning and the weight of the evidence we draw from those sources.”\nOnce you understand a document’s background, you are able to more fully utilize the information found in the record. A professional genealogist explained, “If we don’t understand the records, we won’t get all the information from them that we need to answer our research goal.” Another professional genealogist notes, “Since the researcher seeks records with the purpose of learning specific information about a person, group, or family, records are best understood and used according to their content. … It is by understanding the creation, purpose, and use of genealogical records … that excellent genealogists can then effectively use, interpret, and evaluate the information in those records.”\nWhen preparing to gather data from a document, keep in mind these three important pieces of a record’s history:\nEvents Listed in a Record\nMost records were created to register events such as birth, death, or military service. Noteworthy happenings in a person’s physical, social, religious, family, civil, or private life were recorded by various jurisdictions. However, remember that not all information in a source is of equal value. Primary and secondary information can both be contained in one document (e.g., a birth date listed in a death record), so “it is invaluable to know if the information in a document is from primary, secondary, or tertiary sources.”\nThe Locality Pertaining to the Record\nUsually records are connected to a specific locality: a town, county, state, province, region, or nation. In order to find a person in a record, you must know the specific place (usually the town or county) where the person lived when the record was created. Remember that sometimes the place may have changed since the person lived there—it may have a new name or belong to a new county, province, or state. Gazetteers (geographic dictionaries) can help you determine this information. Also, see the discussion of Jurisdictions.\nA Record’s Purpose\nAuthorities create records to serve their organization. The records may describe an event or the size and nature of the population. You can better use information from a record if you understand why a record was made and kept. For example, to use a tax list, you need to know if the government was taxing real or personal property, or every head of household or adult males. Each tax list may include different people and property.\n- Board for Certification of Genealogists, The BCG Genealogical Standards Manual (Orem, Utah: Ancestry Publishing, 2000), 8, 10.\n- Marcia Yannizze Melnyk, The Genealogist’s Question and Answer Book: Solutions and Advice for Maximizing Your Research Results (Cincinnati, Ohio: Betterway Books, 2002), 163.\n- Natalie D.

80	art design education approach differences primary secondary school levels	In primary school (Brynteg), art involves guided teaching using a scheme of work, with experiences including visits by artists in residence, gallery trips, and projects like lantern making and ceramic murals. In secondary education (The Russett School), art and design is taught as a way to stimulate creativity and imagination, providing visual, tactile and sensory experiences, with focus on understanding the role of art in contemporary life and different cultures.	['School Curriculum- Aims, Approaches & Assessment\nWhat is the curriculum?\nThe curriculum is all the planned activities that we organise in order to promote learning and personal growth, development and independence. It includes not only the formal requirements of the National Curriculum taught in classrooms, but also any other activity organised by school, for example, educational visits and any other activities designed to enrich the experience of the children.\nWhat is our vision for how our outstanding curriculum will develop even further in the coming years?\n- Our curriculum will provide a strong element of ‘personalisation’, with a range of different pathways developed to enable each pupil over the long term to reach her/his own potential, whatever that might be.\n- The curriculum will have even stronger relevance for our pupils’ current and future lives.\n- The curriculum will continue to inspire a life-long love for learning.\n- Our broad and balanced curriculum will be highly effective in helping prepare children and young people for life in modern Britain.\n- The curriculum will be significantly enriched and brought vividly to life through a wide range of first-hand learning experiences beyond the classroom.\n- Pupils, where appropriate, will regularly express their needs and wishes in relation to the curricular pathway they follow.\nWhat do we strive to achieve for our pupils to become, as a result of our outstanding curriculum?\n- Successful learners who enjoy learning, make progress and achieve exceptionally well\n- Confident individuals who are able to get on well with each other and live safe, healthy and fulfilling lives\n- Respectful and responsible adults who are well prepared to play their part as law-abiding citizens in modern Britain, valuing equally different faiths and beliefs\nWhich are the most important aspects of children’s learning that underpin the content of our curriculum?\n- Communication skills\n- Personal, Social and Health Education, including healthy lifestyles\n- Physical skills\nWe provide a balanced, broadly based and relevant curriculum which promotes the spiritual, moral, social, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils, preparing them for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life.\nWhat is our overall approach to the organisation, planning and teaching of our curriculum?\nOur partnership with you\nBefore your child starts school, you will be invited to come and see the classroom, meet the teacher and senior members of staff in order to set up a partnership with you that will last throughout your child’s time at school. We place a high value on dialogue and exchange of information with parents/carers because knowing your expectations and priorities for your child is vital for us if we are to plan the best provision.\nThe ‘Big Picture’ for our curriculum\n- a specialist (local) curriculum is provided in the classes for sensory learners\n- thematic approach\n- accreditation and inclusion\n- priority areas\nIn room 10 the pupils follow a curriculum written by staff at Victoria School MSI Unit in Birmingham. There are four phases and eight Curriculum domains:\n- Social relationships and emotional development;\n- Conceptual development;\n- Sensory responses;\n- Understanding of time and place;\n- Orientation, movement and mobility;\n- Ownership of learning;\n- Responses to routines and changes\nThe class follows a termly theme with a focus on whole class, small group and individual work. On the timetable subjects may be identified but also activities such as Intensive Interaction, sensory stories, Rebound Therapy and individual programmes will also be evident.\nRoom 10 Example of 2 Year Curriculum\nIn this class there is an emphasis on multidisciplinary working with staff from Health and the Sensory Service supporting the pupil’s progress and wellbeing. Pupils are assessed using B Squared but also Routes for Learning or the MSI Profiles.\nKey Stage 3\nAt The Russett School we are following a thematic approach to teaching the National Curriculum as this enables pupils to link skills and knowledge taught across the theme. Pupils follow a three-year thematic rolling programme.\nWe continue to emphasise communication skills because they lie at the heart of teaching and learning. We adopt a ‘total communication approach’, drawing, for instance, on signing, Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), Voice Output Communication Aids (VOCAs) and objects of reference. This model enables a shared understanding between adult and learner, without which no true learning can take place.\nLearning activities are organised through schemes of work which are derived from the National Curriculum but adapted to suit the learning needs of the individual. Students are set challenging targets but there is a commitment to fun and enjoyment whilst learning. There are also increasing opportunities to participate in educational visits and extra-curricular activities, for examples in Key Stage 3, pupils may work towards environmental awards which allow more time for learning beyond the classroom.\nHow do we approach and what do pupils learn from different subjects in the curriculum?\n- English: Pupils access a wide range of texts from schemes such as Project X, Oxford Reading tree and Badger Learning Books. This gives a variety of fiction and non–fiction books helping to develop reading range. PM Benchmark is used as a reading assessment tool. Developing pupils’ ability to respond, to listen and to understand lies at the heart of our curriculum.\n- Mathematics: The teaching of mathematics enables pupils to use their awareness and developing understanding of pattern, space, shape and number, to develop problem-solving skills that contribute to making choices, taking decisions and gaining control over their immediate environment.\n- Science: The teaching of Science gives all pupils the opportunity to think and learn, and develop an interest in and curiosity about, the world around them. In particular, science offers pupils the opportunities to use their senses to explore and investigate, to develop an awareness of, and interest in, themselves and their immediate surroundings and environment. We also encourage pupils to participate in practical activities and develop an understanding of cause and effect.\n- Personal, Social and Health Education, including Citizenship and Careers Education: Learning PSHE and citizenship helps all pupils develop as individuals in a wider society. Pupils learn to understand themselves physically, emotionally, socially and sexually and understand their relationships with others. In particular, PSHE and citizenship offer pupils opportunities to make choices and decisions, develop personal autonomy by having a degree of responsibility and control over their lives. Careers is a vital part of the curriculum. From KS3 students are encouraged to think about the world of work and related skills, the curriculum is designed to develop knowledge, skills and learning useful in lifelong learning and work. Presentations from older students who have participated in work experience and talks from visitors give students the opportunity to consider options available. From Year 9 a member of staff from the Young People’s Service attends the annual person centred review meetings to help the student plan for the future and make the most of their life and career opportunities.\n- Religious Education (RE): Religion is the experience and expression of faith. Learning about religion and learning from religion are important for all pupils, as RE helps pupils develop an understanding of themselves and others. RE promotes the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of individuals and of groups and communities. In particular, RE offers pupils opportunities to develop their self- awareness, understand the world they live in as individuals and as members of groups, develop positive attitudes towards others, respecting their beliefs and experience, reflect on and consider their own values and those of others and deal with issues that form the basis for personal choices and behaviour.\nWe are very proud to have been awarded the RE Quality Mark twice- Gold standard.\n- Physical Education (PE): PE gives all pupils opportunities to develop their physical skills and to apply those skills in different situations. It also enables personal and group achievements to be acknowledged. In particular, PE offers pupils opportunities to develop their skills of coordination, control, manipulation and movement, promote a healthy lifestyle and contribute towards their physical development. PE also develops the personal qualities of commitment, fairness and enthusiasm.\n- Computing/Information Communication Technology (ICT): Developing capability in ICT helps all pupils become part of the rapidly changing world in which technology is an essential part. ICT helps pupils take greater responsibility for their own learning, plan and organise their ideas, and produce and present work of a high standard. It can also encourage creativity.\n- Humanities (Geography and History): Learning geography helps pupils develop curiosity in, and an understanding of, themselves, other people and places, and the relationships between them. Learning history helps pupils develop curiosity in, and an understanding of, the past and how their local community has changed. In particular, studying history offers pupils opportunities to develop knowledge and understanding of the sequences, routines and chronological patterns that make up their world.\n- Design and Technology (D&T): D&T provides practical learning experiences which make it accessible to all pupils. Pupils use knowledge and understanding from across the curriculum and apply and consolidate them in practical activities. Pupils carry out practical tasks in which they all can make a contribution to the development of individual or group projects.\n- Art and Design: Art and design stimulates creativity and imagination. It provides visual, tactile and sensory experiences, and is a unique way to understand and respond to the world, and to communicate with others. Pupils learn about the place and role of art, craft and design in life today, as well as in different times and cultures.\n- Music: Music is a powerful, unique form of communication that can change the way pupils feel, think and act. It brings together intellect and feeling and enables personal expression, reflection and emotional development. As an integral part of culture, past and present, it helps pupils understand themselves and relate to others and improves listening, concentration and attention skills.\n14-19, including Sixth Form\nAccredited courses, starting in Year 10, boost learning opportunities and raise achievements in a caring ethos which nurtures positive relationships and fosters the growth of responsible behaviour. All students will have the opportunity to:\n- achieve nationally recognised accreditation through ASDAN by gaining a diploma in ‘Life Skills’ and either an award, certificate or diploma in ‘Personal Progress’;\n- experience the workplace, receive impartial careers guidance and advice, voice their aspirations and work with staff, including our job coach, to achieve them;\n- receive travel training;\n- experience life in the community, e.g. visits to the local post office, library, shops and colleges\n- prepare for adulthood and independent living;\n- develop skills towards economic and personal and social well-being.\nIn the Sixth Form, we continue to deliver a curriculum linked to nationally accredited courses (ASDAN) which is tailored to students’ individual needs, interests and priorities. Our curriculum offers opportunities for our older students to develop their learning, functional and personal skills in real-life settings in school, the workplace and college placements, for instance. Students take responsibility for planning and making lunches, for running the school café and for acting as positive role models for younger students through our “Buddying” scheme.\nOur personalised progression pathways include college links, enabling students to gain real experience of, and be well-prepared for, life after school and make well-informed decisions about their future.\nOur Job Coach works with individuals and small groups to help students to identify and pursue their own career aspirations, offering real life experiences of the work place, an understanding of lifelong learning, and developing skills to enable students to contribute to society.\nHyperlinks to rolling programmes:\nWe use different methods and procedures to check that the curriculum is well-matched to pupils’ needs and achieving what it is designed to do. These include:\n- observations of teaching made by senior staff to see how well the curriculum is being taught and assess the impact that it is making on pupils’ learning and personal development;\n- work done by subject or curriculum leaders on reviews and audits, in order to identify future priorities for curriculum development;\n- analysis of pupil achievement data to check that the curriculum is promoting the best possible progress for learners;\n- questions asked by governors about the effectiveness of the curriculum and about the evidence that school leaders have of its impact on pupils’ learning and development;\n- feedback from parents/carers, so we can take account of their views on how well the curriculum is working.\nHow can I find out more about the The Russett’s curriculum?\nOther ways you might wish to use to find out more include:\n- Making an appointment to come into school to look at relevant documents, such as schemes of work\n- Making an appointment to come into school to talk to a senior member of staff.', 'The Foundation Phase Curriculum\nThe Foundation Phase in all Infant classes ensures a high adult to pupil ratio. It focuses on the holistic development of children.\nThe Foundation Phase places great emphasis on children learning by doing. Young children will be given more opportunities to gain first hand experiences through play and active involvement rather than by completing exercises in books. They will be given time to develop their speaking and listening skills and to become confident in their reading and writing abilities.\nMathematics will be more practical so that children can see how problems are solved and how important mathematics is in their everyday lives. There will be more emphasis on children understanding how things work and on finding different ways to solve problems.\nThe curriculum will focus on experiential learning, active involvement and developing each child’s:\n- Skills and understanding.\n- Positive attitudes to learning so that they enjoy it and want to continue.\n- Self-esteem and self-confidence to experiment, investigate, learn new things and form new relationships.\n- Creative, expressive and observational skills to encourage their development as individuals with different ways of responding to experiences.\n- Activities in the outdoors where they have first-hand experience of solving real-life problems and learn about conservation and sustainability.\nThis framework sets out the curriculum under seven Areas of Learning. For each area the programme sets out what the children should be taught and the outcomes set out expected standards of children’s performance.\nKey Stage 2\nThe children study the following subjects:\nEnglish, Mathematics, Sciences, Geography, History, Technology, Information Technology, Welsh, Art, Music, Physical Education, (P.E) Religious Education (R.E) and Personal and Social Education. (P.S.E)\nThere is a strong emphasis within the school on the teaching of skills through these subjects.\nEnglish is a core subject, which develops pupils’ abilities to communicate effectively in speech and writing and to listen and read with understanding. To ensure parents are involved in the development of their children’s reading, a home school reading record booklet is provided. All parents are encouraged to write regularly in it.\nMathematics is a core subject of the National Curriculum for all pupils. In Brynteg C.P. School we encourage the children to develop a positive attitude towards mathematical processes. The children are given opportunities to develop mental strategies and apply their knowledge and skills to real life problems that occur in many other areas of the curriculum.\nScience is a core subject it builds upon their knowledge and understanding of the world that they begin to study when they come to nursery.\nA Focus on Literacy\nMany initiatives have taken place to support the development of literacy these have included years 4 and 5 working with poet Mandy Coe, years 1 and 2 with author Rob Lewis, years 5 and 6 with author Jennie Dodd, Junior 3’s A Play for a Day and performances from the Bitesize Theatre Company.\nYear 3 and 4 pupils benefited from a literacy course at The Racecourse organised by the Community Foundation. The event was launched by the author Tom Palmer. They then took part in a reading lesson/quiz with a penalty shootout, ground tour and coaching activities at Glyndwr University. Following the launch the schools then completed 5 modules including a library visit.\nThe Foundation Subjects\nP.E. has a lot to offer all pupils in both Key Stages. The children will be involved in dance, gymnastics, games, athletics, adventure activities and swimming. The school makes use of local facilities, such as the Gwyn Evans Swimming Pool. As well as a balanced programme within their class the children can participate in clubs, school teams, and an annual sports day.\nArt and Design\nArt is a foundation subject of the curriculum and is very much enjoyed by pupils in our school.\nThe scheme of work helps to guide staff in their teaching, whilst ensuring breadth and progression over a child’s school year. Children share their techniques in all classes.\nA great deal of time and money has been invested in equipment to give our children a range of experiences. Visits by artists in residence and trips to galleries and other exciting projects take place regularly.\nThis year several classes have worked with artists on a wide range of projects e.g. lantern making, willow design and designing and making a ceramic mural at the front of the school.\nA high standard of artwork can be found displayed in the school, which reflects our commitment to this valuable area and the pleasure it brings to us and our pupils at Brynteg.\nGeography is taught across the school. Children learn about environmental change, different countries as well as their own environment in which they live.\nGeographical skills are developed through teaching around a theme. Pupils enjoy exciting geography based school trips, which involve fieldwork.\nHistory pervades every aspect of our lives and cultures. We believe that the study of history in Brynteg can introduce children to an understanding of the past and how knowledge of the present is informed by the past.\nEvery opportunity is taken to bring history to life. During their time in Brynteg children may visit Roman ruins in Chester, a Victorian school at Llangollen, Erddig Hall, Chirk Castle, the Legacy Centre and many other relevant sites.\nMusic plays a large part in our school life. As well as following a studies scheme in both key stages, children are encouraged to join in extra musical activities such as recorder, drums and guitar. Many children also take advantage of the violin by the authority’s music teacher. Every pupil enjoys the hard work and commitment that goes into producing our annual musicals.\nBrynteg is an English speaking school where Welsh is taught to all pupils as part of the curriculum and incidental Welsh is used throughout the school sessions.\nPersonal, social and health education is taught as a distinct subject. Issues such as community involvement, self respect and respect for others are explored in the sessions.\nSex and Relationship lessons are carefully planned by the class teachers and teach pupils about things which are age appropriate.\nWe use resources recommended by Wrexham Healthy Schools Team called SENSE. If you would like to view the resources we use ask Miss Roberts our subject leader or myself.\nWe believe that educating our pupils through a structured and age appropriate scheme of work is important to their overall development however if you do not want your child to participate in the Sex and Relationships lessons you may contact us and request that your child is withdrawn\nReligious Education is defined as a basic subject in the Education Reform Act of 1988.

81	control methods pesticides harmful bacteria spread by insects olive trees southern europe alternatives	Currently, there are no pesticides available proven effective against Xylella fastidiosa, a pathogen causing diseases in olive trees. The BIOVEXO project is developing environmentally sustainable solutions called biopesticides. These include X-biopesticides targeting Xylella (based on onion extract and antagonistic bacteria) and V-biopesticides targeting the spittlebug insects that spread the disease (based on plant extract, fungus, and microbial metabolite). These solutions aim to be environmentally sustainable and economically viable for integrated pest management.	['Biocontrol of Xylella and its vector in olive trees for integrated pest management\nOlive cultivation in southern Europe is a long-standing tradition, one that has shaped the environment and the culture in many European countries. However, there is a growing threat to this part of history. Xylella fastidiosa is a pathogen that is increasingly causing diseases on olive trees and various other crops in the Mediterranean region. It wiped out a number of olive groves in Italy and Spain in only a few years, while infections have also been detected in France and Portugal. Unfortunately, the climate of the southern European Union is ideal for Xylella, and if the disease continues to spread, it could reduce yields of olive harvests by as much as 70 %.\nCurrently, there are no pesticides available on the market proven to be effective against Xylella, which is spread by xylem-feeding insects – notably the spittlebug – common in the Mediterranean climate. Farmers are often forced to destroy infected plants or use chemical insecticides, damaging incomes as well as organic production. BIOVEXO will demonstrate environmentally sustainable and economically viable plant protection solutions that can be deployed as a method of integrated pest management.\nBIOVEXO’s approach involves developing biopesticides that target Xylella – X-biopesticides – and those that target the insects spreading the disease – V-biopesticides. The X-biopesticide candidates will be based on an onion extract (a food industry by-product) and antagonistic bacteria; the V-biopesticide candidates will be based on a plant extract (also a food industry by-product), a fungus and a microbial metabolite.\nThe overarching objective of the BIOVEXO project is to reduce the pressure and disease severity caused by Xylella in olive cultivation without an adverse environmental impact. This will help protect long-established olive orchards, which are integral to southern Europe’s history and culture. It will also preserve the cultural heritage and jobs provided by Europe’s olive orchards and permit the continuation of organic production methods. It also seeks to prevent Xylella infections becoming established in new olive plantations.\nWithin these, the BIOVEXO project has a number of specific objectives. These are:\n- Optimising production of antagonistic bacteria and onion extract for targeting Xylella (X-biopesticides) for prevention and cure.\n- Optimising production of the active substances targeting the spittlebugs that act as a transmission vector (V-biopesticides) and identifying the best application methods, thus reducing the likelihood of Xylella infection.\n- Upscaling production of the prototypes of X- and V-biopesticides to prepare them for field trials. This involves producing qualities of up to 2000 litres at an industrially relevant scale.\n- Performing large-scale validation of the pesticides as part of an integrated approach to pest management to provide data on efficacy.\n- Determining the mechanistic effects and mode of action of the pesticides on their target organisms.\n- Assessing the sustainability of the pesticides in terms of their environmental impacts over their full life cycle, to prove their superior environmental characteristics over existing solutions.\nBy achieving its overall objectives, the BIOVEXO project will bring potential new solutions to the challenges facing orchard owners in southern Europe. In addition, it will also make contributions to specific BBI KPIs through:\n- Establishing at least two new cross-sectoral interconnections. One will be between the biotech industry, represented by ACIES, and biopesticide producers; the other will be between the biotech industry and the farmers.\n- Creating at least six new bio-based value chains, as each of the biopesticides being developed represents a value chain of their own. Up to four of these will be tested in large-scale field trials.\n- Contributing to developing at least two new products in the form of two biopesticides for large scale production in the coming years (one for Xylella and one for the insect transmission vector).\nIn addition, the BIOVEXO project will have a positive environmental impact, by offering the potential to switch to biological treatment options. While there is a limited amount of data available on the environmental footprint of vector-targeting biopesticides, some measures suggest potential reductions of up to 85 %. For the Xylella-targeting biopesticides, this should prevent the need to eradicate infected plants and the associated environmental damage.']	['<urn:uuid:2db91766-f0b8-436b-90cd-8f094ffe34cb>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	13	72	688
82	metal manufacturing process dangers protection equipment required	When working with AISI 1020 carbon steel, various manufacturing processes like forging occur at temperatures between 2100-2300°F, requiring proper safety measures. For worker protection during hot work processes, proper PPE is essential, including protective apparel, gloves, welding helmets, and respiratory protection. Adequate ventilation and local exhaust systems like fume extractors and exhaust hoods must be provided to keep fumes and gases away from workers' breathing zones. Additionally, eye protection must comply with ANSI/ISEA Z87.1-2015 standard, and proper protective lenses with appropriate shade numbers are required.	"['Alloy Information for AISI 1020 Carbon Steel\n0.18 – 0.23\n0.30 – 0.60 max\nGeneral Characteristics of AISI 1020\nC1020 is a general purpose carbon steel that may be hardened by carburizing.\nAISI / SAE 1020 grade is a general purpose carbon steel suitable for surface hardening. It may, as required, be case hardened, welded and machined. Cold forming may be carried out, preferably from a spheroidized structure.\nForging AISI 1020 Carbon Steel\nC1020 is forged from 2100 – 2300 º F down to a temperature in the region of 1650 – 1750 º F (1150*–1280 º C down to 900 – 950 º C.). The actual forging and finishing temperatures will depend on a number of factors, including overall reduction during forging and complexity of part being forged. Experience alone will determine near exact values for these two parameters. Parts are air cooled after forging.\nApplications of AISI 1020\nThis grade of steel is used for forged motor shafts, hydraulic shafts and pump shafts, as well as machinery parts.\nA significant amount of this grade of steel is used in the as-forged condition, since it shows good machinability in this condition.\nLittle is to be gained, at this carbon level, by a quenching treatment.\nAt this carbon level, annealing after forging may not be necessary, and depending upon the hardness after forging and the complexity of the part being forged, machining may be carried out on the as-forged parts. If parts are of complex shape and hence there are structural variations throughout the part, then normalizing is in order.\nFull annealing of small C1020 forgings is carried out between 1575 and 1650 º F (860 – 900 º C) followed by furnace cooling at 50 º F (10 º C) per hour, to 1300 º F (700 º C) and air cooling.\nNormalizing is seldom carried out on carbon contents at this level, but may be used prior to surface hardening. The normalizing temperature range for this grade is typically 1650 – 1700 º F (900 – 930 º C) followed by air cooling. When forgings are normalized before, say, carburizing, the upper range of the normalizing temperature is used. When normalizing is the final treatment, the lower temperature range is used.\nThis grade of steel is not normally subjected to hardening and tempering treatments as the hardness obtained from such treatments would not warrant their being performed. Carburizing might be carried out at 1620 – 1690 º F (880 – 920 º C,) and carbonitriding at 1470 – 1600 º F (800 – 875 º C,)\nHardening of the carburized case would be performed at 1430 – 1500 º F (780 – 820 º C.) followed by a water quench and a tempering treatment at 300 – 400 º F (150 – 200 º C) to improve case toughness with a minimum effect on its hardness. Case hardness values of Rc 60 may be obtained on carburized C1020.\nFor parts with a diameter less than 2” (50mm) this grade has been found on occasion to show best machinability when normalized. Parts over 2” (50mm) diameter might be machined following forging or rolling.\nThis grade of steel may be welded by all normal methods: low-carbon electrodes are recommended.\nLow-hydrogen electrodes are recommended together with preheat at 300 – 500 º F (150 – 260 º C.) to be maintained during welding, Cool slowly and stress relieve where possible.\nTo Send a Request for Quote, please Click Here, or call 1.973.276.5000 or 1.800.600.9290 or fax 1.973.276.5050.', 'Steering Clear of the Fire and Shock Hazards\nHot work should not be done where flammable vapors or combustible materials exist. Both the work and the equipment being used by the welder should be placed outside any hazardous area.\n- By Jerry Laws\n- Apr 01, 2018\nFires, burns, electric shock, and exposure to welding fume and gases are some of the leading hazards to which welders may be exposed. The protections they require are spelled out in OSHA’s 29 CFR 1910.252, the welding, cutting, and brazing standard; its section (b)(2) specifies eye protection that must be provided.\nThe standard refers to OSHA\'s 1910.133, which contains charts listing the minimal shade numbers needed for protecting welders\' vision and says welders\' lenses must comply with the ANSI/ISEA Z87.1-2015 standard, the American National Standard for Occupational and Educational Personal Eye and Face Protection Devices.\nHot work such as welding, cutting, and grinding can expose workers to the risk of fires when flammable or combustible materials nearby are ignited. OSHA points out that the basic precautions for fire prevention when performing hot work are:\n- Perform hot work in a safe location or with the fire hazards removed or covered.\n- Use guards to confine the heat, sparks, and slag and to protect fire hazards that cannot be moved.\nIn short, hot work should not be done where flammable vapors or combustible materials exist, and both the work and the equipment being used by the welder(s) should be placed outside any hazardous area, according to OSHA. The 1910.252 standard says personnel should act as a fire watch while hot work is being done in locations where:\n- appreciable combustible material—building construction or contents—is closer than 35 feet from the work\n- appreciable combustible material is more than 35 feet away but is easily ignited by sparks\n- wall or floor openings within a 35-foot radius will expose combustible materaisl in adjacent areas, including concealed locations in walls or floors\n- combustible materials are adjacent to the opposite side of metal partitions, walls, ceilings, or roofs and are likely to be ignited\nThe standard also says fire watch personnel must:\n- have fire extinguishing equipment readily available and have been trained on its use\n- know how to sound an alarm in case of a fire\n- watch for fires in all exposed areas, but try to extinguish them only when they are “obviously” within the capacity of the extinguishing equipment that is available; if not, they should sound the alarm\n- maintain the fire watch for at least 30 minutes after welding or cutting is completed, in order to detect and extinguish possible smoldering fires\nThe most common types of injuries sustained by welders are burns and eye injuries. The right PPE for them—protective apparel, gloves, welding helmets, respiratory protection—is addressed in both 1910.252(b)(3) and by 1910.132, OSHA\'s general PPE standard. It calls for employers to perform a hazard assessment, before PPE is selected and worker training commences. Once trained, workers should understand what PPE is needed and when, its limitations, and proper care and maintenance of their PPE.\nAdequate ventilation and local exhaust are required in welding areas to keep the fumes and gases away from the welder’s breathing zone and the general area. Employers should provide a ventilation system, such as fume extractors and exhaust hoods, that will remove fumes and gases from the work area.\nMost welding equipment has a voltage that presents a risk of electric shock. An accident report still available on OSHA’s website describes one fatality in 2005, an electrocution of an employee who was welding trailer gates:\n""He was welding using a Wire Feed, Arc Welding Machine. Employee #2 was in the room, but did not observe what happened. He stated he heard Employee #1 cry out. When he turned around, Employee #1 was on the floor. Other coworkers ran to see what happened and two coworkers started administering CPR. Emergency services arrived, took over CPR, and transported Employee #1 to the hospital, where he later died. An investigation into the incident found that the welding machine was in the \'on\' position, and that the 50 Amp electrical breaker, which served the circuit to the welding machine, had been tripped. It was noted that Employee #1 did not have his welding hood on. He did have his work gloves on, but the welding gun was not in his hand. The OSHA investigation revealed that the electrical conductors (2 hot and 1 neutral), inside of the male attachment plug for the welding machine, were not securely connected to their terminal points. The visible evidence of burns inside of the attachment plug and the melting of the individual strands of the neutral conductor indicated that the neutral conductor came out of its terminal point inside of the attachment plug and it made contact with a hot (energized) wire that was also inside of the attachment plug. This contact allowed current to flow through the neutral conductor and back down to the equipment grounding attachment location, which was on the metal frame inside of the welding machine. The frame of the welding machine became energized and so did any metal parts of the welding machine that were in contact with the metal frame. The welding machine was sitting on the floor next to a tin wall, when the incident occurred. There were two electrical burn marks on the tin wall, which matched up perfectly with two electrical burn marks that were on the side of the welding machine which was facing towards the tin wall. It was believed that Employee #1 made contact with the energized welding machine and he received an initial electrical shock. He either fell against the welding machine, causing it to hit the tin wall or both Employee #1 and the welding machine hit the tin wall. When the energized welding machine made contact with the tin wall, an electrical short circuit would have been created that would be sufficient to cause the fifty (50) Amp circuit breaker to trip out.""\nThe OSHA page titled ""Controlling Electrical Hazards"" (https://www.osha.gov/Publications/3075.html) is a good resource for understanding the causes of electric shock and how to protect workers from electrical hazards through equipment de-energization, PPE, training, and work practices.\nThis article originally appeared in the April 2018 issue of Occupational Health & Safety.']"	['<urn:uuid:f6e7bb27-dc5e-4297-9f7a-42a7ba483102>', '<urn:uuid:6401007a-81fb-49e9-b16f-a22bd44579cf>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	7	85	1641

84	What role do civil engineers play in building maintenance, and how does studying history help improve modern construction?	Civil engineers handle maintenance through government departments that employ direct labor, with contractors also performing maintenance periods after construction. Learning from historical master builders helps improve modern construction by applying their principles of economy, efficiency, and elegance to develop better structural designs and construction methods that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and minimize waste.	"[""Civil Engineering Functions\nThe functions of the civil engineer can be divided into three categories: those performed before construction (feasibility studies, site investigations, and design), those performed during construction (dealing with clients, consulting engineers, and contractors), and those performed after construction (maintenance and research).\nNo major project today is started without an extensive study of the objective and without preliminary studies of possible plans leading to a recommended scheme, perhaps with alternatives. Feasibility studies may cover alternative methods—e.g., bridge versus tunnel, in the case of a water crossing—or, once the method is decided, the choice of route. Both economic and engineering problems must be considered.\nA preliminary site investigation is part of the feasibility study, but once a plan has been adopted a more extensive investigation is usually imperative. Money spent in a rigorous study of ground and substructure may save large sums later in remedial works or in changes made necessary in constructional methods.\nSince the load-bearing qualities and stability of the ground are such important factors in any large-scale construction, it is surprising that a serious study of soil mechanics did not develop until the mid-1930s. Karl von Terzaghi, the chief founder of the science, gives the date of its birth as 1936, when the First International Conference on Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering was held at Harvard University and an international society was formed. Today there are specialist societies and journals in many countries, and most universities that have a civil engineering faculty have courses in soil mechanics.\nThe design of engineering works may require the application of design theory from many fields—e.g., hydraulics, thermodynamics, or nuclear physics. Research in structural analysis and the technology of materials has opened the way for more rational designs, new design concepts, and greater economy of materials. The theory of structures and the study of materials have advanced together as more and more refined stress analysis of structures and systematic testing has been done. Modern designers not only have advanced theories and readily available design data, but structural designs can now be rigorously analyzed by computers.\nThe promotion of civil engineering works may be initiated by a private client, but most work is undertaken for large corporations, government authorities, and public boards and authorities. Many of these have their own engineering staffs, but for large specialized projects it is usual to employ consulting engineers.\nThe consulting engineer may be required first to undertake feasibility studies, then to recommend a scheme and quote an approximate cost. The engineer is responsible for the design of the works, supplying specifications, drawings, and legal documents in sufficient detail to seek competitive tender prices. The engineer must compare quotations and recommend acceptance of one of them. Although he is not a party to the contract, the engineer's duties are defined in it; the staff must supervise the construction and the engineer must certify completion of the work. Actions must be consistent with duty to the client; the professional organizations exercise disciplinary control over professional conduct. The consulting engineer's senior representative on the site is the resident engineer.\nA phenomenon of recent years has been the turnkey or package contract, in which the contractor undertakes to finance, design, specify, construct, and commission a project in its entirety. In this case, the consulting engineer is engaged by the contractor rather than by the client.\nThe contractor is usually an incorporated company, which secures the contract on the basis of the consulting engineer's specification and general drawings. The consulting engineer must agree to any variations introduced and must approve the detailed drawings.\nThe contractor maintains the works to the satisfaction of the consulting engineer. Responsibility for maintenance extends to ancillary and temporary works where these form part of the overall construction. After construction a period of maintenance is undertaken by the contractor, and the payment of the final installment of the contract price is held back until released by the consulting engineer. Central and local government engineering and public works departments are concerned primarily with maintenance, for which they employ direct labour.\nResearch in the civil engineering field is undertaken by government agencies, industrial foundations, the universities, and other institutions. Most countries have government-controlled agencies, such as the United States Bureau of Standards and the National Physical Laboratory of Great Britain, involved in a broad spectrum of research, and establishments in building research, roads and highways, hydraulic research, water pollution, and other areas. Many are government-aided but depend partly on income from research work promoted by industry.\nBranches of civil engineering\nIn 1828 Thomas Tredgold of England wrote:\nThe most important object of Civil Engineering is to improve the means of production and of traffic in states, both for external and internal trade. It is applied in the construction and management of roads, bridges, railroads, aqueducts, canals, river navigation, docks and storehouses, for the convenience of internal intercourse and exchange; and in the construction of ports, harbours, moles, breakwaters and lighthouses; and in the navigation by artificial power for the purposes of commerce.\nIt is applied to the protection of property where natural powers are the sources of injury, as by embankments for the defence of tracts of country from the encroachments of the sea, or the overflowing of rivers; it also directs the means of applying streams and rivers to use, either as powers to work machines, or as supplies for the use of cities and towns, or for irrigation; as well as the means of removing noxious accumulations, as by the drainage of towns and districts to . . . secure the public health.\nA modern description would include the production and distribution of energy, the development of aircraft and airports, the construction of chemical process plants and nuclear power stations, and water desalination. These aspects of civil engineering may be considered under the following headings: construction, transportation, maritime and hydraulic engineering, power, and public health.\nAlmost all civil engineering contracts include some element of construction work. The development of steel and concrete as building materials had the effect of placing design more in the hands of the civil engineer than the architect. The engineer's analysis of a building problem, based on function and economics, determines the building's structural design.\nRoman roads and bridges were products of military engineering, but the pavements of McAdam and the bridges of Perronet were the work of the civil engineer. So were the canals of the 18th century and the railways of the 19th, which, by providing bulk transport with speed and economy, lent a powerful impetus to the Industrial Revolution. The civil engineer today is concerned with an even larger transportation field—e.g., traffic studies, design of systems for road, rail, and air, and construction including pavements, embankments, bridges, and tunnels.\nMaritime and hydraulic engineering\nHarbour construction and shipbuilding are ancient arts. For many developing countries today the establishment of a large, efficient harbour is an early imperative, to serve as the inlet for industrial plant and needed raw materials and the outlet for finished goods. In developed countries the expansion of world trade, the use of larger ships, and the increase in total tonnage call for more rapid and efficient handling. Deeper berths and alongside-handling equipment (for example, for ore) and navigation improvements are the responsibility of the civil engineer.\nThe development of water supplies was a feature of the earliest civilizations, and the demand for water continues to rise today. In developed countries the demand is for industrial and domestic consumption, but in many parts of the world—e.g., the Indus basin—vast schemes are under construction, mainly for irrigation to help satisfy the food demand, and are often combined with hydroelectric power generation to promote industrial development.\nDams today are among the largest construction works, and design development is promoted by bodies like the International Commission on Large Dams. The design of large impounding dams in places with population centres close by requires the utmost in safety engineering, with emphasis on soil mechanics and stress analysis. Most governments exercise statutory control of engineers qualified to design and inspect dams.\nCivil engineers have always played an important part in mining for coal and metals; the driving of tunnels is a task common to many branches of civil engineering. In the 20th century the design and construction of power stations has advanced with the rapid rise in demand for electric power, and nuclear power stations have added a whole new field of design and construction, involving prestressed concrete pressure vessels for the reactor.\nThe exploitation of oil fields and the discoveries of natural gas in significant quantities have initiated a radical change in gas production. Shipment in liquid form from the Sahara and piping from the bed of the North Sea have been among the novel developments.\nDrainage and liquid-waste disposal are closely associated with antipollution measures and the re-use of water. The urban development of parts of water catchment areas can alter the nature of runoff, and the training and regulation of rivers produce changes in the pattern of events, resulting in floods and the need for flood prevention and control.\nModern civilization has created problems of solid-waste disposal, from the manufacture of durable goods, such as automobiles and refrigerators, produced in large numbers with a limited life, to the small package, previously disposable, now often indestructible. The civil engineer plays an important role in the preservation of the environment, principally through design of works to enhance rather than to damage or pollute."", 'Learning from the past to design a better future\nThroughout history, master builders have discovered expressive forms through the constraints of economy, efficiency and elegance, not in spite of them. We have much to learn from their architectural and structural principles, their design and analysis methods, and their construction logics. Inspired by master builders and learning from the past, the BRG aims to provide appropriate assessment strategies for architectural heritage, develop novel structural design approaches for highly efficient and expressive structural form, and propose and implement new and economical construction paradigms.\nTo address the grand challenges posed by climate change, the group’s research follows the motto “strength through geometry” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (particularly embodied carbon) and use fewer virgin resources. By developing innovative, structurally informed bespoke prefabrication strategies and novel construction paradigms employing digital fabrication, construction waste can be minimised and productivity dramatically increased.\nThere is an urgent need to change the way we design and build our structures and to disrupt the construction technologies for architecture.\nRead our paper ""Redefining Structural Art: strategies, necessities and opportunities"" to learn more about what drives BRG research.\nAnalysis of masonry structures\nMuch of our architectural, cultural and structural heritage consists of unreinforced masonry. These historic structures fail mostly due to instabilities caused by large deformations and displacements. The standard structural analysis tools used in engineering practice today are not well suited to deal with these types of structural problems, not in the least because of the unknowable material properties of historic masonry constructions. The BRG develops a robust computational basis for a fully three-dimensional method for limit analysis of vaulted masonry structures with complex geometry. In addition to computational methods, the BRG also studies masonry structures by means of scaled models. Collapse mechanisms can be simulated using an actuated testing table, an optical registration system, and 3D-printed scale models.

Such explicit approaches provide continuous, bi-directional control over both spatial and structural characteristics in a common visual language that is equally accessible to architects and engineers and therefore extremely useful during early shape and equilibrium explorations. Learn more.\nComputational form finding and optimisation\nThe BRG has developed a computational framework that contains several flexible data structures, novel and efficient solving algorithms, and numerous nonlinear optimization and solving procedures. This allows us to develop new (hybrid) solving strategies for equilibrium problems, often significantly improving solving times and robustness compared to existing approaches. Ultimately the computational methods developed have led to novel structural typologies and structural design approaches for highly efficient, expressive forms. They have enabled the extension of our expertise in compression-only problems to other structural systems, such as thin concrete shells, “bending-active” membrane structures, fabric formwork systems, and general spatial systems of forces with applications in bridge design and large-span roofs. Learn more.\nDesign of discrete assemblies\nDiscrete-element assemblies are structures formed by individual units. These range from structures consisting of relatively small units, such as historical masonry structures, to contemporary large-scale assemblies composed of prefabricated, multi-material building parts or entire building units. Favouring no-tension connections, this research extends and develops novel digital design and engineering approaches that address structurally informed discretization (digital stereotomy), stability during and after assembly, and structural optimization of discrete-element assemblies. Learn more.\nFabrication and construction systems\nThe objective of this research is to develop and implement new, economical construction techniques for structural systems with complex geometries. We propose and instigate new paradigms for structurally informed, optimised building processes in architecture as well as innovative structural design strategies that utilise bespoke fabrication. We seek to define mechanisms to intelligently and efficiently include structural performance information explicitly into architectural geometry and digital fabrication algorithms. Imposing structurally informed constraints allows for more holistic design processes that do not detach formal design from limitations on cost, construction, longevity or structural properties of the chosen material systems.\nPart of the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) in Digital Fabrication, the BRG develops structurally informed, optimised building processes in structural design and innovative solutions in prefabrication. Learn more.\nThe BRG does not stop at developing new computational design strategies that generate expressive and efficient structural form but also develops novel solutions to realize these complex shapes. This puts the BRG in the unique position to participate in real construction projects that showcase the innovative structures developed while also feeding valuable insights back into academic research. Choosing projects in both high- and low-tech contexts further forces the adaptation of the developed methods and tools to varied social, cultural, and geographical conditions. Check out the Projects page to see some of our latest research being applied in exciting demonstrators or real constructions.\nInnovation in Teaching\nThe BRG’s research on graphical methods is also applied in the teaching of architecture students at ETH Zurich. Structural design courses are team-taught together with the Chair of Structural Design Prof. Dr. Joseph Schwartz. This collaborative teaching effort, which began in 2015, is funded by an Innovedum grant and seeks to continue the legacy of former ETH educators including Karl Culmann, Karl Wilhelm Ritter, and Pierre Lardy. Particularly through the use of the interactive and dynamic learning and teaching platform eQUILIBRIUM, students gain an understanding of the relationship between the shape of a structure and the forces in it.\nThe goal of all BRG-produced tools and platforms including eQUILIBRIUM, RhinoVAULT and COMPAS is to “whiten the black box,” making the methods and their implementations explicit and intuitive to the user throughout the early stages of the design process.\nProf. Philippe Block founded the Block Research Group (BRG) at the Institute of Technology in Architecture at ETH Zurich in August 2009.\nSince 2014, Philippe co-directs the research group with senior scientist Dr. Tom Van Mele. Tom leads the computational and technical developments, supervises the postdoc team, and advises and supports the PhD candidates on a day-to-day basis. In 2015, Dr. Noelle Paulson joined the direction of the BRG as Administrative Coordinator, adding professionality and organisation to the group\'s working. In 2018, until his sudden passing in summer 2019, Dr. Matthias Rippmann strengthened the direction to coordinate collaborative research projects, supervise the development of demonstrators and establish and deepen multidisciplinary partnerships with industry and external research groups.\nThe BRG is a dynamic research group, with current and past researchers coming from all over the world and from diverse backgrounds. To date, six researchers have obtained a doctorate (Matthias Rippmann, Masoud Akbarzadeh, Diederik Veenendaal, Juney Lee, David López López, Mariana Popescu) of which two receiving the ETH Medal (Matthias Rippmann, Juney Lee).\nKey milestones for the BRG have included:\n- the launch of the teaching platform eQUILIBRIUM (2011),\n- the release of the form-finding tool RhinoVAULT (2013),\n- the development of the low-carbon, lightweight funicular floor concept (2014- ),\n- the opening of the Beyond Bending exhibition featuring the Armadillo Vault at the Venice Architecture Biennale (2016),\n- the release of the open-source computational framework COMPAS (2018),\n- the realisation of KnitCandela (2018), and\n- the construction of the NEST HiLo research & innovation unit (2019-2020).']"	['<urn:uuid:a2edeae0-188c-4405-9ab4-b0cb2a7687b3>', '<urn:uuid:2cefdb9b-a562-4693-b7f9-9e0ec5d7b705>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	18	53	2780
85	what happens applesauce dysphagia patients	Applesauce is a common food in long-term care facilities, but it poses a risk for people with dysphagia because it releases water-thin liquids from the bulk, making it a mixed consistency food. To make it safe, it needs to be thickened - adding 4-6g of thickener in a single serving will stop the separation.	['Ten IDDSI Tips & Tricks That You Need To Know!\nAs the implementation of the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) rolls out across North America and the world, we keep learning new bits of helpful and valuable information. I love sharing these with everyone!\nHere is my latest list of tips and tricks:\nApplesauce needs to be thickened.\nPasta sauce needs to be processed and thickened.\nYou can make a bread product that complies with IDDSI standards.\nThe appearance of what you serve matters.\nExtremely Thick, Level 4 Liquids will make your journey better. They are the best tool for thickening loose wathe liquids AND safely adding moistness to food.\nA simple flow test can provide an excellent correlation to a high-end rheometer.\nA fork is amazingly standardized around the world.\nIDDSI Funnels are so easy to use.\nSupplements are the most difficult liquids to thicken\nSlightly Thick is a thickness for adults.\nA very common snack and food in long-term care facilities, applesauce, has often been served as part of a pureed menu. However, if you stop and think about it, we all know that applesauce releases water-thin liquids from the bulk, posing a risk for those with dysphagia. It is probably best categorized as a mixed consistency food as generally sold. If you don’t believe me, look at this picture:\nAdd some thickener to the apple sauce, and you can stop the separation. We have found that 4-6g of SimplyThick® EasyMix™ in a single serving will stop the separation.\n2. Pasta Sauce\nIn my experience, most commercial red pasta sauces have two issues with them. First, they tend to have some larger pieces– tomato chunks, for example. So, I usually put any sauce in the blender for 10 – 20 seconds to ensure that any larger bits get processed. Second, red pasta sauces are often best characterized as a mixed consistency. They will give off water-thin liquids – which are a risk for those with dysphagia.\nWe have found that adding 6 -12g of SimplyThick EasyMix to a 24 oz jar of sauce will stop the separation.\nIDDSI discovered that regular bread is a significant choking hazard as they developed their diet standards. As a result, regular bread is not allowed on most IDDSI diet levels. My team spent a lot of time in the summer of 2020 creating a pureed bread recipe that tastes great. They came up with a great recipe that you can see here.\n4. The Appearance of Food Matters.\nWe all have heard that we eat with our eyes. Often modified foods are scooped and plopped on plates. It’s not very visually appealing. It doesn’t look tasty. Take some time to shape the food. Make it visually appealing, and people will eat more. And it doesn’t have to be fancy. You can simply form the food with geometric shapes. A poster presentation by Melanie Betz and Rush University Medical Center found their patients consumed 500 more calories per day by merely forming the food into simple shapes. If you’d like a pdf of the poster, let me know in the comments.\n5. Extremely Thick Liquids Will Make Your Journey Better.\nThey are the best tool for both thickening loose liquids AND safely adding moistness to food.\nI’ve written about this before. We have found Extremely Thick, Level 4 liquids to be the most versatile tool for making texture-modified foods. The Extremely Thick liquid will lubricate and moisten. It is not water-thin. But it will mix with water-thin liquids in the food and thicken them.\n6. A Simple Flow Test Can Remarkably Correlate To A High-End Rheometer.\nAccording to a journal article that looked into it, there is a 0.9 correlation between the results of the IDDSI Flow Test and a rheometer. Rheometers cost tens of thousands of dollars. And a syringe can be found for 10 cents. An IDDSI Funnel costs $2.50.\n$2.50 / $10,000 = 1/4,000.\nSo for 1/4,000th of the cost of a rheometer, you can have 90% of the accuracy. Pretty cool!\n7. A Fork Is Amazingly Standardized Around The World.\nDid you know that the space between the tines of a fork are remarkably consistent? Around the globe? As the IDDSI diet standards were being developed, the team assembled a vast array of forks worldwide and found many of them have the same space between the tines -4mm. And with that discovery, they had a tool in many kitchens around the world that would allow people to measure the size of minced food!\n8. IDDSI Funnels Are So Easy To Use.\nThe IDDSI Funnel has a unique design. The concept was to put a funnel on top of a syringe. Why? So you can pour the sample into the IDDSI Funnel without a second syringe. The design is elegant and straightforward and very easy to use. They are available for purchase here.\n9. Supplements Are The Most Difficult Liquids To Thicken.\nSupplements are a cornerstone of nutrition therapy. But their composition is quite varied. As a result, we have found that each supplement needs to be tested with whatever thickener you are using to ensure they are producing the correct thickness at the time of service. We have even found different results with different flavors within the same product line. Other factors that can affect the outcome are the temperature, the time before serving, and the amount of mixing. It’s a significant amount of work upfront, but it will be worth it once your formulations are figured out for your workflow.\n10. Slightly Thick, Level 1, Is A Thickness For Adults!\nSlightly Thick, Level 1 is a “new” thickness with origins in the pediatric world. It was in use before IDDSI, but it had interesting names like “half nectar.” IDDSI adopted it into their framework.\nThere has been some misunderstanding that it is a thickness for pediatrics because it came from the pediatric world. That is not true. It is an IDDSI level and can be used by anyone. One SLP told me that Slightly Thick was her most commonly assigned thickness level. I expect the use of Slightly Thick to increase as people adopt IDDSI.\nHopefully, these ten tips and tricks are helpful for you in your IDDSI journey. If you have any thoughts on other information I should include next time, let me know in the comments!']	['<urn:uuid:136c28a0-b40b-4b9d-afa9-4293bd11b351>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	5	54	1061
86	studying past environments impact on modern problems and native communities involvement in research what changed	The study of past environments and their impact on modern challenges has evolved in two key ways. First, environmental archaeologists argue that understanding past environmental changes is crucial for modeling future outcomes in areas like climate change, land cover change, soil health and food security, though this requires new collaborative methods to make findings practical. Second, there has been a major shift in how research involves indigenous communities, particularly in environmental studies. For instance, in Alaska, traditional ecological knowledge is now incorporated into environmental and climate change studies through initiatives like the Alaska Native Science Commission. Projects involving Native communities have documented traditional knowledge of wildlife behavior, migrations, and climate changes, combining indigenous observations with scientific research to better understand environmental interactions.	"['Archaeologists are increasingly under pressure to demonstrate that their work has impact beyond the discipline. This has prompted some archaeologists — and in particular, environmental archaeologists and palaeoecologists — to argue that an understanding of past environmental changes is essential to model future outcomes in areas such as climate change, land cover change, soil health and food security. However, few archaeological studies have explored how to put research results into practice.\nFilm showing the historic intensive agricultural system at Engaruka, Tanzania.\nThe EU-funded Archaeology of Agricultural Resilience in Eastern Africa (AAREA) project ran from 2014–2018 with the aim of looking at the long-term sustainability of two east African agricultural systems (Engaruka in Tanzania and Konso in Ethiopia). This was undertaken through a combination of archaeological, geoarchaeological, archaeobotanical and modelling techniques with the aim of providing a frank and realistic appraisal of the role archaeology can play in sustainability debates worldwide. The findings on the applicability of archaeological research were published through the generous funding from the NHSF Gold Open Access grant in Internet Archaeology in the article ‘Archaeology has no relevance’.\nArchaeological investigation of historic terracing in Konso, Ethiopia reveals the importance of valley-bottom sediment traps (Image: C. Ferro-Vázquez, et al. Journal of Environmental Management 202 (3): 500-513).\nAdmittedly, the title of the article might seem to imply our findings indicated that archaeology doesn’t have a role to play in the global conversation about sustainability, whilst in fact, the insights we gained showed that it was far more complicated than this. Archaeological results were not particularly relevant to policy-makers and NGOs in their raw state, or even in the form of a written-up scientific article, but the insights gained were of interest. In order to progress from, “Oh, that’s interesting” to the point where the insights can be used, a different way of working is needed. A way that is transdisciplinary and requires the ‘flow of knowledge’ to go in every direction, this may ultimately produce changes in the way we work, the methods we use, and the questions we ask. Enacting this way of working was beyond the limits of the AAREA project, but since the publication of ‘Archaeology has no relevance’ a new project, SOIL-SAFE, has been funded by the Global Challenges Research Fund through the Arts and Humanities Research Council to allow us to develop this idea.\nPolicy brief exploring the potential role of sediment traps can play in soil conservation practices.\nUsing one of the original case study areas (Konso, Ethiopia), SOIL-SAFE will build on the relationships created during the AAREA project. It will bring together those working in archaeology, ethnobotany, development studies, NGOs and those who live and work in the landscape to co-create a method with archaeological insights embedded from the beginning. Knowing how an agricultural system was built and operated over time is clearly relevant to an understanding of its current sustainability, but discussions of future sustainability must include everyone that is invested in this future. As archaeologists we can tell people what happened in the past, but the relevance of this information can only be determined through open conservation with the people that may choose to apply it.\nThe paper ‘Archaeology has no relevance’ is co-authored by Suzi Richer, formerly with National Trust, and Daryl Stump and Rob Marchant of the University of York.', ""New Dynamics of Cultural Research and Representation in Alaska\nAron L. Crowell\nAlaska Natives number more than 90,000 people and speak 20 indigenous languages. This cultural diversity exists against an historical background of cultural repression as well as the contemporary resurgence of indigenous rights, resource ownership, political autonomy and cultural voice. Within this context, the relationship between Alaska Native peoples and cultural researchers from outside their communities has undergone a fundamental transformation. Anthropologists, archaeologists, historians, economists and other social scientists, as well as the universities, museums, agencies and foundations that employ and support them, all stand on a far different footing with respect to Native communities than was the case until even the last decade.\nToday, researchers seek permissions, collaboration and communication as a matter of course. Information is shared with communities and ethical standards of informed consent, indigenous participation, data sharing and respect for privacy are pre-conditions for project approval and funding (see Guidelines for Research, Alaska Federation of Natives; Principles for the Conduct of Research in the Arctic, U. S. Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee and the National Science Foundation; Draft Principles for an Arctic Policy, Inuit Circumpolar Conference.) Alaska Native communities have also prioritized self-representation of their cultures in books, media and museums.\nIn the long history of arctic research, these principles and responsibilities were often unrecognized or ignored. The indigenous critique of traditional social science practice indicts researchers for lack of community review and access to publications, disrespect for cultural values, disregard for restrictions on the use of oral traditions, removal of objects without proper permission, disturbance of burials and removal of human remains for study, failure to reciprocate village cooperation, lack of credit and financial return to Native colleagues and other offenses.\nThe U. S. National Science Foundation (NSF), the leading source of northern social science funding (almost $2 million in fiscal year 2000 through its Arctic Social Sciences division in the Office of Polar Programs), has been highly influential by directing its support toward projects that actively involve the cooperation and participation of local communities (Arctic Social Sciences: Opportunities in Arctic Research, ARCUS 1999). Federal agencies that conduct social science research in the north have also adopted goals and standards that reflect the new priorities. Agency work is coordinated by the U. S. Arctic Research Commission and the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC).\nIn recent years, the NSF supported creation of the Alaska Native Science Commission to encourage collaborative project design in such areas as northern contaminants research and the incorporation of traditional ecological knowledge into environmental and climate change studies. NSF also provides support for the Alaska Rural Systemic Initiative, a statewide effort with the University of Alaska and Alaska Federation of Natives to develop culturally integrated science and mathematics curricula for Alaskan schools. The emphasis is on incorporating local knowledge and Native worldviews into science teaching. The Smithsonian Institution's Arctic Studies Center (National Museum of Natural History) has played a role in establishing new working relationships for research and education with indigenous communities in Alaska, Canada and Russia.\nA few specific areas of active collaborative research may be highlighted in the present context. For example, human interactions with the changing arctic environment are an important focus of interdisciplinary and cross-cultural study. With NSF support, Henry Huntington and the Inuit Circumpolar Conference worked with North Alaskan coastal communities to document traditional ecological knowledge of beluga whales and their migrations. The Marine Mammal Commission (with Caleb Pongawi) has compiled hunters' observations of shifts in whale, walrus, caribou and seabird behavior. Anthropologists with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game cooperated with the University of Alaska and communities in Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet to develop educational films and interactive CD-ROMs about local subsistence practices and traditional knowledge. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, Alaska Nanuuq Commission and Union of Marine Mammal Hunters of Chukotka recently collaborated on an international study of polar bears that relied heavily on indigenous observations. A recent workshop by the Marine Mammal Commission, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and National Marine Fisheries Service focused on linking climate change observations by scientists and Native communities.\nArchaeology provides a window into cultural history and human-environmental interactions in the past. Archaeological sites can be ideal opportunities for collaborative study and community involvement because they are often located near contemporary villages and are easily linked to school programs, training opportunities, local cultural heritage efforts and tribal museums. The National Science Foundation and the Kodiak Area Native Association co-sponsored excavations by Bryn Mawr College at the Karluk 1 site on Kodiak Island, leading to a wide range of educational efforts and foundation of the Alutiiq Museum in 1995. The Utqiagvik Archaeology Project in Barrow (State University of New York, North Slope Borough, National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs) was another landmark project. Research was carried out jointly, including studies made of human remains recovered at the site. Over the past 15 years, many excavations and field schools have featured close cooperation between Native organizations and the National Park Service (especially its Shared Beringian Heritage Program), University of Alaska, U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Arctic Studies Center and other agencies and universities.\nThe on-going process of repatriation under NAGPRA, which requires extensive consultation between outside museums and tribal groups, has created a new awareness of the wealth of Alaskan collections in U. S. museums and around the world. The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History alone holds more than 18,000 ethnological objects from Alaska, of which some portion will eventually go back to the state through repatriation. Others will return through exhibits developed by the Arctic Studies Center (ASC) in coordination with Alaska Native organizations, the Anchorage Museum of History and Art and other partners. An example is ASC's Looking Both Ways: Heritage and Identity of the Alutiiq People, co-developed by the Alutiiq Museum using information provided by Alutiiq Elders and scholars. ASC offers on-going student internships and community scholar opportunities, and over the next two years will work on a major project with Alaska Native consultants to document Smithsonian collections and to produce new exhibits, publications and a web site. The Anchorage Museum's Living Tradition of Yup'ik Masks is another prominent example of community-based exhibition development, and has been followed by further NSF-sponsored study of European museum collections by Yup'ik elders (with curator Ann Fienup-Riordan).\nInformation may be returned in other ways. For example, ASC's Beringian Yup'ik Heritage Project (led by Igor Krupnik, Willis Walunga, Vera Metcalf, and Lyudmilla Ainana) has assembled historical documentary records, notes, maps and genealogical data from the past century of anthropological research on St. Lawrence Island to create a community sourcebook of Yup'ik heritage and history.\nIt is clear that a new paradigm of U. S. arctic social science has emerged in response to broad political, legal and intellectual trends. The opportunities and challenges are both large. Joining local and scientific knowledge in the area of environmental observation is difficult and requires the construction of new interpretive frameworks. An increasingly important issue in cultural research is intellectual property. Research protocols signed with indigenous entities now often call for restricted access to the information gathered, in line with cultural values and fears that it will be misused or misrepresented. To what extent will researchers agree to restrictions on publication? Repatriation entails other unresolved matters that may undermine the collaborative efforts of Native communities and museums, including disagreement over what objects can be defined under the law as sacred or as inalienable because of cultural patrimony. In general, and across all aspects of social and cultural research, collaboration with indigenous communities requires time, willingness to listen, and a commitment to share control and to work toward alternative goals.""]"	['<urn:uuid:34d14d44-ede8-4bea-8052-e9e9012ddfd1>', '<urn:uuid:04be6ee0-29a2-4a4a-bc21-73b0ba919b86>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	15	122	1836
87	scrap tires green building environmental benefits	Using scrap tires in construction offers multiple environmental benefits. It helps reduce waste by repurposing stockpiled tires, while contributing to green building practices that can reduce CO2 emissions by 30% in the building sector. Additionally, using waste materials in construction improves sustainability and reduces the carbon footprint of projects.	['As sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of new buildings becomes more of a priority across the construction industry, experts are looking to discover innovative ways to reuse materials that would in the past have been considered waste.\nUsing waste materials in construction is not only a great way to reduce the carbon footprint of a project but it can also serve as an economical way to improve the safety standards of existent construction.\nA project at the University of Edinburgh Napier School of Engineering and The Built Environment in Scotland headed by Dr. John McDougall seeks to use scrap tires to retrofit buildings to increase earthquake resistance.\nThis concept could potentially reduce earthquake fatalities in the developing world by creating an affordable way to increase the earthquake resistance of existing structures.\nSeismic bike paths\nThe concept came from an unexpected place—bike paths through the Scottish wilderness.\n“We were tasked with the issue of investigating the use of the Response Spectrum Method (RSM) to improve the resilience of bike paths in a very beautiful place called Glen Tress in the Scottish Borders,” McDougall said. “It was during this project that we began to think more about the elastic properties of soils mixed with shredded or chipped rubber particles and how they might offer some resilience to ground borne vibrations, like seismic disturbance.”\nThe concept of rubber soil mixtures for seismic protection has been studied in many different contexts. Increasingly popular in earthquake-prone countries like Japan, adding rubber to soil helps increase buildings’ earthquake resistance by providing them with a more flexible foundation for absorbing seismic shock.\n“It works similarly to the crumple zone of a car or a buffer on a railroad carriage,” McDougall said. “In the former case, the protection or energy absorption provided by crumpling is a kind of one-off payback, whereas the elastic nature of RSM and buffers allows them to manage repeated impacts—i.e., a large number of loading cycles.”\nAdding rubber to soil enables the mixture to reabsorb shocks again and again—a necessity in a situation like an earthquake where a building suffers repeated impacts. McDougall’s team hoped to use this concept to increase the earthquake resistance of existing buildings by installing RSM adjacent to their foundations, increasing the structures’ shock resistance.\nThe idea of using used tires to create the RSM grew out of a desire to craft a method for increasing earthquake resistance that would be easy to immediately put into use in the developing world—and there’s plenty of excess tire rubber to go around.\nScrap tires to the rescue\nFiguring out new uses for scrap tire material has long been a concern for the international tire industry.\n“Going all the way back to the late 1980s, the United States had a problem with scrap tires,” said John Sheerin, director of end-of-life tire programs at the U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association. “Due to the energy crisis, there was some thought that scrap tires would be valuable in the future because they could be used for their fuel value or pyrolyzed or used in some other way. As a result, the United States ended up stockpiling upwards of 1 billion scrap tires across the country.”\nThis led to the creation of scrap tire stockpiles so ubiquitous that even animated comedy television show “The Simpsons” satirized the problem in an episode.\nSince, the industry has worked to increase the use of recycled tire material in a variety of applications.\n“Over the past decade, we’ve worked with our state partners, industry partners, academia and others to help try and grow and put together the market we have today,” Sheerin said. “Not only were we at about 83% in 2017 going to an end-use market, but also the inventory of stockpiles was reduced from in excess of a billion down to about 60 million in 2017.”\n“We think it’s important that we have a wide range of applications for scrap-tire material,” Sheerin continued, “because applications come and go and reusing the material for its valuable properties rather than disposing of it just makes sense.”\nAn economical solution\nFor McDougall, the use of scrap tires to create RSM could be the solution to implementing increased earthquake resistance in the developing world in a sustainable and economical way.\n“Because local soils and waste tires are the raw materials—the latter often stockpiled as a troublesome waste—we believe this concept has great potential in parts of the world that are least able to afford proprietary seismic protection measures,” McDougall said, “such as base isolation or vibration control, which are expensive and difficult to retrofit through damping or structural strengthening.”\n“Shredding/crumbing are processes that are ‘technology-light’ in terms of machine and infrastructure requirements,” McDougall continued, “which means that establishment of the process in the developing world is a manageable option. Indeed, if RSM is pre-bagged, local supervision of installation is encouraged. Thus, RSM offers the possibility of a locally sourced and managed protection measure.”', 'Green building method, sometimes known as sustainable building or even green building, is an approach to building and architecture that favors environmentally sound and resource-efficient methods that last through a building’s lifecycle.\nBenefits of green building: 30-50 % water saving, 20-30 % energy saving, conserves natural scarce resources and generates less waste, enhanced air quality and excellent day-lighting and provides healthier space for occupants.\nThe building sector has the greatest potential to reduce CO2 emissions. Currently, 30% of global CO2 emissions and 40% of global resource consumption is a result of constructing buildings.\nOur main goal is to optimise the environmental performance of a building using a life cycle approach, in which the materials and products used in a building are compared and evaluated for best performance at the building level (life cycle assessment).\nOur expertise spans all phases of a project from conceptual design through construction to project hand-over; in addition to continuous operation and maintenance.\nThe built environment has a vast impact on the natural environment, human health, and the economy. By adopting green building strategies, we can maximize both economic and environmental performance. Green construction methods can be integrated into buildings at any stage, from design and construction, to renovation and deconstruction. However, the most significant benefits can be obtained if the design and construction team takes an integrated approach from the earliest stages of a building project.\nGreen infrastructure can be broadly defined as a strategically planned network of high quality natural and semi-natural areas with other environmental features, which is designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services and protect biodiversity in both rural and urban settings.\nGreen infrastructure is effective, economical, and enhances community safety and quality of life.\nMore specifically green infrastructure, being a spatial structure providing benefits from nature to people, aims to enhance nature’s ability to deliver multiple valuable ecosystem goods and services, such as clean air or water.\nExperience has shown that investing in green infrastructure can contribute to the recovery of Europe’s economy by fostering innovative approaches and creating new green businesses. Green jobs already represent around 5% of the job market.\nGreen infrastructure and sustainability goals are our specialty, and achieving these goals requires technical knowledge and training in varied fields.\nPotential benefits of green infrastructure can include:\n- Provision of clean water\n- Removal of pollutants from air and water\n- Improved air and water quality\n- Protection against soil erosion\n- Improvement of land quality\n- Enhanced and protected biodiversity and ecosystems\n- Reducing waste streams\n- Conserved and restored natural resources\n- Creation of jobs\n- More energy solutions\n- greener cities\n- Better health and human well-being\n- Diversification of local economy\n- Minimized strain on local infrastructure\n- Improved overall quality of life\nClimate change adaptation and mitigation benefits\n- Disaster prevention\n- Flood alleviation\n- Strengthening ecosystems resilience\n- Ecological corridors\n- Landscape permeability\n- Improved habitats for wildlife\n- Reduced operating costs\n- Improved occupant productivity\n- Optimized life-cycle economic performance']	['<urn:uuid:91fa655e-c3f7-4e74-a59f-2b8ed9f0d129>', '<urn:uuid:888f4a5f-235e-46c4-907a-3e8da92ff1d6>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	6	49	1323
88	foucault beauvoir compare views on political activism change over time what influenced them	Both thinkers underwent significant changes in their political views over time, influenced by major historical events. Foucault's political views were deeply influenced by the 1978-79 Iranian Revolution, which was his only first-hand experience of revolution and led him to embrace the concept of 'political spirituality.' Meanwhile, Beauvoir's political transformation was shaped by her experiences during the Nazi Occupation, which revealed to her the political basis of individual freedom. Initially apolitical in her youth, Beauvoir moved towards leftist political engagement after 1945, and by the 1970s had adopted a socialist-feminist position. The two philosophers' changes were reflected in their writings - Foucault's Iran writings marked a turning point in his thought from technologies of domination to technologies of the self, while Beauvoir's political writings from the 1950s-1970s showed her drawing out the consequences of her philosophical transformation.	"[""Throughout his life, Michel Foucault’s concept of authenticity meant looking at situations where people lived dangerously and flirted with death, the site where creativity originated. In the tradition of Friedrich Nietzsche and Georges Bataille, Foucault had embraced the artist who pushed the limits of rationality and he wrote with great passion in defense of irrationalities that broke new boundaries.\nIn 1978, Foucault found such transgressive powers in the revolutionary figure of Ayatollah Khomeini and the millions who risked death as they followed him in the course of the Revolution. He knew that such “limit” experiences could lead to new forms of creativity and he passionately threw in his support. This was Foucault’s only first-hand experience of revolution and it led to his most extensive set of writings on a non-Western society.\nFoucault first visited Iran in September 1978 and then met with Khomeini at his exile residence outside Paris in October. Foucault traveled to Iran for a second visit in November, when the revolutionary movement against the shah was reaching its zenith. During these two trips, Foucault was commissioned as a special correspondent of the leading Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, with his articles appearing on page one of that paper.\nFoucault’s interest in the Iranian Revolution was much more than a journalistic curiosity. His earlier work had shown a consistent though subtle affinity for the Orient and the more traditional social norms of the East, as well as a messianic preoccupation with Eastern thought. Foucault believed that the demise of colonialism by the 1960s had brought Western thought to a turning point and to a crisis. During a 1978 encounter at a Zen temple in Japan, Foucault remarked that this was “the end of the era of Western philosophy. Thus if philosophy of the future exists, it must be born outside of Europe or equally born in consequence of meetings and impacts between Europe and non-Europe” (1999, p. 113).\nLater that year, Foucault went to Iran “to be there at the birth of ideas.” He wrote that the new “Muslim” style of politics could signal the beginning of a new form of “political spirituality,” not just for the Middle East, but also for Europe, which had adopted a secular politics ever since the French Revolution. As he wrote in Corriere della sera in November 1978:\nThere are more ideas on earth than intellectuals imagine. And these ideas are more active, stronger, more resistant, more passionate than “politicians” think. We have to be there at the birth of ideas, the bursting outward of their force: not in books expressing them, but in events manifesting this force, in struggles carried on around ideas, for or against them. Ideas do not rule the world. But it is because the world has ideas (and because it constantly produces them) that it is not passively ruled by those who are its leaders or those who would like to teach it, once and for all, what it must think. This is the direction we want these “journalistic reports” to take. An analysis of thought will be linked to an analysis of what is happening. Intellectuals will work together with journalists at the point where ideas and events intersect. (cited in Eribon  1991, p. 282)\nIn addition to Corriere della Sera, Foucault wrote on Iran in French newspapers and journals, such as the daily Le Monde and the widely circulated leftist weekly Nouvel Observateur. Iranian student activists translated at least one of his essays into Persian and posted it on the walls of Tehran University in the fall of 1978. In spring 1979, the Iranian Writers Association published an interview with Foucault from the previous September on the concept of revolution and the role of the intellectual. All of Foucault’s writings and interviews on Iran are published in English in their entirety for the first time in the appendix to this volume, alongside those of some of his critics.\nFoucault staked out a series of distinctive political and theoretical positions on the Iranian Revolution. In part because only three of his fifteen articles and interviews on Iran have appeared in English, they have generated little discussion in the English-speaking world. But this itself is curious. Why, given the wide accessibility in English of even his interviews and other minor writings, have these texts not previously been made available to the English-speaking public, especially given the wide interest in Foucault by scholars of non-European societies?\nMany scholars of Foucault view these writings as aberrant or the product of a political mistake. We will suggest that Foucault's writings on Iran were in fact closely related to his general theoretical writings on the discourses of power and the hazards of modernity. We will also argue that Foucault’s experience in Iran left a lasting impact on his subsequent oeuvre and that one cannot understand the sudden turn in Foucault’s writings in the 1980s without recognizing the significance of the Iranian episode and his more general preoccupation with the Orient.\nLong before most other commentators, Foucault understood that Iran was witnessing a singular kind of revolution. Early on, he predicted that this revolution would not follow the model of other modern revolutions. He wrote that it was organized around a sharply different concept, which he called “political spirituality.” Foucault recognized the enormous power of the new discourse of militant Islam, not just for Iran, but for the world. He showed that the new Islamist movement aimed at a fundamental cultural, social, and political break with the modern Western order, as well as with the Soviet Union and China:\nAs an “Islamic” movement, it can set the entire region afire, overturn the most unstable regimes, and disturb the most solid. Islam — which is not simply a religion, but an entire way of life, an adherence to a history and a civilization — has a good chance to become a gigantic powder keg, at the level of hundreds of millions of men…. In fact, it is also important to recognize that the demand for the “legitimate rights of the Palestinian people” hardly stirred the Arab peoples. What would it be if this cause encompassed the dynamism of an Islamic movement, something much stronger than those with a Marxist, Leninist, or Maoist character? (this edition, p. 241)\nHe also noted presciently that such a discourse would “alter the global strategic equilibrium” (this edition, p. 241)\nFoucault’s experience in Iran contributed to a turning point in his thought. In the late 1970s, he was moving from a preoccupation with technologies of domination to a new interest in what he termed the technologies of the self, as the foundation for a new form of spirituality and resistance to power. We argue that the Iranian Revolution had a lasting impact on his late writing in several ways.\nIn his Iran writings, Foucault emphasized the deployment of certain instruments of modernity as means of resistance. He called attention to the innovative uses Islamists made of overseas radio broadcasts and cassettes. This blending of more traditional religious discourses with modern means of communication had helped to galvanize the revolutionary movement and ultimately paralyzed the modern and authoritarian Pahlavi regime.\nFoucault was also fascinated by the appropriation of Shi'ite myths of martyrdom and rituals of penitence by large parts of the revolutionary movement and their willingness to face death in their single-minded goal of overthrowing the Pahlavi regime. Later, in his discussion of an “aesthetics of existence” — practices that could be refashioned for our time and serve as the foundation for a new form of spirituality — Foucault often referred to Greco-Roman texts and early Christian practices. However, many of these practices also had a strong resemblance to what he saw in Iran.\nAdditionally, many scholars have wondered about Foucault’s sudden turn to the ancient Greco-Roman world in volumes II and III of History of Sexuality, and his interest in uncovering male homosexual practices in this era. We would suggest an “Oriental” appropriation here as well. Foucault’s description of a male “ethics of love” in the Greco-Roman world greatly resembles some existing male homosexual practices of the Middle East and North Africa.\nFoucault’s foray into the Greco-Roman world might, therefore, have been related to his longstanding fascination with ars erotica and especially the erotic arts of the East, since Foucault sometimes combined the discussion of sexual practices of the contemporary East with those of the classical Greco-Roman society.\nThe Iranian experience also raises some questions about Foucault’s overall approach to modernity. First, it is often assumed that Foucault’s suspicion of utopianism, his hostility to grand narratives and universals, and his stress on difference and singularity rather than totality, would make him less likely than his predecessors on the Left to romanticize an authoritarian politics that promised radically to refashion from above the lives and thought of a people, for its ostensible benefit.\nHowever, his Iran writings showed that Foucault was not immune to the type of illusions that so many Western leftists had held toward the Soviet Union and later, China. Foucault did not anticipate the birth of yet another modern state where old religious technologies of domination could be refashioned and institutionalized; this was a state that propounded a traditionalist ideology, but equipped itself with modern technologies of organization, surveillance, warfare, and propaganda.\nSecond, Foucault's highly problematic relationship to feminism becomes more than an intellectual lacuna in the case of Iran. On a few occasions, Foucault reproduced statements he had heard from religious figures on gender relations in a possible future Islamic Republic, but he never questioned the “separate but equal” message of the Islamists. Foucault also dismissed feminist premonitions that the Revolution was headed in a dangerous direction, and he seemed to regard such warnings as little more than Orientalist attacks on Islam, thereby depriving himself of a more balanced perspective toward the events in Iran.\nAt a more general level, Foucault remained insensitive toward the diverse ways in which power affected women, as against men. He ignored the fact that those most traumatized by the premodern disciplinary practices were often women and children, who were oppressed in the name of tradition, obligation, or honor. In chapter one, we root his indifference to Iranian women in the problematic stances toward gender in his better-known writings, while in chapters three and four, we discuss Foucault’s response to attacks by Iranian and French feminists on his Iran writings themselves.\nThird, an examination of Foucault’s writings provides more support for the frequently articulated criticism that his one-sided critique of modernity needs to be seriously reconsidered, especially from the vantage point of many non-Western societies. Indeed, there are some indications that Foucault himself was moving in such a direction.\nIn his 1984 essay “What Is Enlightenment?” Foucault put forth a position on the Enlightenment that was more nuanced than before, also moving from a two-pronged philosophy concerned with knowledge and power to a three-pronged one that included ethics. However, the limits of his ethics of moderation with regard to gender and sexuality need to be explored and this is the subject of the last chapter of this book.\nAs against Foucault, some French leftists were very critical of the Iranian Revolution early on. Beginning in December 1978 with a series of articles that appeared on the front page of Le Monde, the noted Middle East scholar and leftist commentator Maxime Rodinson, known for his classic biography of Muhammad, published some hard-hitting critiques of Islamism in Iran as a form of “semi-archaic fascism” (this volume, p. 233). As Rodinson later revealed, he was specifically targeting Foucault in these articles, which drew on Max Weber’s notion of charisma, Marx’s concepts of class and ideology, and a range of scholarship on Iran and Islam.\nIn March 1979, Foucault’s writings on Iran came under increasing attack in the wake of the new regime’s executions of homosexual men and especially the large demonstrations by Iranian women on the streets of Tehran against Khomeini’s directives for compulsory veiling. In addition, France’s best-known feminist, the existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, protested the Khomeini regime’s suppression of women’s rights and sent a message of solidarity to Iranian women (this volume, pp. 246-247). However, Foucault refused to respond to the new attacks, issuing only a mild criticism of human rights in Iran that refrained from any mention of women’s rights or gay rights, before lapsing into silence on Iran."", 'Q: The previous books in The Beauvoir Series cover Simone de Beauvoir’s philosophical writings, student & wartime diaries, and literary writings. How did you decide to place her political writings at this point in the series?\nSimons: The volumes, while organized thematically, also reflect a certain chronological development in Beauvoir’s work. Her most explicitly philosophical writings come earliest in her body of work. So the volume of philosophical writings reflects her early intense focus on philosophy beginning in the 1920s during her years as a philosophy student and extending through her post-World War II articles in existential ethics.\nAlthough Beauvoir continued to work in philosophy, as is evident, for example, in her life-long interest in the problem of writing philosophy in literature, that interest is not as explicit in her later writings. Indeed, beginning in 1958 she paradoxically sought to\nerase all references to her work in philosophy from her autobiography–an erasure that only became apparent with the publication of our volume of her 1926-27 student diaries. As primary sources the texts in these volumes are providing invaluable for dismantling the autobiographical narrative that has long dominated Beauvoir scholarship.\nBeauvoir’s work in literature, unlike her contributions to philosophy, is well known and our volume of her literary writings includes texts from throughout her life, including a new translation of her 1944 play, “The Useless Mouths;” a beautiful, recently discovered novella from the 1960s, “Misunderstanding in Moscow;” and a set of handwritten “Notes for a Novel,” tentatively dated 1928, which we found housed in the archives of the University of Wisconsin library. A manuscript of the 1928 novel, itself, by the way, was recently found and is now being edited for publication by my co-editor of the Beauvoir Series, Sylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir. It will be very interesting to write the novel in the light of the brilliant analysis of the “Notes” that Meryl Altman wrote for our volume.\nThe texts included in our volume of Beauvoir’s political writings, on the other hand, date primarily from the 1950s-1970s, reflecting the dramatic transformation in her thought brought on by her experiences of the Nazi Occupation–and recounted in her Wartime\nThe Occupation revealed to her the depth of both her emotional and political dependence on others, demonstrating the political basis of an individual freedom that she had taken for granted. The political writings in our volume show Beauvoir drawing out the consequences of this dramatic philosophical transformation.\nQ: How did Simone de Beauvoir’s political ideas change over the course of her lifetime?\nSimons: As a young woman, Beauvoir was resolutely apolitical, rejecting any concern with “the earthly kingdom,” a consequence of both her deeply religious upbringing and her rebellion against her politically conservative parents. The defiant individualism she embraced in the 1930s–following a long tradition in French philosophy–culminated in her pre-war masterpiece, the metaphysical novel, She Came to Stay, in which the female protagonist, a solipsist, resorts to murder to solve “the problem of the Other.”\nIn the first articles in Political Writings–reports from 1945 of the plight of the poor among the wealthy classes of fascist Spain and Portugal–we see Beauvoir defining a leftist political engagement that would endure throughout the rest of her life.\nThe Second Sex (1949), which laid the philosophical foundations for the 1960s radical feminism of the women’s liberation movement, reflects this leftist political engagement and Beauvoir was shocked that it was attacked not only by the political right but also by\nDuring the 1950s, as a resurgent political right led France in futile battles to retain control of its colonies, and French intellectuals struggled for political relevance in a world defined by the Cold War between the US and the USSR, Beauvoir moved further to the left\npolitically. By the 1970s, when Beauvoir became actively involved in the French women’s liberation movement, she had moved, philosophically, from radical feminism to a socialist-feminist position.\nQ: Are there any essays in the book that substantially challenge what we know about Simone de Beauvoir?\nSimons: The essays as a whole–revealing the depths of Beauvoir’s political commitment–challenge the traditional view that she simply followed Sartre politically. Also I hadn’t realized until editing this volume how far left she had moved politically during the Cold War or how deeply rooted her feminism was in progressive politics.\nBeauvoir’s lengthy articles from the 1950s analyzing conservative thought were another surprise for me, challenging my reading of her autobiographies. “Must We Burn Sade?” for example, in which she defends the Marquis de Sade, a misogynist 18th century pornographer, as a ‘great moralist,’ still shocks me. But, read in the context of her analysis of right-wing thinkers, it suggests a critical reflection on her own earlier ethical egoism celebrated in She Came to Stay.\nAnd “Right-Wing Thought Today,” often criticized for the stridency of Beauvoir’s political critique, now (given US politics in 2012) seems insightful and politically relevant in its close reading of conservatism. But her analysis also reveals striking similarities with Beauvoir’s own thought, i.e. her early idealism, ethical egoism, and preoccupation with death, which might explain the harshness of her attack and provide a new political context for reading her autobiographical writings that followed (1958-1963).\nFinally, the volume confirms the importance of Beauvoir’s work on the concept of ‘situation’ as grounding embodied consciousness in a world shaped by politics and economics. The volume concludes with an amazing 1974 documentary film script, “A Walk through the Land of Old Age,” that contrasts Beauvoir’s own privileged situation of aging to expose of the treatment of the aged poor in France.\nQ: What is coming next in the series?\nSimons: Two of the most anticipated volumes in the series are coming next. The volume of Beauvoir’s feminist writings, which reveals a feminist political engagement that stretched unbroken from The Second Sex through the 1950s and 1960s, challenges the view that Beauvoir only became a feminist with the arrival of the women’s liberation movement in France in 1972.\nThen we’re publishing the much anticipated second volume of Beauvoir’s student diary, from 1928-1930, with accounts of meeting Sartre in 1929 and their famous argument in the Luxembourg Garden, which has been read (based on the autobiography) as explaining Beauvoir’s subsequent withdrawal from philosophy. But, in fact, the diary suggests that the argument instead ignited Beauvoir’s intellectual aggression and spurred her to success in the oral exams for her graduate degree in philosophy.

89	what surveys say favorite color world	According to decades of questionnaires by experts and US and European public opinion polls, blue is consistently shown to be the most popular color. It is chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favorite color. This preference for blue has transcended gender, generation, and cultures, remaining constant over millennia.	['“A certain blue penetrates your soul.”\nWhy is blue so compelling? As a color, as a state of mind, as an artifact, as symbolism—blue continues to captivate us today as never before. For jewelry designers, no poll or survey is needed, we just know—the blues of lapis lazuli and turquoise are beloved to both designer and customer.\nBut there have been polls and surveys. Many! And the results are clear. Decades of questionnaires by experts in the field have shown that blue is the most popular color.\nThis fervent love for the dreamy hue has transcended gender, generation, cultures, and remained “true blue” over millennia of time. For example, it’s hard to find a bluer blue than the ancient Ishtar Gate of Babylon. (circa 575 B.C.E.)\nBlue is the color of Cleopatra’s favorite eye shadow, the color of Smurfs, and the color of dad’s work shirt. In wedding lore it is the “something blue” of fidelity and faithfulness; in politics it is the color of independence and freedom.\nEven the famous Hope Diamond is actually blue.\n“In US and European public opinion polls [blue] is the most popular colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour.”wikipedia\nAs I researched this topic, I quickly realized that blue is much hotter than red! And the term “purple prose” came to mind, for it is difficult to describe a color so embedded in fashion, design, music, chemistry, physics, archaeology, ancient history, romantic lore, states of mind… without resorting to a few too many lavish adjectives.\nSo here are some quick stats:\nIn the ancient world, lapis lazuli was the the most beloved of stones.\nThe deep hues of lapis lazuli have been likened to both sea and sky, and it is a stone with the longest history of enchantment. The enigmatic poem–The Descent of Inanna–is some four thousand years old. Whomever Inanna, aka Ishtar, actually represented in the ancient world, she must have been one fierce woman you wouldn’t want to tangle with! Still, when she had a job to do, she put on her jewels “of ladyship“, the stones of lapis lazuli.\nRadiance she placed upon her countenance,\nThe . . . rod of lapis lazuli she gripped in (her) hand,\nSmall lapis lazuli stones she tied about her neck,\nSparkling stones she fastened to her breast\nAll the garments of ladyship she arranged about her bodyThe Descent of Innanna, ancient Mesopotamian poem\nA thousand or so years later after this remarkable epic poem was written, the ancient Egyptians still loved blue so much that they devised a way to create a pigment. It is simply called Egyptian Blue, created circa 2500 BCE, and thought to be the first pigment ever made. The color has survived not only the kiln but then the subsequent thousands of years of lying around in dusty tombs!\nWhy would they make what they called “artificial lapis lazuli”?\n‘The ancient Egyptians held the color blue in very high regard and were eager to present it on many media and in a variety of forms. They also desired to imitate the semiprecious stones turquoise and lapis lazuli, which were valued for their rarity and stark blue color. Use of naturally occurring minerals, such as azurite, to acquire this blue, was impractical, as these minerals were rare and difficult to work. Therefore, to have access to the large quantities of blue color to meet demand, the Egyptians needed to manufacture the pigment themselves.’wiki\nThe first blue pigment ever made is thousands of years old; the brilliant invention was created by the Egyptians; it is a lovely greenish blue. This ancient hippo (left) shows the unique shade, as well as the durability of this colorful glaze. Items such as this hippo were buried with the honored dead.\nThe technique the Egyptians used for creating this stable color pigment has been lost.\nHow did blue go from being the color of an elite few–the monarchy, the rich, and the revered dead–to being a color synonymous with the working man, and the subsequent association with terms like “blue collar”? By the eighteenth century blue had become the color of freedom, and the uniform of protest for those wanting to throw off the yoke of the monarchy. The road to liberty was most often paved by workers in blue uniforms, waving blue flags.\nLevi Strauss, and his iconic denim blue work pants, entered the picture about 1873. And while we love our faded denim blues, we don’t love it when our blue jewelry fades! Can a rock really fade? The answer is yes!\nJewelry designers of today who work on a tight budget are well familiar with the manufactured kinds of turquoise. Dyed howlite or magnesite are color treated, and those colors can fade. Lapis lazuli and turquoise–if they are the real deal– should not fade, but other natural blues are not so permanent. (see below, and here)\nLapis lazuli is so color stable, in fact, that it has been ground and used to create color pigments in medieval times. Jewelry designers of today may shudder to think of grinding up their precious lapis lazuli beads, but this technique resulted in some of our favorite paintings of history.\n“Jewelry designers of today may shudder to think of grinding up their precious lapis lazuli beads….”\nUltramarine blue—a pigment made from this powdered lapis lazuli— was the finest and most expensive paint used by Renaissance painters. For the medieval artists, this blue symbolized holiness and humility and was reserved solely for sacred subjects, such as the robes of the Virgin Mary. Interestingly, Michelangelo couldn’t afford this blue paint, with the result that some of his work went unfinished. When he was commissioned to paint the Sistine Chapel, the Pope willingly funded his work so obtaining that precious blue was no obstacle.\n“Ultramarine blue is a glorious, lovely and absolutely perfect pigment beyond all the pigments. It would not be possible to say anything about or do anything to it which would not make it more so.”Cennino Cennini, 15th century artist\nThe artist Johannes Vermeer, on the other hand, must have had a wealthy patron, for he used this precious pigment of blue on subjects other than the sacred. The famous “Girl With the Pearl Earring” should, perhaps, have been named “Girl With the Blue Turban”, for the presence of this expensive lapis lazuli pigment has been found to have been used in rendering the delicate blue of her scarf, making the potential symbolism of the painting even more mysterious.\nIn the Middle Ages, lapis lazuli could only be found in what is now Afghanistan. By the time the powdered stone reached central Europe through a complex trade network spanning thousands of miles, study co-author Beach says, it was worth more than its weight in gold. The vivid blue lapis pigment produced was so precious medieval artists and manuscript illuminators reserved it for the most important subjects.National Geographic\n(For an extra tidbit on this topic of ultramarine, see below, where there is a link to a video of how this expensive pigment was produced.)\nWhat is your favorite blue gemstone to design with, or wear? What is your favorite shade of blue? Perhaps you might find it here, in this chart of various blues. I’d have to say Tiffany Blue, from the chart, is a personal favorite. And I haven’t even begun to discuss another one of my favorites–cobalt blue–but that will be left for a different article.\nI hope you enjoyed this discussion of blue!']	['<urn:uuid:d6b31971-c408-4c3c-865d-ebab15130bb3>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	6	53	1256
90	i work at fish hatchery what sperm to egg ratio needed for fish fertilization	In hatcheries, traditionally a sperm to egg ratio of 4-6 million sperm cells per egg is used, which is more than enough. However, through precise measurement and careful dilution, this ratio can be reduced to 1.5 million sperm cells per egg, allowing the available milt to be used for 3 or 4 times as many eggs.	['GLOBAL - Cryogenetics is helping to increase fish numbers through its milt preservation and fertilisation technology, and also through its diverse gene bank. These services can offer assistance to both aquaculture and wild fish stocks, writes Lucy Towers, TheFishSite Editor.\nAs innovators and industry leaders in cryopreservation of aquatic genetics, the company’s biggest service is the cryopreservation of milt. This technology freezes the milt at extremely low temperatures so that it does not degrade, allowing it to be used at a later date when it is needed for fertilization.\nThe ability to cryopreserve milt is a valuable tool for hatcheries. As well as this, hatcheries can also improve their fish through Cryogenetics’ improved fertilization service.\nThe company is able to maximise the available output of a population through precise measurement.\n“Our SDM6 Photometer measures sperm density precisely in billions of sperm cells per ml of milt. We know that it only takes one sperm to fertilise an egg but in the natural world, there are many millions of sperm cells made available for each egg. In hatcheries traditionally you would find a sperm to egg ration of 4-6 million which is more than enough to do the job. We take that precise measurement and through careful dilution, we can take that ratio down to 1.5 million sperm cells per egg,” explained Russell Ferguson, Aquaculture Manager for Cryogenetics.\n“This means that the milt available can be used for 3 or 4 times as many eggs. This is very significant where you have few elite males and you want to grow your populations with the best genetic material.”\nCryogenetics stores the cryopreserved milt in containers called “SquarePacks®”. These quick thawing containers hold the exact amount of frozen milt to fertilise the same number of eggs each time, thereby offering consistency of results and allows for good planning.\nIn terms of fertilization, Cryogenetics has a range of products that help improve the fertilisation results of many freshwater and marine species.\nThe AquaBoost® range of products to maximize and improve fertilisation includes; dilutors to get the perfect sperm to egg ratio, activators to “turbocharge” the sperm cells and extenders to keep sperm fresh for several weeks.\nAlongside its fertilisation work, Cryogenetics also offers gene banking.\nGene banking is a vital resource that allows a genetic back up for original genetic stock and back-up for a specific genetic enhancement or variation.\nMr Ferguson explained: “If there is a parasitic outbreak such as Gyrodactylus Salaris in a river, then the river is disinfected and all fish species will be killed. By removing the salmon milt before the river is treated and freezing it, when the river is ready to sustain healthy fish again, the original genetic source can be returned.”\nSimilarly, milt can also be frozen until it is needed when eggs become available. It also allows for specific milt from a male to be crossed with specific traits from a female to produce offspring that have all the traits that you are looking for.\nMost importantly, Cryogenetics’ gene banking offers the ability to return a species to a desired point in its genetic history.\nIt provides the assurance that you can return to a specific point in time with the preferred genetic and trait selection.\nThis is a very useful tool as breeding programmes can occasionally drift too far away from the desired outcome, explained Mr Ferguson. It therefore allows you to return to your chosen route.\nOperating in Canada, the UK, USA, Chile and Norway, the company can collect, freeze and store sperm from: Atlantic salmon, coho salmon, chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, rainbow trout, brown trout, brook trout, Arctic char, sablefish, halibut, zebra fish, lumpsucker and several more species.\nWild Fish Enhancement\nThese services offered by Cryogenetics are not only useful to fish farms, they are also fundamental to the enhancement of wild fish stocks.\nEnhancement aquaculture is an important management tool for rescuing or building up stocks of wild fish that are under threat or for helping repopulate areas which may have lost fish populations through disease, overfishing, habitat destruction or other environmental challenges.\nAlso called restoration aquaculture, enhancement aquaculture is all about enhancement of fish or shellfish stocks by releasing into the wild juveniles that have been raised in hatcheries.\nHatcheries capture adult fish in the wild that are ready to spawn and strip them of sperm and eggs, and then where possible, release the adults back into the water systems.\nThe eggs are then fertilised and developed in the hatchery. When the juveniles become an appropriate size they are then released into the wild.\nAs well as giving the fish a good start, Cryogenetics’ work also makes sure that the fish they release are optimum in terms of their performance, fitness and genetic make-up to suit the changing environment.\nExplaining the benefits of raising the juveniles in the hatchery, Mr Ferguson stated: “In the wild, the most vulnerable stage of the fish life cycle is during the period from egg to juvenile. Enhancement hatcheries therefore offer increased survival rates for the juvenile stage as the fish and environment in the hatchery are closely monitored; there is abundant food containing the correct nutritional requirements and most importantly, there are no predators.”\nCryogenetics is currently carrying out this important restoration work in various locations across the world.\nIn Italy, the company has been working for several years with a government sponsored stock recovery programme to help recover stocks of marble trout (Salmo marmoratus) whose genetic purity is at threat due to its breeding with native brown trout.\n“Through working closely with the programme, we were able to select pure species males and females from the populations and apply our products and techniques to improve the fertilisation rate and juvenile output by many thousands,” explained Mr Ferguson.\n“We also cryopreserved sperm from the species so that it can be used in subsequent fertilisations. This acts not only as a fertilisation tool but also as “insurance” within a gene bank in case the population is threatened further. To date in our gene bank, we have sufficient milt from a whole range of males to reproduce in excess of 150,000 juveniles of sufficient biodiversity to maintain a healthy population.”\nSimilarly, Cryogenetics is also working with tribes of the First Nations on the west coast of Canada to help conserve Pacific salmon.\n“The pacific salmon have particular cultural significance within the First Nations and they have consulted with us to enhance the population as well secure the future of the species through improved fertilisation and cryopreservation of genetic material,” explained Mr Ferguson.\n“Through creating larger and stronger populations of Pacific salmon, they will return year after year to spawn in the same river system and this helps to create year-round valuable employment for First Nation people.”\nFor more information on Cryogenetics and its products, please visit http://www.cryogenetics.com/']	['<urn:uuid:a11ac0e3-5ed5-4085-8c64-487e0439fb59>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	14	56	1140
91	What are the main differences between bacteriophages and probiotics in treating bacterial infections, and how do they work differently in our bodies?	Bacteriophages and probiotics work in fundamentally different ways to address bacterial issues. Bacteriophages are viruses that specifically target and kill harmful bacteria by attaching to their surface, injecting their DNA, and destroying them from within. They are highly specific, self-eliminating when their target bacteria are gone, and can evolve quickly to combat bacterial resistance. In contrast, probiotics are beneficial microorganisms that naturally exist in our bodies and work by helping to break down food, protect against pathogens, regulate the immune system, and produce vitamins. They help restore balance to the gut microbiota, particularly when beneficial strains like Lactobacilli or Bifidobacterium are lost due to factors such as antibiotics or infections.	['Bangalore-based GangaGen is currently in the process of developing a bacteriophage-based antibiotic drug potent enough to destroy resitant strains of bacteria.\nNamed StaphTame, Gangagen’s P128 is a recombinant protein meant for the topical prevention and treatment of Staplylococcal infections, including infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).\nMRSA is a bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics. MRSAs, normally acquired from hospitals, often cause serious, and even fatal, infections.\nMRSAs are getting increasingly resistant to more and more available antibiotics including to even vancomycin – the treatment of last resort.\nGenerally, MRSAs spread from infected patient’s nose and 30-50% of the population carries S. aureus in their nose.\nAs much as 125,000 total and 95,000 invasive methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 165,000 methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) infections and 19,000 deaths occur due to MRSA each year, in US alone. Most of these deaths are due to healthcare-acquired MRSA infections.\nGangaGen is currently testing StaphTame in pre-clinical toxicology studies in the final stages. The P128 protein has been tested against over 200 strains of S. aureus, more than half of which are methicillin-resistant. The data showed that StaphTame and has proved capable of killing 56 Japanese isolates, 119 Indian isolates and 8 Canadian isolates.\nStaphTame, which contains P128 protein was developed based on a key protein from bacteriophage. When phages first interact with a bacterial cell, they damage the cell wall in order to insert their genetic material.\nGangaGen has identified the active portion of the phage molecule that causes this damage, and coupled it with another protein sequence that allows binding to the surface of Staphylococcus.\nThe hybrid molecule is capable of binding to, and damaging the surface of, all strains of S. aureus tested. This damage results in the death of the bacteria.\nNo dose-limiting toxicities have been seen in these studies. the company has already planned Phase 1/2 study that will include safety, dosing, and preliminary efficacy.\nGangaGen has completed formulation with StaphTame for intranasal use and has scaled up manufacturing to support clinical studies.\nThe company also held a pre-IND meeting in March, 2010 with the US FDA exploring the possibility of filing the StaphTame as a new drug to treat resistant bacteria.\nWhat is a bacteriophage antibiotic?\nBacteriophages are viruses that parasitize and kill bacteria. Bacteriophages are highly specific, naturally occurring agents that enter bacteria and destroy them.\nBacteriophages are used to cure diseases particularly where antibiotics have proven to be either ineffective or where the disease-causing bacteria have built resistance against the prescribed antibiotics.\nA bacteriophage attaches itself, through specific receptors, to the surface of the host bacterial cell and injects its nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) into the bacterium. The bacteriophage DNA redirects the bacterial cell’s biosynthetic machinery to produce hundreds of new bacteriophages which, when released, destroy the bacterial cell.\nThe new bacteriophages invade other bacteria in the vicinity and the process is repeated about every thirty minutes until all of the bacteria are eliminated. At this time, the bacteriophages, being non-living entities, self-eliminate because the bacteria that they require as hosts no longer exist.\nIn addition to treating bacterial diseases, bacteriophage preparations can be used as prophylactics to control or prevent epidemics.\nBacteriophages have been found safe for treating a variety of infections. They are non-toxic and cannot act on anything except the bacteria to which they can attach and into which they can inject their nucleic acid.\nBacteriophages will specifically target the harmful bacterium, eliminate it, and leave the beneficial bacteria intact.\nBacteriophages are non-living entities. Bacteria can cause disease partly because they are living entities that feed on other living organisms e.g. humans, animals, plants, etc.. Bacteriophages cannot cause disease to humans, animals, or plants; they can only cause harm to bacteria.\nUnlike antibiotics, bacteriophages evolve with bacteria to combat bacterial resistance. Resistance to bacteriophages appears to be limited so far.\nBacteriophages have a distinct advantage over antibiotics in overcoming resistance because bacteriophages evolve faster than bacteria and those that develop against resistant bacteria can be isolated in days or weeks.\nGangaGen, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on the development of proprietary products for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections, particularly infections that are resistant to antibiotics. The Company’s technology has arisen from its studies of bacteriophage, nature’s antibiotics.', 'Article written by Matthieu Marfoglia, fourth-year Master’s Student in Biosciences at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon.\nWhat are the differences between prebiotics and probiotics?\nProbiotics are beneficial microorganisms naturally present in our bodies. Prebiotics are nutrients for these microorganisms and improve their growth and survival rate.\nHow do they function and how are they beneficial for me?\nThe digestive system is mainly made of microorganisms with very different roles: they help to break down and digest food, protect us from pathogens, regulate our immune system and produce vitamins.2 A number of studies show that microbiota imbalance and the loss of certain beneficial strains, in particular bacteria from Lactobacilli or Bifidobacterium strains, can lead to digestive problems or a weakening of our immune system. Microbiota imbalance can have several causes such as a diet lacking in variety and diversity, antibiotic use or even certain gut infections.\nProbiotics and prebiotics are a way of repairing, restoring and preventing the loss of these strains important for both digestion and the immune system. The different strains found inside the products will be able to recolonize the gut and re-establish the functions needed to ensure that we stay in good health.\nWho are these products aimed at?\nThroughout our lives, microbiota are an essential part of our bodies – Immunity Support and Bioharmony Balance are aimed at individuals of all ages and help to maintain or restore a healthy and balanced gut flora.\nWhy should I take them?\nNumerous studies now show that gut microbiota imbalance is linked to a number of problems such as difficulties with digestion or intolerances to certain foods, but also to the deregulation of the immune system as well as to allergies. Therefore, it is essential to replenish and restore the most beneficial strains – prevention is the most effective method! Once certain strains have been lost, other strains take their place and it is therefore in fact easier to prevent microbiota deregulation and imbalance than it is to restore it. In order to restore the beneficial strain, it needs to be sufficiently resistant to take the place of the microorganisms now residing in its place.\nWhat are the different strains and what are they made of? What are their roles?\nBioharmony Balance combines both probiotics and prebiotics. It contains 3 strains: Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Lactobacillus Casei, Streptococcus Thermophilus as well as fructo-oligosaccharides in order to support growth and ensure survival. Clinical studies have shown that these strains improve digestive comfort by reducing bloating, abdominal pain, constipation and also by improving intestinal transit. 3,4,5\nImmunity Support also combines probiotics and prebiotics. It contains 4 strains: Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Lactobacillus Rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium Animalis Lactis, Bifidobacterium bifidum as well as Vitamin D. Clinical trials have shown that these strains reduce both intestinal and respiratory infections by strengthening the immune system and also improve allergic responses by reducing swelling and certain symptoms. 6,7,8\nHow should they be taken? How long will it take to see some results?\nFor prevention, it is recommended to take one capsule per day, for one month and to repeat this every three months. This will allow to regulate microbiota balance throughout the seasons and to help you stay in good health.\nWhen using as a cure, take one capsule per day until any symptoms disappear - then take one capsule per day, for one month and repeat this every three months to ensure that the restored balance is maintained.\nClinical trials have proven that effects can be seen with a prescribed dose of 10/1000 of CFU (Colony Forming Unity) and that these effects are visible within 15 days of starting the treatment.\nAre they lactose/gluten free and suitable for a vegan diet? Are they suitable for those suffering from chronic illnesses (diabetes, high cholesterol) or during pregnancy?\nThe products are lactose-free, gluten-free, GM-free and do not contain any nanoparticles, artificial colourings, flavourings or preservatives. They are therefore suitable for those who are gluten or lactose intolerant as well as for those following a vegan diet.\nThe strains used are suitable for pregnant women and probiotics are in fact recommended during pregnancy as a balanced and diversified microbiota can then be passed on to the new-born.\nThe strains used are also suitable for those following treatments for chronic illnesses and can be taken without problem in treating any illnesses and discomforts associated with those treatments.\n- Basic aspects and pharmacology of probiotics: an overview of pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of action and side-effects.

93	Which costs more: buying a condo or townhouse?	Townhouses typically cost more to purchase than condos because when buying a townhouse you own both the building and the land it sits on, while with a condo you only own the individual unit and not the land.	"['Monday, January 29, 2018 / by Sean Zanganeh\nAlthough all are part of the common-interest housing category, condos, co-ops, townhouses, and apartments may mean different things to different buyers, so here is a breakdown of what each word means and the advantages or disadvantages of one over another for the homebuyer.\nFirst, let’s get the low-down on what makes up the common-interest housing real estate category. Common-interest housing is composed of areas owned individually and areas shared by all owners. The shared or common areas typically include landscaping, pools, parking, and clubhouses, but may also include exteriors, fences, and roofs of certain types of properties. Any community development that has shared property, including individually separate homes in developments with shared playgrounds and pools, falls into this category. Often, a management service or homeowners’ association manages the common areas.\nSpecifically, a condo—or more properly, a condominium—is a single housing unit within the shared property owned by the homeowner. This may be a unit in a tower building (also called an apartment) or a conjoined house with its own ground floor exterior entry (often called a townhouse, although a townhouse is not always a condominium), a single family home or a mobile home in a planned community. The term “condominium” is a legal term in the United States and so is governed by laws of real estate ownership.\nIn a condominium-style common-interest development (CID), the homeowner owns the interior space of the property independent of the other units and may buy or sell the real estate property as the sole owner of that specific unit.\nA co-op—or cooperative housing development—differs in that “owners” own shares in the corporation that owns the real estate development rather than owning an actual unit. Each shareholder has a vote in the real estate corporation and share ownership authorizes the occupancy of a specific unit. Typically, shareholders pay a “share” of the monthly expenses of the real estate corporation. As with a condominium, cooperatives may be apartment-style units in a single building, townhomes or patio homes, single family homes, or even mobile homes. The legal term “cooperative” refers to the real estate ownership structure rather than the property type.\nSo, what is an apartment? Or a townhouse?\nA townhome is a style of house connected on at least one side of the structure to another house. It may be individually owned real estate or part of a CID. A true townhome will have independent sidewalls even though they may touch the walls of another townhome. That being said, many condominium, cooperative, and rental unit designs mimic townhomes, with individual groundfloor entries, back patios or yards, and even differing faces and rooflines. These units may share a wall or roof, however, as part of a single structure.\nAn apartment is another matter. In common usage, “apartment” is a rental unit rather than privately owned real estate. The person occupying the unit does not own it, but leases it from the owner of the entire real estate development. But in legal terms, an apartment is a part of a residential structure occupied by one housing unit (family, roommates, etc.). An apartment, then, can be a rental, but it may also be a condominium unit (homeowner owns the interior space and shares the other spaces) or a cooperative unit (owner owns shares of the entire development equal to the unit being occupied).\nConsult your real estate professional to see which type of CID is the best fit for your circumstances in your local real estate market.', 'When buying a home, there are so many choices you have to make. From area to cost to whether or not a badly out-of-date kitchen is a dealbreaker, you\'ll be required to think about a lot of aspects on your course to homeownership. One of the most important ones: what kind of home do you desire to live in? You\'re most likely going to find yourself dealing with the condo vs. townhouse dispute if you\'re not interested in a detached single household home. There are rather a couple of similarities in between the two, and rather a couple of differences. Deciding which one is finest for you refers weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each and balancing that with the remainder of the choices you have actually made about your ideal home. Here\'s where to begin.\nCondominium vs. townhouse: the essentials\nA condominium resembles a home because it\'s a specific system living in a structure or neighborhood of structures. Unlike an apartment or condo, a condominium is owned by its resident, not leased from a proprietor.\nA townhouse is an attached home also owned by its resident. Several walls are shared with an adjacent attached townhouse. Believe rowhouse rather of house, and expect a bit more privacy than you would get in a condo.\nYou\'ll find apartments and townhouses in metropolitan areas, backwoods, and the suburban areas. Both can be one story or multiple stories. The greatest distinction between the 2 comes down to ownership and costs-- what you own, and how much you spend for it, are at the heart of the condo vs. townhouse difference, and frequently end up being essential factors when making a choice about which one is an ideal fit.\nWhen you purchase an apartment, you personally own your private system and share joint ownership of the building with the other owner-tenants. That joint ownership consists of not just the building structure itself, but its typical locations, such as the gym, swimming pool, and grounds, in addition to the airspace.\nTownhouse ownership is more in line with ownership of a separated single family home. You personally own the land and the structure it sits on-- the difference is simply that the structure shares some walls with another structure.\n"" Apartment"" and ""townhouse"" are regards to ownership more than they are terms of architecture. You can live in a structure that resembles a townhouse but is in fact a condo in your ownership rights-- for example, you own the structure but not the land it sits on. If you\'re searching primarily townhome-style properties, make certain to ask what the ownership rights are, specifically if you want to likewise own your front and/or yard.\nHouse owners\' associations\nYou can\'t speak about the apartment vs. townhouse breakdown without mentioning homeowners\' associations (HOAs). This is one of the greatest things that separates these kinds of homes from single household homes.\nYou are needed to pay regular monthly fees into an HOA when you purchase a condo or townhouse. The HOA, which is run by other occupants (and which you can join yourself if you are so likely), deals with the day-to-day upkeep of the shared spaces. In an apartment, the HOA is handling the building, its premises, and its interior typical spaces. In a townhouse neighborhood, the HOA is managing typical areas, which includes basic grounds and, in many cases, roofing systems and outsides of the structures.\nIn addition to managing shared residential or commercial property upkeep, the HOA also develops guidelines for all tenants. These might include guidelines around renting your home, noise, and what you can do with your land (for instance, some townhouse HOAs forbid you to have a shed on your residential or commercial property, although you own your backyard). When doing the condo vs. townhouse comparison for yourself, inquire about HOA guidelines and fees, since they can vary commonly from home to property.\nEven with monthly HOA fees, owning a townhouse or a condo generally tends to be more budget friendly than owning a single household house. You need to never ever purchase more house than you can manage, so apartments and townhouses are frequently fantastic choices for novice homebuyers or anyone on a budget.\nIn regards to apartment vs. townhouse purchase costs, condos tend to be cheaper to purchase, because you\'re not purchasing any land. Condominium HOA fees likewise tend to be higher, since there are more jointly-owned areas.\nHome taxes, home insurance, and house inspection costs vary depending on the type of property you\'re buying and its area. There are likewise mortgage interest rates to consider, which are typically greatest for apartments.\nThere\'s no such thing as a sure investment. The resale value of your house, whether it\'s a condominium, townhouse, or single official site household separated, depends upon a variety of market aspects, a lot of them outside of your control. But when it concerns the consider your control, there are some benefits to both condo and townhome properties.\nA well-run HOA will ensure that common locations and basic landscaping always look their best, which means you\'ll have less to stress over when it concerns making a good very first impression concerning your building or building neighborhood. You\'ll still be accountable for making sure your house itself is fit to offer, however a spectacular pool location or well-kept premises may include some extra incentive to a possible buyer to look past some small things that may stand apart more in a single household home. When it comes to gratitude rates, condos have actually normally been slower to grow in value than other kinds of residential or commercial properties, however times are changing. Just recently, they even surpassed single household homes in their rate of appreciation.\nFinding out your own response to the condo vs. townhouse argument comes down to determining the distinctions in between the 2 and seeing which one is the finest fit for your family, your budget plan, and your future strategies. There\'s no genuine winner-- both have their pros and cons, and both have a fair amount in common with each other. Discover the property that you desire to buy and then dig in to dig this the details of ownership, charges, and cost. From there, you\'ll be able to make the very best decision.']"	['<urn:uuid:47b5e5ef-11a7-4dba-9b66-ea2d13114da9>', '<urn:uuid:85c30e88-b99b-464e-a538-8d5e54f3e654>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	8	38	1633
94	retail vs consumer food waste percentage comparison	At the retail level, supermarkets discard 43 billion pounds of food yearly, while at the consumer level nearly half of the total 40% of wasted food occurs - making consumer waste the larger contributor to overall food waste.	['Food Rescue: Helping the Earth and the Hungry\nQ&A with Lauren Palumbo\nLovin’ Spoonfuls is a Boston-based organization with a dual mission: reduce food waste and feed the hungry. By salvaging food from wholesalers, retailers, and farmers, they are reducing the amount of food going to landfills. They then distribute the food that would otherwise go to waste to partnering nonprofits that feed Boston’s hungry. By concentrating on wholesome, fresh food products, they not only contribute calories, but also health to the communities they serve.\nWhile their mission may seem more oriented towards social and economic concerns, Chief Operating Officer Lauren Palumbo sees Lovin’ Spoonfuls’ work in a distinctly environmental light. Food Tank talked with Lauren about food rescue, the environment, and what we can all do to limit our food waste footprints.\nFood Tank (FT): What is the environmental impact of wasted food? How does Lovin’ Spoonfuls serve as both a social justice and an environmental justice organization?\nLauren Palumbo (LP): Food is one of the most resource-intensive industries we have, with significant use of water, fertilizer, human labor, oil for transportation and more involved throughout the food system. With 40 percent of food going to waste in the U.S., that means the resources to grow and distribute the food also go to waste—25 percent of our freshwater, 300 million barrels of oil annually, and countless hours of labor. Once wasted, if landfilled, organic waste emits methane when decomposing, which is more than 20x as harmful as carbon dioxide.\nI often say we are first and foremost a food waste agency; we are here to prevent the above-mentioned waste from happening, which is mostly a focus on the environmental impacts. Because there are simultaneously millions of food-insecure Americans, our best solution for the food we rescue is to feed people. We connect the food we rescue with food insecure families and individuals in the communities we serve, and in doing so, provide access and choice to fresh, healthy produce, dairy, proteins, and prepared foods. As an organization, we believe that access to this food is a right, not a privilege, and we are fortunate to play a part in achieving that goal.\nFT: What do you see as the largest challenge in reducing food waste in our food system? What is Lovin’ Spoonfuls doing to address this challenge?\nLP: Because so much food is wasted at the consumer level—nearly half of the 40 percent—education is crucial. We support the efforts of the Harvard Food Law & Policy Clinic, the NRDC, Save the Food, ReFed, and other leaders who are working to educate consumers on ways to prevent food waste at home.\nBeyond consumer efforts, the retail and wholesale distribution sectors provide the largest potential for food waste reduction, and it is precisely those sectors that our operations are built to serve. To that end, we are working diligently to expand our footprint throughout Massachusetts and to serve more communities in need.\nFT: There is a large amount of wasted food that never makes it off the farm. Do you do any gleaning on farms or work with any gleaning organizations that make use of food that would be wasted in the farming and harvest process?\nLP: We do not glean, though there are organizations and volunteers that do, both in our region and beyond. However, we do work with a number of farms to rescue the excess product which they harvest. Because of consumer and agricultural uncertainty, farmers often harvest beyond what their needs are for the farm stand, the farmers market, or the CSA, and we work with a number of farms in Eastern Massachusetts to rescue that excess harvest.\nFT: Do you confront any regulatory or legal barriers to the work you do? Are there opportunities for regulatory and/or legislative changes that would support food waste reduction and/or help to reduce the environmental impact of wasted food?\nLP: Fortunately, there are no regulatory or legal barriers to our work. If anything, in Massachusetts we have regulations that support our work. In 2014, our DEP enacted a Commercial Organics Waste Ban which prevents large businesses from landfilling organic waste in excess of 1 ton per week. This has prompted businesses to seek alternate methods for processing organic waste, whether through donation, animal feeding, composting, anaerobic digestion, or other methods.\nAt a national level, we support the work of Congresswoman Chellie Pingree. On a more local scale, a number of us working in the food policy space have connected to identify the legislative priorities here in Massachusetts, these include state level tax incentives, improved food labelling guidelines, and other initiatives.\nFT: What are some things individuals can do to reduce their personal food waste footprint?\nLP: I highly recommend the following strategies to reduce food waste at home:\n- Plan your meals for the week—look at what’s in your fridge or pantry that needs to be used up and plan around that!\n- Make a detailed shopping list—use your meal plan to draft a shopping list, and shop your fridge & pantry first!\n- Serve reasonably sized portions—this helps prevent plate waste, people can always take seconds.\n- Save your leftovers—package them up and label them so everyone in the family knows what they are and when they need to eaten by.\n- Eat those leftovers!\nAdditionally, you can reduce your food waste by storing food properly in your refrigerator and freezer, making greater use of your freezer for items you won’t eat up quickly such as bread!', 'In the United States, 40% of the food produced is never eaten, which results in massive economic, environmental and social ramifications. According to ReFED, approximately $218 billion is wasted on growing, processing, transporting and disposing food that is never eaten. The consequences of food waste are not just economic, either; many resources were consumed in producing and transporting this uneaten food.\nThe planet is left bearing the majority of the burden on food waste. Meanwhile, 15 million households in the United States are food insecure, meaning these households are uncertain if they would be able to provide food that meets the needs of their families, due to insufficient funds or other resources. With the demonstrated consequences in food waste space and the potential to increase food security across the country, something should be done.\nPhotograph courtesy of Matthew Hollis\nThe grocery industry has come under recent fire for its food waste problem. Supermarkets discard approximately 43 billion pounds of food a year. While grocery franchises may be part of the challenge when it comes to food waste, they can also become a part of the solution. After conducting an initial waste audit, best practices for food waste-savvy grocers include benchmarking your company’s food waste to know where to prioritize efforts, initiating an imperfect produce program, standardizing date labels, and communicating with suppliers to update frequency and reduce the size of orders.\nHowever, when food has ultimately reached the end of its life span at the grocery store, grocers can still do their part in diverting this waste from the landfill by donating to local food banks or composting it. Ultimately, food waste reduction efforts will benefit the grocer’s bottom line, the food insecure and the environment.\nDo you know how much your store throws away? It’s important to do preliminary benchmarking of your waste volumes to create a baseline. Without this important data, it will be difficult to determine the efficacy of any initiatives you decide to implement. There are several online resources to help you conduct a waste audit, but be prepared to get your hands dirty to understand your company’s waste stream. With this information, you can forecast future volumes and find opportunities to reclaim the value in your waste.\nImperfect Produce Program\nMany grocers discard perfectly edible produce that does not meet visual standards. However, these items can still be eaten, rather than being wasted in a landfill. Many consumers are still willing to purchase these items at a discount. For example, Kroger recently launched an imperfect produce program through Pickuliar Picks and found that customers have no problem selecting misshapen or irregularly sized produce when given the option. Do some research and see if your grocery franchise is able to incorporate a program like this to maximize the value in your produce inventory.\nDate Label Standardization\nOne common issue that leads to food waste is the nonstandard use of date labels. Current practices on food packaging cause confusion with “Sell by,” “Best by,” “Use by,” and “Best before” dates, leading up to 90% of Americans to occasionally throw out still-fresh food. There is no mandatory governmental regulation when it comes to labeling food products. In May 2019, the Food and Drug Administration supported the voluntary use of “best if used by” to reflect the manufacturer’s estimate at optimal quality rather than safety. Confusion over the meaning of date labels is estimated to account for 20% of consumer waste of safe, edible food. This equates to approximately $29 billion of wasted consumer spending each year; 5% to 10% of this is expected to be impacted by standardized date labels.\nAs food date labels become more consistent, consumer education campaigns will become more effective with the eliminated confusion. As a grocer, supporting manufacturers that use standardized date labels will help in food waste reduction.\nWhile conventional wisdom states that consumers will buy more if the shelves are overstocked, this practice can be incredibly wasteful and is in many cases no longer accurate. In one study, when Stop & Shop analyzed its overstocking practices, the company found overfilled displays not only led to spoilage on the shelf but also could displease customers due to spoiled product and require more staff handling to sort out the damaged items. In its study, customer satisfaction actually increased when shelves were not overstocked.\nGrocers can better manage their inventory to prevent perishables from spoiling before they can be purchased by the consumer. When ordering less, grocers are not only saving themselves money but also are sparing the environment the cost to produce and ship the wasted food.\nWhile it is crucial to reduce the amount of potential food waste from the source, there will likely still be some residual food left on shelves. When these products are ending their life span in the grocery, several organizations will still accept safe, edible food. Since 1996, the Federal Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act encourages the donation of food and grocery products to nonprofit organizations for distribution to individuals in need. This law prevents individuals and organizations from liability in food donation. Food banks and other nonprofits gladly accept donations to feed America’s food-insecure households. Grocers can feel confident knowing their unsold products can be used to feed the hungry, rather than contribute to landfill volumes.\nWhen waste is considered an asset rather than a necessary byproduct of operations, stores can begin to harness the true value within their waste stream. After conducting a preliminary waste audit, stores can begin to find missed opportunities to save money in their trash. Also, an imperfect produce program can allow customers to select “ugly” fruit and decrease the amount of edible food being thrown away. Evaluate how date labels are informing consumer purchasing and disposal habits, and reduce order sizes to prevent perishables from spoiling prior to being purchased. Finally, edible food that is no longer able to be sold can still be diverted from the landfill through food bank donation.\nReducing food waste across every store in the operation requires a firm commitment from all staff members to cutting costs and finding utility in new places. In the end, food waste reduction efforts will benefit your bottom line, the food insecure and the environment.\nMatt Hollis is the founder and president of Elytus, an industry leader in food waste sustainability.']	['<urn:uuid:207daf9a-2341-437b-90e4-a9bf2cc2f3e9>', '<urn:uuid:1e9939ea-139c-462b-bde7-5fb2e966a27c>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	7	38	1973
95	need help finding resources about psychological first aid for people affected by disasters	There is an international guide called Psychological First Aid: Guide for Field Workers that provides helpful principles for supporting people affected by distressing events. It includes approaches for helping people affected by natural disasters, violence, displacement, and accidents. The guide offers practical case scenarios demonstrating how psychological first aid can be applied in various crisis situations.	"['Global mental health: Finding your niches and networks\nBy Kelly O\'Donnell, PsyD\nBy Kelly O\'Donnell, PsyD\nClimb traveler, or stiffen slowly on the plain. ~ Irish proverb\nKelly O’Donnell, PsyD, is a consulting psychologist based in Europe. He is an APA International Affiliate, the CEO of Member Care Associates, Inc., and Coordinator of the Mental Health and Psychosocial Working Group of the Geneva-based NGO Forum for Health. Kelly’s publications include over 50 articles in the member care field focusing on the well-being and effectiveness of mission/aid workers and their organizations. His two most recent books are Doing Member Care Well: Perspectives and Practices from Around the World (2002) and Global Member Care: The Pearls and Perils of Good Practice (2011).\nThis article is the second in a series exploring the domain of global mental health (GMH). The first article, ""A Resource Map for Connecting and Contributing,"" lists 10 core materials for understanding GMH and presents practical suggestions for GMH involvement (Psychology International, July 2011). This current article takes a similar approach, offering additional materials (written and multimedia links) that reflect important aspects of GMH. The materials are organized into 10 overlapping ""niche-net"" areas that can be quickly reviewed. The goal is for colleagues in the health fields to relevantly participate in GMH by identifying and considering opportunities in various GMH niches and networks.\nI define GMH as an international, interdisciplinary, and multisectoral domain which promotes human wellbeing, the right to health and equity in health for all. It encourages healthy behaviors and lifestyles; is committed to preventing and treating mental, neurological and substance use conditions (MNS); and seeks to improve policies and programs, professional practices and research, advocacy and awareness, and social and environmental factors that affect health and well-being. Psychology, as a vast field of practice and practitioners serving humanity, plays a central role in the GMH domain.\nNiche-working and networking in GMH\nTrying to make inroads into GMH can be a challenging and lonely experience. This domain is behemoth, and it is easy to get lost or discouraged in the effort to meaningfully connect and contribute. In addition, not every colleague, organization or graduate program is oriented towards global issues and global applications of mental health. In spite of our increasingly globalized world, there are many challenges that keep us focused on our own immediate, nearby ""worlds."" Making a living, paying off school loans, raising a family, keeping abreast with one\'s own field, or meeting the demands of a rigorous academic program can seriously affect living our lives as ""global citizens.""\nLet me quickly balance the above comments with a far more influential, positive factor in light of having lived and worked internationally for 25 years as a consulting psychologist. During this time I have seen the increasing desire of mental health professionals and students around the world to be more meaningfully involved in international issues. Regardless of challenges, they want to use their training, passions, and resources to help make a positive difference in the quality of life for people. To support these growing aspirations, I recently set out on a collaborative project called GMH-Map to further orient people to GMH through publications, presentations and web-based resources1. The materials listed in this article are an example. Have a look at the 10 au courant areas below to see what interests you. Do so with others! They can help us go further into our GMH ""niche-working and networking.""\nNiche-Net 1: Human rights. Here are quotes from two foundational instruments that describe the rights of all humans and those with disabilities, including mental conditions. The first is from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UNDHR, 1948, currently in over 380 languages). The second is from the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD, 2006, currently in six languages).\n""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood."" (UDHR, Article 1).\n""The purpose of the present Convention is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity. Persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others"" (CRPD, Article 1).\nGoing further: See the website, United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights as well as the Quality Rights project by the World Health Organization (WHO—e.g. two-page fact sheet).\nNiche-Net 2: GMH overview. WHO has produced several educational videos that overview GMH facts and issues. Mental Health (2011) is a 7-minute video presenting general GMH information along with examples of mental health improvements in Jordan.\nGoing further: Watch the 6-minute video interview about GMH in 2011 by the Global Health Institute at Duke University. It is an interview with Vikram Patel who highlights the serious issues in GMH, shares strategies for reducing mental health gaps and argues for the global prioritization of mental health.\nNiche-Net 3: Updates. The Movement for Global Mental Health (MGMH) is a premier network connecting the diversity of GMH colleagues. It was launched in 2008 and currently has nearly 100 institutional members and over 1,800 individual members. The MGMH compiles regular newsletters with updates and information and offers various resources on its web site. Have a look through the listed news items to get a feel for what is happening in GMH.\nGoing further: Stay in touch via the newsletter-updates from the WHO\'s mhGAP Programme and the news stories from the World Federation for Mental Health.\nNiche-Net 4: GMH research. Two recent publications that reflect cutting edges of research are the Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health (Nature, 7 July 2011) and the Lancet\'s second series on GMH (17 October 2011). The ""Grand Challenges"" article is four-pages and worth a careful read, noting especially the chart which identifies 25 research priorities for GMH (e.g., integrating mental health into primary health care, reducing cost and improving supply of effective medications, providing community-based care, improving children\'s access to care in low-middle income countries, and strengthening mental health training for all health personnel). The Lancet\'s special GMH issue has six articles summarizing research on mental health and poverty, child and adolescent mental health, mental health in humanitarian settings, scaling-up mental health services, human resources for mental health and human rights.\nGoing further: Read the Executive Summary of the WHO Mental Health Atlas 2011 (pp. 10-11) on how mental health resources internationally continue to be ""insufficient, inequitably distributed, and inefficiently utilized."" There is also a 7 minute podcast interview/transcript about the findings.\nNiche-Net 5: Humanitarian and developmental assistance. Prioritizing Mental Health in Development Aid Programs (2010) by the Global Initiative on Psychiatry is a six-page overview for ""improving psychosocial and mental health care in transitional and developing countries.""\nGoing further: Read the Development and Maturation of Humanitarian Psychology article in the American Psychologist, November 2007 (link is for abstract only). See also The Sphere Project: Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Humanitarian Response (2011) that includes mental health assistance in emergency-humanitarian settings (pp. 333-336).\nNiche-Net 6: Training. The Centre for Global Mental Health (CGMH) in London is launching a Masters of Science course in GMH, the first of its kind, in association with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Institute of Psychiatry. In addition, a special GMH module can be incorporated into a person\'s current masters program, and there are opportunities for doctoral research related to GMH. See also the summary on Internationalizing Psychology Education (Monitor on Psychology, July 2008).\nGoing further: Review the Training and Education and the Capacity Building Atlas sections on the MGMH website. More examples of training include the international mental health courses at the University of Melbourne\'s Centre for International Mental Health and GMH-related presentations at conferences such as the Annual APA Convention and the International Congress of Psychology.\nNiche-Net 7: GMH advocacy. Two good examples among many recent advocacy efforts are the Cape Town Declaration (2011, one page) by the Pan African Network of People with Psychosocial Disabilities and the Joint Statement on Mental Health and the Scope of Noncommunicable Diseases (2011, two pages) prepared by the NGO Forum for Health (Geneva) and the NGO Committee on Mental Health (New York) for the United Nations General Assembly\'s High-level Meeting on Noncommunicable Diseases (19-20 September 2011).\nGoing further: To get a better sense of the global issues and power structures that influence human health, see the summary and materials from the 2010 workshop on Democratizing Global Health Governance, organized by Global Health Watch and other international organizations.\nNiche-Net 8: Personal stories. Patient Voices is a special part of the Health section in the online New York Times with audio and photos or people discussing their experiences with chronic diseases and mental health conditions. Listen to the short personal accounts.\nGoing further: Have a look at the stories from around the world in the Mental Health-Global Faces section of the NGO Forum for Health website.\nNiche-Net 9: Resources for practitioners and consumers. Psychological First Aid: Guide for Field Workers (2011) is an international effort to provide helpful principles to help people support those affected by distressing events. Reading through the table of contents will give you a good idea of the approaches used and looking over the three case scenarios at the end provides a good sense of how psychological first aid can be applied in natural disasters, violence, displacement, and accidents. See also the Universal Declaration of Ethical Principles for Psychologists consisting of four broad principles and values related to each principle. The four principles are: respect for the dignity of persons and peoples; competent caring for the wellbeing of persons and peoples; integrity; and professional and scientific responsibility to society.\nGoing further: The National Institute of Mental Health is one of many organizations offering materials on mental health for the general public, including their four-minute video on major depression (symptoms, help, neuroscience research). Other examples based in the USA are Athealth, National Empowerment Center, and National Alliance on Mental Illness.\nNiche-Net 10: Media matters. Madness Radio has over 125 archived radio programs online for free. The programs are diverse both in the subject matter and the perspectives shared on mental health. One example: Listen to the personal story and comments by Dr. Daniel Fischer, a psychiatrist who recovered from schizophrenia and has helped to develop the consumer survivor movement (aired 1 August 2011).\nGoing further: To explore the broader context for GMH involvement, watch a promotional video for the International Day of Peace on the homepage for APA‘s Division of Peace Psychology as well as the United Nations Year in Review from the United Nations News and Media Department.\nStaying the course in GMH\nI want to encourage all of us in the various health fields to take the time to explore the GMH domain. A great way to do this is by reviewing the materials in this short article to identify niches — relevant areas of focus — and networks — supportive groups of colleagues — for going further into GMH. GMH involvement is not always easy. Persevere as you seek to connect and contribute, knowing that GMH involvement is part of a lifelong journey that many mental health professionals around the world are undertaking together.\nSeek to integrate GMH materials into: training curriculum, coursework, and research at academic institutions 2; topical themes, presentations and interest groups at conferences; your areas of professional practice; and above all, as part of a lifestyle that reflects commitments to equality, justice and well-being for all. Ultimately GMH is not about our own fulfilment but about the fulfilment of others. It is about resolutely rallying on behalf of vulnerable people and populations around the world such as the estimated 450 million people currently struggling with MNS conditions, often exacerbated by stigma and discrimination, poverty and despair, and inadequate resources to help. Through it all, diligently maintain your work-life balance as you stay the course in GMH. Celebrate life in spite of its hardships. Climb, don‘t stiffen on the plain!\nThis article is part of a collaborative project to research, organize and share important GMH resources. The project includes articles, presentations at conferences and courses and a website (GMH-Map). The principle article for the project is currently submitted for publication and is to be posted on the website. It extensively highlights materials from the last two decades of GMH developments via a ""resource map,""organizing the materials into six categories: organizations, conferences/events, publications, training, human rights, and the humanitarian sector.\nMany people with GMH interests are clustered at schools/departments of public health, international health or medicine at particular universities (e.g., U.S. examples: Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health; Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health; Harvard Social Medicine Department and the School of Public Health; and the Global Health Institute at Duke University). Currently health professionals and graduate students usually need to connect with such academicrelational clusters having a strong global emphasis, especially in mental health, as a key way to pursue more training, research, and future career opportunities in GMH. I strongly believe that the academic-professional psychological community must also intentionally offer GMH training.']"	['<urn:uuid:76525d04-07a4-488d-bd02-16f0a95c1e14>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	13	56	2223
96	how many gallons of water does ocean voyager exhibit georgia aquarium hold	The Ocean Voyager exhibit at the Georgia Aquarium holds 6.3 million gallons of water	['I looked up just as the water above me darkened. Within an arm’s length, a massive whale shark passed over my head, its tail methodically propelling it forward. I caught its improbably small eye looking intently at me as it glided past. Directly behind came a second whale shark and then another.\nBut I wasn’t swimming in the ocean – I was 30 feet below the surface, at the bottom of the 6.3 million gallon Ocean Voyager exhibit at the Georgia Aquarium. As a marine scientist, I’ve logged a lot of dives in places from tropical reefs to temperate kelp forests. But I’d never been this up close and personal with the world’s biggest fish. In the wild, whale sharks can grow to 40 feet and nearly 50,000 pounds; those at the Georgia Aquarium are a relatively “small” 25 feet in length.\nIn June of 2013 the international body that manages tuna fish in the Eastern Pacific Ocean drafted and approved a resolution to protect whale sharks. The resolution isn’t groundbreaking; the New York Times didn’t report, Anderson Cooper wasn’t on the scene, and Greenpeace didn’t raise the flag. In fact, in the year it took to make U.S. compliance official via rulemaking in September 2014, even the fish-heads and whale shark lovers here at Ocean Conservancy barely noticed. This is a good thing.\nToo often fisheries management is mired in relatively small, but high-profile, fights. The fact that the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) quietly prohibited tuna fishermen, who hail from many nations around the Pacific, from using whale sharks as de facto Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) marks another small but important step towards saving some of the world’s most iconic species and preserving a healthy ocean.\nDr. Hoffmayer and a whale shark in the Gulf of Mexico. [Photo: Jim Franks]\n(This blog is part of a series of interviews with scientists who are championing marine research in the Gulf of Mexico.)\nA preeminent whale shark expert and ecophysiologist, Dr. Eric R. Hoffmayer is a research fishery biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service, Southeast Fisheries Science Center, Mississippi Laboratories. His interest in coastal shark species ranges from their reproduction and life history to their specific abundance, distribution and feeding ecology in nursery grounds. He has pursued a particular interest in the Gulf of Mexico’s whale sharks, the largest fish in the ocean, compiling information on their basic biology, habitat use and movement patterns.\nOcean Conservancy: How much is known generally about the whale sharks found in the Gulf of Mexico? What is the size of the population?\nDr. Hoffmayer: Ironically, even though whale sharks are the largest fish in the ocean, we still know so little about them, specifically here in the Gulf of Mexico. We know from our research efforts, as well as from research efforts of our colleagues in the southern Gulf, that whale sharks are relatively common in the Gulf. Unfortunately, due to their highly migratory nature and preference for offshore habitats, we still do not have a good population estimate for this region. However, colleagues working in the southern Gulf have estimated that between 500 and 900 individuals occur off the Yucatan Peninsula. In the northern Gulf, whale sharks occur along the continental shelf edge from Brownsville, Texas, to the Florida Keys and commonly occur off the mouth of the Mississippi River.\n“SHARK!” Does the word conjure up images of a fin slicing toward you in the open ocean or on the edge of your seat completely absorbed in one of the year’s best television specials?\nIn preparation for Shark Week, which starts this Sunday, we’ve put together a roundup of some of our best shark blog posts from the past year:\nWhat’s Your Shark IQ? How much do you think you know about sharks? Before taking a deep dive into the world of these complex creatures, test your basic knowledge with our short quiz. Do you know which shark swims the fastest?\nSuddenly out of the deep blue water appears a whale shark directly beneath me. The gentle giant moved gracefully to the surface of the water and began feeding next to me. I had been snorkeling off the coast of Tofo in Mozambique and felt that this was a dream come true. Experiences like this make me appreciate the variety of nature’s feeding techniques. You see whale sharks and baleen whales are both filter feeders, animals that eat by straining tiny food, like plankton, from the water. But how they go about filter feeding is completely different.\nIn whale sharks, teeth don’t play a major role in feeding. In one of their filter-feeding methods, they suction water into their mouths at high velocities while remaining stationary. Food moves through filtering pads that cover the entrance of their throats. The filtering pads are broad mess pads full of millimeter-wide pores that act like a sieve, allowing water to pass through while capturing food particles.

97	As someone working on ML applications, I'm curious about how Runway ML makes machine learning more accessible - what's their approach to simplifying the traditional ML workflow?	Runway ML provides an 'app store' of machine learning applications that can be activated with a few clicks, eliminating the need to use complex software like TensorFlow or PyTorch, buy expensive GPUs, or connect to AWS instances. Users can simply click to see model details, add them to their workspace, and set up inputs and outputs.	['Machine learning can be a fantastic tool for creators, but integrating AI into your workflow is a challenge for those who can’t code. A new program called Runway ML aims to make this process easier by providing artists, designers, filmmakers, and others with an “app store” of machine learning applications that can be activated with a few clicks.\nSay you’re an animator on a budget who wants to turn a video of a human actor into a 3D model. Instead of hiring expensive motion capture equipment, you could use Runway to apply a neural network called “PosetNet” to your footage, creating wireframe models of your actor that can then be exported for animation.\nAn easy way to experiment with machine learning\nOr say you need to remove a coffee cup that was accidentally left in a shot on your high-budget fantasy TV drama. You could edit it out the traditional way, painting over the cup by hand, or you could run your footage through a machine learning segmentation model, which would automatically highlight different objects in each frame to make your job easier.\nExamples like these are just the tip of the iceberg for Runway, which co-founder Cristóbal Valenzuela describes as radically egalitarian tool. “Machine learning is a very exclusive technology,” Valenzuela tells The Verge. “But I want to make things more inclusive; to get people from different backgrounds sitting around the table and using these models.”\nRunway began as Valenzuela’s thesis project at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. After getting enthusiastic feedback from the AI art community, he decided to take the program mainstream, asking two school friends to come on board as co-founders and gathering seed money from NYC and Silicon Valley backers. The company was incorporated last December with a beta launch following this January.\nValenzuela straddles the fields of art and code and says he wants to bridge these two worlds, empowering non-coders to use machine learning models and, in turn, connecting researchers to the people who will benefit directly from their work.\nIn a blog post Valenzuela wrote last May, he compares the current AI art scene to painting in the 16th and 17th centuries. At that time, the act of simply storing and using paint was something of a craft secret, with painters relying on esoteric techniques involving pigs’ bladders and string. But with the invention of the paint tube in 1841, the craft became more accessible. It was also easier to conduct outdoors, leading to new styles and movements.\nDoing for AI what paint tubes did for portraiture\nAs 19th century painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir told his son: “Without colors in tubes, there would have been no Cézanne, no Monet, no Sisley or Pissarro, nothing of what the journalists were to call Impressionism.” In other words: accessibility begets creativity.\nBut what is the “paint tube” for modern artists? Valenzuela makes a convincing argument that it might be Runway — or, at least, a program that looks a lot like it.\nThe pigs’ bladders holding back progress in this case is the skill-set currently needed to use machine learning models. That means learning to use software like TensorFlow or PyTorch; it might mean buying a few pricey GPUs (because your current computer won’t run these systems), or connecting to an AWS instance instead. None of these tasks are beyond the reach of non-coders, but they certainly take time and create a bottleneck for users. By comparison, Runway’s model is the perfect paint tube: just click and go.\nThe company is not the first to make AI models easier to use of course. But earlier examples — like Lobe, which let users train AI systems using a visual interface before it was bought by Microsoft — have focused on business use cases, rather than creative ones.\nRunway’s target market is obvious when you load up its store front, which lets you browse a range of models that run the gamut from text generation to motion tracking.\nYou click to see the details of each model, click to add it to your workspace, set up your inputs and outputs, then start the system running. There are hooks to connect these outputs to other apps (so you can send ML-processed images to Photoshop, for example), and users can import new models directly from GitHub with just a few lines of code.\nThis latter point is one of the most important for Runway. It’s hard to understate just how fast-paced and collaborative the current AI art scene is, and how much individuals benefit from one another’s work and professional research. No sooner does a new model get released than it’s pounced on by the masses who use it in all sorts of unexpected ways.\nTake the AI text generation system called GPT-2, unveiled in February by research lab OpenAI. In the months since it was launched, GPT-2 has been turned into accessible web apps, it’s been used to help write a novel, and someone even created a subreddit populated entirely by chatbots mimicking other subreddits using it.\nIn short: this is a bubbling and energetic scene, and Runway wants to stay as connected to it as possible. Valenzuela says his team is constantly responding to users’ feedback, adding new models to the program and updating the software’s interface every month.\nIt’s this connection to the community and speed of updating that he says will also stop Runway from getting overrun by the industry’s established players. “We’re just four people on our team,” he says. “We like to ship things fast, to get people excited and get them using things.” And although corporate giants like Adobe certainly have a lot of interest in similar AI applications, they’re necessarily going to be slower to integrate them into products.\nThe reception Runway has received so far gives credence to Valenzuela’s comments.\n“I personally find it useful for trying out some models quickly,” says Mario Klingemann, an AI artist who recently sold his work at Sotheby’s. He says the program will be particularly useful for workshops and classes since it allows teachers to get a new machine learning model up and running in minutes.\nKlingemann has reservations too. He tells The Verge that the software is “too limited” for making his own art because it only offers pretrained models. That means if someone wants to customize the output of a generator system, like a generative adversarial network (GAN), they can’t train it on their own data. Valenzuela says this functionality will be added soon to the program, along with the ability to use the output of one model as the input of another.\nRobbie Barrat, another AI artist who’s renowned for his work with GANs, also praised the program, singling out its potential to democratize the AI art scene as particularly positive.\n“If Runway can lower the barrier for entry ... I’m all for it.”\n“Right now, it’s easiest for rich tech bros who work at Google or something, went to a fancy computer science school, and have access to huge GPU clusters at work to make artwork with neural networks,” Barrat tells The Verge. “If Runway can lower the barrier for entry and let a more diverse group of people easily create art with AI, I’m all for it.”\nBut Barrat agrees that the program’s simplicity is a limiting factor. People who want to use AI to do more than just simplify an existing step in their process will need more powerful programs than Runway, he says. “No matter how good it is as a tool, people who code will still be able to make a bigger range of things and ultimately have more control over what they produce.”\nBarrat and Klingemann also say price is a potential problem when it comes to training ML models on Runway. The software is free to download and comes with $10 of cloud credit, which is more than enough to get to know its potential. But after that, it costs users 5 cents per minute of computation. For artists like Klingemann and Barrat who need to train their own models, it’s likely cheaper to buy their own GPUs or connect to a cloud service. “I am not sure it will financially make sense to me,” says Klingemann.\nBut saying that Runway isn’t a perfect fit for all users is hardly a huge criticism. No one is surprised when their Swiss army knife can’t be used to dig a trench. And for Valenzuela, the primary mission isn’t catering to pros; it’s expanding the borders of AI art world.\n“These technologies are going to radically change the way we create content because algorithms are understanding text, video, and sound in the same way we do,” he says. “And if we put these tools in the hands of people who have never accessed these before, they’re going to start thinking of new ways to use them.”']	['<urn:uuid:96c36f3d-ca7e-4252-841d-b433ce71d1c4>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	27	56	1483
98	how prevent rain water damage city	Stormwater best management practices (BMPs) can help prevent water damage by capturing and treating stormwater naturally before it flows into watersheds or treatment facilities. These practices include rain barrels, green roofs, swales, rain gardens, and wetlands that filter and store water. BMPs can reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, and damage to infrastructure while also improving water quality. They can be implemented at various scales, from individual homes to entire neighborhoods.	['Stormwater best management practices (BMPs) refer to strategies that utilize vegetation, soils, and natural processes to manage water and reduce stormwater runoff.\nWhy is this important to your community?\nStormwater contamination is a concern for many communities within the CONNECT region. Stormwater carries runoff from parking lots and gas stations, yard debris and chemicals, silt from development sites, and pollutants from wildlife and domestic animals, among other pollutants. Such “non-point-source” runoff and debris that enters streams leads to increased demand at water treatment plants and negative environmental impacts, such as flooding, and can affect water quality and impair watershed health. Instead of undertaking costly, and often unnecessary, expansions to existing stormwater conveyance and treatment systems, communities throughout the region can employ stormwater best management practices (BMPs) to manage stormwater at its source and reduce runoff. By minimizing the negative effects of unmanaged stormwater in the CONNECT region, we can make progress in improving water quality, one of the region’s top priorities.\nWhere is it appropriate to use?\n- Parks and Open Space\nWhat priorities does it address?\nWhat other tools are related?\n- Alternative Fuels and Energy Efficient Vehicles\n- Green Infrastructure\n- Greenways and Trails Planning\nHow does it work?\nAccording to the U.S. EPA, stormwater is precipitation that runs off streets, lawns, and other sites. Stormwater that is absorbed in the ground or other pervious surfaces is filtered before flowing into watersheds. However, in developed areas, impervious surfaces (e.g., sidewalks, roofs, roads, and other pavement) prevent the natural filtration of stormwater, causing water to flow into storm drains, sewer systems, and ditches. Overuse of and reliance on traditional grey infrastructure (piped networks that transfer water off-site for treatment) can lead to negative environmental and financial outcomes, including low water tables, flooding, stream bank erosion, wildlife habitat destruction, sewer overflows, damage to existing infrastructure (e.g., water treatment plants), and contamination of key watersheds—not to mention the cost to local taxpayers for infrastructure construction and maintenance.\nBMPs aim to capture and treat stormwater naturally before it flows into watersheds or treatment facilities. BMPs can be designed to suit a variety of locations and stormwater loads – from an individual rain barrel at a residence to a green or blue roof on a public building, to swales and rain gardens throughout new neighborhoods. Regardless of the scale, each approach works to filter, transpire, capture, and reuse stormwater. BMPs (stormwater planters, tree trenches, rain gardens, green and blue roofs, swales, wetlands, rain barrels, and green gutters) typically capture water from a street, sidewalk, green inlet, or from rainfall (e.g., green and blue roofs) where plants, trees, or a stone media filter and transpire the water while enhancing the appearance of the environment. Water remaining after initial infiltration, seeps into the soil where stone or other storage media provides additional stormwater storage, or is transferred to storage for reuse (e.g., rain barrels, green and blue roofs).\nCounties or municipalities can encourage the use of BMPs by adopting zoning or other regulations requiring developers to manage a certain amount of stormwater produced on site (see sample Stormwater Management regulation). The EPA’s National Stormwater Calculator (SWC) estimates the annual amount of rainfall and frequency for sites throughout the country based on soil conditions, land cover, and recorded rainfall averages. The SWC is a tool that developers, landscape architects, site designers, planners, and homeowners can use to determine the appropriate size and type of stormwater best practice.\n- Stormwater Management – U.S. EPA\n- Stormwater Management – Philadelphia Water Department\n- EPA’s National Stormwater Calculator (SWC)\n- Connect Our Future – Regional Scan Document\n- Sample Local Law for Stormwater Management and Erosion & Sediment Control\n- Map of green infrastructure projects in North Carolina\n- North Carolina Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF)\n- South Carolina State Revolving Fund\n- Low Impact Development - A Guidebook for North Carolina (NC State University, 2009)\nReady to get started?\nUsing the Tool\n- Convene a working group of representatives from county or municipality departments (water department, streets department, development, zoning and planning), developers, architects and landscape architects, engineers, and local schools and institutional partners to discuss strategies for employing stormwater best management practices (BMPs) locally.\n- Review any existing plans or guides to employing BMPs (North Carolina Division of Water Quality – Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, 2007 and South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control – BMP Handbook)\n- Asses what regulations currently exist to address stormwater (e.g., zoning, Post-Construction Stormwater Ordinances, Long Term Control Plans, and state law). Consider revising existing zoning and regulations to require stormwater management for all new developments, or revising water rates to reflect the stormwater burden generated by properties.\n- See what SMPs and other green infrastructure projects have been employed in your area. This map, made by American Rivers, maps the nearly 2,000 examples found throughout North Carolina.\n- In rural areas, it may be appropriate to employ strategies to manage agricultural runoff, which may include harmful pesticides and other pollutants. Rain gardens, sediment ponds, or vegetation buffer strips can help manage water flow and reduce negative impacts on the local water supply. See NC State University’s Best Management Practices for Agricultural Nutrients for additional strategies and information.\n- In more developed areas, discuss the current stormwater infrastructure system. Determine if the system is currently overloaded, and if so, what areas present the greatest risk to water quality. Work with county or municipal departments to develop a strategy for employing BMPs. This could include a series of pilot projects, a BMP design manual for private homeowners and developers (e.g., Philadelphia Water Department’s Green Streets Design Manual).\n- Research federal, state, and local funding sources (e.g., Clean Water State Revolving Fund Programs, EPA’s Green Infrastructure Funding Program)\n- Explore the possibility of providing incentives for developers who manage more than the minimum amount of stormwater on site. For example, site design that manages more than the first inch of stormwater could receive a density bonus, reduced parking requirements, or expedited permitting.\n- Consider creating a public education campaign that details the importance of employing BMPs to manage stormwater and improve water quality. This could include public meetings, flyers or pamphlets, speaker series, or media campaigns. Storm sewer marking that shows where what goes into the storm sewer goes—untreated—is a very successful and inexpensive public education device.\n- Support legislation that works to improve water quality and reduce the cost of providing services. Legislation could include new zoning or regulations requiring developers to manage on-site stormwater or the approval of a municipal-wide project to install BMPs on certain streets to manage stormwater.\n- Businesses / Business Associations\n- Colleges and Universities\n- Community Development Organizations\n- Construction Companies\n- Departments of Education / School Districts\n- Farmers / Agricultural Extension Office\n- Housing Authorities\n- Landscape Architects, Planners, and Urban Designers\n- Municipal Departments\nWhere has it worked?Image Source: Eco Friendly Real Estate Blog.\nDavid Tuch, Equinox Environmental Consultation & Design, Inc.\nAbout the Program\nDrover’s Road Preserve, located in rural Buncombe County, North Carolina near Asheville, is a large-lot residential conservation development situated on a 186-acre mountainside site. The developers made a commitment to protect the site’s natural heritage, resources, and scenic views. Overall site design focused on preserving the quality of the existing land and protecting the site’s water resources. Instead of installing traditional grey infrastructure (e.g., stormwater drains and gutters), the planning team utilized roadside swales, bioretention areas, forested riparian buffers, a stormwater wetland, and an infiltration meadow to manage stormwater on site. In addition to BMPs, Drover’s Road Preserve’s site planners furthered conservation goals by planning new roads and infrastructure to reduce stream crossings, impervious surfaces, and forest clearing and set aside land for permanent conservation in a Conservation Easement program. Planning consultants worked with developers to create a set of design guidelines and rules to ensure that the site was developed in accordance with the overall plan while allowing individual homeowners to build houses on individually purchased lots.\nWhy it works\nAt the time of planning and construction, Buncombe County had no post-construction stormwater requirements or other stormwater or conservation zoning. However, the developers and their planning team, recognizing the site’s unique natural character, made a commitment to conservation throughout the site. With help from the planning team and North Carolina Extension, the development team sized a number of BMPs, including swales, wetlands, and bioretention areas, to capture the first 1.25 inches of stormwater. Post-construction, the developers transferred long-term maintenance of open spaces including the stormwater BMPs to the homeowners’ association, while the land in the conservation easement is maintained by the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy. This case illustrates a comprehensive approach to conservation development by successfully limiting site disturbance, preserving 59% of the site for open space and conservation, utilizing conservation easement tax credits, reducing impervious surfaces, and using BMPs to treat stormwater on site.\n- Businesses / Business Associations\n- Green Infrastructure']	['<urn:uuid:e3f8ec16-1bbd-4f84-bc9d-625b87596058>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	6	70	1489
99	difference between coronavirus mutation rate and influenza drift	Influenza undergoes frequent mutations through antigenic drift, with approximately 1 mutation occurring every time the virus replicates due to its inability to fix RNA transcription errors. Coronaviruses, however, have a unique proofreading ability that allows them to correct mistakes during RNA replication, which affects their mutation rate. Both viruses can still evolve to evade the immune system, but through different molecular mechanisms.	['Assistant Professor of Biology\nB.S. University of Central Arkansas, Ph.D. University of Kentucky\nInterests and Expertise: virology, molecular biology, biochemistry, virus evolution, microbiology\nPlease see our lab website for more detailed research information, publications, and updates.\nViruses and viroids evolve more rapidly than any other biological entity. This enables viruses to evade our immune system, evolve resistance to antiviral drugs, and infect new species.\nViruses containing an RNA genome, such as HIV and influenza, are unable to correct mistakes (proofread) made while replicating their genome. Such error-prone, or low fidelity, replication means that most viral progeny will have mutations. However, viruses are capable of producing millions to billions of progeny virions during infection. Thus, even if 99.9% of the newly-made viruses are defective due to mutations, several thousand to millions still survive. These three characteristics – huge population sizes, rapid replication, and high mutations rates – help drive virus evolution.\nWhile my research interests are primarily virus-centric, many ecological and anthropomorphic factors also contribute to virus evolution and emergence. These include the domestication of animals, rainforest destruction, global warming, and air travel. Each can result in increased human-human and human-animal contact, thus contributing to the emergence of zoonotic infections.\nI study how coronaviruses (CoV), such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, replicate and evolve. Coronaviruses are unique among RNA virus: they can correct mistakes (proofread) made while replicating their RNA genome. The long-term goals of my research program are two-fold: (i) to understand how coronaviruses regulate their fidelity and (ii) to identify the molecular mechanisms (both viral and cellular) that contribute to the attenuation of altered-fidelity viruses.\nOur current research questions include:\nI: How does nsp14-ExoN regulate coronavirus fidelity?\nII: What are the molecular mechanisms by which changes in fidelity impact viral replication and fitness?\nIII: What is the role of host chaperones in coronavirus replication?\nSTUDENT RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES\nStudents and I use a murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), as a model system. This system enables students to study viral replication safely and contribute directly to our knowledge about these medically and agriculturally important pathogens. My research relies heavily on biochemistry, virology, genetics, molecular biology, and evolutionary biology, thus enabling students to receive a wide range of technical training.\nSewanee has exceptional facilities for undergraduate research.

It typically occurs in viruses and enables the pathogen to evade the immune system, triggering an infection once more.\nCredit: Kateryna Kon/Shutterstock.com\nAntigens are molecules which can be bound by immune cell receptors in order to trigger an immune response. This mechanism of binding and recognition is used to detect threats to the body, including bacterium, viruses and various chemicals. The cells of the body also display antigens, which enable them to be distinguished from foreign material.\nWhat is antigenic drift?\nReceptors of the immune system bind to foreign antigens specifically, like a key inserting into a lock, which triggers an immune response to eliminate the threat. Once the infection is resolved, the body can produce many more of these specific receptors which can detect these specific antigens upon reinfection.\nThis functions as an acquired immune response, preventing future infections of the same antigen. If the same antigen is detected, the body can make the specific receptor very quickly, producing a fast and effective immune response, and preventing a second infection.\nVaccinations work with this acquired immune response, stimulating the production of receptors without the individual having to face the primary infection. Non-threatening antigens are introduced into the body which stimulates the production of specific immune receptors. Therefore, if the actual antigen is detected, an acquired immune response can be mounted and the body can fight off the infection more effectively.\nHowever, both vaccinations and the acquired immune response can only function if the antigenic structure remains the same. If the structure is altered, such as in antigenic drift and antigenic shift, then the highly specific receptors will no longer bind and so the acquired immune system will no longer be able to detect the threat.\nAn individual who has previously suffered with a specific viral infection, for example, can become ill for a second time. Therefore, altering the structure of surface antigens provides a potential mechanism for the evasion of the immune system by pathogens.\nAntigenic drift and influenza\nThe surface antigens of influenza include hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Hemagglutinin binds to epithelial cells and allows entry of the virion, whereas NA functions in the process of new virions budding from body cells.\nWhen influenza replicates its RNA to reproduce, errors can be made which lead to a mutation. Around 1 in 10000 nucleotides are transcribed incorrectly, which roughly is the length of the influenza genome, meaning that there is approximately 1 mutation every time influenza replicates. RNA, unlike DNA, lacks the ability to fix these mutations as it does not have proofreading enzymes, and therefore these errors lead to a small but permanent change in the genetic code.\nThis means that every time influenza replicates, the progeny are slightly different and can have slightly different HA and NA. Over time these differences accumulate and produce antigens which are substantially different to their ancestors. Therefore, their antigens “drift” which means they can no longer be detected by the acquired immune system of the body.\nAn individual who has previously suffered from one strain can then be reinfected as the body has no way of detecting that this is the same infection.\nAntigenic drift is a major problem in the design of vaccinations, particularly in influenza A. The slight changes in antigen structure mean that previous vaccines are no longer viable and new vaccines are constantly required. In the future, vaccines which can bind to different variants of HA and NA may provide protection against antigenic drift.\nVIDEO Further Reading']	['<urn:uuid:cdc8e214-94e2-47cb-8b39-0d2114a117b9>', '<urn:uuid:81728ae8-e6af-4ff4-9f68-9a822101e241>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	8	62	1246
100	how make garden gnome paint dry fast without damage	To make a garden gnome and ensure its paint dries quickly without damage, first create it using a mold and concrete mixture, then paint it with acrylics using specific techniques for faster drying. For safe paint drying, apply thin layers, ensure proper ventilation, and use careful heat application with a hair dryer or heat gun while avoiding overheating. It's important to avoid rushing the process as this can lead to cracks or damage in the final painted piece.	"[""Rumor has it that garden gnomes will make your flowers grow faster, your fruit set more quickly and your vegetables grow to enormous sizes. While there's no proof for any of those assertions, there's no denying that the little garden ornaments bring a touch of whimsy to your lawn or garden. They originated in the Bavarian region of Germany in the late 18th century. In 1847, Sir Charles Isham of Northhamptonshire ordered 21 garden gnomes for his gardens at Lamport Hall. Lampy, the sole survivor of Lord Isham's collection, has been insured by his descendants for more than a million pounds. You can cast your own garden gnomes in concrete or resin for considerably less than that.\nMake the Mold\nSculpt a garden gnome from the clay and bake it following package directions on the clay. This will be the model for your mold. You can also choose to use a purchased garden gnome as your original model if you don't want to make your own design.\nStand the gnome in the center of the plastic covered board, securing it with a drop of instant bond glue. Don't overdo it with the glue. You'll want to be able to remove the gnome later.\nLock a piece of PVC pipe in your vise. The pipe should be at least 1/2 inch wider in diameter than the widest part of your gnome. Cut the pipe with a hacksaw so it is at least 2 inches taller than your gnome.\nSpray the inside of the pipe and the garden gnome model with vegetable oil cooking spray or a commercial mold release product.\nPlace the pipe over the model, arranging it so that there is about 1/4 inch of space between the gnome and the wall of the pipe.\nRoll a coil of modeling clay and press it firmly around the outside bottom of the pipe to seal the seam between the pipe and the board surface.\nMix the liquid silicon or latex according to the package directions.\nCarefully pour the mixture into the pipe until it is just below the top of the mold. Pour to the side of the figurine rather than directly over it so that the liquid fills any undercuts or holes in the figure.\nAllow the mold to cure according to the package directions. Some quick curing mold compounds will be ready in a few hours. Others may need to sit overnight.\nRemove the coil of clay from around the bottom of the pipe. Slide the pipe off of the mold and carefully peel the mold off the plastic base.\nCarefully cut the mold in half with a sharp knife, following the outline of the figure inside. Remove the original model from the center.\nCasting the Gnome\nSpray the faces of both halves of the mold with mold release or vegetable oil cooking spray.\nCarefully align the two halves so that they match up. Wrap the outside with cheesecloth or a sheet of paper, then wrap duct tape around them to hold them together.\nMix one part portland cement with one part sand in a plastic bucket or tub.\nSlowly add water while stirring the mixture until it is about the consistency of heavy pancake batter.\nStand the mold on a flat, level surface with the opening facing up. Carefully and slowly pour the cement mixture into the mold until it reaches the top.\nSet the filled mold in a warm place to harden overnight.\nCut through and remove the tape and cheesecloth. Carefully separate the two halves of the mold and remove your concrete garden gnome.\nPaint and detail your gnome as desired."", 'Acrylic paint is a popular medium for artists due to its versatility, bright colors, and ease of use. However, the drying time of acrylic paint can be a challenge for artists, especially those who work on large or complex pieces. Waiting for acrylic paint to dry can be time-consuming and frustrating, especially when you’re on a tight deadline. Fortunately, there are various methods and techniques that you can use to dry acrylic paint faster without compromising the quality of your work.\nIn this article, we will explore the different methods and techniques for drying acrylic paint faster. We will discuss the factors that affect the drying time of acrylic paint, such as temperature, humidity, and the thickness of paint layers. We will also provide tips and tricks to speed up the drying process, including using a heat gun or hair dryer, adjusting the application technique, and preparing the workspace for faster drying.\nWe will also cover safety precautions that artists should follow when using these methods and techniques to dry acrylic paint faster. Additionally, we will discuss common mistakes that artists make when trying to dry acrylic paint faster and provide guidance on how to avoid them.\nWhether you’re a professional artist or a hobbyist, knowing how to dry acrylic paint faster can save you time and allow you to focus on creating beautiful and vibrant artwork. So, let’s dive into the different methods and techniques for drying acrylic paint faster and take your artwork to the next level.\nUnderstanding Acrylic Paint Drying Time\nBefore we dive into the methods to dry acrylic paint faster, it’s important to understand the factors that affect drying time. The temperature and humidity of the environment can significantly impact how long it takes for acrylic paint to dry. A warmer and less humid environment can help dry acrylic paint faster. The thickness of paint layers can also affect drying time, as thicker layers take longer to dry. Adequate airflow and ventilation are crucial for faster drying, as it helps remove moisture from the paint surface.\nIdentifying the drying time of acrylic paint is essential for choosing the right method to dry it faster. You can perform a touch test, smear test, or wait for the paint to dry to the touch or complete dryness.\nHow to Dry Acrylic Paint Faster\nChoosing the Right Materials\nOne way to dry acrylic paint faster is by using materials specifically designed for faster drying. Acrylic mediums can help increase the drying time of acrylic paint, and there are also fast-drying acrylic paints available in the market. Another option is to use a heat gun or hair dryer, which can help speed up the drying process.\nPreparing the Workspace for Faster Drying\nPreparing the workspace is essential for faster drying of acrylic paint. Controlling the temperature and humidity of the environment is crucial for faster drying. You can use a dehumidifier or air conditioner to remove excess moisture from the air. Proper ventilation is also important to allow air to circulate and remove moisture from the paint surface. Using fans or blowers can also help speed up the drying process.\nAdjusting the Application Technique\nAdjusting the application technique can also help dry acrylic paint faster. Thinning the paint with water or acrylic medium can help reduce the thickness of paint layers and reduce the drying time. Applying thin layers of paint also helps reduce drying time, as thick layers take longer to dry. Using a drying retarder can also help slow down the drying time, giving you more time to work on the painting.\nAfter the acrylic paint has dried, you can use a varnish or fixative to protect the painting and enhance its appearance. Polishing or buffing the painting can also give it a shiny and smooth finish. Proper storage of the painting is also important to prevent damage or cracking.\nTips and Tricks for Faster Acrylic Paint Drying\nIn addition to the methods and techniques mentioned above, there are also some tips and tricks that can help dry acrylic paint faster. Using a blow dryer or heat gun can help speed up the drying process, but it’s important to use it carefully and avoid overheating the paint surface. Pre-heating the canvas or painting surface can also help speed up the drying process. Mixing a drying accelerator into the paint can also help reduce the drying time. Using a baking method is another option, but it should be done with caution to avoid damage to the painting.\nWhen drying acrylic paint, it’s important to keep safety precautions in mind. When using a heat gun or hair dryer, make sure to use it carefully and avoid overheating the paint surface. Adequate ventilation and safety measures should be followed when using solvents and mediums. When using a dehumidifier or air conditioner, make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions and avoid overuse, as it can lead to dryness and discomfort.\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid\nThere are some common mistakes that artists make when trying to dry acrylic paint faster. Applying thick layers of paint can prolong the drying time, as the paint needs more time to dry. Using a wet brush or tool can also add moisture to the paint surface and increase the drying time. Rushing the drying process can lead to cracks or damage to the painting. Using improper drying techniques can also affect the quality of the painting and its appearance.\nDrying acrylic paint faster can be a challenging task, but with the right techniques and materials, it’s possible to reduce the drying time significantly. It’s important to understand the factors that affect drying time and identify the drying time of the paint before choosing the right method to dry it faster. Preparing the workspace and adjusting the application technique can also help speed up the drying process. Following safety precautions and avoiding common mistakes are also important to ensure the quality of the painting and avoid damage or cracks.\nAs an artist, it’s important to experiment with different methods and techniques to find the one that works best for your style and preferences. With the right knowledge and skills, you can create beautiful and vibrant paintings using acrylic paint, without having to worry about the drying time.']"	['<urn:uuid:48d50ded-3ab0-4e4e-9ff9-7b2360e2f8e4>', '<urn:uuid:992f5723-6538-4719-ba08-4292b1848205>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:33:22.653082	9	78	1645
