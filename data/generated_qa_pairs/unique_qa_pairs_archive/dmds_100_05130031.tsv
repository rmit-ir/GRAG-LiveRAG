In this blog post, I will show you how to put an effective crisis response strategy in place for your healthcare brand.\nHaving an online presence has so many advantages when it comes to healthcare marketing, but it also comes with some risks. With the click of a mouse, patients can share their experiences online – good and bad – and their comments travel at lightening-speed through their social network. A social media crisis can escalate rapidly and you must be ready to step in and remedy the situation without delay. The only way to do this is to have a crisis plan already in place.\nCrisis management involves dealing with threats before, during, and after they have occurred. Let’s look at these three stages in more detail.\nStage 1 Preparation\nProactively prepare by developing a crisis response plan. The following elements are involved.\n#1 Crisis Definition\nFirst, define what constitutes a crisis. Three elements are common to a crisis (a) a threat to the organization, (b) the element of surprise, and (c) a short decision time.\nA crisis can fall into several categories including:\n(a) Technological (eg; your website has been hacked);\n(b) Confrontation (disgruntled employee, client, or patient attacks you online);\n(c) Rumours (eg; spreading false information about you, your product or service online);\n(d) Malevolence (eg; In 1982, a murderer added cyanide to some Tylenol capsules on store shelves, killing seven people).\n#2 Monitor Online Chatter\nAn effective social media strategy requires active listening to the online chatter about your healthcare organization. Should a crisis occur, listening to the conversation will help you shape a more insightful and effective response. Responding in real time to issues strengthens public perception that your focus is firmly on patient satisfaction. In addition, use monitoring to find the healthcare conversations you can add value to. Investing in community building online now will pay dividends in the form of support should a crisis hit you.\nThere are many free and paid monitoring tools available to you. These tools vary in scope and range across a number of sites, real-time or delayed searching, the sophistication of analytics, the flexibility of data presentation, integration with other applications, and of course, price. When it comes to reputation management, choose a tool that does more than just track mentions of your name. You need to be able to evaluate the sentiment (the ratio of mentions that are positive to those that are negative) attached to the mentions. Mention is a freemium monitoring tool that includes sentiment. Tweets that include words like “not working,” “fail” or “poor experience” should be resolved immediately.\n#3 Create a Written Plan\nYour written plan should include the following:\n- Clear guidelines on how to respond to each of the different situations outlined above in #1.\n- Links to your terms of service.\n- Who should respond – establish a clear chain of command and list contact information.\n- Make sure every member of your team knows this plan is in place, how to access it, and how to put the plan into action.\nStage 2: Action\nNow’s the time to put your carefully crafted crisis plan into place. The following are key considerations:\n- Determine the exact nature of the crisis. How and where did it originate? How is it affecting your patients or clients?\n- Go to the source. Find where the complaint originated and with whom. Determine their sphere of influence. If a blogger has published something that is untrue or misrepresentative of you, ask them to remove, amend, or modify the piece if this is appropriate.\n- Be respectful, polite and engaged. Never get into a public argument or talk down to anyone.\n- Be as transparent as possible as quickly as possible. Acknowledge that you are aware of the situation and that you are dealing with it straight away.\n- Respond swiftly and appropriately. Every moment counts on social media. The longer you wait, the more the conversation will heat up. Twitter, in particular, is a place where people expect a quick response no matter what time of day.\n- Don’t lie or try to hide the truth; admit when the fault is yours.\n- Use the same channel on which you were criticized to respond.\n- Don’t censor or remove the critical comments that appear on your social media platforms. Tempting as this may appear, it will only fan the flames of the social media fire.\n- Channel communication to your own website. Develop an area on your website or blog that houses the information about the crisis and what your organization is doing about it.\n- Communicate your story. A story gets out of control when you haven’t told your side and people begin to speculate. While you can’t control the story, you can provide the facts, information, and access to key people that allow journalists and bloggers to help you frame it in the right way.\nStage 3: Review\nWhen the crisis has passed, go over what happened. Ask yourself the following questions:\n- How well did you handle the situation?\n- Did it escalate to a bigger problem than it was?\n- What could you have done differently?\n- Prepare to deliver on your word. Make changes based on feedback if those changes are warranted and if you have promised to put them in place.\nIf handled well a crisis may even turn out to be an opportunity to show your commitment to your patients and consumers. Remember the Tylenol example above? Johnson & Johnson recalled and destroyed 31 million capsules at a cost of $100 million. The CEO appeared in television ads and at news conferences informing consumers of the company’s actions. Tamper-resistant packaging was quickly introduced, and Tylenol sales bounced back to near pre-crisis levels.\nWhile you can’t control everything that happens on social media, you can control your response. The best way to handle a crisis is to have your response plan in place. If you haven’t already made one, then do it today.\n- Don’t Be Scared, Be Prepared – How to Manage a Social Media Crisis\n- 3 Steps for Communicators to Implement a Crisis Ready Culture\n- The Five Social Media Emergencies Your Next Client Could Have\n- In the Trenches with Crisis Comms: 10 Things to Prepare\n- Crisis Communication and Social Media in Healthcare\n- 5 Steps to Planning for Effective PR Crisis Management\n- 7 Tips for Taking the Stress Out of a Social Media Crisis\n- How to Use Social Media Effectively in a Crisis\n- The Secret Behind Crisis Communications']"	['<urn:uuid:84805298-74a6-4957-804d-8fa3f3cdd441>', '<urn:uuid:03c69d2d-f6ba-4770-8c63-4c267d49ae49>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	11	35	1763
3	what counts valid whistleblowing disclosure protection requirements	For a whistleblowing disclosure to be valid and protected, specific requirements must be met in different jurisdictions. In the DIFC, the disclosure must include the whistleblower's identity, relate to reasonable suspicion of law contraventions, be made in good faith, and be reported to the DIFC Registrar of Companies, entity auditors, or Directors/officers. In New South Wales, the disclosure must be made by a public official about corrupt conduct, maladministration, waste of government resources, or government information contraventions. The disclosure must be made to specific authorities such as investigating authorities, principal officers, or Members of Parliament, and the whistleblower must honestly believe on reasonable grounds that the information shows misconduct. In both jurisdictions, disclosures made primarily to avoid disciplinary action are not protected.	['This month we have a jam-packed magazine and dedicated marketing campaign, focusing on three areas; Family Business, Real Estate and Construction. We will take you on a journey that highlights how our focus areas are building for the future and the regulation being put in place that will help them get there.Take a read of the edition\nIn the case of Bassam Khalifa v S.W.I.F.T (Dubai) Limited, the DIFC Court of Appeal has issued a judgment which clarifies the application of the whistleblowing protections under the DIFC Operating Law, and the Court of First Instance’s (“CFI”) power to grant relief for any breach of the whistleblowing protections.\n“Whistleblowing” is essentially is a disclosure of (often confidential) information that exposes illegal or unethical practices within an organisation. The disclosure is usually made by an employee or an ex-employee of the entity itself, for example via a confidential whistleblowing hotline, or, an independent third party, such as a regulatory authority.\nThe DIFC Law No. 7 of 2018 (“Operating Law”) sets out whistleblowing protection that applies in the DIFC and it applies to any person operating or conducting business in or from the DIFC.\nArticle 64 of the Operating Law provides that a person who makes a disclosure of information (outlined below) to the DIFC Registrar of Companies or the relevant DIFC entity’s auditors or to a Director/officer of the DIFC entity itself, is entitled to the protection set out under the Operating Law. The disclosure must including the identity of the person making the disclosure, related to a reasonable suspicion that the DIFC entity has contravening the Operating Law or other regulations/legislation and must be in good faith.\nIn terms of whistleblowing protection, the Operating Law provides that those making good faith disclosures in accordance with the law shall not, as a result of making the disclosure, be:\nPursuant to Article 64 any act in contravention of the above may result in a fine of USD 30,000.\nIn addition, Article 40 provides that the DIFC Courts may make orders for the recovery of damages or compensation or such other orders as it sees fit where a ‘person intentionally, recklessly or negligently commits a breach of any requirement, duty, prohibition, responsibility or obligation which is imposed by or under this Law or Legislation administered by the Registrar, the person is liable to compensate any other person for any loss or damage caused to that other person as a result of such conduct, and is otherwise liable to restore such other person to the position they were in prior to such conduct.’\nIn April 2020, the CFI issued a judgment in the case of Bassam Khalifa v S.W.I.F.T (Dubai) Limited in which it ruled that the Court had power to grant relief under Article 40 of the Operating Law for losses suffered as a result of breach of Article 64 of the Operating Law.\nIn this case, the Claimant, Mr Bassam Khalifa, was employed by the Defendant, S.W.I.F.T (Dubai) Limited as a commercial manager. During his employment, the Claimant alleges that he became aware of fraudulent activity as a result of which he made five disclosures to the Defendant between November 2017 and October 2018. An investigation was undertaken by the Defendant. On conclusion of the investigation, no further action was taken however, the Claimant’s employment was later terminated. The Claimant’s position was that he was terminated as a direct result of making the disclosures and as such, he should be afforded protection under Article 64 of the Operating Law and he sought relief under Article 40.\nThe Claimant’s arguments rested on the fact that even though the Operating Law came into effect after the disclosures had been made (on 12 November 2018), an individual is entitled to the protections afforded under Article 64 where the termination occurred after the introduction of the law. Effectively arguing that the Operating Law was to be applied retrospectively from its enactment. The CFI held in the Claimant’s favour indicating that it has the power (under Article 40) to grant relief for loss suffered as a result of a breach of Article 64.\nThe Court of Appeal has since overturned the CFI’s judgment and ruled that the Operating Law does not have retrospective effect and accordingly, dismissed the Claimant’s submissions that he was entitled to relief under Article 40 of the Operating Law.\nNotwithstanding, the Court of Appeal did affirm that where there has been a breach of the whistleblowing protections afforded under Article 64 of the Operating Law, that the CFI does have power to grant relief in accordance with Article 40, provided its terms are met.\nThe full judgment is publically available and can be accessed online.\nThe judgment is significant as it affirms that the CFI has the power to grant relief under Article 40 of the Operating Law where there has been a breach of the whistleblowing protections. Employees and ex-employees have a means by which they can seek compensation before the courts in the event that the applicable whistleblowing provisions under the Operating Law are engaged. Given these risks and the potential exposure, it increases the focus upon good corporate governance to ensure transparency, particularly in relation to financial dealings, by taking steps such as creating and maintaining proper whistleblowing policies and procedures.\nAccordingly, we would recommend a thorough review of your business’s existing whistleblowing framework to ensure that it is robust. Please let us know if you require any assistance with implementing and/or updating internal policies and procedures.', 'To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.\nIn 1994, the NSW Government introduced the Public Interest\nDisclosures Act 1994 (“PID Act”) to offer protection\nto whistleblowers who disclose evidence of corrupt conduct or\nmaladministration by a public authority or its officers.

4	compare return profit shareholders bank owners insurance company policy holders	In family-owned community banks and mutual insurance companies, there are different approaches to returning profits. For banks operating as S Corporations, profits are distributed through dividends to family shareholders, though these are often described as 'paltry.' Some family members who work at the bank also receive salaries. In contrast, mutual insurance companies share profits with policyholders through policy dividends, which are considered a return of premium. These dividends are declared annually by the board of directors, though they're not guaranteed. While bank shareholders may receive limited returns unless they're employed by the bank, mutual insurance policyholders can choose from up to five different dividend options including cash payments, paid-up additions, interest accumulation, premium reduction, or purchasing one-year term insurance.	['5 family bank myths that must be shattered\n...without leaving the next generation with a scrambled nest egg\n- Written by Jeff Gerrish\n- Comments: DISQUS_COMMENTS\nI have had the opportunity over the past several years to work with many, many family community banks. By this, I mean community banks that are owned by one or up to several families.\nThere is really no “norm” as it relates to asset size of family banks. Some are very small, while others are multi-billion dollar organizations.\nBecause shareholder information is not publicly available, it is difficult to tell how many true family banks there are in the U.S. Currently, however, there are 1,900 Subchapter S banks. Most of family banks operate under the Internal Revenue Code as S Corporations. Assuming approximately half of these banks are family-owned, this would put the percentage of family-owned banks at approximately 17% of all active charters.\nThe typical family bank lineage involves a matriarch and/or patriarch (depending on who lived longer), adult children, and, in many cases, adult grandchildren.\nHaving worked closely with many of these matriarchs and patriarchs over the years, it is my observation that they tend to operate under a series of myths.\nNow, these myths impact their expectations and actions as to what to do with the bank. I believe that family-owned community banks are invaluable to the industry, so I want to use this blog to identify and dispel these family-owned bank myths.\nMyth #1: Everyone will come clean with what they are really thinking at the annual family meeting.\nMany ownership families of these community banks have what can best be called “the annual family meeting” to discuss the bank and the family’s ownership. The general expectation of the heads of the families is that family members will participate openly, honestly, and candidly.\nIn reality, this virtually never happens.\nThere’s only way I have found to ensure that family members will be candid. This is to interview each individual family group—and possibly even each individual family member— separately.\nIn many cases, the adult children’s position is very different from the matriarch’s or patriarch’s position. However, the adult children are reluctant to disclose that, for fear that someone will be offended or misunderstand their position and the heart behind it. This is often particularly the case in a family meeting with cousins, brothers, and sisters present.\nFamily meetings are not the place to “come clean.” Family members would be better served to discuss their thoughts on continuation of the family’s ownership in the presence of an independent third party.\nMyth #2: No one wants to sell their shares in “our bank.”\nIn a typical family meeting, there will be some discussion of whether any of the individual family or family members want to sell their shares. At some point in that discussion, every single person present will say they have no wish to do so.\nWhat this really means: No one wants to sell their shares … not at a discount, that is.\nAt the right price, there are probably a number of individuals who would sell their shares. They simply do not want to sell them at the price the family is going to pay for them through the holding company redemption—i.e., a discount.\nIt would likely be a different conversation with different answers if the individuals were going to get the benefit of selling the whole community bank. In reality, however, that is not the typical discussion.\nWhy, then, would the individuals who would sell their shares under the right circumstances forego the additional value in the shares by selling them on a minority basis at this point in time?\nThese individuals may very well want cash, but selling their shares is likely not the best way to get cash.\nMyth #3: All family members are okay with some family members working in the bank and drawing salaries while others only receive dividends.\nThe reality: A major point of contention for many family-owned community banks is that some family members draw healthy salaries out of the bank, while other family members do not—and often get paltry dividends.\nThose drawing salaries and getting cash out of the bank (after all, they are working there) typically convince the remaining family members that leaving equity in the bank for future opportunities and growth makes more sense than distributing cash out to the shareholders.\nUnfortunately, the reality is that most family members actually want that additional cash in their pockets. Those are typically the ones that are not employed by the bank.\nCreativity usually comes into play here. One of the creative means I have seen utilized to put additional cash in the non-employee family members’ pockets is to put them in the employ of the bank in some fashion. For example:\n• I recall one bank that hired Grandma as the Chaplain for the holding company, at $25,000 per year.\n• I have seen banks provide consulting fees or some similar payment for services provided by other family members.\nMind you, such “solutions,” of course, are regulatorily suspect, and I’m not recommending them.\nSo this debate often circles right back to simply increasing the dividend. Again, the reality is this is that most family members want to offset the fact that they are not employed by the bank and drawing a salary.\nMyth #4: The kids will keep the bank after the matriarch and/or patriarch die.\nThe myth is that the kids will keep the bank. The myth is not that the kids will tell their parents they will keep the bank.\nTypically, most parents in family-owned banks want to keep the bank in business in perpetuity. In many cases, there are philanthropic underpinnings present.\nMy experience, however, has been that the kids in those situations are generally adults in their 40s and 50s. Generally, they have been the ones receiving the aforementioned paltry dividends rather than working in the bank.\nSo they will see bank stock as a $50 million to $100 million nest egg—and want the cash out of it. This will, of course, result in a sale of the bank shortly after the last senior relative passes away.\nI have counseled many family banks in this regard. One way to possibly prevent this occurrence is to convert to Subchapter S, if the bank and holding company have not already done so. Having done so, then ratchet up the distributions, and turn the bank into a cash cow to the extent that a family member who otherwise wants to sell simply cannot find any investment offering as much return.\nIt sounds too good to be true … because it is. In reality, it seems to be the best defense to a sale resulting from a generational shift.\nMyth #5: The matriarch and/or patriarch does not need to address these issues before they die. Someone else will take care of it.\nThe reality: When the family head dies, no one is going to take care of it.\nThe last place I typically want to stand is between one of the family members and a pot of money. It is a dangerous spot.\nFamily heads must develop a plan regarding what is going to happen to the community bank long before they pass away.\n• If it is going to be perpetuated as an independent community bank in the community, then that direction needs to be given and the appropriate structure needs to be established well beforehand.\n• If the bank is going to be sold, then the bank needs to organize into the structure that would make for the best, quickest, most efficient sale for the best price possible.\nThese issues are not going to solve themselves, regardless of what senior members of the family think. They may have already passed on and not be the ones having to deal with it, but in reality they will have typically left a significant mess for the family.\nI enjoy working with family-owned community banks.

That’s great news but what are you going to do with all that newfound cash? Well, the insurance company may give you up to five different dividend options to choose from.\nBelow, I’ll talk about the dividend options you can choose from along with some other things about dividends you might want to know.\nWhat are Whole Life Insurance Dividends?\nMutual insurance companies are owned by their policyholders. When a mutual company earns a profit, it may share some of that profit with you the policyholder.\nYour share of that profit is called a dividend.\nSince you pay a premium to the insurance company, any dividend you receive back is considered a return of premium.\nDividends are declared annually by the board of directors of mutual companies. Then it’s paid to you. Dividends are not guaranteed. The board of directors is under no obligation to pay you a dividend nor give you a set amount.\nThere are up to five dividend options you can choose from.\nLet’s talk about those options.\nThe Five Dividend Options\nAt the time you apply for your life insurance, you tell the insurance company how you want to be paid your dividend. Don’t worry, your choice isn’t locked in forever. You can change the option down the road if you want.\n- Paid in cash The insurance company will send you a check in the amount of your dividend. You can cash that check and do whatever you want with it.\n- Purchase paid up additions Instead of receiving a dividend check, you can ask the insurance company to keep your dividend in your policy and use it to buy what are called paid up additions. Paid up additions are like little tiny life insurance policies above and beyond your base policy. Each dollar of paid up additions, buys more than a dollar of paid up additions. Not a whole lot but slightly more than your dollar. That means, paid up additions increase the face amount of your policy.\n- Accumulate at interest The next option is to let the insurance company keep the dividend you received in an account that earns interest.\n- Reduce premiums You can choose to have the insurance company reduce your premium by the amount of the dividend.\n- Purchase one year term insurance In some cases, insurance companies will let your dividends by an additional amount of one year term insurance. This will also increase the face amount of your policy.\nWhich Dividend Option Should You Choose?\nDo All Life Insurance Policies Pay Dividends?\nAlso, a policy can be a participating policy but not expect to receive dividends. A good example of this might be a term policy. It’s more likely, the whole life policy will pay dividends but not always. In order to know for sure, you have to read your policy to find out.\nIf you have a policy with a stock company, you won’t receive dividends. Only the shareholders would.']	['<urn:uuid:ed587c91-0bbc-4905-b32a-98d43bb76c92>', '<urn:uuid:d07c6eac-198f-4eba-a9ee-5566afd5ec9b>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	10	119	1935
5	What are the artistic applications of flower pigments in art projects, and what precautions should be taken to protect these natural pigment artworks from UV damage?	Flower pigments can be used to create impressionist-like prints by pressing petals through polyester interfacing onto watercolor paper, with the resulting colors often differing from the original petals. However, these natural pigment artworks need protection from UV light, as continuous sunlight exposure can cause fading within 3-4 hours. To preserve such artwork, it should be framed using Museum Glass or Conservation Clear Glass, kept away from direct sunlight, and periodically stored in dark, climate-controlled environments to 'rest'.	['Plants have been used for thousands of years to make dyes. If you have ever had grass stains on your knees you have seen that pigments in plants can be released. In this project you will squeeze the pigments out of the plants to make flower prints. The result will give the flower shape with soft edges, almost like an impressionist painting. You may be surprised by the results, as the prints may not always be the same color as the petals.\nWhat You Need:\n- Craft mat or newspaper to protect your work service.\n- Watercolor or mixed media paper.\n- A piece of fine polyester knit interfacing, do not use fusible, it should be thin enough to see through.\n- A variety of brightly colord flower petals. Roses, marigolds, calendula, cosmos, dianthus or pansies are perfect.\n- A sheet of plastic to hold the project together\n- A popsicle or craft stick to release the pigment (the side of a spoon works as well)\n- Colored pencils or crayons to finish the pictures\nWhat To Do:\n- Pick a variety of flowers in the morning after the dew has dried. Place the stems in a bucket of water to keep fresh.\n- Work on a craft mat to protect your work surface, the pigments in the flowers can stain.\n- Place your art paper on the surface and place the polyester knit interfacing on top. The polyester interfacing will make it easy to remove the leftover petals.\n- Arrange a few petals to make a design. The top surface of the petal, which is the brightest part, should be face down on the polyester. It is best to work in one small area at a time.\n- Cover the flower petals with the clear plastic taking care not to move the petals.\n- Starting in thte center use the craft stick to rub the petals into the fabric. You want to press the petals from the center and work to the edges. The moisture and pigment will extrude through the polyester and onto the art paper. The petals will change color. It can take a couple minutes of rubbing to get all the moisture out.\n- Carefully pull up the fabric to check on your design. Notice the intensity and the colors are different from the original petal.\n- Remove the plastic and fabric to reveal your design. Notice the intensity and the colors are different from the original petal.\n- Scrape off the leftover petals in the fabric and choose a new spot to work with a clean part of the fabric\nOnce your picture is finished let it dry. When it is dry, draw in leaves and stems or other designs to complete your picture. The polyester fabric can be washed and dried and reused. If you keep the picture out of direct sun it will last for several years. With a little practice you can make cards and tags and many other pictures using this simple technique.', '—by Mark Harris, Founder & Director of the DAC Foundation\nA large part of the mission of the Dixie Art Colony Foundation is EDUCATION and PRESERVATION. On May 16, 2019, the DAC Foundation held a “Lunch & Learn” program titled “Restoration & Preservation.” At this program, examples of how exposure to light and acidic mats can damage artwork were shown and discussed. There’s a saying, “You don’t know what you don’t know.” If you collect or own paper or fabric works of art, make sure you EDUCATE YOURSELF ON THE DANGERS OF UV LIGHT.\nWhen you purchase a paper or fabric work of art from a gallery, or directly from an artist, ask if the work has been archivally framed. Also, keep in mind that when you take the artwork to a framer, most framers will use the cheapest materials available unless you request otherwise. Protect your investment by asking for UV light protection and acid-free mats.\nThere’s a reason why art museums limit the number of windows in the galleries. According to leading experts at NASA, paper, and fabric that is exposed to continuous sunlight without any UV protection can experience fading within as little as three to four hours. The time it takes for the damage to occur will depend on the individual piece of artwork and the amount of exposure over an extended period.\nTONING OR DARKENING, CAUSED BY ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT CAN BE SEEN IN THE MAGNOLIA PAINTING ABOVE BY DAC ARTIST KATHRYN NEVILLE. Fortunately, the darkening of the paper can be reversed by a qualified professional. Source: Dixie Art Colony Foundation Archives\nTIPS FOR KEEPING YOUR ARTWORK SAFE.\n- ALWAYS fame works on paper using Museum Glass ®, Conservation Clear Glass ®, or Optium ® Acrylic Glazing. If you are unsure about the glass currently on your work of art. Take it to a reputable framer and have the glazing changed.\n- Even if you use UV protected glazing, ALWAYS avoid displaying paper artwork in areas where direct sunlight enters the room. Conservation Clear Glass® will filter only 99 percent of the UV rays. Therefore, even with UV protection, experts recommend keeping your artwork away from direct SUNLIGHT. The cumulative effects of exposure can still be a concern.\n- Experts also recommend letting your paper and fabric artwork rest. That is why museums limit the period of time that an article of fabric or paper is on display. If your wish is to preserve your artwork for future generations, keep this practice in mind. During the resting period, artwork should be stored in a dark climate-controlled environment.\nSHOWN ABOVE ARE TWO IDENTICAL PRINTS. THE ONE TO LEFT SHOWS SERIOUS FADING CAUSED BY UV LIGHT.

6	I'm interested in bird conservation - what's being done to protect birds during their long migration journeys across different regions?	Conservation efforts focus on understanding and protecting birds throughout their full annual cycle. The Marra Lab studies how different stages of migration are affected by climate change and urbanization to assess species vulnerability. A major initiative is the Northeast Motus Collaboration, which is installing a network of receiver stations (50 in New England and 46 in Mid-Atlantic states) to track birds at key stopover locations. These stations are strategically placed using NEXRAD radar data and will be maintained for at least five years. This collaborative effort helps identify critical stopover habitats that need protection and allows researchers to understand where bottlenecks occur during migration, which spans thousands of miles. The data helps conservation managers make better decisions about where and how to protect important areas for migratory birds.	['Directed by Dr. Pete Marra, Laudato Si’ Professor of Biology and the Environment and director of the Earth Commons, the Marra Lab in Georgetown’s Department of Biology studies the ecology and conservation of birds throughout their whole lifecycles. Marra Lab research uses birds to help us define and understand broad environmental issues, tackling contemporary conservation challenges by addressing fundamental knowledge gaps at the intersection of ornithology, ecology and conservation biology.\nMigratory connectivity is the geographic and temporal linking of individuals and populations between one life cycle stage and another, such as between breeding and wintering locations for a migratory bird. The Marra Lab has completed or is working on or contributing to many range-wide tracking studies.\nThe full annual cycle describes a bird’s ecology across the year. The Marra Lab evaluates the impacts of climate on migratory birds in the different stages of their annual cycle in order to assess future effects of climate change on species’ vulnerability and the biology of birds.\nUrbanization has altered habitats, restructured avian communities, and influenced the range sizes and population dynamics of animal species. The Marra Lab researches how different anthropogenic changes to the natural world affect population trajectories of birds.\nAs of October 2019, the Kirtland Warbler’s successful recovery has lead to its removal from the endangered species list. The Marra Lab conducted a 4-year adaptive management experiment to reduce the Warbler’s reliance on conservation efforts.\nAlthough general threats to birds are well known (e.g., habitat loss, anthropogenic causes of mortality), we still cannot point to the specific limiting factors or causes of declines for most bird species. The Marra Lab investigates species- and population-specific limiting factors so conservation resources can be implemented in the highest-priority places\nThe Migratory Connectivity Project is working on two volume book entitled “Discovering Unknown Migrations: The Atlas of Migratory Connectivity for the Birds of North America.” This book will fill knowledge gap about the migratory connectivity for the birds of North America\nLaudato Si’ Professor of Biology and the Environment Professor, McCourt School of Public Policy Director, Georgetown University’s Earth Commons Emeritus Senior Scientist, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center\nPete comes to Georgetown University after a 20-year career at the Smithsonian Institution, most recently as Director of the Migratory Bird Center. He has a Ph.D. from Dartmouth College and has authored over 225 papers published in journals such as Science, Nature and Conservation Biology on various aspects of the biology and conservation of birds and other animals, as well as on topics as broad as urban disease ecology. He co-edited the frequently cited book – Birds of Two Worlds and recently published a second book – Cat Wars: The Devastating Consequences of Cuddly Killer. Pete lives in Takoma Park with his wife and two kids, is an avid fisherman, a gardener and cook.\nScientist Nathan Cooper detangles and endangered Kirtland’s Warbler from the mist net. Nathan Cooper at the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center is doing research on federally endangered Kirtland’s warblers — tagging 100 of them with highly miniaturized nanotags in the Bahamas, and then using automated receiver towers that will monitor the entire breeding range in Michigan to relocate them. It is the first time anyone has been able to study the same individual birds on both the wintering and breeding grounds—their behavior, nesting success, physical condition, even changes in their internal and external micro-biome from one site to the other. This should be a gold mine of information on what biologists call carryover effects — the way conditions on the wintering grounds, which have long been ignored by migratory ecologists, impact the breeding success of birds thousands of miles to the north and many months (even years) later. Scientists are finding that winter conditions, not the quality of breeding habitat in the north, is the single biggest determinant for nesting success and the rapid rate of climate change in Central America and the Caribbean, especially persistent drought, makes this a critical issue for migratory bird conservation. More and more birds are facing poor conditions in the tropics, and paying a price in fewer eggs and chicks, and higher mortality.\nBryant is trained as a behavioral and population ecologist. His research interests primarily focus on the linkages between animal movement and population ecology with special interests dealing with populations of migratory land birds. His work on the ecology of migratory birds began with his work on differential migration in a population of Savanna Sparrows at Bowdoin College under Nat Wheelwright. Since then he has undertaken numerous field research positions working with the Black-throated Blue warblers at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, the stopover ecology of passerine migrants on the Gulf Coast with the University of Southern Mississippi, to the winter ecology of American redstarts in Jamaica with the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center. His MSc focused on the stopover ecology of migratory warblers in the Great Lakes. By utilizing an automated radio telemetry array, he was able to determine the factors that influence migratory movement dynamics across western Lake Erie and Southern Ontario with implications on wind energy development throughout the Great Lakes. Bryant is currently pursuing his PhD at Cornell University’s Department of Natural Resources, and Cornell Lab of Ornithology, where he has returned to work in Jamaica on American Redstarts (advisors: Peter Marra & Amanda Rodewald) looking to develop upon his interests in the movement, behavioral, and population ecology of migratory birds.\nBrian is a quantitative ecologist and data scientist specializing in the ecology of birds in human-dominated landscapes. Brian earned a B.S. in Ecology from the University of North Carolina at Asheville in 2006 and a PhD in Quantitative Ecology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2015. Brian’s work utilizes mark-recapture, point count, radio and GPS tracking, citizen science, and GIS data to assess landscape and regional predictors of bird population dynamics, movement ecology, and community composition. As an expert-level computer programmer, he assists colleagues in quantifying field data and teaches professional workshops and graduate classes on Program R and data science. Currently, Brian is creating a data management system for storing and accessing field data and developing unique citizen science and education programs that engage the public in the ecology and conservation of urban systems.\nAmy earned her B.S. in Ecology and Systematic Biology from California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo in 2003, and her M.S. in Natural Resources/Wildlife Biology, studying the spatial ecology of Common Ravens, from Humboldt State University in 2011. Amy is mapping the Bird Banding Laboratory’s database of band recoveries, which includes over 5 million recoveries spanning over one hundred years. This information, along with all of the tracking data for all avian species in North America, will be synthesized and compiled into the Atlas of Migratory Connectivity for North American birds. Amy is part of the Migratory Connectivity Project, which works to improve the understanding of migratory connectivity, to promote full annual and life cycle biology research, and to advance the technological tools needed to track birds.\nCalandra is interested in the behavioral ecology and conservation of migratory birds. Her research aims to understanding how migratory birds interact with their environment throughout their annual cycle using both laboratory and field studies. For her postdoctoral research she is using satellite transmitters to track Yellow-billed cuckoos in order to study their movement ecology and identify spatiotemporal patterns of mortality. Stanley earned her bachelor’s and master’s of science in biology from York University, Canada, and her Ph.D. in biological sciences at the University of Maryland under the supervision of Dr. Peter Marra and Dr. Michele Dudash.\nHenry graduated from Tufts University (Roll ‘Bos) in 2019 with a joint BS in Biology and Environmental Science. He grew up in Exeter, NH, where he discovered his passion for ornithology. He LOVES birds, and his desire to understand their ecology is what gets him out of bed in the morning (#ForTheBirds). Henry’s research interests lie at the intersection of conservation ornithology and tropical ecology, and his past research has focused on the breeding biology and dispersal of Gray Vireos (Vireo vicinior) in New Mexico, the use of remote audio recorders for surveying cryptic species in the Amazon, improving the conservation site network for migratory shorebirds in the Americas, and uncovering the life histories of Andean Cock-of-the-rocks (Rupicola peruvianus) and other understudied species in the cloud forests of Ecuador. At Georgetown, Henry plans to study the full annual cycle of Neotropical migratory wood-warblers, and use integrated population models to pinpoint factors driving their declines. With over 3.2 billion individual birds lost in North America since 1970, understanding and addressing the threats faced by these species is paramount for mitigating further declines.\nEmily is an avian ecologist that has been working with birds for the last ten years. She comes to the Marra lab from working for the National Park Service in Alaska, where she studied the movements, ecology, and behavior of Denali’s resident and migratory birds. Prior to working at Denali National Park and Preserve, Emily completed her MSc at Kansas State University investigating the patterns and mechanisms to within-season breeding dispersal in grassland sparrows. Emily received her BSc in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation and BA degree in English literature from the University of Florida. Emily’s research interests center in migration ecology, with a particular interest in the evolutionary and ecological processes that give rise to variation in migratory behavior. Emily’s PhD research will focus on understanding the drivers that lead to different migratory strategies between palearctic and Nearctic migratory birds. Beyond her academic interests, Emily is passionate about outreach and the accessibility of science, and never foregoes an opportunity to get people excited about birds.', 'If you’ve ever run a 10K, a marathon, or a turkey trot, you’ve probably pinned a bib to your shirt displaying your name and race number. If you’re like me, it was crooked.\nRegardless, that bib helps race organizers keep track of participants: how many started, how many finished, who finished first, last, or not at all.\nScientists have long used a similar technique to help keep track of migratory birds. During fall and spring migration periods, ornithologists staff banding stations multiple days a week, catching birds and attaching small aluminum bands to their legs stamped with unique numbers, like tiny race bibs.\nBut there’s a big difference between tracking migrants and marathoners. Birds don’t have a start line, a finish line, or a marked course to follow with volunteers handing out energy gels and ringing cowbells along the way.\n“After we band a bird, it could be any length of time before we see it again, if at all,” said Lucas DeGroote, Avian Research Coordinator for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s Powdermill Nature Reserve in Pennsylvania, which has been banding birds since 1961. “We band 10 thousand birds every year, and only about two of those are recovered elsewhere that year,” he said.\nDespite the low recapture rate, banding still provides valuable information to researchers. “It gives us a snapshot of populations, and helps us understand their responses to change,” said DeGroote. Say, if you invest in improving stopover habitat at a site, banding can tell you if the total number and diversity of seasonal migrants increases in response.\nBut banding doesn’t tell scientists where else birds go on their migratory journey, and why.\n“The life cycles of migratory birds unfold over thousands of miles,” explained Lisa Kiziuk, Director of Bird Conservation for the Willistown Conservation Trust in Pennsylvania, who launched a banding station at the trust’s Rushton Woods Preserve a decade ago. “If we want to look at where the bottlenecks are, we need to see the whole life cycle.”\nGiven the dramatic decline in migratory bird species in North America, identifying those pinch points will be critical to ensure that enough stopover habitat is protected in the right places to support birds during these arduous journeys.\nFortunately, partners are gaining ground with new technology that tracks birds and other species along their migratory paths, wherever they may take them.\nWith support from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Pennsylvania Game Commission is leading a collaborative of two states and eight organizations to close a major geographic gap in the Motus Wildlife Tracking System, which uses nanotag transmitters and an array of radio telemetry receivers to study migratory routes and behaviors.\nPart of the Northeast Motus Collaboration, the partners have been awarded a state wildlife grant to install 50 new receiver stations across New England — adding to the 46 being installed in the Mid-Atlantic states — all sited strategically to provide maximum coverage of key stopover locations based on NEXRAD radar data. The funding guarantees that the towers will be in place for at least five years, an important warranty for researchers who often need a year or two just to set up a study.\n“Within the next decade, the entire region will be populated with stations listening for tags from wherever they’ve been deployed,” said Kiziuk, who is helping to lead the effort.\nThere will soon be a lot more to hear. While radio telemetry is not new in wildlife tracking, its use has traditionally been restricted to relatively large animals that can carry heavy transmitters, like hawks, snakes, and bobcats.\nThe nanotags deployed through Motus can be used on smaller species than ever, like the northern long-eared bat, Bicknell’s thrush, and even monarch butterflies.\n“Each tag weighs less than three percent of the weight of the animal,” Kiziuk said. The tags can emit radio signals at distinct time intervals, like a Morse code signal identifying each individual.\nPartners have already seen significant returns on investment. DeGroote said two-thirds of birds that have been nano-tagged in the project have been detected by towers, which are aligned latitudinally at specific intervals so they will pick up any individuals flying north or south across the region — sort of a proxy for runners crossing a start or finish line. “It’s a much better payoff in terms of detection while birds are moving,” he said.\nThat data on individual movement is a valuable complement to the population data that banding provides. Compare it to a race: If you are the director of a marathon, you want to know about how many people you can expect to register each year. But you also want to know how long it will take runners of varying skill levels to complete the course so you keep the roads blocked off for enough time, and you want to know where the toughest hills are so you can station volunteers at the top with energy gels and cowbells.\n“Motus allows us to ask different questions by tracking individuals, and individual decisions, at different times,” DeGroote said. Questions that can help researchers address specific challenges birds face during migration, including one of the deadliest: One billion birds die each year because they fly into windows, disoriented by the reflection of the sky in the glass.\nBut what happens to the ones that get back on their feet?\n“That’s where Motus comes in,” DeGroote said. “We can now track individuals that hit windows and survive to see what happens to them over time.”\nHis organization has equipped programs that respond to bird strikes in urban areas, like Lights out Baltimore, with nanotags to put on birds that are brought to rehabilitation centers after hitting windows, so they can monitor their survival and behavior when they are released back into the wild.\nDan Brauning, Wildlife Diversity Chief for Pennsylvania Game Commission and the grant project lead, explained that the ability to monitor individual birds lets us fine-tune how we measure this problem, and how best to respond. “As of now, the estimates of the impacts of collisions are based on finding dead birds,” he said. Those estimates don’t account for impacts to birds that take off and die later, or fly in the wrong direction because they are concussed.\n“Motus can help us understand how big the problem really is, and the relative threat it poses to different species,” Brauning said. That applies to other problems too. By connecting the dots between threats and responses across time and space, managers can see where they need to act to address problems on the ground.\nJust as important, Motus connects the dots between people who care about these problems, and empowers them to make decisions that reflect the landscape-level needs of migratory species.\nThrough the interactive map on the Motus website, participants can see the receiving stations, who owns them, and what species have been detected at each one. They can also see the conservation potential of having this regional data available at their fingertips.\n“It shows what can be accomplished with a diverse group of people working together,” Kiziuk.\n“Information is getting out there faster than ever, and can that can help us make better conservation decisions more efficiently,” she explained.\nUltimately, the effort to recover migratory species is not a sprint. It’s a relay between partners over thousands of miles, and collaboration is key to victory. Cowbells can’t hurt, though.\nby Bridget Macdonald, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, North Atlantic-Appalachian Region']	['<urn:uuid:f5c5ea18-4555-4985-a531-d679bd3d007f>', '<urn:uuid:81f7f077-6800-4c2c-b363-d04007c7790a>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	20	128	2850
7	How do storms affect both barrier islands and boardwalk durability?	Storms, particularly hurricanes, can dramatically reshape barrier islands through washover fans and breakthrough channels, as seen in examples like Dauphin Island during Hurricane Katrina. These same storm conditions also severely impact boardwalk structures - wooden boardwalks are especially vulnerable, requiring frequent repairs and replacement of deteriorated boards, while concrete boardwalks better withstand storm damage and coastal environments as demonstrated in case studies showing 20+ years of durability without major maintenance.	"['Pressure Treated Pine vs. Composite Decking vs. Hardwood vs. Precast Concrete\nMany owners familiar with boardwalk systems face the same question: ""How can we minimize the maintenance costs on our boardwalks?""\nAs you\'ve probably researched already, the biggest selling points for our PermaTrak system are the durability and lack of maintenance your client will need to pay for over 5, 10, 30 years. Per Army Corps of Engineers, reinforced precast concrete has a design life of 50-75 years.\nAll boardwalk suppliers will tell you their systems are low maintenance, but if you look into the potential for slippery boards, splinters, cupping, warping, rotting, etc. you\'ll find that maintenance problems will inevitably occur over time. Using an older, well known building material like precast concrete helps eliminate that maintenance problem many owners face.\nDesigners and owners will ask us: ""What maintenance do you recommend for PermaTrak? Or is there no maintenance recommended at all?"" The simple answer is: ""You could pressure wash it annually or every couple of years. We do not recommend any maintenance, other than an optional power washing once every several years.""\nIn many cases, cleaning a concrete surface is limited to hospitals, office buildings and high-end condominium complexes. The cleaning usually takes place at the front entrance and is strictly for aesthetics.\nBoardwalk decking products require maintenance when the material becomes functionally or structurally in need. On commercial boardwalk applications, that point is reached rather quickly with softwoods like Southern Yellow Pine or with composite lumber (plastic decking). Heavy pedestrian traffic, bicyclists, UV exposure, coastal environments, and freeze/thaw cycles can expedite the deterioration of these products.\n|Maintenance Cost ($-$$$$)||Twist/Warp||Fire Resistance or Fire Rating||Splinters||Color Fade||Rot/Decay|\n|Southern Yellow Pine - Pressure Treated||$$$$||High||Combustible: Class ""C"" Resistance||Yes||Med||High|\n|Composite Decking - Standard Plastics||$$$||Med||Combustible: Class ""C"" Resistance||No||Low||Low|\n|Hardwoods - Ipe||$$||Low||Combustible: Class ""A"" Resistance||No||High (stain/sealer recommended)||Low|\n|PermaTrak - Precast Concrete||$||None||Noncombustible: Hourly Fire Ratings||No||Low||None|\n[Case Study #1] Hamilton County, OH: Southern Yellow Pine vs. PermaTrak\nThe following maintenance cost comparison was generated by Hamilton County Park District in Hamilton, OH. The application involved a narrow 160\' wetland boardwalk leading to a 40\' observation deck. The design live load requirement was pedestrian only.\nA pressure treated timber boardwalk system was given a life expectancy of 16 years. After 16 years of use, the structure was to be demolished and replaced. You can see the hike in life cycle structure costs at year 16 on the graph below. The County accounted for a timber boardwalk powerwash and sealer application every 4 years, estimated at $1.50/SF. Lastly, maintenance funds were allocated new screws/tightening old screws, and replacing individual boards once they had deteriorated or warped too badly.\nThe County planned to powerwash the PermaTrak wetland boardwalk once every 4 years at a cost of $1/SF. This was the only maintenance item presented.\n- After 20 years, the cost of the timber structure was roughly 2x that of PermaTrak\'s wetland boardwalk.\n- After 40 years, a timber structure would cost the County over 4x that of the PermaTrak structure.\n[Case Study #2] Granite Island, Adelaide, Australia: Australian Hardwood vs. PermaTrak\nThe PermaTrak boardwalk system was originally invented in Australia in the mid-1990\'s.\nWithout any maintenance, the photos on this page show what the PermaTrak boardwalk photo looked like in 2009 and 2014, respectively.\nWith two common boardwalk materials present on Granite Island in Adelaide, Australia, this project offers a good example of life cycle maintenance numbers. As a popular tourist destination in a coastal environment, both boardwalk materials are subject to harsh weathering conditions.\n- PermaTrak was installed in 1996 during Phase I of this project, totaling an estimated 7200 SF.\n- An Australian hardwood material was installed on an estimated 1350 SF in 1999 during Phase II.\nDesigners saw this hardwood material as more suitable for use as steps up the face of the island.

8	What causes ceramic brittleness, and how does fracture propagation occur?	Ceramic brittleness is primarily caused by limited slip systems for dislocation motion and the presence of omnipresent small flaws that act as stress raisers. During fracture propagation, a crack accelerates until reaching a critical velocity (about half the speed of sound in glass). The fracture surface shows distinct regions: a mirror region formed during initial acceleration, followed by a mist region, and finally a hackle region with radiating striations. In polycrystalline ceramics, the inherent microstructural roughness can make it difficult to identify these boundaries clearly.

Fracture mirrors are telltale fractographic markings in brittle materials that surround a fracture origin as discussed in Practices C1256 and C1322. Fig. 1 shows a schematic with key features identified. Fig. 2 shows an example in glass. The fracture mirror region is very smooth and highly reflective in glasses, hence the name “fracture mirror.” In fact, high magnification microscopy reveals that, even within the mirror region in glasses, there are very fine features and escalating roughness as the crack advances away from the origin. These are submicrometer in size and hence are not discernable with an optical microscope. Early investigators interpreted fracture mirrors as having discrete boundaries including a “mirror-mist” boundary and also a “mist-hackle” boundary in glasses. These were also termed “inner mirror” or “outer mirror” boundaries, respectively. It is now known that there are no discrete boundaries corresponding to specific changes in the fractographic features. Surface roughness increases gradually from well within the fracture mirror to beyond the apparent boundaries. The boundaries were a matter of interpretation, the resolving power of the microscope, and the mode of viewing. In very weak specimens, the mirror may be larger than the specimen or component and the boundaries will not be present.\nFigs. 3-5 show examples in ceramics. In polycrystalline ceramics, the qualifier “relatively” as in “relatively smooth” must be used, since there is an inherent roughness from the microstructure even in the area immediately surrounding the origin. In coarse-grained or porous ceramics, it may be impossible to identify a mirror boundary. In polycrystalline ceramics, it is highly unlikely that a mirror-mist boundary can be detected due to the inherent roughness created by the crack-microstructure interactions, even within the mirror. The word “systematic” in the definition for “mirror-hackle boundary in polycrystalline ceramics” requires some elaboration. Mirror boundary hackle lines are velocity hackle lines created after the radiating crack reaches terminal velocity. However, premature, isolated hackle can in some instances be generated well within a ceramic fracture mirror. It should be disregarded when judging the mirror boundary. Wake hackle from an isolated obstacle inside the mirror (such as a large grain or agglomerate) can trigger early “premature” hackle lines. Steps in scratches or grinding flaws can trigger hackle lines that emanate from the origin itself. Sometimes the microstructure of polycrystalline ceramics creates severe judgment problems in ceramic matrix composites (particulate, whisker, or platelet) or self-reinforced ceramics whereby elongated and interlocking grains impart greater fracture resistance. Mirrors may be plainly evident at low magnifications, but accurate assessment of their size can be difficult. The mirror region itself may be somewhat bumpy; therefore, some judgment as to what is a mirror boundary is necessary.\nFracture mirrors are circular in some loading conditions such as tension specimens with internal origins, or they are nearly semicircular for surface origins in tensile specimens, or if the mirrors are small in bend specimens. Their shapes can vary and be elongated or even incomplete in some directions if the fracture mirrors are in stress gradients. Fracture mirrors may be quarter circles if they form from corner origins in a specimen or component. Fracture mirrors only form in moderate to high local stress conditions. Weak specimens may not exhibit full or even partial mirror boundaries, since the crack may not achieve sufficient velocity within the confines of the specimen.\nFracture mirrors not only bring one’s attention to an origin, but also give information about the magnitude of the stress at the origin that caused fracture and their distribution. The fracture mirror size and the stress at fracture are empirically correlated by Eq 1:\n|=||stress at the origin (MPa or ksi),|\n|=||fracture mirror radius (m or in),|\n|=||fracture mirror constant (MPa√m or ksi√in).|\nA, the “fracture mirror constant” (sometimes also known as the “mirror constant”) has units of stress intensity (MPa√m or ksi√in) and is considered by many to be a material property. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, it is possible to discern separate mist and hackle regions and the apparent boundaries between them in glasses. Each has a corresponding mirror constant, A. The most common notation is to refer to the mirror-mist boundary as the inner mirror boundary, and its mirror constant is designated Ai. The mist-hackle boundary is referred to as the outer mirror boundary, and its mirror constant is designated Ao. The mirror-mist boundary is usually not perceivable in polycrystalline ceramics. Usually, only the mirror-hackle boundary is measured and only an Ao for the mirror-hackle boundary is calculated. A more fundamental relationship than Eq 1 may be based on the stress intensity factors (KI) at the mirror-mist or mist-hackle boundaries, but Eq 1 is more practical and simpler to use.\nThe size predictions based on Eq 1 and the A values, or alternatively stress intensity factors, match very closely for the limiting cases of small mirrors in tension specimens. This is also true for small semicircular mirrors centered on surface flaws in strong flexure specimens. So, at least for some special mirror cases, A should be directly related to a more fundamental parameter based on stress intensity factors.\nThe size of the fracture mirrors in laboratory test specimen fractures may be used in conjunction with known fracture mirror constants to verify the stress at fracture was as expected. The fracture mirror sizes and known stresses from laboratory test specimens may also be used to compute fracture mirror constants, A.\nThe size of the fracture mirrors in components may be used in conjunction with known fracture mirror constants to estimate the stress in the component at the origin. Practice C1322 has a comprehensive list of fracture mirror constants for a variety of ceramics and glasses.\n1.1 This practice pertains to the analysis and interpretation of fracture mirror sizes in brittle materials. Fracture mirrors (Fig. 1) are telltale fractographic markings that surround a fracture origin in brittle materials. The fracture mirror size may be used with known fracture mirror constants to estimate the stress in a fractured component. Alternatively, the fracture mirror size may be used in conjunction with known stresses in test specimens to calculate fracture mirror constants. The practice is applicable to glasses and polycrystalline ceramic laboratory test specimens as well as fractured components. The analysis and interpretation procedures for glasses and ceramics are similar, but they are not identical. Different optical microscopy examination techniques are listed and described, including observation angles, illumination methods, appropriate magnification, and measurement protocols. Guidance is given for calculating a fracture mirror constant and for interpreting the fracture mirror size and shape for both circular and noncircular mirrors including stress gradients, geometrical effects, and/or residual stresses. The practice provides figures and micrographs illustrating the different types of features commonly observed in and measurement techniques used for the fracture mirrors of glasses and polycrystalline ceramics.\n1.2 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard.\n1.3 This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.\n2.

The principal drawback is a disposition to catastrophic fracture in a brittle manner with very little energy absorption.\nBRITTLE FRACTURE OF CERAMICS At room temperature, virtually all ceramics are brittle.\nMicrocracks Its presence results in amplification of applied tensile stresses and accounts for relatively low fracture strengths (flexural strength).\nAt room temperature, both crystalline and noncrystalline ceramics almost always fracture before any plastic deformation can occur in response to an applied tensile load. Crack growth in crystalline ceramics may be either transgranularor intergranular\nThe measured fracture strengths of ceramic materials are substantially lower than predicted by theory from interatomic bonding forces. The measure of a ceramic material’s ability to resist fracture when a crack is present is specified in terms of fracture toughness.\nvery small and omnipresent flaws in the material stress raisers may be minute surface or interior cracks (microcracks), internal pores, and grain corners, which are virtually impossible to eliminate or control.\nstatic fatigue, or delayed fracture fracture of ceramic materials will occur by the slow propagation of cracks, when stresses are static in nature this type of fracture is especially sensitive to environmental conditions, specifically when moisture is present in the atmosphere.\nFRACTOGRAPHY OF CERAMICS A fractographic study involves examining the path of crack propagation as well as microscopic features of the fracture surface.\nduring propagation, a crack accelerates until a critical velocity is achieved; for glass, this critical value is approximately one-half of the speed of sound. Upon reaching this critical velocity, a crack may branch, a process that may be successively repeated until a family of cracks is produced.\nmirror region - The crack surface that formed during the initial acceleration stage of propagation mist region- a faint annular region just outside the mirror hackle region- a set of striations or lines that radiate away from the crack source in the direction of crack propagation\nSTRESS-STRAIN BEHAVIOR The stress–strain behaviorof brittle ceramics is not usually ascertained by a tensile test.\nFirst, it is difficult to prepare and test specimens having the required geometry.\nSecond, it is difficult to grip brittle materials without fracturing them;\nThird, ceramics fail after only about 0.1% strain, which necessitates that tensile specimens be perfectly aligned to avoid the presence of bending stresses, which are not easily calculated.\nFlexural Strength The stress at fracture using flexure test.\nElastic Behavior a linear relationship exists between stress and strain.\nMECHANISMS OF PLASTIC DEFORMATION Any plastic deformation of crystalline ceramics is a result of dislocation motion; the brittleness of these materials is explained, by the limited number of slip systems.\nCrystalline Ceramics plastic deformation occurs, as with metals, by the motion of dislocations. One reason for the hardness and brittleness of these materials is the difficulty of slip (or dislocation motion).\nNon-crystalline Ceramics These materials deform by viscous flow, the same manner in which liquids deform; the rate of deformation is proportional to the applied stress.\nViscosity a measure of a noncrystalline material’s resistance to deformation.\nFor viscous flow in a liquid that originates from shear stresses imposed by two flat and parallel plates, the viscosity is the ratio of the applied shear stress and the change in velocity dvwith distance dyin a direction perpendicular to and away from the plates\nThe units for viscosity are: Poises (P): 1P = 1 dyne-s/cm2 and Pascal-seconds (Pa-s): 1 Pa-s = N-s/m2 Conversion from one system of units to the other is according to: 10P = 1Pa-s\nMISCELLANEOUS MECHANICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nInfluence of Porosity As will be discussed in chapter 13, the precursor material is in the form of a powder. Subjected to compaction for formation of desired shape, pores will exist between the powder particles. During heat treatment, much of this porosity will be eliminated; however, it is often the case that this pore elimination process is incomplete and some residual porosity will remain.\nAny residual porosity will have a deleterious influence on both the elastic properties andstrength. For example, it has been observed for some ceramic materials that the magnitude of the modulus of elasticity E decreases with volume fraction porosity.\nThe influence of porosity on the modulus of elasticity for aluminum oxide at room temperature.\nThe influence of porosity on the flexural strength for aluminum oxide at room temperature.\nHardness One beneficial mechanical property of ceramics is their hardness, which is often utilized when an abrasive or grinding action is required; in fact, the hardest known materials are ceramics.\nA listing of a number of different ceramic materials according to Knoop hardness is contained in Table 12.6. Only ceramics having Knoophardnesses of about 1000 or greater are utilized for their abrasive characteristics.\nCreep Often ceramic materials experience creep deformation as a result of exposure to stresses (usually compressive) at elevated temperatures.\nIn general, the time–deformation creep behavior of ceramics is similar to that of metals; however, creep occurs at higher temperatures in ceramics. High-temperature compressive creep tests are conducted on ceramic materials to ascertain creep deformation as a function of temperature and stress level.']	['<urn:uuid:0e15b1b5-4e5c-44f4-8213-b37056fa4495>', '<urn:uuid:9d8cd169-b84a-49e6-9ec3-5d5d00f58c20>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	10	85	2415
9	why is group work important architecture	Group work is fundamental in contemporary architecture because projects have become too complex for a single architect to handle everything. The architect acts as a manager of complexity, working with engineers and other professionals who can improve different aspects of the project. Working in groups allows projects to go further than individual work, since it benefits from different perspectives and capabilities. Through group discussions and tension between different viewpoints, better solutions emerge and help move architecture forward.	['Conversations; The Keys to Teaching Architecture Today\nConversations; The Keys to Teaching Architecture Today\nThese conversations take place in the framework of the preliminary tasks of the book Cutting-edge Landscapes. This book goes beyond being a collection of student projects from Final Design Project TFG year of Esarq_UIC 2014/2015. Actually it’s a publication that aims to share an intense 11-month structured reflection with the objective to provide new opportunities to peri-urban landscapes. Rather than discuss the evolution of the workshop or any other specific aspects, due to the experience of Carlos Pereda as special teacher invited last year, we wanted to delve into a relaxed conversation about the keys of the teaching of architecture and the different sensibilities to deal with.\nCarlos Pereda, Marta García-Orte and Miquel Lacasta\nIl Giardinetto restaurant, Mai the 21st, 2015, 14.00h\nMiquel Lacasta: Instead of talking about this year’s workshops, which you’re not familiar with, we’d like to make the most of your visit to Barcelona to exchange opinions about the keys to teaching architecture today.\nCarlos Pereda: Quite honestly, I have to say I don’t know. Though I do think that teaching should keep reality very clearly in its sights. Your academic strategy, which I had the pleasure to share last year as course mentor, and which I see is ongoing, not only seems interesting and rewarding; it is also a course that raises issues about our reality. Obviously, if we want the students to be architects of their location, time and place, they have to deal with exercises that have a degree of complexity. How could it not be a great learning experience to bring together in the same exercise and workshop situations where one student is concentrating on the edge, another on the landscape, another on the productive system, or on construction, while yet another is working on an intervention at the urban scale? This is the definition of a rewarding exercise that brings students right up to date.\nOne of the keys is, then, looking at what is happening and trying to open students’ eyes to what they are going to find, rather than lapsing into the endogamy of thinking that the profession and society are unchanging.\nI would say, then, that the key is to look at and listen to what is happening.\nML: I agree. In an introduction to one FYP course, I told the students that an architecture degree is like a wind tunnel: it’s a place where you test the aerodynamics of your knowledge, gradually increasing the pressure to see your reactions and behaviour.\nThis is, ultimately, the reality that students will find when they’re out there on their own, as qualified professionals, in the face of changing situations.\nSo it’s a testing ground where the student learns on the basis of her own experience, rather than being offered a closed parcel of knowledge. Of course, part of the studies are like that, but it’s not the case of Projects.\nPressure is gradually changing and increasing the complexity of conditions in this artificial climate of the testing ground that is a school. Conditions that change year after year until they produce the proposed FYP we offer at the ESARQ, like a pre-professional project which, apart from the budget, offers all the components of the equation that go to make up a project: installations, construction, accessibility, urbanism… This formula is possible thanks to the fact that the university places all its departments at the service of the course, led by Projects, but it is the project of the school, not just of our area.\nMarta García-Orte: Exactly, we submit them to greater complexity to equip them with more mechanisms, tools and capacity to manoeuvre.\nCP: The degree course is long enough and yet short enough for the student to realize what architecture is, and, by means of this pre-reality and the inputs of our profession and their professional dynamic, start to form a more precise idea of what each hopes to do professionally.\nThere is an aspect of the briefs that you propose in your courses that I think is very interesting, because architecture is based very clearly on need. What do we need today? Housing? Yes, of course, but we also need programmatic, geographical and urban research, to solve problems. And there are problems that really do need help and rather more complex solutions for production, circulation or movements, because we live in a global world.\nApproaching reality in terms of this complexity is valuable both for the student and for the whole workshop, and it seems an ideal path to take in the times in which we are living.\nNeed is a basic condition in architecture.\nML: I like that; it reminds me of two interviews with Víctor López-Cotelo that I’ve read. He referred to architecture in terms of intelligence. He said that what matters is not what your project is like but its intelligence. What’s more, beauty comes from the intelligence that you bring to the project. To associate this with what you’re saying, the very purpose of intelligence is to meet this need you refer to. And this disarms any pseudo-artistic approach to the design condition that left formal fever years behind. By this, I don’t mean that a project shouldn’t be beautiful—it has to be extremely beautiful, organoleptic, even! It has to be capable of enveloping you and constructing, using intelligence, a complete and complex response to this need, which is where the concept of beauty comes in.\nBeauty is in fact the contraposition to today’s austere, conservative trend, where things have to be apparently cheap in order to be architecture for times of crisis, just as it is also the contraposition to trivial formalism, or the parametric craze.\nCP: I completely agree; I’d just like to mention a comment I read about the concept of beauty. Beauty in architecture does not refer to aesthetics; it has to be the final utility of architecture. Architecture is useful for many other things before that.\nML: Beauty is useful, too…\nMGO: And beauty is necessary!\nCP: And as for the austere line, architecture is based on need and measure. So if an auditorium is needed, you have to exactly measure all the questions of brief, function, concept, construction, economy and the times in which we live, but without turning all that into a formula.\nML: Exactly, not lapsing into automatism, or a reductionism of complexity.\nCP: Because when this austerity becomes a safe formula for immediate consumption, it then becomes a fashion. We have to respond to a need with the measure that that need requires.\nML: Let’s talk about more personal experience. Now you’re returned actively, deliberately and successfully to teaching in Saragossa, tell us what you’re doing, what approach you’re taking, and the pleasure of getting out of the studio for a day!\nCP: It is a pleasure! It’s so intense that the next day, or even two days later, I still have a kind of hangover. After doing studio work for years, when you go back to teaching, you realise that it is very rewarding if you take it as a mechanism to convey not knowledge but an attitude. You realise that the students notice this; they are receptive and they believe it. You see that they’re not the same when they start and when they finish the course.\nIt’s like being young again, seeing their ingenuity and freshness; the way they consider and present projects is fantastic.\nIn Saragossa we’re teaching a course that corresponds to years three and four, in which we consider architecture as the product of ideas, and the ideas are not predetermined; we try to open their minds. For reasons of closeness, the exercises are located right in the city, and this last semester we’ve had them working on high-rise buildings. They had to work in a group and the magnitude of the task was sufficiently ambitious to enable them to learn about team work and organization, as well as learning with the project.\nThe model had to talk about construction and structure—we’re talking about models that were two metres tall!\nSomething singular about our courses is the fact that we always refer to cubic metres, not square metres. In this way, the briefs are declarations of space, not surface area, which forces the student to have recourse to other documents than floor plans. What stood out most about this last task was how much we enjoyed the last day, with the staging of the project that goes beyond teaching to form part of architecture: how to present projects, how to explain them. This made the last workshop particularly intense.\nI particularly remember one team that transported their model packed up in ten cardboard boxes. They got to the university at 10:00 and finished at 13:00. They were assembling it in the university lobby in a double-height space where the corridors of classrooms met, and when they finished, the students in the engineering part came out to applaud.\nML: The moment of joint project design when they start to work as a group is fundamental. It is also perhaps one of the most defining moments in the way of practising contemporary architecture. Authorship is diluted among a whole bunch of people who are involved in a project. The processes have become so complex that the architect is a manager of complexity who cannot do it all herself.\nWe are the ones who design the project, and lead and monitor it from start to finish, but it’s very important to have good engineers beside you whose structural resolution can give the project great spatial quality, for example. The same goes for all the professional branches that surround a project, and part of our genetic code should be the ability to surround ourselves with the best, so that they improve the project. The architect may have led the process throughout, but who is the author?\nCP: As I see it, these days it’s a job for a group, and the responsibility belongs to the group, too. I understand that real learning lies in difference. When you get to a point and then, in the next job, you reach that same point, you really haven’t learned much. When you advance a little further and you find differences between the two jobs, that is when you have really learned something. Difference is always at the bottom of the learning process.\nWhen it’s well coordinated, a group project is obviously capable of going much further than an individual project, which is limited by personal capacity.\nThen there is a transcendent leap that we make as architects; rather than individuals producing marvellous projects, the transcendence lies in the group, in moving forward towards civilization. We tell the students that a lot of arguing is needed—a lot! It’s in this tension created by realising that you’re not 100% right, or someone else telling you something you don’t quite understand but then suddenly it clicks—it’s this and nothing else that generates an identity for the team or for the school. In your case, the fact that all the departments place themselves at the service of the FYP is a great exercise in architecture that also generates a positive twofold effect as an architect and as a human being.\nML: And it reminds you what a professional is these days, and that you can’t sort out everything yourself like architects did 30 years back. Today, you form part of a chain of value and, along with the client, you’re the one who knows most about the project. There’s a word I like that’s used a lot in innovation: disruptive. It means when, in a conversation between two people where each is talking about something, there is a sincere desire to listen and understand. Unless there is a desire to share, you’re going nowhere. But if you really want to generate something, sharing can prompt a disruptive idea that has nothing to do with what either one is saying—it’s the product of the two. As though a new idea emerged from the confrontation of two others, but this happens in a conversation marked above all by the desire to listen and understand, because in your difference from the other, there is something you’ll be able to use in your favour.\nCP: To return to something you said earlier, I have the bad—or good—habit of looking at project credits. And when a project really interests me, it rarely involves just a couple of people. If it does, I find that rather suspicious. It seems to me obvious that a project is not the work of just one person. There are very good people who have a lot of good things to contribute.\nML: Carlos, if we could convey this 110% to our students, we could really say we’ve done our job! You’re so passionate about architecture, I’m sure it gets across. Thank you for the talk! Let’s do it again some time.\nMGO: Thank you very much, Carlos. Once again, it’s been a pleasure.\nCP: Thanks to you two! I’ll come back soon so we can carry on talking about architecture.\nThe image that illustrates this post come from the exhibition and the final jury week we did last year at MNAC with the splendid collaboration of Carlos Pereda. This year we will repeat at MNAC the next 21st to 26th of July in Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, MNAC, in Barcelona. You are all invited!']	['<urn:uuid:5777fd41-11ec-47a2-b7f9-e18ed344d7da>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	6	77	2248
10	blind mobility daily life science solutions	Several Intel ISEF projects address mobility for the blind, including a 'Traffic Control System for the Blind' ensuring 99% road safety through a 'talking traffic junction' and an 'FPGA Based Real-time Assistance System' to help blind people map their world. These innovations align with key challenges faced by people with sensory disabilities, as deafblindness significantly impacts mobility, independence in daily living skills, and orientation.	['Built in Africa focuses on entrepreneurs, startups and technologies that hail from the continent and empower its citizens.\nTouted as the world’s largest international pre-university science competition, Intel’s International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF) provides a platform for young innovators to create, invent and reinvent in the field of science and engineering and hopefully change the world.\nAnnually the competition brings together more than 1 700 high school students from over 70 countries, regions, and territories to showcase their independent research and compete for more than US$5-million in awards.\nThe competition begins with local and school-sponsored science fairs, with the winners then going on to participate in Intel ISEF-affiliated regional and state fairs. From there, the best win the opportunity to attend Intel ISEF.\nThe competition gives students the opportunity to have their work judged and discussed by doctoral level scientists and Nobel laureates. The 2014 edition of ISEF sees 1 300 students from more than 70 countries between the ages of 14 and 18 showing off experiments they hope will change the world.\nThis year, 29 Africa teams from five countries will be participating with projects that range from alternative energy sources, immunotherapy, voice recognition, pest control and aids for the visually impaired. It will also mark the first time that Kenya has participated in the competition with two teams.\nIn this, our seventh instalment of our “Built in Africa” series, we take a look at how Africa’s best and brightest inspiring the world with their creations at ISEF.\n- Computational Prediction of Vaccine Potential Epitopes and 3D Structure of XAGE-1b for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Immunotherapy — this project is hoping to use existing research to find an anti-cancer medication.\n- Eye Detection and Tracking-Based Communication System for Tetraplegia Patients — this system hopes to offer a new portable, wireless, rechargeable and low-cost communication system that will help tetraplegia patients communicate better.\n- Voice Recognition Based Elections Voting System for Blind — this project hopes to create a voice recognition system that will allow the blind to be able to vote.\n- G-14: A New Kind of Multi-rotors — this project is hoping to build a smarter, faster and more versatile electric aircraft.\n- High-performance Solar Thermoelectric Energy Conversion System with Efficient Thermal Concentration — this research aims to design, fabricate and investigate a more promising, cost effective, and highly efficient Solar Thermoelectric Generator (STEG) based on the Seebeck effect.\n- Water Integrated Desalination System using Graphene Sheets and Silver Nano Particles — this project wants to find more efficient ways to produce water for drought prone areas.\n- Heating Houses Using a Friction-Based Heating System that Employs Renewable Energy Sources — this project wants to find a new way of heat home, through the use of friction to produce a heating system.\n- Biofuel from Tree Fungus — this project aims to identify if it is possible to produce high quality biodiesel that runs engines longer than diesel from the Gliocladium Roseum fungus.\n- Multiple Chemical Generator — this research hopes to develop a model that can be used to reduce pollutants not only in air but also in water as well as in domestic uses in a cost effective way.\n- Traffic Control System for the Blind — this team hopes to make it easier for the blind to cross the road through an automated system that ensure 99% road safety. The team calls it a “talking traffic junction”.\n- Who Says Energy Is Scarce?

Deafblindness is known throughout the world as the most isolating of all disabilities.\nThese difficulties can occur even when hearing loss and vision loss are mild, because the two senses usually work together and one usually helps compensate for loss of the other. This is why deafblindness, (combined sensory loss) has a significant impact on a person’s life, even when they are not totally blind or deaf.\nThe nature and impact of deafblindness is affected by many factors including whether it is congenital (born deafblind) or adventitious (acquired). There are variations within every group and each person brings individual perspectives and experience to living with dual sensory loss. No matter what the extent of loss, it may affect all or some of the following:\n- orientation and mobility\n- confidence and self-esteem\n- independence in daily living skills\n- access to information, education and employment\n- access to interpreters and aids and equipment, because of cost\nAll of these can cause fatigue and frustration in dealing with everyday situations.\nHow do deafblind people communicate?\nWe all have a need to interact and communicate with people around us to share knowledge and information; to exchange greetings; to convey our needs; to express how we are feeling or to make choices.\nThis interaction may be informal or formal and may take place between one individual and another; or there may be a group of people who are communicating with each other.\nWhen we are communicating with other people, whether it is in an educational, employment or social situation, the interaction connects us to others.\nCommunication preferences for people who are deafblind may involve the use of a combination of methods that have been adapted depending on:\n- whether the individual is congenitally deafblind or they have acquired dual sensory loss\n- the extent to which the person’s vision and/or hearing is affected\n- acquisition of language\nCommunication methods that may be used with people who are deafblind\n- Lip reading\n- Auslan (Australian Sign Language)\n- Signed English\n- Key Word Sign (formerly known as Makaton)\n- Tactile Signing\n- Signs used on the body\n- Co-active signing\n- Visual frame signing\n- Deafblind manual alphabet\n- Printing on palm\n- Social Haptics\n- Body language\n- Facial expressions\n- Object symbols\n- Written (large print writing or typed information)\n- Use of communication devices\nThere are many technological aids which may be used by people who are deafblind. Technology developed for people who are blind or have a vision impairment, or for people who are deaf or have a hearing impairment, or technologies which span both as well as devices developed specifically for people who are deafblind.\nThere is more general technology becoming available to deafblind people all the time, in this age of technology, so always ask us.\nFor more information, please go to: Deafblind Information\nDeafblind Information by Senses Australia This website was established to ensure that individuals living with a combination of vision and hearing impairments, their families and support members, professionals and service providers, have an accessible, web-based resource available to them.\nDeafblind Australia (DBA) An important role of DBA is to help empower people who are deafblind in regard to self-determination and self-advocacy.\nAble Australia We reach out to people with multiple disabilities including deafblindness, supporting them in achieving self-fulfilment and connection with the greater community.\nSense International We have put together a list of useful links to some other organisations which represent people with deafblindness and support and promote deafblindness.']	['<urn:uuid:2c2a7863-3306-4819-9012-9da2cd6b47e5>', '<urn:uuid:1c171240-6f55-4c77-bc95-dbc5063d4292>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	6	64	1838
11	What kind of horseback riding equipment is recommended for trail expeditions in Tierra del Fuego, and what safety precautions should be taken with saddles and tack?	For horseback riding in Tierra del Fuego, essential equipment includes waterproof leather boots, multiple pairs of wool and cotton socks, waterproof clothing layers, gloves (2 pairs preferably waterproof), warm hats, and a waterproof backpack. As for saddle safety, it's crucial to use a clean, well-oiled saddle that fits both horse and rider, with proper rigging including a breast collar attached to D-rings for mountain riding. The saddle should be double-rigged in the ¾ position to avoid chafing, and all tack should be labeled and free of protruding nails and wear.	"[""Expedition horseback riding\nThis excursion is going to be done in the well-known Esqueletos´s Coast, located in Mitre´s Peninsula, on the south east of Tierra del Fuego, that wonderful place in the End of the World.\nDuring long hours we are going to be in the deep nature of Tierra del Fuego, enjoying of it variety on wildlife and flora.\nOur way to move around are going to be horses specially trained to walk on this land, same as many years ago, the men who explored over the Patagonia.\nThe most wonderful of this excursion is the pleasure of the loneliness sensation that you are going to experiment once we are in places that are far away of any city or noise.\nThe landscape invited us to discover the silence and with a lot of respect the secret that they are hiding in these millenaries trails. During the tour we are going to have the opportunity of seeing really close the variety on the wildlife that includes cows, wild horses, also cetaceans shipwrecks of hundreds years old, abandoned ranches, Indian trails and more. At night we are going to make a fire to enjoy, share experiences, to tell stories, always in the magnificent company of the Austral Sea; that it gets its name from the big amount of whale´s skeletons and sea lion’s skeletons, also of the establishments and boats which where famous many years ago.\nWe are going to be in the most magnificent adventure, with a constant contact with the nature and it changing climatic conditions. If you are lucky and the surrounding allows us, maybe you could fish.\nThe overnight is going to be in tents which will give us more contact with the night and it mysteries, also you are going to get relax with the constant sound of the Ocean, and we are going to be in contact with the people who live in the ranch. This experience is unique and one way or another it will change us forever.\nDay 1: Ushuaia / Maria Luisa Ranch / La Chaira Station\nA transfer is going to pick you from your hotel in Ushuaia to take you to the place where the horseback riding is going to start, the Maria Luisa Ranch.\nThis Ranch works mainly in ranching and logging. Along the way, the passengers will witness the most beautiful and amazing scenery, especially when you cross mountain range through Garibaldi Pass, where you could see incredible panoramic views.\nOnce you get to the ranch you are going have a horse assigned, and the staff is going to introduce themselves. The first day is going to be about getting in tune with the nature and getting used with the place.\nYou are going to use a trail that is going to take to the shore of Irigoyen´s River, this is an special place to people who like to do fishing, you can get trout fishes over 10 kilos.\nThe first day we are going to sleep in a tent on La Chaira Station, place where there´s not going to be more people than us, and you are going to have a delicious BBQ.\nDay 2: La Chaira Station // Rio Bueno Station\nAfter enjoying an energetic breakfast, we are going to start our 2 horseback riding day.\nThe objective today is to reach the Rio Bueno Station, place where we are going to sleep.\nAlong the way you can see how the civilization’s track starts disappearing and the wildest side of Tierra del Fuego appears.\nDuring this horseback riding day you are going to visit some shipwrecks like the “Barca” which is been stuck in the beach for many years. Also you may find abandoned stations. The shocking part is going to be how close we are going to be from the wildlife of the place. Between all the species that you will see, you may see foxes, guanacos, condors, marine mammals, beavers and many beautiful birds. The last part of the day we are going to go around “Leticia” River which is going to takes us to our last stop.\nLike the night before, we are going to sleep in tents and we can get relax with the sound of the “Bueno” River.\nDay 3: Rio Bueno Station // Policarpo Ranch\nAfter breakfast, you are going to start the way with the objective to reach Policarpo Ranch which was declared a National Historic Landmark\nThe trail is going to take us along the shore of the “Bueno and Policarpo” Rivers, where you may find aboriginal remains from the native “ Haush” tribe.\nThe conditions on this there are pretty similar to the day before, the difference is going to be in the peatland you are going to find, and you will be able to see the different abilities of the horses, while walking on this floor.\nAlong the way we could see the local wildlife where the wild horses, sea lions and king penguins will surprise us. You may also find different shipwrecks as “Duquesa de Albania”.\nFrom the high valley we could see Falsa Creek which was abandoned in the 60’s. Here is possible to find remains and tools of all kinds.\nWe are going to do our overnight in a tent in “Policarpo” Ranch.\nDay 4: Policarpo Ranch\nOn this day we are going to rest and relax in Policarpo Ranch. If you want to, you could visit the cormorant colony which is located in the marine caves or do a trekking in the Bilbao Hill, place where you could see incredible panoramic views.\nDay 5: Policarpo Ranch // Rio Bueno Station\nOn this day, we are going to start our return trip to Rio Bueno Station. In some parts you are going to use different trails.\nDay 6: Rio Bueno Station // La Chaira Station\nIn your return trip to La Chaira Station, you are going to use different trails, compared with the ones we used on our first way.\nOn La Chaira Station, we are going to enjoy a delicious BBQ.\nDay 7: La Chaira Station // Maria Luisa Ranch // Ushuaia\nWe are going to come back from La Chaira Station to Maria Luisa Ranch, where we are going to go up the cars which are going to take us to Ushuaia. Here is where our services finish.\nTimes riding and distances\nYou will ride for 6 hours each day, doing stops and breaks. The distance each day is doing to be 30 kilometers approx.\nLevel of difficulty\nThis is a medium difficulty since is necessary to know about horseback riding and you need to have a good health condition. You will ride through different lands, but most of all through beaches and peatlands where because of the conditions of the land it could be necessary to dismount. Also you are going to go through leafy forest and some steep cliffs.\nIt´s important to know that the schedule for the places where to sleep and the durations of the days are going to depend on the weather conditions and the tide, since during the excursion your are going to go along 5 different and important rivers.\nWe are going to be riding in places completely isolated and lonely, away from civilization and sanitation, that’s why the staff is going to carry a satellite phone for emergencies. Also the guides on charge are SAN-WFR (Wilderness First Responder) Certified, given by the Argentine School of Lifesaving and First Aid. Each guide is going to carry with a First Aid kit and also they are going to know the whole technical part. All the water is potable during the trip.\nHorses and Mounts\nWe are going to use Native Argentine horses, of 1.55 meters on average, a really known race all over the world because of their nobility and strength, they are ideal for this kind of excursions. The same ones have been raised in Tierra del Fuego, reason why they are familiarized and comfortable riding in the different kind of lands.\nTalking about the mounts we are going to be using a combination between the Chilean and Argentinean ones. The horses don´t need spurs.\nThe weather is going to be very variable. During summertime the days are incredibly long with a length of 14 hours, where we can experiment different weather conditions.\nPeople said that you can have all four seasons in just a few minutes in Tierra del Fuego, although the extreme conditions are rare. In general the weather is cold and windy and the temperature goes from 2 to 12ºC, although the wind and the regular drizzle can make it colder.\nEither ways the weather could be nice with cold nights even though we are close to Antarctica.\nClothing and other items required\nBecause of the weather, the clothes need to be warm and waterproof as an esential ítem for the a comfortable trip.\nThe best system you can use to dress is the layers system, to adapt to the changing weather conditions.\nWe recommend this equipment\n1 -Shoes: 2 pairs. We highly recommend waterproof leather boots, which are really good for rain or cold weather. We really another pair of a comfortable and warm shoes for the relax moments. If you want you, you can take leggings which are really good to avoid friction.\n2- Socks. 5 pairs. The best option is to take some cotton ones and some wool ones.\n3 –Interiors. 2. One for the chest and the one that is being worn. Take a look on the Power Dry or similar options for material. If you suffer the cold weather, to take pair of pants of the same material could be a good option. The cotton clothing is not a good option because they absorb the humidity and take a long time to dry.\n4 –Pants. We highly recommend taking lightweight trousers and a pair of pant covers of any waterproof material.\n5 – Jacket. Take a waterproof material one as a Gore-tex material with an adjustable hood.\n6 – Gloves (2 pairs and posibly waterproof), hat for the sun and a warm hat, sunglasses and a scarf. It’s pretty useful to take leather glove’s covers.\n7 – Overcoat. Polar fleece’s vest and a feather’s jacket.\n8 – Backpack. Is important to take a backpack with you (35 to 40 liters) where to put the thing we are going to need close to us during the riding and during the trekking. Is a good idea to take a waterproof backpack cover.\nThis is the equipment recommended by the guides, this doesn’t mean if you don’t have something of these things, you can’t do the excursion. The most important thing is to have waterproof clothes, so we can keep our body temperature.\nFor those who don’t want to spend so much money, an option is to buy those yellow robes that are one hundred percent waterproof. The cons with this robes is that you can get really hot when the sun is shining. We don't recommend using poncho, since they scare the horses when they get shaken by the wind and don’t give the necessary isolation.\nRemember to bring your sleeping bag which needs to have the comfortable temperature under -10Cº. Renting these sleeping bags is possible in Ushuaia, they been tested and approved.\n• Photo camera / film camera with batteries.\n• Personal medicine,\n• Travelogue, maps, etc..\n• Some Cash\n• Patient card, which will be given to guide\n• Passport. It is mandatory to have it circular route. Passengers have the option to leave it at Maria Luisa Ranch to avoid losing it.\n• Trash bags resistant material to protect all these personal effects\nThe backpacks which are going to be given to you has the necessary space to save all these things. It’s not necessary or recommended to bring a lot of clothes, since is not possible to carry more things than the backpack capacity.\nThe excursion includes\n- The horse and all the mount equipment.\n- Backpack with waterproof bags where to save all the personal items and the sleeping bag.\n- Extra horses that will carry all the group’s stuff.\n- Bilingual guides and helpers.\n- All the meals and beverages (breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner)\n- Satellite phone for emergencies.\n- Security kit and radio.\n- Insurance for personal accidents until certain amount.\n- Transfer service from and to Ushuaia\n- Tents for 2 people and insulating for the sleeping bag.\n- Crockery, cutlery, cooking elements, etc..\nAmount of passengers: 4 minimum 12 maximum.\nYou have the option to return to Ushuaia by helicopter. Ask for prices and availability"", 'Pre-trip Planning Acquire trail map(s), and talk to other riders that know the area Select trail appropriate for the expectations of your group Select trail difficulty and length that is safest for the least experienced horse and rider Select trails that avoid high mountain areas during afternoon lightning storm seasons Contact trail owner or manager for current trail conditions and any restrictions If you are hiring/leasing horses or guides, check references and reputations Precondition both yourself and your stock for the challenges of the trip For SAFETY SAKE, check condition of your vehicle, hitch, lights, brakes and trailer Let a responsible person know your trip plans, i.e. places and dates\nPreparing Stock Select an animal that has good withers, legs, feet and attitude for the trail environment Schedule instruction from an experienced trail-riding instructor, if necessary Condition your stock for water crossings, trail hazards, trip length and altitude Be able to catch your horse quickly or have it corralled the night before your trip Practice trailer loading and unloading before the trip to the trailhead Check with your veterinarian and ferrier for animal health and shoeing needs Make sure you carry all certificates of heath, Coggins testing and brand inspections Identify stock pecking orders and personality traits that others should know about Precondition stock to ropes, dogs, llamas, mountain bikes, motors, wildlife and etc. Train stock (and yourself) to mount from either side when in steep country Train stock to handle fly wipes and spray bottles Train stock to eat from a nosebag\nSaddles and Tack Use a saddle that fits both you and the horse.

12	bell shaped pit nahal pattish vs bet nehemya size	The bell-shaped pit at Nahal Pattish had a diameter of 2 meters and depth of 1.5 meters, while the bell-shaped cistern at Bet Nehemya was larger with a maximum diameter of 4.7 meters and depth of 4.8 meters.	['Nahal Pattish (Nos. 7–10, 14, 15)\nThis is a Chalcolothic site that sprawls over the northern bank of Nahal Pattish and an alluvial plain to its south. Excavations at the site unearthed the remains of habitation levels and underground complexes (HA-ESI 122). Ash layers and walls that probably belong to the site (Nos. 7–10) were found in the natural sections of the riverbank. The area surrounding the site was surveyed, where numerous pottery sherds and lithics (Nos. 14, 15) were found.\n7 (Map ref. 174148/579765). A scatter of sherds from the Chalcolithic period and an ash layer mixed with sherds.\n8 (Map ref. 174135/579764). A wall built of large fieldstones (length 0.4–0.5 m).\n9 (Map ref. 174116/579758). Two fieldstone-built walls (Fig. 2).\n10 (Map ref. 174097/579746). A bell-shaped pit filled with ash (diameter 2 m, depth 1.5 m).\n14 (Map ref. 174018/579586). A scatter of sherds from the Chalcolithic period.\n15 (Map ref. 174063/579456). An ash layer mixed with sherds and stone tools from the Chalcolithic period.\nHorbat Karkor (Nos. 44–48)\nThe site, located south of Nahal Karkor, dates from the Byzantine period. Excavations at the site unearthed a church (Figueras 2004). The survey area included only a small section of the site – its northern margins on the bank of the stream. It comprises remains of several buildings surrounded by a wall (a fortress?).\n44 (Map ref. 176858/581588). Remains of a square building (4×4 m).\n45 (Map ref. 176831/581565). Remains of a square building (3×3 m).\n46 (Map ref. 176816/581552). A rectangular building (4×8 m).\n47 (Map ref. 176838/581546). A rectangular building (6×9 m).\n48 (Map ref. 176686/581491). Several structures built of korkar stones and surrounded by a wall.\nAn Encampment Sites (Nos. 24–26, 27)\nPoorly preserved encampment sites were identified on a hill north of Nahal Karkor.

The excavation, undertaken on behalf of the Department of Archaeology at Ben Gurion University of the Negev, and financed by the Cross-Israel Highway Company, Ltd., was directed by Y. Yekutieli and Y. Ben-Yishai, with the assistance of T. Harpak and O. Gat (area supervision), D. Bachar and P. Kaminski (surveying), S. Talis (ceramics), I. Gutman (pottery restoration), P. Kaminski and H. Sokolovsky (drawing of finds) and A. Fogel (studio photography).\nBell-shaped cistern (map ref. 196514/654054; L10; max. diam. 4.7 m, depth 4.8 m). The cistern was discovered c. 50 m north of the stream, and c. 3 m above the level of the streambed. It has a round opening (diam. 1 m), its upper part was hewn in the hard nari rock, and its lower part is in the soft limestone. About two-thirds of the cistern’s volume was filled with alluvium devoid of finds. Jar fragments with a variety of rims, which were commonly used in the southern Judean Shefela in the Mamluk and Ottoman periods, were collected on the surface (within a 3 m radius of the cistern). These included a jar with an everted and elongated triangular rim (Fig. 3:1), a jar with a rim thickened on the outside (Fig. 3:2), a jar with a straight, thickened rim with a prominent ridge at its base (Fig 3:3), and a jar with a broad neck and thin, everted rim thickened on the inside (Fig. 3:4). A modern Gaza jar (Fig. 3:5) was also discovered. About half a meter northeast of the cistern was a circular rock-cutting (L11; diam. 0.9 m, depth 0.4 m), probably a settling pit that was hewn next to the intake opening of the cistern. Only its northern part was preserved.\nCupmarks. At the top of a spur north of the stream, c. 200 m north of the cistern, were two groups of cupmarks, c. 10 m apart—one on its eastern side, the other on the western side. The eastern group consisted of four cupmarks hewn in a rock outcrop (L12–L15; diam. 0.22–0.30 m, depth 0.25–0.36 m), at a distance of c. 3 m from each other. The western group comprised two clusters of three cupmarks each, 1 m apart. The cupmarks were elliptical, and 0.1–0.2 m apart (L16–L21; length 0.35–0.44 m, width 0.27–0.35 m, average depth 0.15 m). The shape of the cupmarks indicates that they may have been used for pounding and grinding, and the fact that they were clustered points to a possible group activity. A group of cupmarks that was dated to the Chalcolithic period was previously discovered several dozen meters west of these two clusters. At the time the excavators suggested that they were associated with group activity related to food processing (van den Brink et al. 2001).\nQuarry. A quarry for building stones (map ref. 196482/654270; L22; 30 × 35 m, max. depth 2.5 m) was discovered in the middle of a rock surface west of the cupmarks. Quarrying marks were visible on the sides and at the bottom of the quarry.\nTomb. A deep rectangular rock-cutting (L24; 1.2 × 3.0 m, depth 2 m), which contained a limestone sarcophagus (0.8 × 2.3 m, height 1.2 m, wall thickness 0.1 m; Fig. 4) was exposed in the southern part of the site, near the top of a spur south of the stream. The sarcophagus was entirely concealed beneath the surface. A shallow stone pillow was sculpted at on end of the sarcophagus, to support the head of the deceased. The sarcophagus was sealed with a lid (0.90 × 2.25 m; Fig. 5) adorned with rounded acroteria on its four corners. The surface of the sarcophagus was not decorated. Similar stone sarcophagi first appeared in Israel during the reign of King Herod. In the second and third centuries CE they were fairly common in central and northern Israel and beyond it—throughout the Mediterranean countries. In the large necropolis at Bet She‘arim for example, 125 stone sarcophagi dating to the second and third centuries CE were found. Ninety of them, like the one discovered in the current excavation, were not decorated (Avigad 1971). Inside the sarcophagus were the remains of two individuals in supine position, with their heads on either end of the sarcophagus, facing the wall. Near the head of one were five candlestick-type glass bottles (Fig. 6:1–5) of a type common throughout Israel in the second and third centuries CE (Greenhut and Solimany 1995; Nudel 1999). A gold earring (Fig. 7:1) and a bronze bracelet in the shape of a cobra’s head (Fig. 7:2) were found on one of the deceased. Next to the same individual was a bone kohl-stick, of a type which was very common in the Roman period (Fig. 8).\nSite 77 (North) was an open area between settlements, and was used for agricultural activities, quarrying and burial. The dating of the finds shows continuous activity from the second century CE to the present. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that a variety of activities took place at the site much earlier, because it is only a few hundred meters from Tel Dalit, which was inhabited in the Early Bronze Age II (Gophna 1996\n), and from Site 77 (Area N), which dates to the Early Bronze Age IV (Yekutieli, Paran and Ben-Yishai 2015\nAvigad N. 1971, Bet She‘arim III.

13	I accidentally locked my keys in my car at work today and had to call for help. What's the difference between a lockout service and a locksmith service?	When a driver fails to gain entry to his own vehicle, both lockout service and locksmith service are required. Any time a roadside service professional helps a driver open his vehicle, it falls under lockout service. They usually can use various tools to unlock a door. If the roadside service professional fails to get entry to the vehicle, a locksmith service will be called.	['Car breakdown services are categorised as roadside assistance which helps drivers when their vehicles get inoperative. Almost every auto has an insurance policy. Every insurance company is liable to compensate their client as early as possible. Car insurance can save you from all the hassle an accident can cause.\nMost of the new technologies and cool car gadgets are introduced only in the newest models and very few are found in the oldest cars.\nGenerally, roadside assistance service includes: towing, battery service, flat tire service, fuel delivery, lockout service, and extrication. Here is a brief description of what each service includes and a situation that would call for it.\nRoadside Assistance When Your Car Breaks Down\nBe sensible and don’t just jump in your car and drive off. Get into the habit of making sure everything is in apple pie order. Every time we get into a vehicle, we automatically can make quite a few safety checks, probably without even realising it. For example, we check the mirrors are aligned, we have fuel and our seatbelt is fastened.\nWhen your car breaks down, you badly need protection in the form of roadside assistance. Simply, it means to get professional assistance through a phone call when you have problems with your car.\nA breakdown service is actually the attempt by a service professional to make minor mechanical repairs and adjustments to make your car drivable again. Your car can face many mechanical issues during traveling on the road, so it needs to be insured in order to get roadside assistance. The following mechanical car breakdown services can be provided when your car breaks down on the way.\n1. Towing service is urgent when repairing fails\nYou can be provided with one of the handy breakdown services when your car needs to be towed.\nTowing service is actually made when the roadside assistance fails to repair your vehicle and makes it drivable again safely. They have to tow your vehicle to a mechanic up to a limited number of miles. In this scenario, you want your vehicle towed beyond that limit, they won’t leave your vehicle stranded, but they will charge you extra.\n2. Dead battery needs a quick jump\nYour car’s battery can be dead for many reasons: extended lack of use, interior lights left on, or cold weather. When it happens on the road, you are totally helpless. No matter what happens, having a dead car battery can ruin your plans and leave you stranded. Get quick help against a dead car battery from your service provider.\nGenerally, hybrid vehicles use the battery which powers the electric motor to turn over the gasoline engine, making it unlikely they would ever require a jump-start.\n3. Flat tyres mean no air; a puncture means a hole\nA flat tyre happens when the air has gone out of it; a puncture means a hole in the tyre, caused by running over a sharp object. A puncture will cause a flat tyre but flat tyres can have other causes, such as a faulty valve.\nIn this situation you will have to call your roadside service provider, a service professional will report to your location and replace the flat tire with the spare one inside your vehicle. Roadside assistance will not typically compensate a flat tire for a motorcycle or any other two or three-wheeler.\n4. When your car locked inside, locksmith service is urgent\nAt the time of buying a car, you should always go direct to a car locksmith or key cutting station to produce a duplicate of your car key.\nHence, you might have the ability to prevent these situations.\nIt’s very sensible to keep an extra key in your luggage. Or also somewhere in your house or on your desk at work.\nWhen you are in a scenerio like that and need a local locksmith to get you into your car whenever possible, call Locksmith for excellent mobile vehicle locksmith services.\nWhen a driver fails to gain entry to his own vehicle, both lockout service and locksmith service are required. But there is a difference between the two. Any time a roadside service professional helps a driver open his vehicle, it falls under lockout service. They usually can use various tools to unlock a door. If the roadside service professional fails to get entry to the vehicle, a locksmith service will be called.\n5. Emergency fuel delivery\nIt is really a bad situation when your car runs out of fuel.\nIf you fall into this situation, a breakdown service can usually deliver enough to get you to the nearest petrol station.\nFuel delivery service is provided to the drivers who run out of gas while driving. A service assistant will come to your location with enough fuel to get the vehicle to the nearest gas station.\n6. Vehicle on its side: Extrication options\nExtrication is the process of transporting a vehicle if it is constrained or stuck on the road as a result of an accident.\nA vehicle resting on its side following a bump is not an uncommon contingency and roadside breakdown services should be familiar with the options they have with which to extricate the vehicle.\nModern vehicle technology keeps advancing and is always challenging extrication tools and techniques. We always follow the progress of the automotive industry and we can only hope to be prepared by constantly researching and learning.']	['<urn:uuid:1fa485c9-4b92-4cb9-8827-eda918173955>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	28	64	902
14	feeling tired going toilet more often thirsty could these be type 2 diabetes symptoms what else to look for	These symptoms are indeed associated with type 2 diabetes. The main symptoms include going to the toilet more often (especially at night), feeling more tired (because your body can't get enough glucose into your cells for energy), feeling extremely thirsty, losing weight without trying, genital itching or thrush, cuts and wounds taking longer to heal, and blurred vision.	"[""Looking for more information about type 2 diabetes? We’ve got all you need to know.\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\nWe all need insulin to live. It does an essential job. It allows the glucose in our blood to enter our cells and fuel our bodies.\nWhen you have type 2 diabetes, your body still breaks down carbohydrate from your food and drink and turns it into glucose. The pancreas then responds to this by releasing insulin. But because this insulin can’t work properly, your blood sugar levels keep rising. This means more insulin is released.\nFor some people with type 2 diabetes this can eventually tire the pancreas out, meaning their body makes less and less insulin. This can lead to even higher blood sugar levels and mean you are at risk of hyperglycaemia.\nIs type 2 diabetes serious?\nAround 90% of people with diabetes in the UK have type 2. It is serious condition and can be lifelong.\nHaving type 2 diabetes without treatment means that high sugar levels in your blood can seriously damage parts of your body, including your eyes, heart and feet. These are called the complications of diabetes. But with the right treatment and care, you can live well with type 2 diabetes and reduce your risk of developing them.\nLearn more about diabetes complications.\nManaging type 2 diabetes\nLearning how to live with type 2 diabetes can be challenging, but we’ll help you to discover what works for you. Some people can manage it through healthier eating, being more active or losing weight. But eventually most people will need medication to bring their blood sugar down to their target level.\nLearn more about managing your diabetes.\nCan type 2 diabetes be cured?\nThere isn't a permanent cure for type 2 diabetes yet. But strong evidence shows that some people can put their type 2 diabetes into remission by losing weight. Remission in type 2 diabetes means your blood sugar levels are below the diabetes range, and you don't need to take diabetes medication.\nIt can be life-changing, but it's not possible for everyone.\nLearn more about diabetes remission.\nType 2 diabetes treatment\nThe treatments for type 2 diabetes help to manage blood sugar levels and also reduce your risk of diabetes complications.\n- eating healthy food, being as active as you can and keeping to a healthy weight\n- medications such as tablets and injections, that may include insulin\n- weight loss surgery\n- or other ways to put type 2 diabetes into remission. This means that type 2 diabetes goes away for some people, and they don't need to take diabetes medication anymore.\nMany people with type 2 diabetes will need to be on a combination of these treatments. Because everyone's different, it can take time to figure out what works best for you. Your diabetes healthcare team will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.\nLearn more about diabetes treatments.\nType 2 and insulin\nYou may not need to use insulin straight away but many people with type 2 diabetes need to use insulin as treatment at some point. If you need to start insulin treatment, remember that this isn’t your fault.\nSome people have very high blood sugar levels when they are first diagnosed. Insulin can be used as a short-term treatment to help quickly bring down your blood sugar levels.\nSome people may need to take insulin for a particular reason, like during pregnancy, a severe illness, or after surgery. But you may also need to start insulin as a treatment if other medications haven’t helped managed your blood sugar levels or aren’t appropriate for you.\nWhen you start taking insulin, you may notice that you start to put on weight. There are lots of reasons for this, like how much insulin you take, your diet and the type of insulin you’re taking. If you’re worried about putting on weight, or you’d like some help losing weight, then we’re here to help.\nIt’s still important to keep going to your appointments and manage your condition with healthy lifestyle choices. Staying active and eating a healthy diet will reduce the risk of complications from your diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes symptoms\nType 2 diabetes develops more slowly than type 1 diabetes. A lot of people don’t get any symptoms, or don’t notice them. But you may notice:\n- going to the toilet more often, especially at night\n- feeling more tired, because your body can't get enough glucose in to your cells for energy\n- losing weight without trying\n- genital itching or thrush\n- cuts and wounds taking longer to heal\n- blurred vision\n- feeling extremely thirsty.\nLearn more about the symptoms of diabetes.\nRisk factors of type 2 diabetes\nSome things can increase your chance of getting type 2 diabetes. Because the symptoms of type 2 diabetes are not always obvious, it’s really important to be aware of these risk factors. They can include:\n- Age. You’re more at risk if you’re white and over 40, or over 25 if you’re African Caribbean, Black African, or South Asian (Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi).\n- If you are living with obesity or overweight.\n- If your waist size is too large.\n- Ethnicity. You're more at risk if you're of African Caribbean, Black African, or South Asian (Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi) or Chinese descent.\n- Family history. For example, if you have a parent, brother or sister with diabetes.\n- Medical history. For example if you have a history of high blood pressure, heart attack or strokes, gestational diabetes or severe mental illness.\nWe’ve got more information about all of the risk factors, as well as a Know Your Risk tool that can help you discover your risk of type 2 diabetes within minutes.\nLearn more about the risk factors of type 2 diabetes.\nNewly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes\nKnowing where to get started following a type 2 diagnosis can be a challenge. You may feel overwhelmed, but it’s important to know there isn’t a one-size fits all approach to managing the condition.\nAs well as using the information on this page to understand your condition, you can meet other people with type 2 diabetes in our Learning Zone. You’ll hear advice from others in your position, and get practical tools to help you feel more confident managing your condition.\nWant to know more?\nWhether you are newly diagnosed, looking to improve your diabetes management, or in need of information to support others, we are here to help. We’ve got lots more information about:\nPreventing type 2 diabetes\nDid you know that with the right support, up to halve of type 2 diabetes cases can be delayed of prevented? Our information about preventing type 2 will show you some of the steps that can help you can take to reduce your risk of developing the condition.\nChecking your blood sugar levels\nChecking your blood sugar levels is an important part of managing your diabetes, so we’ll take you through how to check them and what your readings mean.\nLiving with type 2 diabetes\nHaving type 2 diabetes can bring up lots of questions about your lifestyle, but we’re here with the answers. From nutritional advice and recipes to help you know what to eat when you have type 2 diabetes, tips about diabetes and alcohol and keeping active and staying fit – we’re here to support you.\nType 2 diabetes is also associated with other health conditions, such as thyroid disease and dental problems. It’s important to be aware of these, so make sure to read our information about diabetes related conditions.\nType 2 diabetes is a complicated condition, and it may seem like there’s a lot of information to take in. If you’re feeling worried or stressed, we’ve got emotional support and advice that you may find helpful.\nFor some people, managing their diabetes with technology can be life-changing. But we also know it can be overwhelming if you’re not sure where to begin. Our information and guidance about diabetes technology will help you understand what the different types of tech do and how to access them, so you can find what works for you.\nResearch into type 2 diabetes\nWe have been funding leading research projects into type 2 diabetes for over 80 years. You can find out more about the impact of this research, and how it has helped to transform the lives of millions living with the condition.""]"	['<urn:uuid:a90f1853-2956-4e9d-a2ff-eca2175ab20c>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	19	58	1422
15	database model prevent data corruption how	A solid data model prevents data corruption by enforcing referential integrity, building in domain constraints, and choosing appropriate keys. This makes the database reject invalid data and prevent incorrect relationships, making it impervious to bugs from the application layer.	['97 things - Database as a Fortress\nThe database is where all of the data, both input by your employees and data collected from your customers, resides. User interfaces, business and application logic, and even employees will come and go, but your data lasts forever. Consequently, enough cannot be said about the importance of building a solid data model from Day One.\nThe exuberance over agile techniques have left many thinking that it‘s fine, or even preferable, to design applications as you go. Gone are the days of writing complex, comprehensive technical designs up front! The new school says deploy early and often. A line of code in production is better than ten in your head. It seems almost too good to be true, and where your data is concerned, it is.\nWhile business rules and user interfaces do evolve rapidly, the structures and relationships within the data you collect often do not. Therefore, it is critical to have your data model defined right from the start, both structurally and analytically. Migrating data from one schema to another in situ is difficult at best, time consuming always, and error prone often. While you can suffer bugs temporarily at the application layer, bugs in the database can be disastrous. Finding and fixing a data layer design problem does not restore your data once it has been corrupted.\nA solid data model is one that guarantees security of today‘s data, but also extensible for tomorrow‘s. Guaranteeing security means being impervious to bugs that will – despite your best efforts – be pervasive in an ever-changing application layer. It means enforcing referential integrity. It means building in domain constraints wherever they are known. It means choosing appropriate keys that help you ensure your data‘s referential integrity and constraint satisfaction. Being extensible for tomorrow means properly normalizing your data so that you can easily add architectural layers upon your data model later. It means not taking shortcuts.\nThe database is the final gatekeeper of your precious data. The application layer which is, by design ephemeral, cannot be its own watchdog. For the database to keep proper guard, the data model must be designed to reject data that does not belong, and to prevent relationships that do not make sense. Keys, foreign key relationships, and domain constraints, when described in a schema, are succinct, easy to understand and verify, and are ultimately self-documenting. Domain rules encoded the data model are also physical and persistent; a change to application logic does not wash them away.\nTo get the most out of a relational database – to make it a true part of the application as opposed to simply a storehouse for application data – you need to have a solid understanding of what you are building from the start. As your product evolves, so too will the data layer, but at each phase of its evolution, it should always maintain its status as Fortress. If you trust it and bestow upon it the heavy responsibility of trapping bugs from other layers of your application, you will never be disappointed.\n(RMH Edited 7/13/2008) By Dan Chak (Edited RMH 5/28/2008)']	['<urn:uuid:6aaaf792-f785-415d-a9d6-c50e425f25ba>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	6	39	522

The GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) measures total precipitation including light rain and snowfall, while the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) provides three-dimensional measurements of precipitation structures inside clouds. Together, they create a database used to combine and compare other satellites' microwave observations to make uniform global precipitation datasets.	"['A Japanese H-2A rocket blasted off and streaked into space Thursday, boosting a sophisticated weather research satellite into orbit, the centerpiece of a $1.2 billion international mission to study global precipitation in an ongoing effort to improve climate models, forecasting and understanding of the water cycle critical to life on Earth.\nEquipped with a pair of state-of-the-art instruments, the Global Precipitation Measurement Core Observatory will provide world-spanning, near real-time measurements and anchor an international fleet of space-based climate research and weather stations, serving as a calibration standard to improve accuracy across the constellation.\n""Rain and snowfall affect our daily lives in many ways,"" said Steven Neeck, NASA\'s deputy associate administrator for Earth science flight programs.

Extreme precipitation events like hurricanes, blizzards, floods, droughts and landslides have significant socio-economic impacts on our society.""\nPrecipitation also plays a significant role connecting the planet\'s water, energy and bio-geochemical cycles.\n""Since rainfall and snowfall vary greatly from place to place, and in space and time, satellites can provide a more uniform set of observations globally compared to ground instruments,"" Neeck said. ""The GPM, through its core observatory and constellation of satellites, will dramatically improve our knowledge of global precipitation and our ability to forecast it and its consequences.\nSaid Ramesh Kakar, GPM program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington: ""The water cycle is central to creating an understanding of weather, climate and water resource management for the society. You\'ve got to measure precipitation if you want to study the water cycle.""\nThe mission got underway at 1:37 p.m. EST (GMT-5; 3:37 a.m. Friday local time) when the 17-story-tall H-2A rocket\'s hydrogen-fueled first-stage engine roared to life, following seconds later by ignition of two solid-fuel strap-on boosters. In an instant, the rocket vaulted away from the picturesque Tanegashima Space Center launch pad on the southern coast of Japan, lighting up the pre-dawn sky with a fiery plume.\nThe climb to space went smoothly, with the solid-fuel strap ons falling away as planned just under two minutes into flight, followed by the spent first stage six minutes and 44 seconds after liftoff. The second stage engine ignited at an altitude of about 148 miles and completed the push to orbit, shutting down about 15 minutes into flight.\nThe 8,500-pound Global Precipitation Measurement Core Observatory satellite, built at NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., was released into a 250-mile-high orbit about one minute later. A few minutes after that, its two solar panels began unfolding as expected.\nIf all goes well, the spacecraft\'s instruments and subsystems will be activated over the next 10 days or so, following by two months of detailed checkout and calibration before the the satellite begins full-time science observations.\n""We really do need to care, because less than 1 percent of all the water on Earth is easily accessible for us to use as fresh water resources,"" she said. ""And water is vital to life on Earth. We need to measure precipitation both frequently and at the local and regional scales so that we can follow fresh water through the water cycle of the Earth.""\nThe GPM Microwave Imager, or GMI, will measure total precipitation, including light rain and snowfall, while the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar, or DPR, will give researchers a three-dimensional look at the structures inside clouds that generate rain and snow.\nNASA spent $933 million building the spacecraft and the microwave imager, provided by Ball Aerospace and Technology Corp., while the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, contributed $226 million for the H-2A rocket, built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and the multi-channel radar, built by NEC Toshiba Space Systems.\nThe GPM core observatory mission builds on the experience gained by NASA and JAXA in the joint Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission program, a satellite launched in 1997 to measure rainfall in tropical latitudes. The new spacecraft will extend those observations to more northern latitudes and add extensive new capabilities.\n""GPM will join a NASA Earth science fleet of 16 missions currently on orbit,"" Neeck said. ""They\'re devoted to studying the Earth as an integrated system in six science focus areas ranging from atmospheric composition to the Earth\'s surface and interior. GPM will support the water and energy cycle, the weather and the climate science focus areas.""\nOther satellites in the constellation are operated by Japan, India, the European Space Agency, the French Space Agency, the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n""The GPM core observatory is a precipitation science observatory ... that is the primary satellite of the constellation,"" Neeck said. "" It will calibrate and unify precipitation data from other constellation satellites every three hours.""\nThe spacecraft\'s instruments ""will allow scientists to see inside clouds,"" he said. ""The GMI will sense the total precipitation within all cloud layers, including for the first time light rain and snowfall. The DPR will make detailed three dimensional measurements of precipitation structures and rates as well as particle drop size.\n""Together, the GMI and the DPR will provide a database that will be used to compare and combine the other constellation satellites microwave observations to make uniform global precipitation datasets.""']"	['<urn:uuid:f2efd039-21fe-41c4-ac17-6a3cd2cb2e31>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	10	47	866
17	Being interested in maritime rescue technology, I'd like to know about the operational heights of WWII submarine observation platforms and how they relate to modern marine safety release depths - what were the typical deployment heights and release depths for each?	The WWII German FA 330 submarine observation autogiro typically operated with 200 to 500 feet of cable, though these maximum heights weren't always reached in testing. In contrast, modern Hammar H20 hydrostatic release units are designed to activate at much lower heights/depths - specifically 1.5-4 meters underwater for the SOLAS-compliant units used with life rafts.	"['Having attended the High Altitude Wind Power symposium at California State University in Chico, I was surprised at the variety of high altitude energy systems proposed by presenters and attendees (www.hawpconference.org). Of the many proposals, however, I was struck by the possibility of using tethered autogiros in high altitude energy generation. Here is a “kite” that can remain stable in almost any wind condition, is completely resistant to gust and shear, and produces great lifting capability in a fairly compact package. But the symposium made me think of a brief report on another autogiro – the “rotary wing kite” used on German submarines in WWII.\nAn easily overlooked item in the Drachen Foundation archive is a copy of the report by the Combined Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee, written by Bartram Kelly and Hugh J. Mulvey, on behalf of the US Technical Industrial Intelligence Committee. It is a short summary of the information known about the German rotary wing kite used by submarine forces as an early warning system. Here was a system that could be deployed quickly and easily, was very difficult to “see”, and could be recovered to a submarine ready to submerge. The 25 page intelligence report describes the kite:\nThe FA 330 kite consists of pilot seat, pylon, conventional autogiro head rotor, tube extending aft supporting horizontal surface, and rudder operated by pilot’s feet. Great ingenuity in detail design is evident and the whole kite could be dismantled and stowed in a compartment on the submarine….\nThe English performed flight tests with a captured autogiro and reported the following flight performance:\nThe machine is launched with a slight backward tilt. Starting rope not always necessary. Typical airspeed is 25 mph. Minimum airspeed to maintain in flight is about 17 mph. Typical rpm is 205. Helicopter pilots find it easy to fly, and it is believed that several seamen learned to fly it on each submarine. The machine inspected has a bullet hole through the pylon. Hands off the stick for 5 to 10 seconds possible. In operation, from 200 to 500 feet of cable were used, although these heights have not yet been reached in tests….\nThe quick recovery of the kite was also discussed, as this was critical for the safety of the sub:\nThe pilot can telephone to the deck of the submarine. He can also operate a quick release which disconnects the cable at the kite. To overcome the difficulty of landing in water under a rotor, there is another emergency control lever over the pilot’s head. When he pulls it, the rotor flies away upwards and the parachute (stored immediately behind the pylon) is pulled up by the departing rotor and opens. The cable is automatically released, and the pilot, still strapped to the seat, is also directly connected to the open parachute. At this point he unfastens the safety belt and the entire fuselage structure falls down into the sea, leaving him descending alone by parachute.\nWhat a horrible situation!\nThe report contains both diagrams and photographs of the autogiro and in them you can clearly see how compact and fragile this aircraft was. Maybe the best photos show a British airman flying the kite from the back of a flat-bed truck. Exciting indeed! German source documents have far more detail included, but It’s interesting to read this report, as it’s evident that the Allies had a great deal of respect for the ingenuity and cleverness shown in this simple system. They say, “Conventional autogiro practice was followed, the blades were exceptionally well made and great ingenuity in detail was shown, especially in regard to quick disassembly for storage, ease of blade pitch and damper adjustments, etc.”', 'SAVING LIVES AT SEA FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS\nThe Hammar H20 is the best-selling HRU in the world, and it has been saving lives on the oceans for more than 30 years. Its safe, reliable, and simple design has earned more worldwide approval than any other unit.\nThe H20 needs no annual service, maintenance, or spare parts. You simply install a new unit and dispose of the old once it has reached the end of service life.\nWHAT DOES AN HRU DO?\nIf the vessel sinks, the increasing water pressure activates the Hammar H20. It automatically releases the liferafts, EPIRBs (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons), or other life-saving appliances it is connected to.\nThe Hammar H20 is designed to be safe and reliable in all extreme conditions that you and your ship might meet on the oceans. The Manual Release Units (MRU) and Electronic Release Units (ERU) allow for a smooth, controlled release in an early stage of abandoning the ship without compromising the hydrostatic function.\nTHE HAMMAR H20 - HOW IT WORKS\nInside the Hammar H20, a pin under tension sits in a notch of a spring-loaded knife. The pin is attached to the center of a flexible membrane. At the intended depth, water acts on the membrane pushing it inwards and out of the notch. When the pin is fully out of the notch, the blade can instantly spring forward, cutting through the strong rope and releasing the lashing.\nThe Weak Link™ holds the painter line assuring the necessary pull to inflate the raft as the buoyancy of the liferaft container floats towards the surface. The increased buoyancy of the inflated liferaft will cause the Weak Link™ to break, and the raft can surface.\nThe Hammar H20 is designed to cut through the White Strong Rope but may, in some applications, also cut the unshielded electrical cable.\nTHREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF RELEASE UNITS\nHYDROSTATIC RELEASE UNIT\nThe Hammar H20 is the simplest way to gain free float capability on your life-saving appliances.\nMANUAL RELEASE UNIT\nThe Hammar H20 is a key component in Manual Remote Release Systems (MRRS). These systems are durable for the controlled release of life-saving appliances such as liferafts or Marine Evacuation Systems (MES).\nELECTRONIC RELEASE UNIT\nThe ERU allows for complex installations involving several release units in an Electronic Remote Release System (ERRS). One system makes it possible to release a vessel\'s life-saving appliances all at once, user-selected or in a predetermined order.\nH20 DUAL ASSEMBLY\nThe H20 Dual Assembly is a combination of release units that includes two or more H20 units and/or has two connection points to the deck. The H20 Dual Assembly is used in raft arrangements and RRS when more than one release criteria are fulfilled.\nMARCODE - VALIDATING SAFETY AT SEA\nBe assured of the crew and passengers\' safety with MarCode validation equipment. Hammar is always striving to bring you better solutions for safety at sea. This MarCode gives you a tool to check the validity and authenticity of all your Hammar H20 products, even at sea. Scanning and registering your MarCode tag will create a digital link between your H20 unit and the ship it has been installed on. The MarCode app will also give you relevant certificates, such as the Declaration of Conformity (DoC) and Certificate of Conformity.\n(CoC) for your H20. It is quick and easy to scan and check the MarCode – validating safety at sea.\nDownload the Hammar MarCode app from:\nH20 R FOR RAFTS\nThe H20 for Rafts combines a Release Unit, Strong Rope and a Weak Link. The Yellow top label indicates a release depth of 1.5-4 m as defined by SOLAS. The Hammar H20 SOLAS model is designed for liferafts from 6 up to 150 persons\nH20 FOR EPIRBS\nIn an emergency, the automatic release of the EPIRB will dramatically facilitate the rescue operation and the possibility to save lives. The Hammar H20 E is the most reliable hydrostatic release unit on the market and is used by leading EPIRB manufacturers\nH20 FOR MES\nIn Marine Evacuation Systems, the Hammar H20 is, in many cases, a core component for the activation of the system. Hammar H20s are availible various combinations in terms of activation depth, rope length, and release options. H20s without a Weak Link are defined as ""for MES""\nH20 FOR SMALL RAFTS\nThe SOLAS regulation is viable for vessels over 500 gross tons, affecting the size of liferafts used and criteria set up for the HRU. The H20 for small rafts is designed to fit smaller liferafts, not exerting the same pull from buoyancy when released. The Weak Link™ on an H20 for small rafts is optimized for smaller rafts with a lower force needed to release the raft after activation.\nThe Hammar H20 for Small Rafts (HR-0200) is designed for USCG (United States Coast Guard) approved liferafts less than six persons and all recreational rafts up to 12 persons (outside SOLAS regulation).\nHOW TO READ INFORMATION ON A H20\nTHE DATE LABEL\nThe date label should be marked with an expiry date (month/year) on an installed unit. The expiry date is two years or otherwise stated on the product from the month of installation onboard.\nTHE TOP LABELS\nThe top label of an H20 comes in many colors and contains the information you need to be aware of.\nEASY RELEASE SLIP HOOK FOR H20 R\nIn the emergency of abandoning the ship, an early and controlled release of liferafts can save lives at sea. Manual release and launch of a liferaft is the way to evacuate in a controlled manner before the vessel is going down.\nThe Hammar Easy Release for H20 R can easily be operated using just one hand, even under its maximum lashing load. The Easy Release can be installed with a Hammar H20 or a manual release-only configuration. The design makes it possible to retrofit into an existing installation.\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nCANT FIND YOUR ANSWER?']"	['<urn:uuid:198278ec-7089-4900-920b-d9e9a4469cf6>', '<urn:uuid:9805342f-6cf5-4edf-bea8-d03340969418>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	41	55	1607
18	french champagne bottles recovered underwater story baltic sea	In 1916, a Swedish schooner named Jönköping, carrying French champagne destined for the Russian Tsar, was sunk by a German submarine. The champagne bottles were discovered and salvaged near Finland in 1998. Remarkably, the champagne had been perfectly preserved at a constant temperature of 4°C and was still suitable for drinking. The bottles were later auctioned by Christie's in London.	"[""From a marine archeology and scientific standpoint, the Baltic Sea is a paradise. There could be as many as 100,000 shipwrecks dating back centuries in this dark and mysterious sea—Viking ships, trading ships and warships to name a few. No other place in the world is comparable to the Baltic Sea.\nThe wrecks, and structures found in the sea are veritable time capsules lying in wait for us to explore and expand our understanding of the past. It is also a comparatively quite shallow sea. The average depth is only 55 meters deep, so with modern technology, it is not too complicated to find many of our lost histories. These histories belong to the countries surrounding the Baltic Sea.\nGranted, diving in the far North is not for the weak-minded, nor for the inexperienced, but it’s not as bad as it sounds. Scandinavian divers are known around the world for being able to cope with rather tough diving conditions because this is where we grew up and learned to dive.\nAnyone who goes through entry level training in murky waters with a visibility of 2-4 m (6-12 ft) at best, a water temperature averaging 8°C to 2°C in the winter to 20°C in the summer, and comes out with a smile, will be ready to face anything else. And yes, we do also dive during the fall and winter months, too, with great pleasure.\nSweden has to highest proportion of divers per capita in the world. We are spoilt for choice. Following are descriptions of just a few of the jewels.\nOne of, if not the most, popular attractions in Sweden is the Vasa ship. Vasa was a Swedish warship that sank during her maiden voyage in 1628. All but forgotten for 300 years, she was salvaged practically intact on 24 April 1961, restored and turned into a museum. Once you enter the museum, you will stay for hours—it is that good. www.vasamuseet.se\nThe Champagne Wreck\nOne of my favorites is the Swedish schooner Jönköping, which was sunk by a German submarine in 1916. She carried an order of French Champagne for the Russian Tsar. The bottles were salvaged near Finland in 1998, and they found that the French champagne had been perfectly preserved at a constant 4°C and was ready to drink. Many of the champagne bottles were auctioned off by Christie’s in London.\nThe Mystery Ship\nA wooden ship found by the Swedish Navy that, despite a very unusual figure head of a horse, has never been identified or salvaged.\nA lost plane presumed to spy on Russia and therefore was presumed to be shot down by the same. The discovery of the plane gave answers to a number of questions and peace of mind to surviving family members.\nMy most intense diving experience was a 500-year-old wreck in the Baltic in 1992. She was standing upright, mast still there, but the oak planks were as thin as could be, which left her fragile and exposed to careless diving and rough weather. What really got me though, was that she went down in 1492. The visibility was incredible, I saw the entire wreck, and as I swam over the deck, it hit me. When she went down, Columbus discovered America. Columbus discovered America! That was heavy, and even though the ship itself was a simple, small merchant ship, stripped by years of exposure, she was also a monument for the men and woman that explored the world.\n— Millis Keegan\nDownload the full article ⬇︎\nDive into Sweden: rugged coasts, drop-off's, clear lakes and centuries old wrecks\n| Wetsuits anno 2010 - all you need to know | Find out why off-shore wind turbines are also good for marine life; Marine scientists have discovered ocean “superhighway” for tiny life forms; A massive Southern Ocean current has been discovered; NOAA responds to Gulf oil spill; Chemicals from seaweeds damage corals on contact; Learn about Eukaryotic phytoplankton; Ocean bacteria can harvest sun energy; Get the Annapolis update; Rob Rondeau's marine archeology 101; Carol Tedesco's 17th century shipwreck treasures of green stone; Underwater cinematographer Mike Valentine; Spiny Dogfish as per A""]"	['<urn:uuid:a91d3acf-a7ba-4626-b964-7a3a54f4f58d>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	8	60	690
19	how long chinese people use shiitake mushrooms	The Chinese people have been using shiitake mushrooms as a nutritional and medicinal food for over 6,000 years.	['The Chinese people have been using shiitake mushrooms as a nutritional and medicinal food for over 6,000 years. One of the most well-known of the edible mushroom, shiitakes, have recently been discovered by the health food movement around the world and are considered to be one of the top superfoods most widely available. Instead of paying a premium price for shiitakes at your local health food store, however, shiitakes are relatively easy to grow and one of the easiest ways to get the nutritional and medicinal benefits your body needs.\nWhat are Shiitake Mushrooms?\nHippocrates was a Greek philosopher and writer most famous for advising humanity to “let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food”. Whereas our western society has separated food from medicine, the ancient Greeks, and several other cultures around the world, understood that the wide variety of foods available to us around the world could indeed provide all the needed nutrition and medicinal needs for our human bodies.\nShiitake mushrooms are native to East Asia and grow on the decaying wood of many types of deciduous trees. Like other mushrooms, the shiitake serves a unique purpose in forest ecosystems by helping to break down the lignin found in the wood of trees. Whereas other soil organisms can effectively break down leaves and other organic matter, it is the mushrooms that get the decomposition process started on fallen trees and limbs through breaking down the lignin so that the nutrients can be accessed by other soil organisms.\nIf it weren’t for the work of mushrooms in the forest, fallen trees and limbs would simply sit on the forest floor and not decompose into the rich humus that characterizes the forest soil. Fungi, then, are a fundamentally essential element to the overall health of a number of important ecosystems around the world.\nShiitake mushrooms are unique in that, apart from serving as an essential part of ecosystems, they also offer fantastic nutritional benefits to us humans. Shiitakes can be eaten fresh or dried and are one of the main ingredients in different Asian dishes such as miso soup.\nShiitake mushrooms were reportedly first cultivated in the 13th century during the Song Dynasty of China. As their popularity has grown, however, shiitake spores are widely available in most parts of the world and can be grown almost anywhere that an abundance of deciduous wood is available and where there are humid conditions.\nHow do Mushrooms Grow?\nMushrooms aren’t actually plants, but rather exist in their own kingdom. Many researchers believe that mushrooms are actually more closely related to animals than plants due to their innate behaviors.\nMushrooms, like the shiitake, grow extremely large network of a root-like system underneath the soil. These thin filaments are called hyphae and are the main mode of vegetative growth of mushrooms. The mushrooms that appear above ground are actually the “fruits” of the mushroom that only appear once the mushroom has grown enough hyphae underground.\nIf you have ever picked up a handful of rich humus from the forest floor, chances are that you have seen a number of white, stringy threads or fibers. These are the hyphae that colonize the forest floor and, as we mentioned above, are a fundamental part of the soil ecosystem.\nThe mushroom heads or fruits that appear above ground release spores that act like seeds. Once the mushroom head matures, it releases millions of microscopic spores into the environment where more hyphae are eventually born. Mushroom enthusiasts often make beautifully artistic mushroom spore prints through collecting mushrooms before they release their spores and collecting the spore drop on a piece of paper.\nDifferent Ways to Inoculate Logs\nWhile you can try and grow your own shiitake mushrooms from spores that you collect from other shiitakes that are growing, it is far easier to simply purchase shiitake spores through commercially available shiitake spawn.\nMushroom spawn is simply any substance that has been inoculated with a certain type of mushroom mycelium. If the spores are the seeds of a mushroom, spawn resembles the small starter plants that you purchase from the hardware store to get your garden going. By purchasing shiitake spawn from a reputable mushroom grower, you will make sure that when you inoculate your logs where your mushrooms will grow, you will only have one type of mushroom seed.\nThere are a number of companies that specialize in growing their own shiitake spawn, and the most commonly available type of spawn is dowel spawn. Dowels are simply small pieces of wood, usually cylindrical in shape that come completely inoculated with shiitake mycelium. They should resemble a piece of food that has been left in the corner of your refrigerator for several weeks and has been taken over by mold.\nTo “plant” your mushrooms, you simply need to get the spawn into a hardwood deciduous log. The wood in your log is the growing medium for your shiitakes. The mycelium in the spawn will slowly begin to colonize the rest of the log and begin the slow process of breaking down the lignin.\nOnce the mycelium has grown and when the log is sufficiently colonized, you should start to see your first “flush” of edible mushroom fruits. As long as you keep your colonized logs protected from the sun and sufficiently humid, shiitakes can produce yields of mushrooms for several years. If you live in a dry area or experience extended droughts, you may need to wet your logs with a hose once a day to keep the mycelium active. Mushrooms like humid conditions, and if your logs begin to dry out, the mycelium can die before producing mushrooms.\nTo get the dowel spawn (seed) into the logs (growing medium), the easiest and most efficient technique is simply to drill several holes evenly spaced around your log (the thicker the better). Drill the holes about the same diameter as the dowel spawn that you have.\nNext, stick the dowel spawn into the holes so that they fit tightly. If you need to lightly hammer the dowels to get them to fit snugly, you can do so with care. To avoid colonization of other mushroom spawn floating around in the air, it is best to seal the holes where you inserted your mushroom spawn with the wax of a simple melted candle.\nPlace your logs in a shady, humid area. If you have several logs, you can stack them in a crisscrossed manner so as to allow air flow. Keep your logs humid, but not dripping wet and after 6-9 months you should see your logs come alive with delicious, nutritious, and medicinal shiitake mushrooms.\nHealth Benefits of Shiitake Mushrooms\nShiitake mushrooms have been shown to contain all eight essential amino acids that are bodies need. Additionally, shiitakes come with certain chemical compounds that can help your body fight off oxidative damage. They are also one of the most concentrated sources of the numerous B vitamins that our bodies need.\nShiitake mushrooms also help to regulate your cholesterol and fight off aging due to their strong anti-oxidant properties. For vegetarians and vegans, shiitakes also constitute a great source of non-meat based protein.\nBenefits of Mushrooms to the Local Environment\nWe have already mentioned that mushrooms of any type are an essential element to any healthy soil. By cultivating your own mushrooms in inoculated logs, you are helping to propagate needed mushroom mycelium in your surrounding soil.\nFurthermore, once your shiitakes have finished flushing, or producing edible mushrooms, you will be left with a number of logs that are completely filled with health mycelium. These “spent” logs can be added to the compost pile or placed directly around fruit trees. Since fruit trees prefer a fungal dominated soil, the mycelium in your mushroom logs will reach into the soil and add health and vibrancy to the soil around your fruit trees. If you are lucky, you might even find a few extra shiitake mushrooms popping up underneath your orchard.\nAnother idea for your spent mushroom logs is to use them as borders for raised garden beds. The mycelium in these logs will add to the fertility of the soil in your garden bed and could help to increase the yields of whatever you are growing.\nShiitake Mushrooms as an Easy, Healthy and Ecologically Sustainable Crop\nChinese cultures have long understood that growing your own mushrooms is an easy way to get the nutrition you need. The ecological benefits of growing your own mushrooms can also help to boost the fertility and overall soil health of your site. With so many different suppliers of quality shiitake mushroom spawn, one fallen tree can give you more than enough logs to enjoy a delicacy for years on end.']	['<urn:uuid:d29ea5e7-bd35-4295-a18d-733accffce20>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	7	18	1456
20	What role do entrepreneurs play and how do companies control them?	Entrepreneurs are the critical long-term stakeholders in developing local economies, requiring a 15-20 year view for success, especially in emerging markets where they build both solutions and infrastructure. However, when partnering with large companies, entrepreneurs often face strict control mechanisms - companies typically reserve key control rights through detailed alliance contracts that can be hundreds of pages long, spelling out contingencies and strategic direction. These controls are particularly stringent when there's greater uncertainty about the technology being developed.	['Startup Communities and the Bottom-Up Approach to Prosperity\nThe insights shared during a recent webinar organized by the Legatum Center for Development and Entrepreneurship at MIT made for a refreshing hour and a half of intellectually stimulating and inspiring discussion. The session featured Brad Feld, author of The Startup Community Way and Managing Director of Foundry Group, Professor Fiona Murray, Faculty Director of the Legatum Center and Associate Dean for Innovation & Inclusion, and Christopher Schroeder, Co-Founder, Next Billion and author of Startup Rising. The conversation was facilitated by Dina Sherif, Executive Director of the Legatum Center, who engaged the panel to explore how startup communities are foundational building blocks for innovation ecosystems and for economic prosperity. Below are four key insights I gained from listening in and should be considered when thinking about startup communities in emerging markets.\nView the full webinar here.\nRecognize Entrepreneurs as the Long-Term Stakeholder\n“Large companies run on [an] annual rhythm, universities run on [an] annual rhythm… government run on [a] 2-4 year cycle.. [with] startup communities.. you have to have [a] 20 year view.” That governments are not the long term stakeholders in developing a local economy, as most narrative coming out of them would emphasize, seems counterintuitive.\nHowever, the quote by Brad Feld resonated with my personal experience as a person who spent the last eight years working on entrepreneurship ecosystem building and economic empowerment in Yemen. I observed infrastructure and projects disappearing juxtaposed against the relentless efforts of a community of entrepreneurs who just won’t stop trying. Entrepreneurial success takes a long time, 15-20 years as Brad would emphasize, “it is not a 20 year view that is absolute, I lived in Boulder for 25 years, I am not on -5 of my 20 year journey, I am on year 25 year of my 45 year journey”. In emerging markets, entrepreneurs long-term view is not only about building their solutions, but also the infrastructure and markets for their solutions to succeed.\nInteractions and Connections are What Matter in A Startup Community and Ecosystem\nWhile I personally tend to think of innovation and entrepreneurship as ecosystems requiring the engagement of all relevant stakeholders, Brad makes the case that the startup community should be at the core. He argues that the interactions of this community should have one main purpose, “to help an entrepreneur succeed.” An entrepreneurship ecosystem is built out of it, as a system of systems. In The Startup Community Way, Feld distinguishes between Leaders, Instigators and Feeders as the main actors in a startup community.\n- Leaders are the entrepreneurs,\n- Instigators are people working within other relevant stakeholder organizations,\n- Feeders are the organizations themselves.\nFeld emphasized that it is not the parts of the community or the ecosystem that matters but rather the interactions between those parts. Prof. Fiona took a step back to look at the bigger picture and drew attention to the other communities within the ecosystem, each with its own shared intent, trust, and social norms. Murray highlighted the need to break the boundaries between these communities, and how critical connections across communities are to eventually create an Innovation Ecosystem that gives us the results we are seeking in terms of economic development and prosperity.\nAn Inclusive approach is needed\nThe MIT approach to innovation ecosystem development, highlights, the importance of engaging all stakeholders in the process. It emphasizes bringing all stakeholders to the table including universities, government, corporates, risk capital, and entrepreneurs, and I would add civil society. However, when we talk about emerging markets, or even smaller markets within the US, not all of these players may be ready or willing to engage. Brad Feld noted this potential mismatch of purpose and stressed the importance of “not hav[ing] the organizations themselves try to control and lead the activity in the startup community [as] that would stifle it”. Prof. Fiona agreed that “it is not that you can’t make progress when some of these key actors are lagging behind, but clearly you can accelerate progress when you bring them on the journey…but you need to bring those individuals (instigators) on and have them bring their organizations”.\nImportantly, panelists agreed we shouldn’t just wait for other stakeholders to be ready, entrepreneurs can create the holding environment for a startup community to emerge and these communities play a critical leadership role in advocating for changes needed in order for entrepreneurs to succeed and innovation to emerge.\nShift the paradigm, recognize the value of local knowledge and leadership\nWe are now at the forefront of a model of a diverse set of startup communities. Whether based in smaller cities in the US or in emerging markets, these communities are working from the bottom up creating momentum for innovation, and are invested in the long term. Christopher Schroeder defined this model as a model that values people, not as a problem to be solved, but as assets to be unleashed. Christopher also brought attention to the new realities where “rising markets around the world share as much together if not more than they share with Silicon Valley.”\nIncreasingly, entrepreneurs in emerging markets are connecting with each other and sharing lessons as they recognize the similarities in their startup communities and challenges they face, rather than relying on or trying to replicate the structure of already well-established ecosystems that are totally different in terms of composition, challenges, and mindset. Chris makes a strong case that VCs in such established ecosystems, such as Silicon Valley, need to learn from what is happening in emerging markets. Local “entrepreneurs are creating solutions on their [own] terms” and are better positioned to understand the needs and challenges of their local environments. This is how they are managing to win against large well-funded companies who lack local understanding, pushing these large companies to either acquire them (as in Uber acquiring Kareem) or leave the market (as in Uber leaving the East Asia market for Grab).\n“[We need to] focus startup community energy as organically as possible on the big problems,.. because clearly, governments are not going to do it on their own [and] foreign aid is not going to do it…we have to do it differently”.\nEntrepreneurs and startup communities’ long-term commitment to local development, their topophilia (love to place), coupled with deeper insights into what it takes to innovate in a local setting is the best bet for development in emerging markets. When entrepreneurs are willing to brave conflict, as in the case in my home country Yemen, not because they don’t realize the challenges facing them, but because they believe in the value of what they are doing, in their ability to navigate challenges, and their commitment to the cities and towns within which they are operating, prosperity starts to be more of an eventual certainty not an unlikely eventuality.\nThis article was written by Adeeb Qasem, Executive Director of the ROWAD Entrepreneurs Foundation and Researcher at the Legatum Center for Development and Entrepreneurship at MIT.\nThank you to our panelists for their contributions and insights:\n- Brad Feld, Author of The Startup Community Way and Managing Director of Foundry Group\n- Chris M.

But here, too, all is not simple. Numerous distortions can creep in, which lead to less-than-ideal contracts.\nIn many cases, the larger firms have ample financial reserves, while the startup is needy.\nParticularly at times when it is hard to raise funds from the public markets, the smaller firm may feel compelled to under-take an alliance in order to survive.\nThese imbalances can lead to the signing of one-sided agreements, where all the power is in the hands of the corporation, even though it would make sense for the startup to make many of the decisions.\nPhilippe Aghion and Jean Tirole developed a model that suggests that one-sided agreements will lead to fewer innovations than ones where neither of the parties suffers from financial constraints, and can arrive at an optimal agreement, which will typically be more balanced.\nIn addition, the business development officers at the larger firms who negotiate these agreements face a dilemma.\nIn many industries, the ultimate success or failure of the agreement will often not become clear for many years; in sectors like biotechnology, the verdict will not come in for a decade or longer.\nBy this point, the negotiators will be off to a new job, probably at another company.\nEvaluating the business development group on the ultimate success of the deals they negotiate is almost impossible. Instead, firms tend to look at other things, such as the extent to which the terms in the agreement favour the corporation.\nThese career concerns can also lead to agreements that are not the most conducive to success.\nThe dangers of the misshapen relationships that these pressures lead to can be illustrated by the alliance between Ciba-Geigy, a predecessor to the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis, and young Silicon Valley drug delivery specialist ALZA.\nALZA had turned to an alliance strategy after its promising startup ran aground: the California firm had quickly raised a substantial war chest from the public markets in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and just as quickly burned through it developing products that did not work.\nThe two firms signed a research agreement in 1978, when ALZA was on the verge of bankruptcy.\nAlthough the bulk of ALZA’s technologies were covered by the alliance, the young firm retained the right to also engage in a variety of independent activities, including alliances to exploit technologies that did not conflict with the topics being jointly explored with Ciba-Geigy.\nDue to ALZA’s financial weakness at the time of the alliance, Ciba-Geigy was able to obtain vast control rights, such as eight of ALZA’s eleven board seats, majority voting control, extensive information rights, and the ability to guide 90 percent of ALZA’s research activities through a number of review panels that were dominated by Ciba-Geigy representatives.\nDespite these seemingly ironclad control rights, numerous tensions arose over the exact type of research the ALZA researchers should be conducting.\nIn particular, Ciba-Geigy was concerned about other research projects and collaborations for which ALZA representatives kept seeking permission to establish with third parties. Although the boards ultimately approved most of ALZA’s, ALZA representatives became frustrated at the long delays associated with the process. As a result, ALZA scientists began bypassing the various review panels and directly contacting senior Ciba-Geigy officials to engage in outside arrangements.\nWhile detailed reporting and monitoring processes had been stipulated in the original agreement, these proved very difficult to enforce.\nCiba-Geigy officials were also concerned that ALZA scientists were publishing material in journals that disclosed their proprietary technology or might be employed in ALZA’s collaborations with other pharmaceutical firms.\nAs a result, Ciba-Geigy became increasingly reluctant to disclose its own technologies in the area of drug delivery to ALZA. Ultimately, these tensions led to the dissolution of the research collaboration at the end of 1981.\nThis conflict while perhaps extreme, illustrate what can go wrong in these alliances.\nThis one-sided nature of the agreement, brought about by the differing positions of the two firms at the time it was negotiated, created a cascading series of problems that were ultimately impossible to resolve.\nBut just as with corporate venturing, in many cases, large and small firms are able to overcome their differences, and to create real value from their collaborations.\nNot only can we offer many stories of such fruitful partnerships between firms, but more systematic studies also document such success. For instance, Ben Gomes-Casseres, Adam Jaffe, and John Hagedoorn compare pairs of firms that from strategic alliances with otherwise similar firms that do not.\nThey seek to understand whether these pairs of firms successfully transfer innovative knowledge – a key objective behind the typical alliance. To measure this, they look at how frequently the firms cite each other’s patents.\nWhile some knowledge flows are no doubt accidental or involuntary, if the alliances are fulfilling their intended role, greater interactions between the parties should lead to more mutual citations of each other’s work.\nThey find that if firms have one recently formed alliance, there is only a modest increase (6 percent) in the probability that they will cite each other.\nAs the relationship deepens, however, the knowledge flows accelerate: firms with alliances that are three or more years old have 19 percent more citations than nonallied firms, and pairs of firms with seven or more alliances have 63 percent more citations.\nThese effects are particularly strong for firms that have a more intensive alliance- for instance, if one of the firms purchases equity in the other-or have headquarters close to each other.\nThese patterns suggest that alliances, just like corporate venturing, do seem to be having real effects in boosting innovation.']	['<urn:uuid:dd98669b-5223-4f47-b85a-01c7eeb485f3>', '<urn:uuid:acc6248a-eac4-47da-a093-d1b94157678b>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	11	78	2509

22	surgical procedure differences teeth hip joint	The surgical procedures for tooth extraction and hip replacement differ significantly in complexity and approach. Tooth extractions can be either simple or surgical - simple extractions use local anesthetic and dental forceps to remove visible teeth, while surgical extractions require incisions and sometimes drilling of bone tissue for inaccessible teeth. Hip replacement surgery is a more complex procedure affecting the body's largest joint, requiring hospital stay of 2-4 days, followed by extensive rehabilitation including physical therapy. While tooth extraction patients can usually resume activities quickly, hip surgery patients need assistance with daily activities and must follow a structured rehabilitation program lasting several weeks.	"['Tooth extractions, or the removal of one or more teeth, are usually used as a last resort in dentistry, as keeping the natural tooth in the mouth is ideal. There are many reasons why single or multiple extractions may be performed, including pervasive tooth decay, the impaction of wisdom teeth, or the need to create space for orthodontic devices.\nThe most significant short-term benefit associated with tooth extraction is the elimination of pain. If a tooth is severely decayed or an infection is present, removing the affected tooth almost immediately alleviates discomfort. However, it should be noted that further procedures are necessary to replace the extracted tooth. Leaving a gap is not a viable option as the other teeth tend to twist out of alignment to fill the space.\nWhy might I need to have a tooth extraction?\nTooth extractions are incredibly common procedures. It should be reiterated that an extraction is used as a procedure of last resort, when nothing more can be done to save the tooth.\nHere is a brief overview of some of the main reasons for tooth extraction:\nDeep decay – This is easily the most common reason for tooth extraction, accounting for around two-thirds of all extraction procedures performed. When decay affects the surface of the tooth as well as the pulp, root canal procedures cannot be performed. Root canal therapy is only viable where the general structure of the tooth is in stable condition.\nExtra teeth –There are a variety of explanations associated with extra teeth, but most commonly they are baby teeth that do not shed. Extra teeth take up space on the arch, causing nearby teeth to twist out of place. A tooth extraction is necessary in this case to provide enough space for the teeth to properly realign.\nPeriodontal disease – Often teeth have to be extracted because the gums and underlying bone are so severely eroded that they can no longer hold the tooth in place securely. The cause of bone and gum recession is almost always advanced periodontal disease (gum disease). Poor bone density means that the chance of restoring the natural tooth is minimal.\nPrior to braces – Traditional orthodontic braces require enough space to for the teeth to move into ideal alignment. If space cannot be created naturally, a tooth may be extracted as an alternative.\nFractured teeth – Fortunately, dentists are able to save injured teeth in most circumstances with the aid of root canal therapy. However, there are some instances where the tooth has become fractured in a way that makes repair impossible. Your oral health professional will remove the tooth and use a prosthetic replacement in most cases.\nHow is the extraction procedure performed?\nGenerally, tooth extraction can be simple in nature or involve more complex surgical processes. Simple extractions are performed on fully emerged teeth after applying local anesthetic to the treatment site. Instruments are used to elevate the tooth and then sever the periodontal ligament. The tooth is then carefully removed with dental forceps.\nSurgical extractions are performed on teeth that are either invisible or inaccessible, like un-erupted wisdom teeth. An incision is usually made in the gum tissue and a drill is used to precisely remove some of the adjacent bone tissue. Sometimes, the tooth has to be split into several pieces to completely remove it.\nIf you have any questions or concerns about tooth extraction, please contact your oral health care provider.', ""Going through total hip replacement surgery can make you feel nervous and scared. Knowing what to expect after your surgery can help ease your nerves and make you feel better prepared for the surgery. Here is what to expect after total hip replacement surgery and what to do to recover faster.\n1. Pain After A Hip Replacement\nYou will feel pain after hip replacement. However, everyone is different and people will feel different levels of pain. Be prepared to feel some pain or discomfort afterwards, especially in the first three days following surgery. On the first day, you will be given pain medication to help alleviate the pain. On day two, you will likely be able to get out of bed and start moving with assistance. Although you had surgery on the largest joint in your body, you will be walking on it in only one or two days. Pain levels will probably be the most around the third day after surgery because this is when inflammation around the hip is the greatest. Talk to your doctor about their recommendations for using ice and taking an anti-inflammatory medication starting on the day of surgery. Typically, once you get through day three, the swelling and pain will get better. We've written a great blog about how to manage pain after a knee replacement, where the pain management strategies can be used to manage pain after a hip replacement .\n2. Walking After A Hip Replacement\nYou will most likely be up and walking the day after your surgery. Take it slow and don’t push yourself beyond what you can handle. Moving after surgery is very important to speed up your recovery. The first day that might just be you getting out of bed and to the hallway but don't feel discouraged by this. Moving around will also help to prevent blood clots, increase your muscle strength in your lower body and prevent your new hip from becoming stiff. Also, walking with a walker or cane is one of the goals you need to accomplish before going home from the hospital.\n3. Participating in Physical Therapy\nAfter hip surgery, your mobility will be limited. You will have supervised physical therapy before you are discharged from the hospital or surgical center. You will typically be discharged two to four days after surgery to either your home or to a rehabilitation facility. How long you stay in the hospital varies based on which country you live in. It will also be different based on your orthopaedic surgeon. It is a good idea to ask your surgeon before the surgery how many days you will be expected to stay in the hospital. Here in Toronto, Canada it is becoming more common to send people home on the same day as their surgery. We will leave the benefits and limitations of a hospital stay for another blog. Here are some goals to use as a checklist when transitioning back to your home:\n- You can get out of bed by yourself\n- Your pain is adequately under control usually with medication\n- You can eat, drink, sleep and go to the bathroom (for more information about how to go to the washroom and shower , check out this blog)\n- You can walk with a cane, walker or crutches\n- You're ready to do home exercises on your own\n- You know what you need to do to protect your new hip from an injury\nWhen you are sent home you will be expected to do some physical therapy on your own, unsupervised. Anticipate doing about 60 to 90 minutes worth of exercises 3 times per day. You may need some help with activities of daily living, such as cooking, cleaning, and doing laundry. Have a partner, family member, friend, or personal support worker help you with these tasks as best as they can. Thankfully, this stage usually doesn’t last long especially if you are doing your rehab exercises prescribed by the physical therapist. However, some people do not have physical therapy coverage after being discharged from the hospital. This is a major barrier to physical therapy access . Being physically active is very important for your recovery after surgery. Generally, people who do not have access to physical therapy after surgery experience less successful recovery.\n4. One To Two weeks After Surgery\nOne or two weeks after surgery you’ll probably be able to:\n- Move about your home more easily\n- Walk short distances (10-25 meters)\n- Prepare your own meal: One to 2 weeks after surgery you may be able to stand at the kitchen counter without a walking aid. Always follow the advice of your surgeon or physical therapist\n- Take showers: Some people are initially advised to avoid showering for a few days to protect the surgical incision. Guidelines on when it’s okay to shower can vary depending on the type of bandage and other factors, so follow your surgeon’s instructions\n5. How Long Until I Can Return To My Normal Activities?\nYou can expect it to take 10-12 weeks before you are able to return to all your daily life activities. It’s important to remind yourself that feeling frustrated is a normal part of the healing process.Take a break and relax from pushing yourself in times like this. Do something you enjoy. Think about how far you have already come, then get back up and keep on moving. It is also important to ask for assistance when you need it. Ten to twelve weeks will feel like a long time, but once you are enjoying a pain-free stroll that time will be just a memory.\nThis blog discusses various aspects to consider after a total hip replacement. This includes walking, participating in physical therapy, and what to expect the weeks following your hip replacement. For more information about hip replacement, check out Curovate.

23	As an immigration lawyer, what defines a Convention refugee in Canada?	A Convention refugee is defined as a person who has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, and is outside their countries of nationality and unable or unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of those countries due to that fear.	['Citizens of any country in the world are allowed to make a claim for refugee status in Canada, including Americans.\nHowever, the circumstances for an application for refugee status made by an American national to be approved are exceptionally limited. Out of 642 claims for refugee status made in 2018 by US citizens, only 2 were approved.\n|Referred to Refugee Protection||Accepted||Rejected||Abandoned||Withdrawn & Other||Pending|\nThe United States and Canada are signatories of the Safe Third Country Agreement, a bilateral agreement which establishes both nations as safe places for refugees to seek protection. The Supreme Court of Canada has found the Safe Third Country Agreement to be unconstitutional just this year, however it is still in place at this time. This is important because it is the legal establishment of both nations as places so safe that they will not accept refugee claims from people already present in either nation. The agreement has been in place for nearly 20 years.\nWhile it is not impossible for an American to make a claim for refugee status in Canada, their personal circumstances would have to be absolutely dire for there to be any chance of approval.\nThe legal basis for a claim for refugee or protected person status is outlined in sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act:\n96 A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries;\nWhat this means is that if you have a well-founded fear of actual persecution, such as violence, imprisonment, because of your race, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group then you have a basis to make a claim for refugee status in Canada.\nWhat this does not mean is that you have a legal basis for a refugee claim because one candidate or another won the United States presidential election.\nPerson in need of protection\n97 (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\nWhat this means is that if you were to be sent back to your country of nationality, and you would be tortured or subject to cruel and unusual punishment, you would have a legal basis for a claim for protection.\nWhat this does not mean is that you have a legal basis for a claim for protection because you are not happy with the current social situation in the United States.\nIf you are in danger of persecution or at risk of torture, then you should seek protection.\nIf you are an American citizen and want to move to Canada, but you are not in an appropriate situation for seeking protection, contact us to determine if a you may be eligible for permanent or temporary residence in Canada.']	['<urn:uuid:6634cf40-e339-4c87-b109-38ae535d91d3>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	11	54	660
24	What are the different ways to substitute eggs as a binding agent in recipes, and how can they be used specifically for leavening purposes?	For binding, you can use 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons of water, or chia seeds in the same proportion. Another binding option is mixing 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, 1 1/2 tablespoons water, and 1 teaspoon baking powder. For leavening purposes, you can add 1 teaspoon of baking soda to dry ingredients and mix in 1 tablespoon vinegar last, or use 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons canned coconut milk with 1 teaspoon baking powder. Another leavening option is using carbonated water or the combination of 1 tablespoon cider vinegar and 1 teaspoon baking soda.	['1. You’ve run out of baking powder: People tend to always have baking soda in the house because we use it for more than just cooking. If you run out of baking powder you can make your own. For each teaspoon of baking powder you need, simply add to your recipe 1/4 tsp of baking soda plus any ONE of the following: 1/2 tsp cream of tartar OR 1/2 cup buttermilk or yogurt OR 1/4 cup molasses. I usually determine which ingredient I’ll use by what I have in the house and which might taste better in the recipe.\n2. The recipe calls for buttermilk which you don’t buy: Whenever a recipe calls for buttermilk, you can make your own. Simply add 1 tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice to 1 cup of your type of milk (cow, soy, rice, etc…) and let it sit for five minutes. It’ll thicken up, and you can simply stir and use whatever amount you need for your recipe. You can also mix 3/4 cup of yogurt with 1/4 cup of milk or 3/4 cup sour cream with 1/4 cup milk. Again you can choose simply by what you have in stock or by which you’d think would taste best in your recipe.\n3. You’re baking, and you’re completely out of eggs: No worries. 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons of water is equivalent to one egg. If you don’t have ground flaxseed on hand, 1/4 cup of a pureed fruit or vegetable like applesauce or pumpkin will substitute as an egg binder. If the egg is acting as a leavener in your recipe (like for a cake), you can replace the egg by adding an extra 1 tsp of baking soda to your dry ingredients and mixing in 1 tablespoon of vinegar as the last ingredient to the batter.\n4. The recipe wants you to use milk but you’re out: If it’s a baking recipe like a cake or cookies, you can always use another liquid like fruit juice or even water. If you’re making something like a soup that uses milk simply as a liquid, you can substitute a vegetable or chicken broth or water seasoned with herbs. If you’re making a dish that uses milk to make it creamy and thick, you can substitute cooked pureed vegetables in an equal amount. If you’re baking something that needs the milk to give it density and thickness, substitute yogurt or sour cream, but reduce your fat (butter, oil, etc…) by about 1/4 cup.\n5. You need sour cream but you never buy it: You can substitute yogurt which you’re more likely to have but for every cup of sour cream you’ll use 1 cup of yogurt mixed with 1 tablespoon of flour. You can also substitute using 3/4 cup of a homemade buttermilk and adding about 1/3 cup of a solid fat (butter) to your recipe.\n6. You’re completely out of yogurt: Substitute one cup of sour cream or homemade buttermilk or pureed cottage cheese for every cup of yogurt needed.\n7. You don’t buy cottage cheese or ricotta cheese for dietary/allergy reasons: Simply substitute pureed tofu in equal amounts.\n8. The recipe wants you to use molasses or honey instead of sugar which is all you have or vice versa: 1 cup of molasses is equal to 3/4 cup of sugar and 1 cup of honey is equal to 1 1/4 cup of sugar. What’s important to remember is that molasses and honey are wet ingredients verses the dry ingredient sugar. So, if you’re adding molasses or honey instead of sugar, reduce another liquid ingredient by at least a 1/4 cup. If you’re substituting sugar, make sure to increase the liquid by at least a 1/4 cup. For all three you can always substitute half the amount of Agave remembering to reduce the liquid by 1/2 a cup if you’re using the Agave for the dry sugar. You can also use 1/2 the amount of Truvia for sugar. If you substitute Truvia for the molasses or honey, be sure to increase your liquids to adapt for the loss in wet ingredients.\n9. Your recipe calls for tomato sauce and you only have tomato paste: 3/4 cup of tomato paste mixed with 1 cup of water will give you about 2 cups of a tomato “sauce”. FYI: If you only have tomato sauce and need tomato “juice” in your recipe, 1/2 cup of tomato sauce mixed with 1/2 cup of water is equivalent to 1 cup of tomato juice.\n10. Your recipe wants you to use a certain type of meat, vegetable, bean or whatever and you only have another type: Go head! Substitute! Use what you have. Just be sure that what you’re using is comparable. For example, salmon, halibut and tuna are all fish with similar texture, thickness and cooking time, while cod and haddock cook similarly, as does flounder, tilapia and catfish. For vegetables, substitute one root vegetable for another (carrots, turnips, potatos, etc…), a flower vegetable for another (broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, etc…) and make sure everything is cut to the same shape and size and thickness so your cooking times will stay the same.', 'Going egg-free? How to Substitute Eggs in Recipes\nThere are a lot of reasons you may need to replace egg in your recipes. You or your child may have an egg allergy or sensitivity, maybe you’re baking for a friend who is vegan, or you want to mix up your menu a bit. Or maybe it is a day you simply ran out. Avoiding eggs doesn’t mean sacrificing your favorite foods or good flavor.\nThe most important thing to remember when replacing eggs is to think about what the egg is being used for in the recipe. Eggs supply moisture, act as a binder or are used to provide leavening so the recipe is fluffier. Do you need to replace a whole egg, or just a yolk or the egg white? This will help you decide what egg replacer to use. Some recipes that only require 1 to 2 eggs and make a flat product (such as pancakes) may not need a replacement at all, just 1 to 2 extra tablespoons of liquid to make up for the missing liquid from the egg.\nThe egg replacer I most often use in my baking is 1 tablespoon ground flax seed mixed with 3 tablespoons hot water. Set this aside for a couple of minutes until the flax seed mixture thickens. This mixture should be as thick and sticky as an egg white. If it isn’t, heat the mixture until it thickens. Allow to cool slightly before adding to your recipe. This mixture equals one egg. Flax mixture only replaces the binding property of an egg. If you are using it in a cookie, cake or quick bread recipe also add 1/4 teaspoon extra baking powder to provide the leavening needed.\nThere are many other things besides flax to replace eggs. I have them grouped by use. Some egg replacements, due to their flavor, may alter the taste or texture of your recipe, so use an egg replacer that will compliment the other ingredients. Have fun experimenting and find one that works for your family. Each substitution below equals one egg.\nWhen eggs are used as moisture it is the easiest substitution and used most often in baked goods such as cookies, muffins and quick breads.\n- 1/4 cup mashed banana, pumpkin puree or sweet potato\n- 3 tablespoons applesauce, pear sauce, apple butter, apricot puree or pureed prunes. Add one more tablespoon liquid to the recipe.\nIf eggs are used as a binder:\n- use the flax seed mix above. If you want to make a larger batch ahead of time, mix 1/4 cup ground flax seed with 3/4 cup water. Cook until thickened. Allow to cool. Store in the refrigerator in a covered container for up to 2 weeks. Use 3 1/2 Tablespoons flax mix for each egg.\n- Chia seed can be used the same as flax seed. If you can find chia seed online and at health food stores.\n- 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, 1 1/2 tablespoons water, and 1 teaspoon baking powder\n- Gelatin (unless you are vegetarian- gelatin is NOT a vegetarian product). Sprinkle the contents of a packet of unflavored gelatin over 1 cup of cold water. When the gelatin absorbs water, heat over medium heat until the gelatin completely dissolves. Allow mixture to cool. Use 3 tablespoons to replace one egg.\nReplacing eggs used as leavening. Eggs give texture providing lift. Egg-free baking has a tendency to be a bit heavier without the egg white, but there are several things you can do to lighten the texture of your baked good.\n- add 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons canned coconut milk (NOT light) and 1 teaspoon baking powder to your recipe\n- use Ener-G egg replacer powder 1 packed tablespoon of powder mixed with 2 tablespoon warm water, whisking until frothy.\n- replace part or all of the liquid with carbonated water. Do not over mix after adding in order to retain the carbonation’s effect.\n- And don’t forget the old WWII trick of subbing 1 tablespoon cider vinegar and 1 teaspoon baking soda for eggs in cakes, cupcakes and quick breads.\nHopefully these egg replacers will help out the next time you need to replace an egg.

25	As someone interested in urban development, I'd like to know how Berlin's Ring Estate and Prenzlauer Berg neighborhoods changed over time - what were they originally designed for, and how did their purposes evolve?	The Ring Estate (Siemensstadt) was originally designed as worker housing near Siemens plants, with approximately 18,000 units planned around a central park area (though this was later converted to a parking lot). The estate was conceived to open up to surrounding areas, unlike other contemporary developments. Meanwhile, Prenzlauer Berg evolved from its original purpose as a 19th century tenement neighborhood - during communist rule it served as a bohemian artistic district with state-controlled low rents, but after Germany's reunification it transformed into an expensive neighborhood for middle-class households, featuring modern amenities like farmers markets, coffee bars, and day care facilities.	"['Keywords Change this\n1929 – 1931\nLocation Change this\nAlso known as Change this\nRingsiedlung, Ring Estate, Großsiedlung Siemensstadt\nArchitect Change this\nPaul R. Henning\nClient Change this\nGemeinnützige Heimstätten-Aktiengesellschaft (GEHAG) GmbH\nArticle last edited by AleeshaCallahan on\nAugust 02nd, 2013\nSiemensstadt Change this\nDescription Change this\nThe Siemensstadt residential estate was launched by the Berlin Senate in 1928. it was designed by a group of architects, namely Hans Scharoun, Walter Gropius, Otto Bartning and Rudolf Häring. Collectively they called themselves \'The Ring\' (der Ring in German). Two further architects, Fred Forbat who worked with Walter Gropius at the Bauhaus and Paul Henning who were not members of the group, participated in the project.\nPurposeThanks to the close proximity of the Siemens plants and the existing rail transportation lines, the Siemens-owned building society was given permission to build a large-scale residential estate (with some 18,000 units for Siemens workers) on an undeveloped site.\nConceptHans Scharoun who also designed the master plan for the project grouped the buildings according to the principle of ""neigbourhood units"" a term loosely related to Taut\'s concept of ""outside living space"". One of his main concerns was the preservation of a large central park area. Unfortunately this area was later lost due to the construction of a parking lot. Scharoun emphasized the access route into the estate nearby by flanking the entrance with two buildings placed at acute angles to each other. They are pointed to the railway underpass and provide a link with the neighbouring industrial area.\nContrary to Taut\'s Hufeisensiedlung, the estate opens up to the surrounding area. The facades of the buildings, designed by Scharoun himself, are accentuated with unusual elements such as projecting balconies, porthole windows and sundecks on the roofs - deliberate reminiscences of naval architecture.\nAnother characteristic feature of the estate is the long curving building designed by Bartning which forms a kind of protective barrier along the railway line. The terraced housing by Häring is not laid out at exact right angles to Bartning\'s building, thereby lending the space a dynamic tension. Häring has varied the design of west facades by using different materials adding curved balconies. The rear of the adjoining row of houses has a much less expressive design and seems to retreat further than it actually is, thereby widening the space in between. Häring\'s detailing clearly manifests his philosophy of an organic functionalism.\nBy contrast, the section of the estate designed by Walter Gropius represents a strictly rational functionalism. His buildings, with access balconies and glazed staircase towers, appear highly graphic with clearly defined edges and characteristic interplay of dark and light areas. Unlike Häring\'s sculptural treatment of the building volume which radiates an almost Mediterranean feeling, Gropius\' building appears rather austere.\nThe Ring Estate combines the advantages of terraced housing with an impressive variety of expressive detailing and design. The spectrum of architectural vocabularies suggest a loosely knit association of individual personalities rather than a true collective of designers and epitomises the different facets and of approaches taken by the pioneers of modern city architecture.\nSince 2008, the Ring Settlement is a UNESCO Cultural World Heritage.', 'This photograph is taken in Prenzlauer Berg, a 19th century neighborhood dominated by tenement buildings in former East-Berlin. This short essay argues that it is a good example of a Lefebvrian counter-space “running against the grain of the dominant […]” (Leary (2009), p. 204).\nPrenzlauer Berg was “a unique sociotope, more individualistic, more colorful, and more non-conformist than anywhere else in East Germany” (Urban (2007), p. 28)\nDuring the communist occupation and the separation of east- en West-Berlin, Prenzlauer Berg was “a unique sociotope, more individualistic, more colorful, and more non-conformist than anywhere else in East Germany” (Urban (2007), p. 28) – in other words, inhabited by artists, bohemians, dissenters, et cetera. During this time, Prenzlauer Berg was a peripheral part of Berlin due to its relative position the wall.\nUntil 1990, housing was subject to state planning and control (Berlin, 1997, p. 301) and “rents [in Prenzlauer Berg, DH] were extremely low and did not vary much according to location and quality of dwellings. Appropriation and exploitation of land and property was abolished” (Berlin, 1997, p. 302).\nShortly after Germany’s unification however, the communist practices of nationalization and rent control were abolished, and since the wall had been destroyed Prenzlauer Berg’s relative location shifted to quite central which increased the potential land value.\nPrenzlauer Berg transformed, much to the dislike of the original artists and bohemians who saw their rents rise and the social fabric of the neighborhood change because bohemians and intellectuals moved out and ‘bourgois’ middle class moved in.\nOne of the traditional explanations for gentrification is rent gap “the disparity between the potential ground rent level and the actual ground rent capitalized under the present land use” (Smith, 1979, p. 545), and this is exactly what happened in Prenzlauer Berg: by investing in tenements (by renovation) and the neighborhood (facilitate a modern, western urban middle class lifestyle), Prenzlauer Berg transformed, much to the dislike of the original artists and bohemians who saw their rents rise and the social fabric of the neighborhood change because bohemians and intellectuals moved out and ‘bourgois’ middle class moved in. Hence the protest which has been painted on one of the buildings reminding us that gentrification has unwanted side effects for the less affluent.\nWhen Lefebvres famous spatial triad is applied to this case, the analysis becomes more geographical and a little less historical. Following the ideas of Healy, 2007, p .204 in Leary (2009), this paper interprets this triad as follows: “\nSpatial practice: the physical city […].\nRepresentations of space: rational, intellectual conceptions of urban areas […].\nSpaces of representation: emotional and artistic interpretations of city space imbued with cultural meaning which […] can lead eventually to the production of a counter-space.”\nNow, what happens in the case of Prenzlauer Berg on Lefebvres three spatial levels?\nNow, what happens in the case of Prenzlauer Berg on these three spatial levels? Firstly, the physical fabric of Berlin changes dramatically: the wall is tore down, Prenzlauer Berg becomes a centralized district and the tenements become privatized, renovated and surrounded by other facilities that didn’t exist under communist rule.\nSecondly, on a rational level, the way Prenzlauer Berg is valued in terms of rent gap, changes as well: suddenly the neighborhood becomes an attractive investment opportunity. Analogue to the revaluation of Liverpool Road Station in Manchester “from a site of deteriorating industry to one of historic value”, the revaluation of potential rent “plays a crucial role in the production of” Prenzlauer Berg (Leary (2007)).\nAnd finally, on an emotional level too, feelings about and towards Prenzlauer Berg shifted. During the sixties, seventies and eighties, Prenzlauer Berg was felt as ‘artistic’ and a place of relative bohemian freedom. After the unification, it became a rather affluent, bourgois middle class neighborhood because the actual artists were dispersed to quarters like Kreuzberg and Charlottenburg where they could still afford to live.\nThe dominant representation of space in Prenzlauer Berg of today is that of a rather expensive neighborhood for double income households, who plan or have children and who enjoy a modern urban lifestyle – farmers markets, cofffee bars, taking your young children to day care in a container bicycle. The above photograph is reminding us that another representation of space pre existed this narrative and has opposed / is opposing the current one. Therefor, it can be considered as a counter-space.\nUrban, F. (2007). Designing the past in East Berlin before and after the German reunification. Progress in Planning, 68(1), 1–55.\nBerlin, E.

26	food banks food pantries difference service delivery	Food banks and food pantries differ in their service delivery models. Food banks, like those in Baltimore's Emergency Food Working Group, coordinate with multiple city agencies and nonprofits to protect the overall food system during emergencies. In contrast, food pantries focus on direct client service, offering healthy food initiatives that include client choice models, cooking demonstrations, recipe tastings, and on-site nutrition education programs.	"['Two years ago, Baltimore was hit with the largest snowstorms in its history. The city was in a state of emergency causing the school system to be closed for a week. Yet canceling classes aren’t the only consequence during a disaster. With a major disruption to the food system, how would thousands of parents who depend on school-provided lunches weather the storm, and how would their children stave off hunger?\nA myriad of factors from extreme weather events to labor shortages can threaten the city’s ability to function. So how does a government begin planning for a disaster that hasn’t happened yet–or prevent one from occurring in the first place? In 2013, the Baltimore Office of Sustainability (BoS) developed a comprehensive disaster preparedness plan to identify the city’s most vulnerable areas and the hazards that threaten them.\nBased on these findings, BoS and the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future (CLF), saw the need to do further analysis in one critical area: food systems. Collaboration between the two organizations led to the Baltimore Food System Resilience Advisory Report, which assessed factors that predict resilience and laid out a framework for other cities to do the same. Resilience, or the ability to withstand and adapt to a crisis, is key because it allows cities to recover, grow, and ultimately, ensure the well-being of its residents. Here are three things cities can learn from the report to create more resilient communities.\nDon’t Recreate the Wheel\nBy using a systems thinking approach to coordinate efforts among organizations, Baltimore City developed a successful strategy for protecting the food system through the creation of an Emergency Food Working Group. The group consists of food access nonprofits and 12 city agencies, with each organization supporting critical infrastructure in their area of expertise with the common goal of protecting the food system. For example, after a snowstorm, the Department of Transportation reroutes plowing to clear roads to grocery stores as opposed to delivering meals. By taking advantage of each department’s day-to-day role, multiple entities contribute towards the overall effort of food system resilience. For Sarah Buzogany, Food Access Planner for the Baltimore Food Policy Initiative at BoS, the key to supporting the food system is this coordination: “You don’t have to recreate the wheel to do it. Just make sure that you have all the right people at the table for your existing processes, especially if you don’t have folks that are specifically dedicated to food systems working on city staff.”\nRecognize Gaps in Disaster Preparedness\nIt is important for cities to recognize that gaps in disaster preparedness often occur on the individual level. A snow day that keeps children home from school for two days is a seemingly minor disruption, but for food-insecure families that depend on school meals, this event will impact the entire family budget. Food insecurity is not uncommon in Baltimore City; in 2014, 23.8% of city residents were food-insecure. The effects of food insecurity are not limited to physical health concerns such as an increased risk in chronic disease, delayed development in children, and nutrient deficiency. This insecurity can negatively affect mental health in the form of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. More specifically, food insecurity has been linked to toxic stress, a form of stress that stems from economic hardship and other adversity and causes long-term physical and emotional harm. Cities must think about resilience on a macro level, but they cannot assume a substantial level of preparedness exists among their citizens.\nSupport Food Assistance Organizations\nFinally, capacity and funding are constant challenges for food assistance organizations (FAOs), but cities can help them continue to operate sustainably. A key strategy is to avoid treating food system resilience as a stand alone issue. Tying it into other resilience efforts makes this area less vulnerable to losing funding. For example, Baltimore City’s development of an emergency food access protocol brought together food access organizations to better understand their needs. According to Erin Biehl, Senior Program Coordinator for the Food System Sustainability and Public Health Program, advocating for FAOs doesn’t have to involve funding: “From my perspective, enhancing communication and coordination seems like it could be a role that local governments could play, even in the absence of funding directly for those organizations.” By supporting these organizations and prioritizing food security initiatives, the city can help them remain effective and prevent crises from creating a system shut down.\nSince food system resilience is a relatively new topic, the process of developing indicators to measure it is still ongoing. As a next step, CLF and OoS intend to develop tools that other cities can use to do develop their food system resilience strategies in a fast, efficient way. Until then, city governments can look to the advisory report’s fault tree analysis, a tool for identifying potential vulnerabilities in the food system. This framework allows cities to deal with smaller, more manageable parts of resilience, which is ideal for those who may not have experience with food systems. Regardless of experience level, it is never too late to start planning for a disaster. Prevention can make all the difference.', ""Food pantry and food bank healthy food initiatives combine hunger relief efforts with nutrition information and healthy eating opportunities for individuals and families with low incomes. Such initiatives offer clients healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and lean proteins, and can implement client choice models. Initiatives can include fruit and vegetable gleaning programs, farm Plant-a-Row efforts, and garden donations. Healthy food initiatives can also modify the food environment via efforts such as on-site cooking demonstrations and recipe tastings, healthy meal kits, featured product placements, produce display stands, or point-of-decision prompts. Some food pantries and food banks establish partnerships with health and nutrition professionals to offer screening for food insecurity and medical conditions (e.g., diabetes), provide nutrition and health education, and health care support services as part of their healthy food initiatives (FA-Nutrition initiative, Bush-Kaufman 2019*).\nExpected Beneficial Outcomes (Rated)\n- Increased healthy food consumption\n- Increased food security\nOther Potential Beneficial Outcomes\n- Improved nutrition\n- Improved weight status\n- Reduced emissions\nEvidence of Effectiveness\nThere is some evidence that food pantries and food banks that use healthy food initiatives increase fruit and vegetable consumption, improve diet quality, and increase food security for clients more than traditional food pantries and banks (An 2019, Grabow 2020, Cochrane-Martin 2018). Available evidence associates such initiatives with a significant increase in fresh fruit and vegetable distribution through food pantries (Long 2019), and when implemented as intended, with improved quality of foods available and selected by pantry clients (Caspi 2019). However, additional evidence is needed to confirm effects especially over the long-term (An 2019).\nFood pantry initiatives that provide nutrition education and recipe demonstrations can increase the variety of fruits and vegetables and the amount of produce clients consume, and can improve nutrition knowledge, home cooking skills and habits, and food security status (An 2019, Flynn 2013*, Keller-Olaman 2005*). In a Rhode Island-based study, food pantry clients participating in a plant-based cooking and nutrition education program and preparing these meatless recipes at home 2-3 meals per week, improved weight status and reduced total food costs (Flynn 2013*). In a rural Missouri case study, healthy food initiatives at food pantries are associated with improved healthy food access and food choices, as well as increased gardening knowledge, support, and resources (Chapman 2017). Program evaluations of comprehensive healthy food initiatives that include a client choice model with a variety of featured healthy food options, connections to community resources and services, a respectful and welcoming environment, and on site opportunities for clients to build skills are associated with significant improvements in food security, self-sufficiency, and diet quality over time (Cochrane-Martin 2018).\nFood banks and pantries with healthy food initiatives that use client choice models for food selection and tailor messaging, recipes, and food tips for their clients appear to have greater effects on healthy eating decisions and vegetable use than generic messaging and food tips (Clarke 2011*). One Utah-based study suggests food pantry healthy food nudge programs may improve dietary choices, with the largest effects reported among Hispanic survey respondents (Coombs 2020*). A Connecticut-based study suggests ingredient bundles with recipe tastings may increase the likelihood that food pantry clients select healthier food options more than tastings alone (Stein 2019). Healthy food display interventions can help food pantry clients select healthier food items (An 2019) and may improve diets among people who are food insecure (Grabow 2020).\nHealthy food initiatives in food pantries that include gleaning, farm, or garden donations can reduce waste and increase the availability of local, seasonal produce for participants, which may reduce emissions from fossil fuels used to produce, process, and transport food (Ringling 2020, FAO-Food waste, Hic 2016, SSSA-McIvor 2017, CCAFS-Campbell 2012). Healthy food initiatives in food pantries may also reduce the energy intensity of an individual’s diet if more plant-based foods are consumed in place of animal products (Ringling 2020).\nSuccessful healthy food initiatives are most often found in food pantries or food banks that have written nutrition guidelines, client choice distribution models, and adequate refrigerator storage (Long 2020). Building a healthier food inventory, enhancing partner agency access, storage, and distribution capacity for fresh foods, developing nutrition education, and expanding community partnerships and settings for healthy food distribution are key components for healthy food initiatives at food banks (Wetherill 2019*). Establishing strong nutrition policies at food banks is a suggested strategy to improve the nutritional quality of food distributed; however, such changes have the potential to alter relationships with existing donors, possibly reducing the total amount of food available for distribution (Handforth 2013*). Interviews with food bank and food pantry personnel suggest that other challenges to adopting healthy food initiatives include the procurement, handling, and monitoring of large quantities of perishable foods (Campbell 2013*), as well as limited staffing and other resources (An 2019). Such interviews also suggest food pantry clients may benefit from nonjudgmental nutrition guidance; however, some clients may have other reasons not to choose healthy foods, for example, lack of cooking equipment or transportation challenges (Cooksey-Stowers 2018*).\nThe cost of healthy food initiatives varies; some are very low cost and relatively straightforward to implement, such as healthy food display interventions (Grabow 2020).\nImpact on Disparities\nFeeding America, a hunger-relief organization with over 200 member food banks and 60,000 food pantries and meal programs nationwide, is one organization working nationally to increase healthy foods distributed through food banks (FA-Who we are). As of 2020, 69% of foods distributed through Feeding America member food banks were considered healthy and align with USDA nutritional guidelines. Feeding America also operates mobile food pantries to bring healthy foods to families in underserved areas and the Produce Matchmaker program that connects growers directly with food banks to donate surplus, fresh produce (FA-Nutrition initiative). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Feeding America’s network of food banks has implemented many new drive-through and outdoor food distribution locations, delivered emergency food boxes, and worked with many schools and school districts to provide grab-and-go cold meals for children and families while schools are closed (FA-Who we are).\nFarm to Food Bank, Farm to Food Pantry, and Farmers Ending Hunger programs are in place in many states, including Connecticut (CFB-Farm donations), Georgia (GFBA-FTFB), Kentucky (KAFB-FTFB), Maryland (MFB-FTFB), Montana (CFC-MT FTFB), Oregon (FEH-Oregon), and Rhode Island (RI Food Bank-Community farms). Some states offer growers a tax credit for donations of excess produce to state-sponsored food banks, as in Arizona, California, Colorado, Oregon (NRDC-Gunders 2012), Iowa (IA DOR-FTFD tax credit), and Kentucky (KAFB-FTFB).\nMany food banks use farming, gardening, gleaning, and other healthy food programs to procure fresh produce and support healthy eating for their clients, as in Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona in Tucson (CFBSA-Programs), Chester County Food Bank in Pennsylvania (CCFB-Programs), Inter-Faith Food Shuttle in Raleigh, North Carolina (IFFS-Food bank), and Santa Barbara County Food Bank (SBCFB-Programs). Ample Harvest, a non-profit organization, helps home and community gardeners donate their excess produce to over 8,700 food pantries in all 50 states (Ample Harvest-Garden donations). The Missouri Department of Agriculture supports the Grow & Give program part of the 10,000 Garden Challenge, which encourages home and community gardens to donate a portion of their produce to local food banks and pantries (MDA-Grow and give 2011).\nMany food pantries have implemented more comprehensive healthy food initiatives. For example, the More Than Food initiative builds capacity for food banks and food pantries to offer client choice, connections with community services, supports to reach their goals, and a welcoming environment; this initiative was developed through evaluations of the Freshplace food pantry program in Hartford, CT (Foodshare-More than food, Foodshare-Freshplace). The Fresh Start program at Kelly Memorial Food Pantry in El Paso, Texas also provides healthy food assistance, health and wellbeing classes, and case management services to address the root causes of hunger and overcome barriers to personal and financial independence (Fresh Start). The Whole Body Approach to Wellness (WBA) program, developed through a collaboration between Northern Illinois Food Bank and Northern Illinois University, is a health promotion, nondiet program to help food pantry clients develop a healthy relationship with food and fitness, while respecting body, shape, and size diversity and focusing on a holistic approach to wellness and behavioral outcomes. Participants who are at risk for or already diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes also receive additional fresh produce as part of the program (NIFB-WBA).\nTo increase the amount of healthy foods available, statewide food policy councils can require food banks to spend a portion of funds on fresh fruits and vegetables and low-fat milk, for example, the New York State Council on Food Policy (CDC DNPAO-FPC).\nAmple Harvest-Garden donations - Ample Harvest.

27	What are the key characteristics and growth conditions required for culturing Streptococcus pneumoniae in a laboratory environment, and how does it appear on blood agar plates?	S. pneumoniae is a fastidious bacterium that grows best at 35-37°C with approximately 5% CO2 or in a candle-jar. It is typically cultured on blood-containing media or chocolate agar plates. When grown on blood agar plates, S. pneumoniae colonies appear as small, grey, and moist (sometimes mucoidal) colonies that produce a zone of alpha-hemolysis (green). While young pneumococcal colonies initially appear raised like viridans streptococci, after 24-48 hours they become flattened with a depressed central portion, which is a distinguishing characteristic.	"['Chapter 8: Identification and Characterization of Streptococcus pneumoniae\nS. pneumoniae may occur intracellularly or extracellularly as gram-positive lanceolate diplococci, but can also occur as single cocci or in short chains of cocci. S. pneumoniae is a fastidious bacterium, growing best at 35-37°C with ~5% CO2 (or in a candle-jar). It is usually cultured on media that contain blood, but can also grow on a chocolate agar plate (CAP). On a blood agar plate (BAP), colonies of S. pneumoniae appear as small, grey, moist (sometimes mucoidal), colonies and characteristically produce a zone of alpha-hemolysis (green) (Figure 1). The alpha-hemolytic property differentiates this organism from many species, but not from the commensal alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococci. Differentiating pneumococci from viridans streptococci is difficult as young pneumococcal colonies appear raised, similar to viridans streptococci. However, once the pneumococcal culture ages 24-48 hours, the colonies become flattened, and the central portion becomes depressed, which does not occur with viridans streptococci (Figure 2). A microscope (30-50X) or a 3X hand lens can also be a useful tool in differentiating pneumococci from viridans streptococci. Prior to identification and characterization testing procedures, isolates should always be inspected for purity of growth and a single colony should be re-streaked, when necessary, to obtain a pure culture. For the following identification and characterization procedures, it is essential to test alpha-hemolytic colonies that are less than a day old, typically grown overnight at 35-37°C with ~5% CO2 (or in a candle-jar).\nThe following specialized tests are used to identify colonies on a BAP that resemble pneumococci (Figure 3). S. pneumoniae can be identified using Gram stain, catalase, and optochin tests simultaneously, with bile solubility as a confirmatory test. If these tests indicate that the isolate is S. pneumoniae, serological tests to identify the serotype can be performed. This sequence of testing is an efficient way to save costly serotyping reagents and time. Additional methods for identification and characterization of S. pneumoniae using molecular tools are described in Chapter 10: PCR Methods and Chapter 12: Molecular Methods. Additional protocols used for streptococcal species identification and updates to existing methods can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/streplab/strep-doc/index.html.\nBiosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) practices are required for work involving isolates of S. pneumoniae, as this organism presents a potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the surrounding working environment. Please refer to Chapter 4: Biosafety in order to follow the guidelines that have been established for laboratorians working in BSL-2 facilities as many of the tests described in this chapter require opening plates with live cultures and are often performed outside of a biosafety cabinet (BSC).\nCatalase is the enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into H2O and O2. The oxygen is given off as bubbles in the liquid. The catalase test is primarily used to differentiate between gram-positive cocci. Members of the genus Staphylococcus are catalase-positive, and members of the genera Streptococcus and Enterococcus are catalase-negative.\n- Performing the catalase test\n- Grow the isolate(s) to be tested for 18-24 hours on a BAP at 35-37°C with ~5% CO2 (or in a candle-jar).\n- From overnight growth on the BAP, use a disposable loop to carefully remove a colony and place it on a glass slide.\n- Do not transfer any of the blood agar to the slide as erythrocytes in the blood agar will cause a false-positive reaction.\n- Add 1.0 ml of 3% H2O2 to the slide and mix with the bacteria.\n- H2O2 can be obtained from a commercial drug store.\n- After initially opening, store H2O2 at 4°C in a tightly closed bottle as it will slowly lose potency once opened.\n- Observe the bacterial suspension on the slide immediately for vigorous bubbling.\n- It is essential to use a known positive and negative quality control (QC) strain. A Staphylococcus spp. strain can be used for a positive control and a known S. pneumoniae strain or any other streptococcal spp., i.e., S. pyogenes can be used for a negative control.\n- Reading the catalase test results\n- The absence of bubbling from a transferred colony indicates a negative test.\n- Any bubbling from a transferred colony indicates a positive test (Figure 4).\n- False positives will result from transfer of red blood cells so take care when picking colonies from the BAP for this test.\n- Quality control\n- It is essential to use a known positive and negative QC strain as described in the procedure. Opened bottles should be checked against a known catalase positive organism every 6 months.\n- Performing the catalase test\nS. pneumoniae strains are sensitive to the chemical optochin (ethylhydrocupreine hydrochloride). Optochin sensitivity allows for the presumptive identification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci as S. pneumoniae, although some pneumococcal strains are optochin-resistant. Other alpha-hemolytic streptococcal species are optochin-resistant.\nPerforming the optochin test\nOptochin (P) disks (6 mm, 5 µg) can be obtained from a commercial vendor. Optochin disks are often called ""P disks"" and many commercial versions are labeled with a capital ""P"". If a commercial source of P disks is not available, a 1:4000 solution of ethylhydrocupreine hydrochloride can be applied to sterile 6 mm filter paper disks.\n- Grow the strain(s) to be tested for 18-24 hours on a BAP at 35-37°C with ~5% CO2 (or in a candle-jar).\n- Use a disposable loop to remove an isolated colony from the overnight culture on the BAP and streak onto one half of a BAP.\n- Two different isolates can be tested on the same plate, but care must be taken to ensure that the cultures do not overlap.\n- Place a P disk within the streaked area of the plate and incubate the BAP overnight at 35-37°C with ~5% CO2 (or in a candle-jar).\n- Observe the growth on the BAP near the P disk and measure the zone of inhibition, if applicable.\n- Reading the optochin test results\n- Using a 6 mm, 5 µg disk, a zone of inhibition of 14 mm or greater indicates sensitivity and allows for presumptive identification of pneumococci (Figure 5).\n- Zones of inhibition should be measured from the top surface of the plate with the top removed.\n- Use either calipers or a ruler with a handle attached for these measurements. Measure the diameter of the zone holding the ruler over the center of the surface of the disk when measuring the zone of inhibition. In the case of an isolate completely resistant to optochin, the diameter of the disk (6 mm) should be recorded.\n- A smaller zone of inhibition (< 14 mm) or no zone of inhibition indicates that the bile solubility test is required. It is important to remember that pneumococci are sometimes optochin-resistant.\n- Quality control\n- Each new lot of optochin disks should be tested with positive and negative controls. The growth of S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 49619 is inhibited by optochin and growth of S. mitis strain ATCC 49456 is not inhibited by optochin.\nBile solubility test\nThe bile (sodium deoxycholate) solubility test distinguishes S. pneumoniae from all other alpha-hemolytic streptococci. S. pneumoniae is bile soluble whereas all other alpha-hemolytic streptococci are bile resistant. Sodium deoxycholate (2% in water) will lyse the pneumococcal cell wall.\n- Preparation of 2% sodium deoxycholate (bile salt) solution\n- Dissolve 2 g of sodium deoxycholate into 100 ml sterile distilled water.\n- Performing the bile solubility test\n- Add bacterial growth from the overnight BAP to 1.0 ml of 0.85% saline to achieve turbidity in the range of a 0.5-1.0 McFarland standard.\n- Divide the cell suspension equally into 2 tubes (0.5 ml per tube).\n- Add 0.5 ml of 2% sodium deoxycholate (bile salts) to one tube. Add 0.5 ml of 0.85% saline to the other tube. Mix each tube well.\n- Incubate the tubes at 35-37°C in CO2.\n- Vortex the tubes.\n- Observe the tubes for any clearing of turbidity after 10 minutes. Continue to incubate the tubes for up to 2 hours at 35-37°C in CO2 if negative after 10 minutes. Observe again for clearing.\n- Reading the bile solubility test results\n- A clearing of the turbidity in the bile tube but not in the saline control tube indicates a positive test (Figure 6).\n- Partial clearing (partial solubility) is not considered positive for pneumococcal identification. Partially soluble strains that have optochin zones of inhibition of less than 14 mm are not considered pneumococci.\n- Quality control\n- Each new lot of sodium deoxycholate should be tested with positive and negative QC strains. S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 49619 can be used as a positive control and S. mitis strain ATCC 49456 can be used as a negative control.\n- Preparation of 2% sodium deoxycholate (bile salt) solution\nCommercial test kits for identification\nSeveral commercial identification systems that use slide agglutination tests are available for identification of colony growth from a BAP as S. pneumoniae. These identification tests use suspensions of latex beads with rabbit antibody specific for S. pneumoniae capsular antigens. Visible agglutination occurs when the S. pneumoniae capsular antigen reacts with the antibody-coated latex beads. The manufacturer\'s instructions should be followed precisely when using these kits. These kits should be regularly subjected to QC using a non-pneumococcal streptococcal species, since they can become cross-reactive with prolonged storage.\nDetermining S. pneumoniae capsular serotypes using serologic methods\nAlthough serotyping of pneumococci is not usually necessary for a clinical response, capsular serotype determination is a critical component of successful pneumococcal disease surveillance efforts. Effective current multivalent vaccines target combinations of key serotypes. Determination of serotype distributions associated with disease in certain regions provides information regarding the potential usefulness of applying existing vaccines and is also critical for assessing vaccine impact.\nSerotype distribution can be determined by culture of the organism followed by serological determination of the capsular type by latex agglutination and the quellung reaction. Many laboratories have opted to use simpler and less expensive methods of deducing capsular serotypes through the use of specific PCR reactions (see Chapter 10: PCR Methods and http://www.cdc.gov/streplab/pcr.html for specific PCR protocols).\nThe standard quellung reaction test for serotyping pneumococci can be labor-intensive and time-consuming, and requires a certain level of experience to be performed competently. An agglutination method using anti-rabbit IgG-coated latex particles sensitized to pooled and select individual serotype-specific antisera (PCV7 serotypes: 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F) for serogrouping/serotyping S. pneumoniae has been developed and kits are commercially available. The latex agglutination method is simpler and faster than the quellung reaction, but is only intended for partial serotyping as it can only narrow the identification down to a group or pool of serotypes. Then the quellung reaction should be performed using individual serotype-specific antisera for each serotype in the group or pool to identify the serotype.\nPerforming latex agglutination testing\n- From overnight growth on a BAP, use a sterile loop to prepare a light to moderate cell suspension (approximately equal to a 0.5 McFarland density standard) in 0.5 ml of 0.85% saline.\n- On a glass slide or reaction card, add 10 µl (1 droplet) of the latex reagent and 10 µl of the cell suspension. Mix the two suspensions together.\n- After 10-30 seconds, observe the latex agglutination reaction at an angle with oblique lighting.\nReading the latex agglutination results\n- A positive reaction is indicated by agglutination (cells clumping together) appearing within 5-10 seconds.\n- A negative reaction is indicated by no agglutination appearing within 5-10 seconds.\n- The latex agglutination reaction should be examined within 5-10 seconds. If the reaction time exceeds 30 seconds, false positive reactions may occur.\n- Each lot of latex suspension should be tested for positive agglutination reactions using S. pneumoniae reference strains with known capsular serotypes.\nFor proper quellung-based serotyping, a high quality microscope is required. A positive quellung or Neufeld reaction is the result of the binding of the capsular polysaccharide of pneumococci with type specific antibody contained in the typing antiserum. Pneumococcal typing sera are commercially available as pooled, group, or serotype-specific (see http://www.ssi.dk/English.aspx). It is recommended to initially test with pooled antisera in succession until a positive reaction is observed. Typing should then proceed by testing with individual group and serotype-specific antisera included in the antisera pool that gave a positive reaction to determine the serogroup and serotype. An antigen-antibody reaction causes a change in the refractive index of the capsule so that it appears “swollen” and more visible. After the addition of a counter stain (methylene blue), the pneumococcal cells stain dark blue and are surrounded by a sharply demarcated halo which represents the outer edge of the capsule. The light transmitted through the capsule appears brighter than either the pneumococcal cell or the background. Single cells, pairs, chains, and even clumps of cells may have positive quellung reactions.\nPerforming the quellung reaction\n- From overnight growth on the BAP, use a sterile loop to prepare a light to moderate cell suspension (approximately equal to a 0.5 McFarland density standard) in 0.5 ml of 0.85% saline.\n- Optimum quellung reactions can be observed when there are 25-50 cells visible in a microscopic field at 1000X magnification.\n- Dispense equal amounts of antiserum (5 µl) and methylene blue (5 µl) onto a microscope slide. Add approximately 0.2-1.0 µl of the diluted cell suspension and mix all three with a pipette tip.\n- Cover the suspension with a 22 mm2 square cover-slip and incubate at room temperature (25°C) for 10-15 minutes.\n- Do not allow the fluid on the slide to dry.\n- Examine the slide at 1000X using an oil immersion lens.\n- Begin testing with pooled antisera. Once a positive reaction is obtained, proceed with individual group and serotype-specific antisera included in the pooled antisera that gave the positive reaction to determine the serogroup and serotype.\nReading the quellung reaction results\n- A positive quellung reaction is observed when the capsule appears as a sharply demarcated halo around the dark blue stained cell (Figure 7).\n- A negative quelling reaction is observed when there is no appearance of a clear, enlarged halo surrounding the stained cell.\n- In some instances, observing a positive reaction can be difficult. Prepare and read all quellung reactions on the same day that the cell suspension is prepared.\n- When reading the reactions, look for free floating single or paired cells.\n- Agglutination (cells clumping together) is NOT a positive quellung reaction.\n- If a quellung reaction is not observed in any of the antisera pools, the strain may be non-typeable, but identification of the strain as S. pneumoniae should be confirmed by optochin susceptibility and bile solubility testing.\n- Each lot of antisera received should be tested for positive quellung reactions using S. pneumoniae reference strains with known capsular serotypes.\nDetermining S. pneumoniae capsular serotypes using PCR-based methods\nThe high cost of antisera, subjectivity in interpretation, and technical expertise requirements associated with these serologic methods have resulted in the development of PCR-based serotyping systems. PCR-based serotyping has the potential to overcome some of the difficulties associated with serologic testing and assays for direct detection of serotypes from clinical specimens are a valuable aid in surveillance, particularly in situations where culture is insensitive.\nConventional PCR-based methods have been developed to determine the serotypes of S. pneumoniae specimens. Conventional multiplex PCR assays are available for detecting 40 of the 93 S. pneumoniae serotypes. Schemes for testing based on the strains that are historically and/or currently circulating in specific regions are listed in Chapter 10: PCR Methods. Published real-time PCR serotyping assays are also available for many common pneumococcal serotypes.\nGeneral methods for genotyping S. pneumoniae\nThe continued study of the ""seroepidemiology"" of pneumococcal disease and carriage isolates is important for understanding selective effects upon regional population structures of this species. Trends in pneumococcal carriage and disease epidemiology are influenced by selective factors in the environment, such as the use of antimicrobial drugs and the introduction of conjugate vaccines. Understanding questions related to long-term effects of such pressures on the pneumococcal population require precise isolate characterization using molecular methods to characterize the strains at the genetic level. Chapter 12: Molecular Methods describes some of the most common typing methodologies used to differentiate S. pneumoniae and includes pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and the use of more variable loci such as the penicillin binding protein (pbp) genes and the pneumococcal surface protein (pspA) gene.\n- Page last reviewed: April 1, 2014\n- Page last updated: March 15, 2012\n- Content source:']"	['<urn:uuid:8734b543-0671-4980-aee1-f2729f21eaac>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	26	81	2735
28	I'm tired in the morning. Are eggs good for breakfast?	Hard-boiled eggs are excellent for morning energy as they contain the amino acid tyrosine which boosts alertness. Each egg provides 6 grams of protein for energy, and the yolk contains choline, which supports memory function.	['Whether you struggle to get up in the morning or you fight the afternoon slump a few hours before heading home from work, you know it can be tough to keep your energy up. Instead of reaching for an energy drink, which can be hard on your heart and bad for your body, try looking for natural energy boosters in the food you eat.\nDangers of energy drinks\nAccording to a recent study, drinking a 32-ounce energy drink could cause harmful changes in your heart function and blood pressure in a way that caffeine alone doesn’t. That’s good news for us coffee and tea lovers, but should be a warning for people who look to energy drinks to give them a boost.\nThe study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, states that generally, 400 milligrams of caffeine in a day — about five cups of coffee — is safe. But the average energy drink contains 320 milligrams of caffeine plus four ounces of sugar, multiple B vitamins and other ingredients intended to boost your energy. That’s a lot in one sitting.\nResearchers monitored subjects for 24 hours after they consumed energy drinks via electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). The ECG test showed sometimes life-threatening heartbeat irregularities after subjects drank energy drinks. The same did not happen when they drank a caffeinated beverage alone. Subjects’ blood pressure also normalized far quicker if they consumed caffeine only, rather than an energy drink.\nSo, if you want to protect your heart and prevent potentially life-threatening side effects, steer clear of energy drinks and try some of the following foods instead.\n1. Brown rice\nYou can get 88-percent of your daily value of manganese from one cup of brown rice. This trace mineral helps turn carbohydrates and protein into energy. It’s also an important component of an enzyme called superoxide dismutase, which is found in the powerhouse of cells, the mitochondria. Manganese can not only boost energy but also protect against free radicals in the process.\n2. Sweet potato\nRefined carbohydrates are a no-no when it comes to needing an energy boost; they burn too quickly. But complex carbs like those in sweet potatoes release glucose into the system slower, giving you a slow, steady supply of energy. They’re also rich in nutrients including vitamin C, magnesium, iron and beta-carotene that help keep you energetic throughout the day.\nHoney has a long history of uses for a natural energy boost. Ancient Olympians reportedly used honey to give them more energy before the games. Honey can help prevent muscle fatigue and gives you a long, slow burn of energy thanks to its natural fructose levels.\nCarbohydrates, vitamin C and fiber make bananas a great energy-packed snack. Add some organic peanut butter or almond butter to the snack, and you’ve got a combination of protein and carbohydrates that will carry you through a long afternoon of work.\nJust like Popeye ate spinach before a fight, you might want to nosh on a spinach salad a couple of hours before your workout. Its iron content can help boost your energy. In fact, if you find yourself lacking energy on a regular basis, it might be due to an iron deficiency, although you should talk to your doctor about that before jumping to any conclusions. Spinach can help keep those iron — and energy — levels where they should be.\nThe fiber content in beans makes them a great source of sustained energy. Since fiber takes longer to digest than other nutrients, it helps extend the energy production of the carbohydrates in beans. Magnesium in beans also helps the body to relax and restore energy, according to dietitians Lyssie Lakatos and Tammy Lakatos Shames.\nAlmonds contain manganese, magnesium, vitamin B2, vitamin E and phosphorus, among other nutrients. Magnesium helps the body produce energy from food and supports the immune system. The fiber and protein in almonds also help keep blood sugar levels stable, meaning you’ll avoid a sugar crash after your snack. They can also help keep you feeling full for longer, reducing the heavy feeling that too much food can give you.\nDehydration can sap your energy levels quickly, so foods with high water content — like melon — can help you stay hydrated, especially during warmer months. In fact, watermelon is about 90-percent water, making it a great way to keep hydrated and energized.\nHard-boiled eggs contain the amino acid tyrosine, which boosts alertness. There’s also six grams of protein per egg, which helps with energy levels. Not only that, but the egg yolk contains choline, a nutrient that supports memory function. With so many great energy and memory-boosting nutrients, eggs are one of the best ways to start the day off if you’re sluggish in the morning.\nHeart-healthy and great for your brain, walnuts provide the body with incredible levels of omega-3 fatty acids. Healthy fats help boost your energy level so they can give you a nice pick-me-up when you need it.\nWhat is your favorite energy-boosting food on our list?\n— Megan Winkler']	['<urn:uuid:0e30b362-b8e7-4085-bab7-8ebfbfbac31f>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	10	35	842
29	how decide if need pesticides garden	Applications of pesticides should never be made based solely on a calendar schedule, but only after monitoring indicates a pest presence and a threshold of damage has been met, or is likely to be met. Action or damage thresholds help guard against applying pesticides unnecessarily because any damage being caused by an actual pest that could be controlled by a pesticide may simply be tolerated if it does not exceed the established threshold.	['Pest and Symptom Identification\nIdentification of the pest species or plant disease is vital for decisions regarding control measures, if any, including proper material selection and application rates. Before a pesticide is applied, a determination must be made if the damage observed is actually being caused by a pest and not an abiotic (non-living) factor such as over-watering, chemical damage or sunburn. If a pest is identified as having caused the observed damage, a qualified person will decide if the timing is appropriate for a pesticide application. In other words, is the pest that caused the damage already gone for some reason or has it entered a life stage where pesticides would not prevent any further damage. An Agricultural Commissioner/Weights and Measures (ACWM) Entomologist, Plant Pathologist and/or Certified Arborist are available to provide an identification of the actual cause of any observed damage and assist with a determination if a pesticide application will help.\nACWM operates entomology and plant pathology laboratories capable of providing rapid and accurate identification of insects and other invertebrates (snails, slugs, spiders and mites) as well as diagnosis of plant diseases. The two labs process over 8,000 pest specimens annually for Los Angeles County residents, schools, governmental agencies, growers, plant nurseries, and pest control operators.\nSpecimens can be taken directly to the labs (call first) or mailed in. When mailing a specimen, careful handling is required. Appendix I has information on how to properly submit a specimen invertebrate or plant disease sample by mail. Appendix H contains resources and contact information for County departments seeking assistance with identification of potential weed or vertebrate pests (mammals and birds).\nRegular Pest Surveys\nRegular surveys allow you to detect damage in the early stages and then do something about it before a pesticide application may become necessary. If detected early enough, damage can be pruned out, or changes made to the habitat, to cultural practices, etc. Once pest populations get high, management options can become limited. Regular surveys result in a familiarity with the local landscape environment allowing more precise determinations of pest control methods/ timing, or if any is needed at all.\nAction Thresholds and Guidelines\nApplications of pesticides should never be made based solely on a calendar schedule, but only after monitoring indicates a pest presence and a threshold of damage has been met, or is likely to be met. Action or damage thresholds help guard against applying pesticides unnecessarily because any damage being caused by an actual pest that could be controlled by a pesticide may simply be tolerated if it does not exceed the established threshold. Don’t forget that sometimes damage can even be managed at a tolerable level by selective pruning as previously described. The sidebar on this page outlines a pre-application decision making process that summarizes much of what has been discussed in this section.\nThe use of this process is required for any outdoor application of a pesticide at a facility owned or managed by Los Angeles County\nA persistent or reoccurring problem requiring multiple pesticide applications suggests a weak point in a facility’s IPM plan. These situations should be examined by an ACWM biologist or other qualified person who may recommend changes in landscaping (pest tolerant species), better exclusion or other changes in management strategy.\nSound Management Methods\nManagement methods for pests should integrate the range of available and effective options including cultural, physical, mechanical, chemical, and biological. The following is a brief description of each:\nCultural control is modifying or changing the environment, or the way something is done (the practices) in an attempt to make an area less attractive to pests, or less likely the pests will find what they need to thrive. Cultural control includes changing from overhead watering to drip irrigation, appropriate plant pruning and fertilizing, and removing bird feeders to make an area less attractive to rats.\nThese are usually control measures that directly kill or remove pests. They include things like using steam or hand-pulling to kill weeds, trapping for rodents and pruning out infested plant foliage.\nChemical control means using a pesticide to control, prevent or repel pests. Pesticides include: insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, rodenticides and other chemicals like many household cleaners/sanitizers.\nBiological control is when natural enemies of pests maintain the pests’ population levels below a damage threshold. In some agricultural areas, biological control agents are actually purchased and released onto a crop. In urban Los Angeles County, biological control will most often mean protecting, conserving and augmenting natural enemies that are already occurring in the area.\nThe following sections contain pest management information for some of Los Angeles County’s common vertebrate, invertebrate, weed and disease pests. In addition to management methods, the sections also contain information on the other components of a successful IPM Program, which, in case you forgot, are Prevention, Pest Identification, Surveys and Thresholds/Guidelines. It is not possible to cover every pest, or pest scenario, in this document. However, managers of County facilities needing additional help are encouraged to utilize the resources in the Appendix Section or to contact an ACWM biologist for support.\nPre-Pesticide Application Decision-making Process\nIs a pest really causing a problem?\nAre the number of pests and the amount of damage they are causing intolerable?\nWould a pesticide be effective?\nAre the conditions that caused the pest activity likely to stay the same leading to a bigger problem?\nAre there any nonchemical methods that can be used to manage the pest or change the environment to prevent pest problems in the future?']	['<urn:uuid:dbfac291-b66f-4d1b-9ba3-806416175a80>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	6	73	916
30	pax6 dna mutation inheritance pattern	Aniridia is caused by a mutation in the PAX6 gene on chromosome 11. In 2/3 of cases, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, requiring only one abnormal gene from either parent. In 1/3 of cases, the mutation occurs spontaneously. Rarely, it can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, requiring two abnormal copies.	['What Is Aniridia?\nAniridia is a genetic based condition, caused by a mutation in the PAX6 gene on chromosome 11:\n2/3 of people with aniridia inherit it in an autosomal dominant fashion, meaning that an individual has to inherit only one abnormal gene, from either parent, in order to manifest the disease.\n1/3 of people with aniridia, the genetic mutation is sporadic, meaning that it is not inherited from either parent, but developed spontaneously in the person.\nRarely, aniridia can be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, meaning that an individual has to inherit two abnormal copies of the gene, one from each parent, in order to exhibit the disorder. These individuals may also have other symptoms, including ataxia (problems with balance and movement) and cognitive disabilities.\nAniridia and Wilms’ Tumor Development\nRoughly 30% of persons with sporadic aniridia can have WAGR syndrome. Wilms’ tumor is an uncommon kidney based cancer that primarily affects Younger people. WAGR is an acronym for a list of conditions that commonly occur together in this syndrome:\nW: Wilms’ tumor\nG: Genitourinary abnormalities, i.e. abnormalities in the reproductive and/or urinary organs\nR: Mental Retardation\nTherefore, it is important for your eye doctor to evaluate your family history if you have aniridia. If you have sporadic aniridia, regular ultrasounds are necessary to screen for Wilms’ tumor.\nHow Does Aniridia Affect the Eyes?\nAniridia is named for its effects upon the iris. This disorder can involves global functioning of many structures of the eye, most of which can impair vision.\nThe effects of aniridia can vary significantly from person to person. Some individuals exhibit only mild effects from the disorder, while others have profound ocular abnormalities:\nSome persons have only minimal underdevelopment of the iris that is barely noticeable to the untrained eye, while others have partial absence of the iris, and still others have total absence of the iris. Even in persons with “total” absence of the iris, there is usually a very rudimentary iris tissue remnant that can be seen during a careful eye examination under the microscope.\nLight Sensitivity (Photophobia)\nSince the iris helps block and absorb some of the light entering the eye, people with aniridia may be very light sensitive (photophobic) and report symptoms of glare.\nEither abnormal development of the angle (the area of the eye responsible for draining aqueous fluid from the eye), blockage of the angle from the rudimentary iris stump, or narrowing of the angle can lead to glaucoma.\nPeople with aniridia may have a deficiency in the limbal stem cells. These are stem cells that arise in the limbus. The limbus is an area at the border of the conjunctiva, which is the thin translucent tissue over the white surface of the eye, and the cornea, the transparent dome-shaped tissue that forms the front part of your eye, through which you can see the colored iris. These stem cells are responsible for maintaining the health and integrity of the cornea.\nAs a result of a deficiency in the limbal stem cells, the conjunctiva can grow over the cornea, the cornea cannot heal easily from injuries or scratches, and the cornea ultimately can undergo scarring or vascularization (growth of abnormal blood vessels into the normally clear cornea). These corneal changes can impair vision.\nLens Abnormalities (Crystalline)\nRetinal Developmental Problems\nIndividuals with aniridia often have foveal hypoplasia, meaning underdevelopment of macula lutea, which is the part of the retina responsible for fine visual acuity; they may also have hypoplasia of the optic nerve, which transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. “Hypoplasia” is a term that refers to a deficiency or underdevelopment of a tissue or body structure.\nInfants with aniridia may exhibit abnormal, involuntary, rapid side-to-side or up-and-down movements of the eyes called nystagmus.\nHow Is Aniridia Treated?\nSince aniridia can affect the eyes in a multitude of ways, aniridia treatment is similarly multifaceted:\nOpaque or colored contact lenses can give the appearance of an iris to improve one’s appearance, or for cosmetic purposes, as well as to improve vision and minimize glare/photophobia.\nAbsorptive sunglasses can also help with symptoms of photophobia and glare.\nSome individuals also may be candidates for surgical placement of an artificial iris, though this procedure may be associated with complications.\nLubrication with artificial tears can help maintain the health of the cornea.\nSignificant corneal disease may require more aggressive surgery, including transplants and/or stem cell transplantation to replace some of the missing stem cells.\nIndividuals who have cataracts may require surgery to remove the cataract.\nPeople with aniridia should be monitored closely for glaucoma and those who develop it should be treated accordingly, with medications, lasers, and/or surgery.']	['<urn:uuid:6d764903-dbad-437c-998d-458046aa8cd6>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	5	55	777
31	whats difference multiculturalism vs interculturalism meaning	Multiculturalism is the ideology that all cultures and civilizations are of equal value and should be treated equally within a nation. In contrast, interculturalism is a political ideology that develops a common civic culture based on Western values of freedom, liberty, and human rights, while encouraging interaction between communities in the same country. Unlike multiculturalism, interculturalism requires democracy and full respect for universal human rights.	"['Development Cooperation Handbook/Definitions/Interculturalism\nInterculturalism is the philosophy of exchanges between cultural groups within a society.\nVarious states have intercultural policies which seek to encourage the socialization of citizens of different origins. These policies are often ostensibly used as an instrument to fight racism.\nInterculturalism requires an inherent openness to be exposed to the culture of the ""other"". Once a person is exposed to an element of a different culture, a dialogue will ensue, where everyone embarks upon understanding the culture of the other, and usually this involves comparisons. Thus, interculturalism breeds dialogue, in order to be able to look for commonalities between that element of one\'s culture and the culture of the other.\nInterculturalism seeks to enhance fusion by looking for commonalities. Hence, various cultures merge. The differences that remain make up the subcultures of the world.\nWithin a country, a distinction can be drawn between interculturalism and multiculturalism. Indeed, multiculturalism is the ideology that postulates that all cultures and civilizations are of equal value and should be treated and promoted equally within the same nation. It is often confused with political pluralism, and with ethnic and linguistic diversity, or with interculturalism.\nInterculturalism is a political ideology that does not place a priority for all cultures to be on the same level as a basis to organize a given society. Its main objective is rather to develop a common civic culture based on the values of freedom and liberty, and of human rights, as derived from the Western civilization, while encouraging interaction between the communities living in the same country. As such, Interculturalism requries democracy and full respect for universal human rights (whereas multiculturalism explicitly doesn\'t know this requirement).\nInterculturalism promotes individual rights for everyone, with no discrimination. This means, in particular, that people have the right to maintain an affiliation with one\'s ethnic group and the right for cultural and religious differences to be displayed in the public domain. However, the entire society must adhere to the same constitution of fundamental rights and obligations, with no exception. It does not accept that cultural differences are used as an excuse to reduce the rights of certain groups. This approach leads to an ethics of maximum tolerance for an individual\'s choices and of minimum tolerance for totalitarian and theocratic systems of ideas that could undermine the very foundations of a democratic society.\nIntercultural education cannot be just a simple ‘add on’ to the regular curriculum. It needs to concern the learning environment as a whole, as well as other dimensions of educational processes, such as school life and decision making, teacher education and training, curricula, languages of instruction, teaching methods and student interactions, and learning materials. This can be done through the inclusion of multiple perspectives and voices. The development of inclusive curricula that contain learning about the languages, histories and cultures of non-dominant groups in society is one important example.\nThe distinct aims of Intercultural Education can be summarized under the headings of ‘the four pillars of education’ as identifi ed by the International Commission on Education for the Twenty-First Century. According to the conclusions of the Commission, education should be broadly based on the pillars of:\n1. Learning to know, by “combining suffi ciently broad general knowledge with the opportunity to work in-depth on a small number of projects”. The Commission further states that “a general education brings a person into contact with other languages and areas of knowledge, and… makes communication possible”; these results of a general education represent some of the fundamental skills to be transmitted through intercultural education.\n2. Learning to do, in order to “acquire not only an occupational skill but also, more broadly, the competence to deal with many situations and to work in teams.24” In the national and international context, learning to do also includes the acquisition of necessary competencies that enable the individual to find a place in society.\n3. Learning to live together, by “developing an understanding of other people and an appreciation of interdependence – carrying out joint projects and learning to manage confl icts – in a spirit of respect for the values of pluralism, mutual understanding… peace” and cultural diversity. In short, the learner needs to acquire knowledge, skills and values that contribute to a spirit of solidarity and co-operation among diverse individuals and groups in society.\n4. Learning to be, “so as to better develop one’s personality and be able to act with ever greater autonomy, judgement and personal responsibility. In that respect, education must not disregard any aspect of a person’s potential…” such as his or her cultural potential, and it must be based on the right to difference. These values strengthen a sense of identity and personal meaning for the learner, as well as benefiting their cognitive capacity.']"	['<urn:uuid:c6d0f897-08f5-413d-8bff-db406fdcb416>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	6	65	793
32	how do neighborhood protests affect policy change and public debate transparency	Local neighborhood protests can effectively influence policy, with around 45% of cases resulting in either project abandonment (29%) or significant modifications (16%). However, their success depends on having proper civil society infrastructure and activist networks. For public debate to be legitimate and effective, transparency is essential - initiators and participants must disclose their aims, interests and funding sources. At the same time, rules like 'Chatham House Rule' may be needed to allow people to express opinions without fear while maintaining transparency about the process itself.	"['What is the opposite of an activist\nBy Anna Zhelnina (Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg)\nThe myth of Russians\' political passivity is surprisingly long-lived, despite ample evidence to the contrary, both nationally and locally. The article deals with local activism in the big cities of Russia. This type of activism receives less attention in the national media, but it is precisely the attempts of city dwellers to shape their lives together on site and in the renovation, redesign or redevelopment of urban areas that are central to the sustainability of civil society Play a role in demanding that their interests be safeguarded. By participating in local initiatives, city dwellers acquire new skills; in addition, they create new political identities and social connections.\nProtests often have an urban character\nUrban social movements occupy a strange place in political science and sociology. They are popular as a research project, but scientists do not always take their urban character into account. Sometimes they consider local protests to be insufficiently ""political"" or too minor. At the same time, the fact that these movements and initiatives arise from the everyday life of city dwellers: inside or because of urban spaces that are literally not far from one\'s own home and city centers, has a considerable influence on the mobilization potential, on their composition as well as on the character of them social and political consequences.\nStudies on urban social movements in different national and cultural contexts regularly provide evidence that city dwellers learn to use instruments of citizen participation, especially in the format of specific local initiatives, and to build activist networks that remain active after the end of the respective conflict; they also develop new political identities and contexts of meaning. In the context of authoritarian regimes, where political participation carries a number of risks, local activism may be the only acceptable format in which citizens can make their demands. City dwellers can perceive local conflicts as being forced upon them because the mobilization often results from questions that are embedded in everyday life and that evoke strong emotional reactions. Finally, the civil society skills and contacts that are gained in the course of urban conflicts can be transferred to other policy areas and thus form the basis for civil society infrastructures.\nUrban conflict occupies a prominent place among the movements and protests in Russia. According to calculations by political scientist Andrei Semyonov, urban issues are the most common reason why Russians are collectively active. They mobilize even more than economic and socio-political problems or questions of the political regime. The team of the research project ""Mechanisms of the reconciliation of interests in processes of urban space development"" (http://urbanconflictsrussia.ru/) has identified over 8,000 conflicts in connection with urban space development on the basis of a specially created collection of media publications from the years 2012 to 2016. Among these conflicts, protests by the urban population against infrastructure projects (24%), against densely populated buildings (23%) and the construction of recreational areas (21%) were particularly frequent, which together account for two thirds of the cases we analyzed.\nIn most of the cases of disagreement and protests, the conflicts concerned areas associated with everyday urban life and part of the urban population\'s environment (residential and recreational areas, and places for trade and services). What is special about many of these social movements is that they attract people who have no experience of civil society resistance, who appear for the first time as actors in the political field and who set up new networks of activists and create a new repertoire of instruments for political debate.\nFormal and informal civil society infrastructures\nCivic participation, which also includes collective action on the occasion of urban development measures, not only requires motivation on the part of the citizens, but also a certain infrastructure, namely rules, resources and platforms for interaction, with the help of which the actors can try to achieve their goals. The infrastructures through which the urban population is involved in negotiation and decision-making processes can be described as civil society infrastructures.\nAccording to Russian legislation, the citizens of the country have a whole range of formal, legally anchored instruments of participation at their disposal, which can be described as formal civil society infrastructure. These include elections, participation in voluntary organizations, municipal self-administration, self-organization and cooperation between homeowners, participatory budgeting, etc. Recent studies on civil society show that the formal structures are supplemented or even supplemented by informal networks and relationship structures of civil society self-organization - i.e. by informal civil society infrastructure be completely replaced. This includes informal associations, networks of friends and acquaintances, which nonetheless concentrate on the creation and preservation of a certain common good. An important element of the informal infrastructure are the citizens themselves - activists and those who support them - who have a certain view of their place in city administration and a vision of their rights and opportunities to influence their surroundings .\nThe formal and the informal civil society infrastructure are not opposed to each other, but rather represent a mutual prerequisite for their respective functioning. Thus, Russian legislation provides for the possibility of so-called territorial social self-government (Russian: territorialnye obschtschestvennyje objedinenija, TOS), which have a fairly wide range of decision-making powers at local level. However, these formal legal provisions do not work with full force and do not allow all powers and possibilities inherent in them to be realized unless they are underpinned by informal connections in the urban population. Because they are embedded in a political context that is characterized by a lack of social trust and distrust of the authorities. In addition, a formally anchored and compulsory element in urban development measures such as the public hearing is often only held in order to ""tick off"" it, namely without the residents being fully informed.\nHowever, even such formalistic stages can be filled with meaning by mobilizing the urban population and their activity. This allows activists to prepare and turn a formal process such as a public hearing on a controversial project into an important public action that attracts media attention and creates the emotions necessary to mobilize and retain new followers . This also applies if decisions of the public hearing should only have the character of recommendations.\nAnother example of a more harmonious, mutual enrichment and underpinning of the formal and informal infrastructure of citizen participation is the strongly developing instrument of participatory budgeting. This form of citizen participation has been formally anchored in many countries on the initiative of grassroots movements. In Russia, especially in St. Petersburg, urban activists who have experience in formulating demands or implementing urban projects are recruited to develop and anchor the ideas behind participatory budgeting.\nDifferences between cities\nA large part of the formal instruments for civic participation in Russia is regulated by legislation at the federal level, for example the urban development and housing codes that apply in all regions of the country. In every city, however, unique configurations of actors and platforms emerge on which cooperation for urban development develops. Each city has its own configuration of informal relationships and civil society infrastructures, which can have a significant impact on the way city policies are pursued and conflicts in the city are resolved.\nAs part of the research project ""Mechanisms for the reconciliation of interests in processes of urban space development"", the situation in six Russian cities with over a million inhabitants was analyzed, namely in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Samara and Novosibirsk, in addition to the statistical recording of urban conflicts. An in-depth analysis of media reports and interviews with those who were involved in urban conflicts (both with activists and with representatives of the administration and of urban development companies) have allowed us to identify the specific outline of the urban in each of the six cities to recognize political arena.\nOne of the interesting features of the transformation processes in each of the cities is related to the respective initiators: inside controversial projects. In Moscow, for example, in 23 of the 44 cases we analyzed, the projects that led to the protests were promoted by bureaucrats. At the same time, most of the conflicts examined in St. Petersburg revolved around corporate projects (27 out of 44). In Moscow, the proximity of the central budget and the decision-making centers had an impact on the dimensions of the projects and the aggressiveness with which the initiators proceeded. In this case we can speak of the well-known phenomenon that entrepreneurial structures grow together with the authorities. This configuration of strong actors who drive a project forward makes the work of activists very difficult or even completely blocks any attempts by the population to influence the course of events in any way. Experienced Moscow activists often mentioned this constellation in the interviews, emphasizing that corruption and informal agreements by the Moscow bureaucrats greatly reduce the activists\' chances of success. Interestingly, this topic was raised less often in St. Petersburg, as there representatives of the administration appeared less frequently as the main initiators of controversial projects. Of course, we cannot rule out an informal interest on the part of bureaucrats in projects there.\nThe difference between the entanglement of bureaucrats in urban transformation projects in Moscow and in St. Petersburg creates an important context for attempts by activists to influence the course of events. In Moscow it is much more difficult to oppose the representatives of the bureaucracy: According to our data, the majority of the projects initiated or supported by bureaucrats are being implemented unchanged. Our interlocutors also said that it is easier in Moscow with builders who enter into a dialogue with local activists and MPs than with representatives of the city authorities, who are practically deaf in the opinion of the local population. In comparison, projects in St. Petersburg that were pushed forward by bureaucrats have been abandoned or heavily modified in several cases due to demands from citizens.\nConsequences of mobilization\nIn addition to the myth of the passivity of the Russians, there is also the notion that protests in Russia are pointless and ineffective. However, our data show that local protests can produce results, namely abandoning or at least significantly modifying a controversial project (in around half of the cases). In 30 percent of the cases analyzed, the announced project, which had caused public displeasure, was implemented unchanged, and in a further 13 percent of the cases minor changes were made. At the same time, projects were completely abandoned in 29 percent of the cases and significantly changed in 16 percent of the cases (e.g. relocated to another location, changed in the planned height, etc.).\nThis is also where the difference between the different urban contexts can be seen. If we compare Moscow and St. Petersburg, on the other hand, we can see that the urban protests in St. Petersburg have achieved something more often than those in the capital. In Petersburg half of the projects were abandoned, another third was modified. In Moscow, the situation is reversed: Almost half of the projects here were implemented unchanged. One of the possible explanations lies in the amount of resources, including financial ones, that are used in refurbishment or development projects. Also relevant here is the fact that the officials in Moscow have strong levers of power and that actors at the federal level are also involved in the transformation projects in the capital.\nBut the characteristics of civil society actors should not be ignored either. Our analysis shows that the peculiarities of the civil society infrastructure are also important. An interesting peculiarity of the protests in St. Petersburg was that they were often joined by a broad coalition of actors during the period we examined: representatives of various social organizations and activist networks come together to form the protesters to support a concrete dispute, to bring them together with influential MPs who are involved in these networks, and to point the direction of action. In Moscow, residents are more likely to act independently or, at best, seek the help of committed activists among the local MPs.\nOne can assume that there is a special history of the defense of the urban structure in St. Peterburg, which has created the basis for a lively and committed civil society infrastructure. This includes long, extensive protests against the demolition of historic buildings and new buildings in the city center, but also the connections between people and public resources that beginning activists can use, for example groups and pages in social networks. In the cases we examined in St. Petersburg - the struggle against the development of Malinovka Park, against the demolition of substation No. 11 (»Blokadnaya podanziya«), The conflict over the Westtangente (a toll motorway) - the most important activists knew each other before the protests, which accelerated the mobilization and facilitated cooperation. In addition, experienced activists and experts challenge controversial urban development projects without the participation of the ""ordinary"" local population, especially in the area of preserving the historical heritage.\nIn Nizhny Novgorod, the presence of a dense network of activists and experts who stand up for the preservation of the historical heritage in the city enables them to react quickly to emerging threats to the historical building fabric. However, in Nizhny Novgorod, the protection of historical buildings from demolition - unlike the much sensational ecological problems - does not always meet with the same understanding and support from the ""ordinary"" population; without this support, even the work of such active, committed civil society networks will be made more difficult. Discourses, ideas, values and other elements of worldview are also a necessary instrument for civic participation. In contrast to St. Petersburg, where there is widespread awareness of the value of historical heritage, activists in Nizhny Novgorod have emphasized in talks, that the residents of their city see historical buildings more as ""clutter"" than as values.\nAll of these characteristics - the existence of activist networks, public platforms for the exchange of news and experiences, the course of certain values and ideas in urban discourse - are of fundamental importance for the success of urban social movements. However, they are also a potential result of local initiatives. Whenever there is a mobilization, even if the protesters do not achieve their immediate goals, that changes a lot: those involved get to know each other, meet experienced activists and sympathetic politicians and find out which approaches are more or less effective .It is also important that in the course of mobilization new values, ideas and social and political identities can be developed.\nThrough these effects of participating in a joint approach, even unsuccessful actions can lay the foundation for a more effective approach in the future. Activists usually emphasize the importance of those defining moments that mark a turning point for them. For example, our interlocutors in Moscow said that an example of such a turning point was the active and successful fight against the dismantling of the Shukhov Tower in 2014. He had shown the authorities and construction companies that an attack on objects of historical heritage can turn into a protracted and resource-guzzling struggle with the citizens.\nIf one looks at the development of urban activism in the cities of Russia, one can see a gradual increase in civil society infrastructure: experience and knowledge in the ranks of activists, activist networks and social organizations have increased. Values and discourses have emerged that are essential for citizens to participate in urban politics. In addition, a protest activity in the city has an influence on the behavior of the authorities, who then start planning urban development, taking into account the potential for resistance based on previous experience. Sometimes formal and informal civil society infrastructures ""meet"" and complement each other in a conflict-free way. More often, however, the people in the city have to do a lot of work and fight for their rights in order to be heard.\nThe contribution is based on materials from the research project ""Mechanisms for the reconciliation of interests in urban space development processes"" (http://urbanconflictsrussia.ru/).\nTranslation from Russian: Hartmut Schröder\n- There are enough jobs for everyone\n- What is the meaning of love life\n- What\'s the hardest part about growing up\n- How many countries did Britain create\n- Social anxiety makes you flat\n- What are the types of internet advertising\n- How does King Solomon relate to Freemasonry?\n- Where was Louis XVI.

The effectiveness of public debate activities An organised activity, delimited in scope, intended to stimulate and to attend to public debate on a specific theme in the expectation that it will inform or influence policy development or governance. cannot be assured by design alone but requires them to be conducted in accordance with principles of procedural justice.\nProcedural measures can help to counteract imbalances or inequalities among those involved, including those participating in and those initiating or sponsoring public debate activities.\nIdentifying or setting out principles of conduct to be observed in a public debate activity can help to increase transparency and support accountability.\nRespect for all participants may involve paying special attention or taking special steps to encourage and enable the participation of certain groups, and to ensure that all voices are given a fair hearing, including those expressing contrary or unorthodox views. It is important that the focus in a public debate should be the issue to be debated and not on the person debating it.\nIn particular, respect for ethnic, cultural, religious and socio-demographic differences, and the equal entitlement of all participants to have their views taken into account should be ensured. Demonstrating respect and fairness encourages trust in the initiative.\nModeration or independent, impartial and skilled facilitation can help to ensure that all participants have a fair opportunity for their views to be heard, regardless of social, political, educational and economic differences.\nThe personal, lived experiences of individuals can offer important insights alongside data and factual evidence. Individuals may find their personal experiences relevant to public debate and may wish to share them with others. It is important that debate offers a ‘safe space’ in which to do so. Respecting privacy by protecting the anonymity of participants might be important, for example to protect participants from media intrusion. This may, in any case, be a legal requirement of data protection law.\nThe participation of some individuals may expose them to vulnerability, stigmatisation, discrimination or even direct harm. This can be particularly important to consider where an activity involves the participation of children and young people. Many biomedical developments raise issues that impact disproportionately across differences of gender, age and health status or disability, which entails a risk of compounding structural inequalities if disadvantaged groups cannot participate fairly in debating them.\nWhere the participation of particular groups or individuals affected by a proposed measure is important, and direct involvement poses a threat to their privacy, alternative means of enabling participation should be considered. For example, this can be done by video link, through trusted intermediaries or by written submissions. If participation from particularly affected individuals requires anonymity, the legitimacy of the process could be maintained for example through independent assurance.\nIt is necessary to consider the potential for conflict between the importance of transparency and the need to protect the privacy of individuals participating in a public debate.\nIt might be appropriate to engage different publics separately where, for structural or contingent reasons, certain subgroups cannot participate on an equal footing with others.\nA rule like the ‘Chatham House Rule’ (that information received may be subsequently disclosed so long as neither the identity of the information provider nor of any other participant is revealed) may allow people engaging in public debate to express opinions without fear of negative consequences for doing so. If this is to apply it should be agreed at the outset and credibly enforced.\nTransparency of interests\nTransparency is an important aspect of fairness. Initiators The person who takes the initiative in a public debate activity. The initiator will usually provide or co-ordinate the resources for the activity and may commission specialists to facilitate or deliver the activity on their behalf. and participants alike should be transparent about their aims and interests in sponsoring or participating in public debate, and about the sources of any funding. Because of their interests, it is often appropriate for sponsors of initiatives to separate themselves or to involve independent professionals to conduct public debate activities on their behalf.\nRelevant interests are not limited to public interests. Personal interests should also be taken into account and be declared, as hidden personal interests of participants, experts or stakeholders can undermine trust and the credibility of the outcome of the public debate. Having an interest in the issue at hand should not, however, prevent involvement. On the contrary, it is a reason for involvement. However, on matters of public interest, it should not entail privileged influence.\nInitiators, experts, sponsors and participants should disclose any relevant interests they have in the initiative or its outcome. This might be done when introducing themselves to others for the first time or, in the case of experts by a written declaration of interest.\nIt is important that people participate candidly and in good faith, rather than manipulating public debates for private interest. This is particularly important where questions of scientific fact and evidence are relied on in public debate and when expert testimony is involved. The use of clear, non-technical and unambiguous language is desirable to avoid misunderstanding. Those offering expert evidence should explain any uncertainties and limits of technical knowledge. Honesty about sources is important.

33	tight knitter looking for proper gauge and needle size recommendations for worsted and dk yarn	For worsted yarns, the recommended needle size range is 7 to 9, which typically yields 4.5 to 5 stitches per inch. Using size 8 needles with worsted yarn usually gives you 4.5 stitches per inch. If this seems too loose, you can switch to size 7. For DK yarn weight, needle sizes 5 to 6 work best. If you want tighter knits, you can use a smaller needle like size 4. It's recommended to only scale down one needle size at a time, as going down two or three sizes can result in fabric that's too tight or small. Finding your comfortable gauge may require making test swatches, and you don't always need to follow the standard gauge as long as you track your project size.	['In knitting, the gauge is a crucial factor. It determines the number of stitches and rows you need to make per inch. This depends on the yarn weight or size and the needle size you use. Most knitting patterns give you the appropriate gauge to use. This is to ensure that you achieve the right size and drape of the project.\nIf you use small knitting needles, you often get smaller and tighter stitches. This is even more obvious when you use small needles on big yarns. There is no strict rule in gauge, especially if you are not using a pattern.\nSeasoned knitters use the needle size and yarn according to their preference. But for novice knitters, it is still best to use the right gauge in your needles and yarns. This is to make sure you get to finish the project according to your expected outcome.\nThere are important key points to keep in mind when using small needles.\n- Small needles tend to create smaller stitches regardless of your yarn weight.\n- Using small needles make tighter and denser fabric.\n- Knitting with small needles makes stiffer and warmer fabric.\n- Small needles use less yarn because of its smaller stitches.\n- If you are a novice knitter and following a pattern, make sure to follow it to a tee. If you do not use the prescribed gauge, your finished product will be different from that of the pattern. Say you use smaller needles than the prescribed ones. Expect that your finished project will be smaller.\n- Using small knitting needles on heavy yarn creates a fabric with less drapability.\nKnitting gauge does not prohibit you from using smaller needles. You still have the option to do so. The gauge only serves as your guide on what needle to use per needle size.\nBut if you want denser and stiffer fabric, you may opt to use a size smaller than the suggested gauge. What you need to ensure is the size of your finished project. See to it that you make the necessary adjustment with your cast on.\nList of Contents:\n- How Does Needle Size Affect Knitting?\n- What Happens If You Knit With Two Different Size Needles?\n- How Do You Knit With Small Needles?\n- Do Smaller Knitting Needles Use Less Yarn?\n- What Knitting Needles Are Best For Beginners?\n- What Is The Smallest Size Knitting Needle?\n- Is It Easier To Knit With Big Or Small Needles?\n- Does Using Larger Knitting Needles Use Less Yarn?\nHow Does Needle Size Affect Knitting?\nMost knitting patterns prescribe the needle size and yarn you need. These details allow you to finish the design looking like a complete replica of the pattern. This means your finish project will have the same size, look, and texture as described in the pattern.\nThese factors are the reason why you need to use the right gauge for your knitting. Using the wrong needle size to your pattern can result in difficulties. It can lead to the wrong size or length of your finished project.\nThese are the three effects of needles size to your knitting.\n- The garment or fabric will not fit.\n- You will either run out of yarn or have leftovers.\n- Your finished project might not look as pictured in the pattern.\nIf you use smaller needles, your finished design will be smaller than expected. Say the pattern asked you to use needle size 11, but you rather use a 10.5. This will make your finished project smaller than what you expect.\nEven if you use the yarn and you follow the number of cast-on specified in the pattern, your output is smaller. Keep in mind that a smaller needle size creates smaller and tighter stitches.\nThe opposite effect happens when you use bigger needles. Say you use size 13. Your finished project will be bigger and looser because your stitches are bigger.\nStill related to the example mentioned above. Say you use a smaller needle for the project. Your project will be smaller and so you will have leftover yarns.\nMeanwhile, if you use bigger needles, you will have a bigger fabric. This will mean you might run out of yarn to complete the pattern.\nIf you deviate from the pattern, your completed project is a bit different from the pattern. The size, texture, and drape are not the same as described or pictured in the pattern.\nIf you are using a pattern, make sure you follow its recommendations. In case you want to deviate, make sure you know how to adjust either the yarn weight or the length of the design. This can be tricky for beginners. So, if you are a novice knitter, stick to following the pattern first.\nWhat Happens If You Knit With Two Different Size Needles?\nKnitting with two different needle sizes often refers to Condo Knitting. This is simple yet unique. Both seasoned and novice knitters can do this technique. This creates lacy look stitches that are loose and drapey.\nIf you are going to use this technique, make sure to cast-on with the small needle. Then, use the large needle to knit every stitch. This technique is like doing a Garter stitch but with 2 different needle sizes.\nThere are two important factors to consider if you want to use this technique.\n- Compatible needle sizes\n- Compatible needle sizes\nWhen doing this Condo Knitting, use a soft yarn. It is also advisable to use thin or medium weight yarns. This will give your fabric that soft and drapey finish. If you want to use chunky yarns, make sure your needles are both on the bigger sizes.\nThis technique calls for two different needle sizes. This means you will have to use straight needles. There is no specific pairing for this.\nYou may need to test your chosen needles on your yarn and see if they give your preferred stitches. For instance, you may pair needle size 7 and size 19 needles. Check if the combination works well with your yarn.\nThis technique works on soft drapey shawls, scarves, and loose cardigans.\nHow Do You Knit With Small Needles?\nAs explained in the previous chapters, the gauge is important in knitting. Whether you are following a pattern or not, you will have to figure the gauge that works well for you.\nIf you are a tight knitter you may need to use smaller needles to achieve your desired fabric tightness. If you want to create loose and drapey fabrics then bigger needles will help you achieve this.\nEven if you have a pattern, it does not mean you cannot tweak it. You may use your preferred yarn weight or needle size. The gauge indicated in the pattern is only a recommendation. You still have the option to use your desired gauge.\nWhat you need to remember is that worsted, chunky, and bulky yarns work on bigger needles. The fingering, DK, and other thin yarns work well on small needles. If you are going to use worsted yarns, use a needle size range of 7 to 9.\nThis needle size range can give you around 4.5 to 5 stitches per inch. If you use size 8 on worsted yarn, you are likely to get 4.5 stitches per inch. When this seems too loose for you then switch to size 7.\nThis will not create a drastic change in your design. The key is to either scale up or down to one size only. You tend to have too small or too tight fabric if you scale down your needle to two or three sizes.\nFor DK yarn weight, the needle size range of 5 to 6 works best. Again, if you use a smaller size needle such as size 4, you will have tighter knits. The logic is simple. Use a smaller size needle than the recommended if you want tighter or stiffer output.\nFinding your comfortable gauge may take some swatches or testing. It does not always have to conform with the standard gauge. Use your preference as your guide for your knitting gauge. As long as you keep track of your project size, finding the right needle size will not be a problem.\nDo Smaller Knitting Needles Use Less Yarn?\nIn theory, smaller needles will use a lesser amount of yarn. That is if you use the same pattern and do not adjust the length and cast-on of your design.\nFor instance, the pattern recommends that you use a size 8 needle on a 200 cast-on pattern. You know that size 8 will give you 4.5 stitches per inch. This means that the 200 divided by 4.5 is 44.44. The length of the pattern using this needle size is 44.44 inches (113 cm.).\nIf you use size 6 instead of 8, your stitches per inch are now 5.5. Here is how the changes happen. If you divide 200 by 5.5, your quotient is 36.36. This means that by using a size 6 needle, your design will now be 36.36 inches (92 cm.).\nThis shows that smaller needles use a lesser amount of yarn. But, you have to consider that your design also got smaller. This proves the theory but it does not mean you will get the same result pictured in the pattern.\nIf you will use a smaller needle but want to achieve the same size given in the pattern, then adjust your cast-on.\nWhat Knitting Needles Are Best For Beginners?\nMedium and large needles are suitable for novice knitters. The same goes for yarns. If you are a beginner, you may start with medium-weight and chunky yarns. Bigger needles and yarns will allow you to work easier and faster.\nA good needle size range is 7 to 9. Needles with these sizes work well on worsted, chunky, and bulky yarns. These needles are great training needles. They make bigger stitches and are less straining to your fingers.\nThese needle sizes are perfect for making warm and thick scarves, shawls, and cowls.\nWhat Is The Smallest Size Knitting Needle?\nIn the US standard, the smallest knitting needle is 0. This is the metric counterpart of size 2 mm. This needle size works on thin yarns. You can use this for knitting intricate lace patterns.\nOnly experienced knitters use this needle size for making lace designs. This can be challenging because your yarn is also very thin.\nIs It Easier To Knit With Big Or Small Needles?\nNovice knitters will find it easier to knit on medium to large needle sizes. Small needles can be tricky because you also have to work on smaller yarn. This combination can be challenging if you have not gained advanced knitting skills.\nDoes Using Larger Knitting Needles Use Less Yarn?\nThe answer depends on the yarn weight you use. If you use chunky and bulky yarns on large needles, the amount of yarn is proportionate to your design.\nBut if you use thinner yarns on knitting needles then you will use more yarns. Bigger needles make bigger and looser stitches. This means it will have to use up longer yarn to make one stitch.\nThis is why knowing the right gauge is crucial in knitting. The principle is easy to understand. Small needle size makes smaller and tighter stitches. Bigger needle sizes create bigger stitches.\nOnce you know these, you can defy your pattern and use your desired needle size. You will know how to work on your number of stitches to ensure your project will have the right size.\nKnitting should not be a difficult craft. These needle sizes are mere recommendations for your guidance. You can still follow your personal choice.\nYou can use your preferred needle size according to your chosen yarn. You can make your project tighter or looser than your pattern. There is no hard rule in knitting. What you need is to understand the logic in these recommendations.\nYou have to keep in mind that these needle sizes were not made out of thin air. Each size works for a specific yarn weight. It is all up to you if you want to follow or deviate from it.\nAny changes from your knitting pattern have corresponding effects. If you are not yet an experienced knitter, make sure to follow your pattern first. This is to make sure that you complete your project accordingly.\nDeviating from your pattern can lead to mistakes and frustration. You, too, can tweak your patterns once you become more skilled and experienced.']	['<urn:uuid:ba073e10-2401-41dd-84de-35e0a81b9cef>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	15	126	2093
34	I want a small knife for my keychain. How big is the Signature Lite?	The Signature Lite is 2.3 inches long and weighs just 0.8 of an ounce. It has seven tools including a ballpoint pen, screwdriver, knife blade, and scissors.	['The Victorinox Swiss Army Knife Is An Icon. The Small Red Knife Has A Remarkable History And Is Popular All Around The World\nFew knives are as immediately recognizable as the Swiss Army knife. The small red multi-tool has been manufactured for over a century and is known around the globe for its versatility and durability. Still made in Switzerland today by Victorinox, the Swiss Army knife has evolved as a tool since the founding of Victorinox in 1884.\nHistory Of The Victorinox Swiss Army Knife\nVictorinox was founded in the small town of Ibach in the canton of Schwyz in central Switzerland by Karl Elsener. It was initially just a small cutler’s workshop run by Karl and supported by his mother Victoria.\nJust seven years later, Elsener was able to deliver his first major batch of knives to the Swiss military, and six years later patented the original “Swiss Officer’s and Sports Knife. That set the stage for a whole range of knives, each of which would be included under the umbrella name of Swiss Army knife, or SAK for short.\nThe Victorinox brand name came into existence in 1921. After Victoria’s passing in 1909, Karl chose her name as the brand name, but 13 years later the innovation of stainless steel swept through the knifemaking world. At the time the steel was known as “Inox,” and by combining that with his mother’s name, Karl created the brand name of Victorinox that has endured for more than a century.\nAfter World War II, American GIs stationed in Europe took a liking to the Swiss Army knife and bought many of them, turning them into a popular souvenir to bring back to the states.\nSince then, and the brand has continued to grow. Victorinox now makes other types of cutlery along with outdoor gear and watches. Rival maker Wenger, which also made a claim to the Swiss Army knife, was acquired by Victorinox in 2005, and its knives were absorbed into the Victorinox brand eight years later. The Wenger brand lives on through watches and other licensed products.\nIn 2017 the company produced its 500 millionth Swiss Army knife, a testament to the quality and popularity of the brand.\nWhat Is The Best Swiss Army Knife?\nThat question depends on what you want out of your knife. Most all operate the same way, a slip joint with tools coming out of both ends of the knife thanks to a special spring system innovated in 1897 that every Swiss Army knife still uses today.\nIf you’re looking for a tool that can solve simple, everyday problems, there are many smaller models that will handle your needs. Many of those even fit on a keychain.\nIf you’re more of an outdoors person or just want something more rugged and diverse, there are many models that have dozens of different tools in them. You’ll see one with 73 tools in it shortly. Regardless of your wants or needs, Victorinox will have a knife for you.\nSwiss Army Knife Options\nThe Victorinox Swiss Army knife is a living, breathing tool. New models come out regularly, and the team in Switzerland continues to find ways to create new tools and designs for the knives. Below are a trio that shows off what the SAK is capable of, from something simple to the opulently extravagant.\nThis is a prime example of how much can be deftly fit into a space so small. The Signature Lite is 2.3 inches long and weighs just .8 of an ounce. Even in those tiny dimensions, there are seven tools including a ballpoint pen, screwdriver, knife blade, and scissors. This is a quintessential Swiss Army knife. It can fit on a keychain and follow you wherever you go.\nThe Trekker shows how robust a Victorinox Swiss Army knife can be. This model features a dozen tools including three different screwdrivers, a can opener, and a wood saw. It’s designed for the outdoorsman, the hiker, the person camping under the stars. The Trekker does have a keychain loop although it’ll probably be better folded up in your pocket. At 4.6 ounces it’s far heavier than the Signature Lite but still far lighter than many other factory knives.\nSwiss Champ XXL\nLast on our list is the most expensive model sold by Victorinox not including limited edition pieces. The XXL has so many tools in it that it doesn’t feel real. It’s 3.6 inches long, and in that space there are 73 individual tools. That’s not a typo. 73 tools.\nSeven screwdrivers. Six blades. Three wire strippers. Too many wrenches to count. All that’s missing is the partridge in a pear tree.\nThe XXL also features some of the most unusual Swiss Army knife tools made today. That includes the pharmaceutical spatula, watch opener, fish scaler, and hook disgorger.\nAt 12.5 ounces it is a beast, and it even comes in a lined, branded case. While it might not be necessary for you, the Swiss Champ XXL flexes the design and manufacturing capabilities that Victorinox has developed in its decades of existence.\n- Best Pocketknife Brands\n- Best Kitchen Knife Set To Upgrade Your Galley\n- Best Knife Case Options To Protect Your Investment\n- BLADE 101: Types Of Kitchen Knives\nKnife Guide Issue features the newest knives and sharpeners, plus knife and axe reviews, knife sheaths, kit knives and a Knife Industry Directory.\nGet your FREE digital PDF instant download of the annual Knife Guide.

35	how tattoo transfer paper works compare thermal inkjet printing process	Thermal transfer paper uses heat to transfer designs, containing multiple layers including a white layer, protective milky layer, ink layer, and yellow bottom layer. The design is processed through a thermogenic transfer maker. In contrast, inkjet printers spray thousands of ink droplets to form images, with dots per inch (DPI) determining resolution. For tattoos, thermal transfer paper has become the industry standard as it produces clearer images than traditional hectograph paper, though both methods are used to transfer designs onto skin before tattooing.	['How To Use Tattoo Transfer Paper\nSometimes the hardest part of getting a perfect tattoo is explaining to your tattoo artist exactly what design you want. You could always sketch the design or even have the tattoo professional draw it for you. But the problem still remains how get that perfect design on to your skin.\nUsing tattoo transfer paper solves that problem. It’s basically carbon copy paper for tattoos which leaves the design outline on your skin. The effect is similar to those temporary “fake” tattoos you used to apply as a child. This short guide explains how to use tattoo transfer paper, and the difference between thermal and hectograph/freehand transfer papers.\nHectograph or Freehand Tattoo Transfer Paper\nManual transfer papers, known as hectograph or free hand transfer paper, work in the same way as carbon copy sheets. They are similar to the sheets used with manual typewriters or older dot matrix printers, to create multiple copies.\nHectograph transfer paper usually has three sheets. The top sheet is where you manually draw your design. The center tissue sheet is removed before you begin. The bottom sheet is where the design is transferred to; it is carbon-like and is available in a choice of colors.\nUsing a hectograph pencil to ensure quality artwork, you simply draw your design on to the top layer. When it has copied through to the bottom sheet, you cut out the design and place it over the area to be tattooed. The skin should be prepared with a solution, known as stencil stay, before the paper is then applied.\nOnce properly aligned, wipe it repeatedly with a damp sponge. the transfer paper is then removed, and the design is left on the skin.\nThis type of stencil paper is normally more cost effective and easier to re-do if you make a mistake. The availability of different colors can also make them easier to see on different skin tones.\nThermographic Tattoo Transfer Paper\nThermal transfer papers typically contain four layers. First is a white layer for the design to be transferred onto. This is protected by a milky thin layer which is normally thrown away. It also has an ink layer, which is usually purple. Finally there is a bottom yellow layer which hold the sheets in place.\nCreate your tattoo design in pencil on a regular sheet of white paper before sliding the design between the ink layer and the bottom yellow sheet. You then place the whole set of papers through a thermogenic transfer maker. You can sometimes find this machine in tattoo shops. A local print shop may also have one that you can use.\nOnce you remove the top piece of paper, you should have an exact replica of your original design. Wash the area of skin where you intend to place the tattoo, with soapy water, before applying the carbon copy. Press down on the paper and smooth it out before removing, ensuring the design has completely transferred.\nYou can find a Wiki how-to-guide on thermal tattoo transfer paper, by clicking here.\nThe ability to produce clearer images has made thermal transfer paper the standard in the tattoo industry. Until recently, they could only produce a dark purple outline, which couldn’t always be seen on darker skin tones. Some manufacturers, however, now produce red thermographic transfer paper, which is more visible.\nA recent survey on tattoo regrets found that 40 percent of the respondents didn’t like how their tattoo looked. Using tattoo transfer paper will help you get a tattoo which is more likely to closely match your original design.\nYour tattoo will be with you for decades to come, so you definitely want the design to be perfect. Whichever type of tattoo transfer paper you choose, the key to obtaining the best results is quality paper. This will enable you to produce a quality design which looks as good on skin as it does on paper.', 'Businesses around the world rely on printers every day to print all manner of items, including contracts, receipts, asset management tags, and more. It’s essential that businesses understand and choose the right printer for their specific needs. An inkjet printer, for instance, may print high-quality photos but lack the capabilities to quickly and easily print barcodes. This article will examine inkjet and thermal printers, two of the most common types of printers currently available, with information on the pros and cons of each, typical applications, and resources for choosing your next printer.\nWhat is an Inkjet Printer?\nInkjet printers, as the name implies, use ink to print text, graphics, and images onto various types of paper. These printers are most common in homes and small offices, though many commercial printing companies use inkjet printers to produce high-quality brochures, flyers, and other pieces.\nHow do Inkjet Printers Work?\nInkjet printers spray thousands of droplets of ink onto a piece of paper, where the colors are combined to form an image or text. The colors and sizes of these droplets can be altered to produce sharp, photo-realistic images. Users can look at the advertised dots per inch (DPI) to gauge the printer’s resolution. The DPI measurement tells users how many tiny droplets can fit along a single inch on the page. A higher DPI means that the printer makes smaller individual dots, and a sharper image.\nWhat are the Advantages of an Inkjet Printer?\nThere are many reasons a company might opt for an inkjet printer. Here are some common benefits and advantages of choosing an inkjet:\n- Cost: Inkjet printers, cartridges, and supplies are more widely available—and therefore cheaper—than their thermal counterparts.\n- Image quality: Even low-end inkjet printers can produce nearly photo-quality images.\nWhat are the Disadvantages of an Inkjet Printer?\nInkjet printers aren’t without drawbacks and disadvantages. Here are a few:\n- Image durability: Ink-based images may smudge, stain, and run when exposed to moisture, sunlight, humidity, and routine use.\n- Moving parts: Inkjet printers typically use more moving parts than thermal printers, increasing the chance of breakdowns that require repair or replacement.\n- Reliability: Stickers, signs, labels, and other printed material may tear and peel too often for reliable long-term use.\nWhat is a Thermal Printer?\nUnlike inkjet printers, thermal printers don’t spray liquid ink through a nozzle to produce images. Rather, thermal printers use tiny heating elements to activate or transfer pigments. Thermal printers are used most commonly to create labels, safety signs, way-finding markers, bar-codes, shipping labels, and other heavily-used items.\nHow do Thermal Printers Work?\nThere are two distinct categories of thermal printers: Direct thermal printers and thermal transfer printers. Here’s a quick breakdown of how each works:\n- Direct thermal printers use chemically-treated paper that darkens when heated by a thermal print head. Direct thermal printers do not use separate ink, toner, or ribbon supplies. Direct thermal printers are most commonly used to print items such as receipts and shipping labels.\n- Thermal transfer printers use a thermal print head to transfer a solid ink from a ribbon onto a label supply (usually made from vinyl, polyester, nylon, or other thicker materials) to produce a permanent print. Ribbon is usually made from wax, resin, or a combination of the two, and is bonded to the label supply surface with heat and pressure.\nWhat are the Advantages of a Thermal Printer?\nThere are several reasons to consider a thermal printer for your facility. Here are a few advantages of investing in a thermal printer:\n- Durable: Labels and signs created with thermal printers last longer and stand up to a wider variety of weather conditions than those printed with ink.\n- Versatile: Thermal transfer printers can print documents, labels, and signs that meet various needs, including durable arc flash labels, text- and graphics-based floor marking, and labels meant for extreme conditions such as cold storage.\n- Less maintenance: With fewer moving parts, thermal printers tend to last longer, are easier to maintain, and run more reliably than inkjet printers.\nWhat are the Disadvantages of a Thermal Printer?\nFor all the good that comes with using thermal printers, they aren’t without disadvantages and drawbacks. Here are a few complications that may arise from using thermal printers.\n- Cost: The specialty materials used in the thermal printing process are considerably more expensive than their inkjet counterparts; even the most basic thermal printer may cost hundreds of dollars.\n- Color choice: Thermal printers print fewer colors, and the high heat limits wax and resin choices; both factors limit color and application options. (For these reasons, users cannot print high-quality photographs with thermal printers.) Despite these disadvantages, Graphic Products offers a Custom Label Service, which allows employers to design unique labels with up to four spot colors.\nWhen Should You Use One Printer Over the Other?\nWith so many printer choices and label standards, it can be tough to know when one type of printer is better suited than the other.\nUse an Inkjet Printer for:\n- Office printing: Use an inkjet printer for basic office print jobs, like contracts, manuals, and emails.\n- Photographs: Thermal printers cannot print high-quality photographs, making inkjet printers the ideal solution.\n- Temporary signage: Print short-term notices, announcements, and reminders designed for short-term use (such as a sign informing workers that a meeting has moved rooms).\nUse a Thermal Transfer Printer for:\n- Durable signs and labels: Thermal transfer printers can print signs and labels that stand up to extreme environments and meet OSHA and NFPA requirements, including arc flash labels, marine signage, safety signs, and more.\n- Specialized visual communication: Print magnetized shelving labels, wire wraps, low-light visual communication, and more for applications unique to your facility’s needs.\n- Floor marking: Boost efficiency and safety with custom floor marking signs, which can be modified to create pathways, cordon off areas, and alert pedestrians to forklift traffic.']	['<urn:uuid:e017c653-502b-4cca-b742-43bac802ba66>', '<urn:uuid:4c5eba40-ea88-46e5-b3b4-ed4cbece3d8e>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	10	83	1640
36	pair research vs interdisciplinary team goals difference	Pair Research aims to resolve immediate work blockers by connecting people with relevant expertise, while interdisciplinary teaming focuses on long-term instructional goals like integrating academic core curriculum and providing consistent support to a stable group of students. Pair Research prioritizes dynamic, short-term collaborations, whereas interdisciplinary teaming creates lasting 'school within a school' environments.	"[""I recently met with McCormick and School of Communication professors Haoqi Zhang and Liz Gerber to discuss their new platform Pair Research, whose development was funded through a Provost's Digital Learning Fellowship. Listening back to the recording of our interview, it occurred to me that the story of Pair Research and the path to launch was best told by the experts themselves. So, without further ado, here it is in their own words…\nFIRST, A LITTLE BACKGROUND\nThe Pair Research platform simplifies the process of asking for and receiving help. The platform provides a digital space where a community can form around a project. When a member of the community encounters a problem in their work that they need help with, they type in a request for help and other community members respond, rating their ability to help on a scale of one to five. A matching algorithm then recommends the most optimal pairings for collaboration, allowing work to move forward more quickly as experts are paired with the person who needs help.\nHaoqi: “Pair Research is a process and tool, something that together we call a socio-technical system, for people to come together and help each other by pairing experts within and across communities. The platform launched January 1st and it’s open to anyone at pairresearch.io.\n“We [Liz and I] use it every week in both our interdisciplinary research lab, which is called the Delta Lab, and within our undergraduate and graduate research programs. For us, it's been a way to connect students across projects, teams, and even research areas to be able to help each other.\n“The students are using Pair Research to help resolve blockers that could be things like: I have a problem with my technology; I need someone to take a look at my research arguments or do user testing of a design element… it can be a variety of things.\n“We're also seeing some early successes beyond Northwestern. So far we've had users testing it at the University of Washington and a research group in Korea at KAIST using it actively on a weekly basis to help their students collaborate and learn from each other.\n“Having this platform now is enabling us to say to anyone who can benefit from this new form of collaboration within their lab or community that you can create your own groups, invite your own members, and run your own pair research pool.”\nHaoqi: “The way the Pair Research system works is that you enter your problem and specify what it is you need help with. Then other people rate how well they could help you. The system creates a ‘help graph’ of who can help whom with what and automatically creates parings where people who can best help each other are matched together. The system then makes globally optimal pairings in the sense that it's best distributing the expertise we have within that community.\n“There’s two interesting things that happen in the way the platform runs.\n“One of the things is if you think about having faculty and students in this community, faculty are often the scarce resource, so to speak. Students who need help on things that other students can help them on may get paired with that other student, but if they have a request that a faculty member is more likely to be able to help answer, they have a better chance at getting paired with the faculty member. We're really leveraging every ounce of expertise we have within our community to resolve everyone's problems.\nInterface for managing the pair research pool\n“The other piece of this is that the system intentionally does not make perfect pairings. It purposefully skews the pairing so that if you and I paired recently it will purposely try to pair other people with us. The intention is that even though, myopically speaking, the best thing is if the people who could best help each other right now are paired, really what we want are for skills and abilities to be distributed within the network so that we're building competencies across the community. Over time, this increases our help-giving capacity as more people learn things from others and can now become helpers.”\nLiz: “There's a third interesting thing that happens regarding perspective. Pair Research encourages you to meet up with people who have different perspectives than you. Research suggests you’re more likely to come up with a unique insight or idea if you talk with such people.”\nLiz: “Like most innovations, a lot of different people in different locations were working on a similar idea at the same time. When we found out we were all working together, we decided to work together. I was working on a whiteboard and marker version of this in my lab before Haoqi started at Northwestern. It turns out, at the same time Haoqi and his colleague Rob Miller were doing something similar using spreadsheets at MIT.”\nHaoqi: “At first, this was just about connecting PhD students who are constantly hitting really hard problems in their research with a lab community so they’re not left to wait for the next time they get to meet with their faculty mentor. Over time, this idea of building a community became a lot more about cross-collaboration.”\nLiz: “In my lab, we started with a low fidelity prototype on the whiteboard. We’d each write our challenges on the board and then look around to figure out how to optimize help for each other based on individual skillsets. We write pairs down on the board to optimize help giving. Each week, we’d look back at the pairs we had made and remake pairs based on help needed and new perspectives offered.”\nHaoqi: “Once we had a sharable prototype running on Google, we had all of these colleagues who were like, ‘Cool! Give me that!’”\nScreenshot of the spreadsheet prototype\nLiz: “Faculty don't have a lot of time; they want to adopt things that work. So one of the things that we are currently designing for the platform is an easier adoption process. Part of this year's work is to get to a place where using Pair Research is as easy as downloading an app on your phone – you don't really think about it, you just do it because it helps you and your team to be more productive.”\nLiz: “We could probably take every paper and product that has come out of the Delta Lab and reverse-engineer it back to collaborations through Pair Research.”\nHaoqi: “I think the thing that really resonates with me is – what haven’t we done that hasn't been touched by Pair Research in some way because every student every project is going to hit a blocker and then they have somebody help them find a way past the blocker.”\nLiz: “I have a PhD student who is working on building and designing an app. She was struggling with some code so she requested help on Pair Research. She then was paired with one of Haoqi’s computer science students. Twenty-five minutes later the bug was fixed and she was on her way to finishing the code. That’s a pretty common scenario. Vice versa, we had a computer science student struggling with some qualitative data analysis who requested help and drew an expert in qualitative analysis and was able to get what he needed to finish his research paper which was just published.”\nHaoqi: “It's almost like you have parts of your brain that store different knowledge and concepts that are going on and someone comes by and goes, ‘Here, let me link them for you.’”\nHave a research project that could benefit from a new or different point of view? Give Pair Research a try! Who knows what types of new and interesting connections you’ll make…"", 'MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHING AND TEAM BUILDING\nGathered from various sources.\nWHAT IS INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAMING?\nInterdisciplinary team teaching is an instructional practice in which two or more teachers combine their abilities, energies, interests, enthusiasm and knowledge of pupils to teach the core academic disciplines to a group of students with a constant, unvarying membership. Interdisciplinary teaming provides for collegial support and assistance. Interdisciplinary teaming expands the instructional and classroom options.\nTeams share common planning times during which they:\n1. discuss and individualize experiences for the students they teach in common;\n2. plan coordinated efforts in solving student problems;\n3. prepare cooperatively taught, interdisciplinary lessons that involve shared\nobjectives or concepts that are explorable by more than one discipline;\n4. confer as an informed, unified group of experts with students, parents,\npatrons, and school officials.\nBelongingness and distinctiveness for students and teachers are engendered by Interdisciplinary teaming.\nTeaming creates a ""school within a school"" environment in which students and teachers develop loyalty to the team.\nInterdisciplinary teaming allows for great flexibility in scheduling.\nInterdisciplinary teaming enhances shared decision-making.\nTeam teaching permits the integration of the academic core curriculum, enhancing the motivation of students and subsequent retention of learning objectives. The integration of core and related-arts curricula to the great benefit of each is also possible.\nThe interdisciplinary team will emulate the self-containment typically found in elementary schools. A structure that is similar to self-containment is imperative in providing an adequate, incremental transition from the elementary to the middle school.\nThe team provides for flexible and adaptable grouping opportunities.\nThe team makes more effective use of the abilities and talents of team members.\nThe team enables more effective instructional problem-solving by concentrating the experience and insight of several professionals.\nPUTTING AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM TOGETHER\nCreate a team name, logo, and/or mascot.\nAs individuals, complete the accompanying instruments regarding teaching, analyze your belief systems concerning education.\nDetermine your teaching styles and methods, testing methods, discipline beliefs and methods.\nIt is critical that you know your own teaching before you can effectively team.\nShare and compare the results with each team member in open meeting.\nAs a group, review permanent record folders of students assigned on the team.\nPlan to coordinate your homework assignments and testing schedule.\nCoordinate your discipline plans.\nDevelop a plan to keep a team bulletin board.\nEstablish standards for students that provide consistency, e.g., late work, headings on papers, discipline, etc.\nPlan team recognition of students, e.g., awards, team activities.\nBegin identifying field trips for the year.\nIdentify students with special learning or behavioral problems. Review their confidential files.\nConsider social events (summer and at other times) to get to know each other better.\nInvite the librarian to a team meeting to better understand the resources in the media center.\nView materials upon ""Interdisciplinary Team Teaching"".\nReview standardized tests results available in the guidance office.\nConsider a plan to work cooperatively to teach and reinforce academic and study skills, e.g., ""skill of the week,"" study skills.\nSchedule a time to meet with the counselors during a team plan to review procedures for parent conferences, etc.\nObtain and read the Middle School Journal, The Journal of Early Adolescence, or Schools in the Middle to keep abreast of middle school programs. Consider joining the State Middle Level Education Association.\nConduct a self-evaluation of the effectiveness of your team at the end of the year. Use the instrument provided.\nConduct periodic checks of the Organizational Notebooks to insure students are keeping the supplies they need.\nReview the examples of commercial Interdisciplinary Units purchased from such publishers as Wiles, Bondi and Associates.\nA team may wish to adapt one of these for their own use.\n1.

For instance, a geography objective involving the study of a particular region can be explored through mathematics; examining economics, demographics and associated numeric data. Flora, fauna, and environmental issues can be inspected through science classes; English classes would be used to tie the package together with reports, essays or oral presentations.

37	austrian parliament power structure history changes	The Austrian Parliament's power structure has evolved significantly over time. The National Council, as the lower house, holds the primary federal legislative authority with 183 members elected for five-year terms. While the 1929 constitution defined Austria as a semi-presidential democracy with significant presidential powers, in practice it functions as a parliamentary democracy where the cabinet answers to the National Council. Historically, parliamentary democracy was suspended in 1933 and Austria was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1938 to 1945. After liberation in April 1945, the Second Republic was established with the restoration of democratic principles based on the 1920 Constitution, declaring the 1938 annexation null and void.	"['National Council (Austria)\n|26th legislative period|\n|Founded||10 November 1920|\n|Preceded by||Constituent National Assembly|\n|15 October 2017|\n|By 6 November 2022|\n|Redoute Wing (provisionally) |\nHofburg Imperial Palace, Vienna\nThe National Council (German: Nationalrat) is one of the two houses of the Austrian Parliament and is frequently referred to as the lower house. The constitution endows the National Council far more power than the Federal Council.\n|This article is part of a series on the|\n|Politics of Austria|\nThe National Council is where Austria\'s federal legislative authority is concentrated; for a bill to become federal law, it must be resolved upon by this chamber. Bills passed by the National Council are sent to the Federal Council for corroboration. If the Federal Council approves of the bill or simply does nothing for eight weeks, the bill has succeeded. If the Federal Council vetoes the bill, the National Council may still force it into law by essentially just passing it again; a National Council resolution overruling a Federal Council objection merely has to meet a higher quorum than a regular resolution. In other words, the Federal Council does not have any real power to prevent adoption of legislation, the National Council being trivially able to override it. There are three exceptions to this rule:\n- Constitutional laws or regulations limiting the competencies of the federal states\n- Laws relating to the rights of the Federal Council itself\n- Treaties concerning the jurisdiction of the federal states.\nThe approval of the National Council is also required for most of the prerogatives of the Federal Assembly to be exercised. For example, motions to call for a referendum aimed at having the President removed from office by the electorate, and motions to declare war all need a two-thirds majority in the National Council. Only motions to impeach the President can also be from the Federal Council.\nThe 183 members of the National Council are elected by nationwide popular vote for a term of five years; each Austrian sixteen years or older on the day the election takes place is entitled to one vote. National Council elections are general elections. The voting system aims at party-list proportional representation and uses partially open lists:\n- For the purpose of National Council elections, the nine states of Austria constitute regional electoral districts. The nine regional electoral districts are subdivided into a total of 43 local electoral districts. Political parties submit separate ranked lists of candidates for each district, regional or local, in which they have chosen to run. They also submit a federal-level list.\n- Votes cast are first counted within their local electoral districts. Since there are 43 local districts but 183 seats to fill, most local districts are multi-member districts. The number of seats assigned to each local district is based solely on electoral district population, as established by the most recent census; the partitioning and apportionment rules are simple enough to prevent gerrymandering from becoming an issue. The number of votes required to win one seat is simply the number of votes divided by the number of seats assigned to the district in question. For example, if 150,000 votes are cast in a five-seat local district, it takes 30,000 votes to win one seat. If a party has scored 61,000 votes out of the 150,000 votes cast, it is entitled to two seats, to be taken by the first two candidates on the party\'s local district list. Since 60,000 votes would have been sufficient to win two seats, 1000 votes are left unaccounted for by this first round of tallying.\n- Any vote not accounted for on the local level is dealt with on the regional level, provided that the party it has been cast for has obtained at least four percent of the regional total vote. The system is analogous to that used on the district level; the number of seats assigned to a regional district is simply the number of seats assigned to one of its constituent local districts but not filled during the first round of tallying.\n- Any vote not accounted for on the regional level either is dealt with on the federal level, provided that the party it has been cast for has obtained at least four percent of the federal total vote. The D\'Hondt method is used to allocate any National Council seats remaining to be filled.\nIn addition to voting for a party list, voters may express preference for one individual candidate. A candidate receiving sufficiently many personal votes can rise in rank on his or her district party list; voters thus have a certain degree of influence as to which particular individual wins which particular seat. It is not possible, however, to simultaneously vote for party X but exert influence on the candidate rankings on the party list of party Y.\nAustria\'s federal constitution defines Austria to be a semi-presidential democracy: the executive branch of government is supposed to be headed by the President, but is also answerable to the National Council. In practice, however, nearly all of the day-to-day work of governing is left to the Chancellor and Cabinet, which are dependent on the confidence of the National Council. The President has the theoretical right to name anyone eligible to serve in the National Council as a minister or Chancellor. However, the National Council\'s right to sack a minister or the entire cabinet makes it all but impossible for Presidents to appoint a government entirely of their own choosing or keep it in office against the will of the National Council. While the President has the theoretical authority to dissolve a hostile National Council, constitutional convention prevents this power from being exercised.\nAustria accordingly functions as a parliamentary democracy: for all intents and purposes, the cabinet is subject to approval by the National Council and is responsible to it, with the president being little more than a figurehead.\nA related discrepancy between Austrian constitutional theory and Austrian political practice is that the constitution defines the President of the National Council to be Austria\'s second highest public official, junior only to the president proper. As a practical matter, the President of the National Council is a representative of rather moderate significance: wielding less power than the president by extension means wielding less power than the Chancellor or even most federal ministers. The President of the National Council thus serves mostly as a moderator of parliamentary debate.\n|Austrian People\'s Party (ÖVP)||1,586,106||31.5||62||+15|\n|Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ)||1,351,918||26.9||52||0|\n|Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ)||1,310,614||26.0||51||+11|\n|NEOS – The New Austria (NEOS)||264,317||5.3||10||+1|\n|Peter Pilz List (PILZ)||220,088||4.4||8||New|\n|The Greens – The Green Alternative (GRÜNE)||189,467||3.8||0||–24|\n|My Vote Counts!

From March 13, 1938 onwards Austria was occupied by the German Reich and thus prevented from exercising its sovereign power. It remained part of the Third Reich until April 1945. As had been the case with the First Republic (1918-1938), it was the political parties that founded the Second Republic after Austria's liberation in April 1945.\nThe three anti-fascist parties - the Socialist Party of Austria (SPÖ, now Social Democratic Party of Austria), the Christian Social Party (now Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), and the Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ) reached an agreement on the formation of a Provisional State Government headed by Karl Renner (1870-1950) and on the proclamation of Austria's independence.\nThis Declaration of Independence was proclaimed on April 27, 1945. The first two Articles read as follows: Article I: The democratic Republic of Austria is restored and shall be instituted in the spirit of the Constitution of 1920. Article II: The annexation enforced on the Austrian people in 1938 is declared null and void.\nThe Austrian Constitution is based on the principles of a republican, democratic and federal state, the principle of the rule of law, and the principle of the separation of legislative and executive powers and the separation of jurisdiction and administration.\nThe Federal President of Austria is the Head of State elected by the Austrian people for a term of six years. He is the only representative of the entire country who is elected directly by the population. The list of the Federal President’s powers was established in the 1929 constitutional amendment, which attributed more powers to the President than did the Constitution of 1920.\nIn addition to his powers rooted in the Constitution, it is the Federal President's responsibility to offer moral support to his country. In particular, his tasks include the integration of minorities into the political process and the protection of the democracy. Extensive experience in politics, a steady positioning within the population, competence in all spheres of life and the political arena, and non-partisanship are seen as essential prerequisites for a presidential candidate. By means of this combination of constitutional rights and the above powers of the President, the state can thus efficiently guarantee the separation of powers.\nThe Austrian president convenes and concludes parliamentary sessions and under certain conditions can dissolve Parliament. However, no Austrian president has dissolved Parliament in the Second Republic. The custom is for Parliament to call for new elections, if needed. The president requests a party leader, usually the leader of the strongest party, to form a government. Upon the recommendation of the Federal Chancellor, the president also appoints cabinet ministers.\nThe Austrian Federal Chancellor is the head of government. The Chancellor and the other members of the Austrian Cabinet chosen upon the Chancellor's advice are appointed or removed from office by the Federal President of Austria (head of state). Neither the appointment of the Chancellor nor the appointment of the members of the Austrian Cabinet needs to be confirmed by the Austrian Parliament. However, the Parliament can pass a vote of no confidence against individual members of the Cabinet or the entire administration. As a consequence, the Cabinet or the respective Minister would have to resign. The Chancellor countersigns the federal acts executed by the President. If the President is unavailable, all his duties are assigned to the Chancellor for a period of up to 20 days.\nThe Federal Assembly (Parliament) consists of two houses--the National Council (Nationalrat), or lower house, and the Federal Council (Bundesrat), or upper house. Legislative authority resides in the National Council. Its 183 members serve for a maximum term of 4 years in a three-tiered system, on the basis of proportional representation. The National Council may dissolve itself by a simple majority vote or the president may dissolve it on the recommendation of the Chancellor. The nine state legislatures elect the 62 members of the Federal Council for 5- to 6-year terms. The Federal Council only reviews legislation passed by the National Council and can delay but not veto its enactment.\nThe highest courts of Austria's independent judiciary are the Constitutional Court; the Administrative Court, which handles bureaucratic disputes; and the Supreme Court, for civil and criminal cases. While the Supreme Court is the court of highest instance for the judiciary, the Administrative Court acts as the supervisory body over government administrative acts of the executive branch, and the Constitutional Court presides over constitutional issues. The Federal President appoints the justices of the three courts for specific terms.\nThe legislatures of Austria's nine Bundeslaender (states) elect the governors. Although most authority, including that of the police, rests with the federal government, the states have considerable responsibility for welfare matters and local administration. Strong state and local loyalties have roots in tradition and history.\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|""]"	['<urn:uuid:3d5a68c1-aa68-47c4-a201-e529e9bf3e6b>', '<urn:uuid:73838c2d-2f88-462e-adbc-152b6f5f1c65>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	6	106	2048
38	multi infarct dementia hypertension stroke correlation	Multi-infarct dementia is strongly correlated with hypertension and stroke. High blood pressure can cause strokes by weakening blood vessels in the brain, leading them to narrow or rupture. These strokes can then result in multi-infarct dementia, which manifests through cognitive impairment affecting memory, thinking, language, behavior, and judgment. This makes hypertension the single most modifiable risk factor that must be optimized to prevent both strokes and subsequent dementia.	['Hypertension or high blood pressure is capable of affecting and damaging several parts and organs of your body, even before you experience symptoms. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can destroy a lot of your organs and disrupt their functioning. Here are the various effects and health complications that come with high blood pressure:\nHigh blood pressure causes the pressure of blood that flows through your arteries to increase. The cells present in the lining of your arteries can get damaged because of high blood pressure. Fats coming from the food you consume enter your bloodstream and accumulate in your damaged arteries. This makes your artery walls less elastic and limits blood flow all over your body. The constant pressure of blood moving along a weak artery can lead to the formation of a bulge due to the enlargement of its wall known as aneurysm.\nHigh blood pressure affects your heart in several ways.\n• Coronary artery disease\nThis disease affects the arteries supplying blood to the heart muscle. Being narrowed down because of this condition, your arteries do not allow the smooth and the free flow of blood. This may cause a heart attack, chest pain, or arrhtymias.\n• Enlarged left heart\nHigh blood pressure makes your heart work harder than it usually has to, for pumping blood to the different parts of your body. This may cause the heart’s left ventricle to become thick or stiffen. This condition is known as left ventricular hypertrophy.\n• Heart failure\nThe strain on your heart that is caused due to high blood pressure over time can lead to the weakening of the heart muscle, and make its functioning improper. This may make your heart wear out and ultimately stop functioning.\nSimilar to the heart, your brain also gets affected because of high blood pressure in several ways.\n• Transient ischemic attack\nTIA or transient ischemic attack, or a mini stroke occurs when there is a temporary disruption of sufficient supply of blood to the brain. It is commonly caused because of a blood clot or atherosclerosis, which develops from hypertension.\nA stroke is experienced when a part of the brain is totally deprived of nutrients and oxygen, which leads to the death of brain cells. High blood pressure can cause a stroke by weakening the blood vessels present in your brain. They become narrow, and may rupture. Blood clot formation also results from high blood pressure that blocks blood flow to your brain, and causes a stroke.\nDementia is a brain health condition which causes issues with your thinking, reasoning, speaking, movement, vision, and memory. Among the various causes of dementia, vascular dementia occurs because of the blockage of arteries supplying blood to your brain.\nHigh blood pressure damages the blood vessels that go in, and come out from your kidneys. This may result in several forms of kidney diseases. Kidney failure commonly develops from high blood pressure. Damage to the arteries causes disruption in the kidney’s functioning to filter waste from the blood. This causes high levels of waste and fluid to accumulate. Kidney scarring is also likely to be experienced because of high blood pressure.\nIt is recommended for you to get your blood pressure checked regularly from the Best hospitals in Ranchi, in order to prevent hypertension, and keep away from several health complications.', 'Multi-infarct dementia is a heterogeneous disorder caused by the sequel of cerebrovascular disease that manifests in cognitive impairment affecting memory, thinking, language, behavior, and judgment.\nMulti-infarct dementia was first mentioned by Thomas Willis in 1672. It was later further described in the late 19th century by Binswanger and Alzheimer as a separate entity from dementia paralytica caused by neurospyhillus (1). This concept has evolved tremendously since the advent of neuroimaging modalities.\nSynonym(s): Vascular dementia (VaD); Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI); Vascular cognitive disorder (VCD); Arteriosclerotic dementia; Post-stroke dementia; Senile dementia due to hardening of the arteries; Binswanger’s disease; mixed dementia (2).\n- It is the 2nd most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s dementia in the elderly.\n- After careful consideration of the difficulties in diagnosing multi-infarct dementia and the many geographical and methodological differences, there is a lack of agreement in terms of its prevalence and epidemiology.\nAbout 6–12 cases per 1000 person years >70 (3)\n- About 1.2–4.2% in those >65 (3)\n- 14–32% prevalence of dementia after a stroke\n- Previous stroke\n- Atrial fibrillation\n- Peripheral vascular disease (PVD)\n- Metabolic syndrome\n- Coronary atherosclerotic heart disease\n- Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy (CADASIL) is caused by a mutation in the NOTCH3 gene on chromosome 19 that results in leukoencephalopathy and subcortical infarcts. This is clinically manifested in recurrent strokes and associated cognitive decline (4).\n- Apolipoprotein E gene type: Those with ApoE4 subtypes are at higher risk of developing both multi-infarct and Alzheimer’s dementia.\n- Amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene: Leads to a form of vascular dementia called heritable cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (5).\n- Optimization and aggressive treatment of vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia\n- Hypertension is the single most modifiable risk factor and must be optimized.\n- Lifestyle modification: Weight loss, physical activity, smoking cessation\n- Medication management for vascular risk reduction: Aspirin usage, statin therapy for hyperlipidemia, antihypertensive therapy\nUpon autopsy of those with dementia, 1/3 have significant vascular pathology present but this is not necessarily correlated clinically with multi-infarct dementia (6). There are no set pathological criteria for the diagnosis of multi-infarct dementia such as those that exist for Alzheimer’s dementia.\n- Large vessel disease: Cognitive impairment that follows a stroke\n- Small vessel disease: Includes white matter changes (leukoaraisosis), subcortical infarcts, and incomplete infarction. This is usually the most common cause of multi-infarct dementia.\n- Subcortical ischemic vascular disease: Due to small vessel involvement within cerebral white matter, brainstem, and basal ganglia. Lacunar infarcts and deep white matter changes are typically included in this category (7).\n- Non-infarct ischemic changes and atrophy (8)\n- Transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke\n- Vascular, demographic, genetic factors\n- Vascular disease (i.e., hypertension, PVD, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, etc.)\nCommonly Associated Conditions\n- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA): Accumulation of amyloid in cerebral vasculature resulting in infarctions and hemorrhages (9).\nDifferentiation between Alzheimer’s dementia and multi-infarct dementia can be difficult and there can be significant overlap in the clinical presentation of these two dementias. The diagnosis of multi-infarct dementia is a clinical diagnosis.\n- Gradual, stepwise progression is typical.\n- Ask about onset and progression of cognitive impairment and the specific cognitive domains involved.\n- Ask about vascular risk factors and previous attempts to control these risk factors.\n- Ask about medication compliance.\n- Ask about urinary incontinence and gait disturbances.\n- Look for early symptoms including difficulty performing cognitive tasks, memory, mood, and assessment of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) (8).\n- Past history may include TIAs, cerebrovascular accidents, coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and/or peripheral vascular disease.\n- Screen for hypertension\n- Focal neurological deficits may be present\n- Gait assessment is important especially looking at gait initiation, gait speed, and balance.\n- Check for carotid bruits as well as abdominal bruits and assess for presence of peripheral vascular disease.\n- Check body mass index and waist circumference.\n- Do a thorough cardiac evaluation that includes looking for arrhythmias (i.e., atrial fibrillation).\nDiagnostic Tests & Interpretation\n- Cognitive screening, such as Mini-Cog, Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE), Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), provides more definitive information in terms of cognitive deficits, especially executive function, which may be lost earlier in multi-infarct dementia (8).\n- Neuropsychological testing may also be beneficial especially in evaluating multiple cognitive domains and their specific involvements and deficits.\nAs appropriate, consider: Complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic Profile, lipid panel, thyroid function, hemoglobin A1C, vitamin B12.\n- Imaging is used in conjunction with history and physical examination to support a clinical diagnosis of multi-infarct dementia.\n- Cognitive deficits observed clinically do not always have to correlate with findings found on neuroimaging studies.\n- There are no pathognomonic neuroimaging features for multi-infarct dementia (6).\n- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is best in terms of evaluation of subtle subcortical deficits.\n- Alzheimer’s dementia\n- Drug intoxication\n- Central nervous system tumors\n- Vitamin B12 deficiency\nPrevention is the real key to treatment.\n- Control of risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.\n- Avoidance of tobacco and stopping smoking.\n- Healthy, low-cholestrol diet\n- Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may be used but are of limited benefit in multi-infarct dementia (6,10).\n- The clinical evidence for use of memantine is not as strong as for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and therefore the clinical benefit is likely modest (6).\n- Controlling blood pressure with any antihypertensive medications, treatment of dyslipidemia (e.g., statins), and treatment of diabetes are very important.\n- Limit alcohol intake to ≤1 drink per day in women and 2 per day in men.\n- Heavy sustained alcohol use contributes to hypertension.\n- Aspirin and/or clopidogrel may be useful in some cases.\nComplementary and Alternative Medicine\nGinkgo biloba should be avoided due to increased risk of bleeding especially in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.\nCarotid endarterectomy or stenting if evidence of significant internal carotid artery stenosis (i.e., >70-80%).\n- Remain sensative to functional assessment and avoidance of pressure ulcers after cerebrovascular accients.\n- Urinary incontinence treatment may be needed after CVA.\n- Avoid Foley catheter usage unless absolutely necessary due to increased risk of infection.\n- Nonpharmacological approaches to behavior management should be attempted prior to medication usage.\n- Providing optimal sensory input to patients with cognitive impairment is important during hospitalizations to avoid delirium and confusion. Patients should be given frequent cues to keep them oriented to place and time. They should be informed of any changes in the daily schedule of activities and evaluations. Family and caregivers should be encouraged to be with patients with dementia as much as possible to further help them from becoming confused during hospitalization. Recreational, physical, occupational, and music therapy can be beneficial during hospitalization in avoiding delirium and preventing functional decline.\n- Particular emphasis has to be placed on screening for and optimizing the mood of the patient. Depression is very common in older patients especially those that have had strokes and have become hospitalized. Depression in itself can present as “pseudodementia” with worsening confusion during hospitalization and is a treatable condition.\nMulti-infarct dementia is a condition that should be followed with multiple visits in the office setting with goals of optimizing cardiovascular risk profiles for patients. Future planning and advanced directives should be addressed early. Family and caregiver evaluation and burden should also be evaluated.\nRegular follow-up with a primary care provider or geriatrician for risk factor modification and education on importance of regular physical and mental exercises as tolerated.\nAppropriate evaluation and diagnosis of this condition, need for future planning, optimizing vascular risk factors, lifestyle modification counseling, therapeutic interventions\n- American Heart Association diet and DASH diet recommended for optimal blood pressure and cardiovascular risk factor control.\n- Low-fat, decreased concentrated sweets and carbohydrates especially in those with metabolic syndrome.\n- Lifestyle modification is important in vascular risk reduction (smoking cessation, exercise counseling, dietary counseling, weight loss counseling).\n- Optimizing vascular risk factors via medications (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, PVD, heart disease)\n- Avoiding smoking including secondhand smoke.\n- Home blood pressure monitoring and glucometer testing of blood sugars if hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance and/or diabetes is present.\n- Instruct patients to call 911 for any TIA type symptoms.\n- Lost cognitive abilities that persist after initial recovery of deficits from stroke do not usually return. Some individuals can have intermittent periods of self-reported improvement in cognitive function.\n- Risk factors for progression of cognitive and functional impairment poststroke include age, prestroke cognitive abilities, depression, polypharmacy, and decreased cerebral perfusion during acute stroke (6).\n- Physical disability from stroke\n- Severe cognitive impairment\n1.

39	causes forest loss magamba nature reserve versus amazon brazil compare	In Magamba Nature Reserve, the main drivers of forest loss are socio-economic factors including education level, unemployment, limited landholding, population pressure, and expansion of built-up areas and agricultural land. In contrast, the Amazon in Brazil faces deforestation primarily due to cattle ranching, agriculture for cash crops, oil and gas extraction, and international factors such as development projects, trade agreements, and lack of law enforcement.	"[""Implication of Socio-economic Factors on Land Use and Forest Cover Changes in and Around Magamba Nature Reserve in Tanzania\nPerception of Local Stakeholders\nRural settlements in mountainous regions are a typical process that occurs in many places around the world and have a number of implications on the landscape. Among them is a threat it possesses to the conservation and management of Afromontane ecosystems. This study assessed the socio-economic factors that drive the changes in land use and forest cover and the extent of land use and vegetation cover in and around Magamba Nature Reserve. Focus group discussion, direct field observation and household survey were used to acquire socio-economic information that impacts land use and forest cover. Through the use of Remote Sensing and GIS methods Landsat satellite images of 1995, 2008 and 2015 were employed to identify the extent of the changes in land use and forest cover. The perceived factors for the changes include education level, unemployment, landless/limited, landholding, population pressure, expansion of built-up areas and agricultural land at the expense of other land covers. This study revealed the transformation of natural forest and associated vegetation from one form to another. There was a decrease in natural vegetation from 61.06% in 1995 to 26.02% in 2015 and increase in built-up areas by 6.69% and agricultural areas by 4.70%. This study recommends conservation monitoring and strong law enforcement relating to natural resources so as to promote sustainable use of resources to rescue the diminishing ecosystem services.\nAchard, F., Eva, H.

Oil and gas extraction\nIV. Cattle ranching\nV. Agriculture: Cash crops\nVI. Local, National, and International factors: development, land titles, government subsidies to attract corporations into developing countries, trade agreements (NAFTA, CAFTA), civil wars, debt, lack of resources, and lack of law enforcement.\nLargest rainforests worldwide listed in descending order (from largest to smallest).\n- Amazon basin of South America\n- Congo river basin of Central Africa\n- S.E. Asia\n- New Guinea\n- Did you know that tropical rainforests, which cover 6-7% of the earth's surface, contain over half of all the plant and animal species in the world!\n- Did you know that 57% of all rainforests remaining are located in the Neotropics, with 30% located in Brazil.\nOverview of deforestation around the world:\nBetween 1960 and 1990, most of the deforestation occurred globally, with an increasing trend every decade.\n- Brazil has the highest annual rate of deforestation today.\n- Atlantic coast of Brazil has lost 90-95% of its rainforest.\n- Central America has 50% of its rainforests.\n- South America has 70% of its rainforests.\n- Philipines have lost 90% of its rainforests!\n- Madagascar has lost 95% of its rainforests!\n- El Salvador has lost 70-85% of its rainforest due to heavy bombing during the civil war 1984-1985.\n- Sumatra has 15% of its rainforests left.\n- Only 6% of Central Africa's forests are protected by law.\nStatistics on Global Rates of Rainforest Destruction:\n2.4 acres (1 hectare) per second: equivalent to two U.S. football fields\n149 acres (60 hectares) per minute\n214,000 acres (86,000 hectares) per day: an area larger than New York City\n78 million acres (31 million hectares) per year: an area larger than Poland\nOn average, 137 species become extinct everyday; or 50,000 each year!\n*If the current rate of deforestation continues, the world's rain forests will vanish within 100 years- causing unknown effects on global climate and eliminating the majority of plant and animal species on the planet*\nWhat are the consequences of deforestation?\n- Extinctions (loss of biodiversity of microbes (bacteria), plants, insects, animals, indigenous peoples, etc.\n- Habitat fragmentation. This disturbes the animals' habitat and may force them to enter habitats which are already occupied. This can pose many problems such as territorial conflicts, homelessness (loss of habitat), lack of food availability, migration disturbances, etc.\n- Soil erosion occurs when trees and plants are removed; the rain water washes the nutrients in the top soil away.\n- Changes in watershed geomorphology.\n- Desertification (dry, hot, arid conditions).\n- Edge effects can change microclimates (small climates) which affect endemic species (native species which can only live in specific environmental and habitat conditions).\n- Climate change (more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, thus increasing the effects of global warming).\n- Pollution (ground, water and air pollution from oil extraction and mining chemicals).\n- Loss of culture (indigenous peoples subsistence living in the rainforest). People who live in the rainforest depend on the natural environment for food, shelter, materials for cooking, clothing, etc. If the forest is cut down or if their environment becomes polluted from oil extraction and mining, they are forced to move or risk starvation and sickness.\n- Displacement of people (loss of farmland, forest resources, etc).\n- Social conflicts and struggles over land and natural resources.\n- Conflicts over racial and ethnic rights.\n- Poisoning from oil and mining waste.\n- Economic uncertainty (price fluctuations and high interest rates on outstanding international loans with The World Bank and International Monetary Fund.\nWhat can we do to STOP or at least lessen the amount of deforestation and conserve our own use of natural resources such as wood, oil and gas, electricity, minerals and elements, and water? Brainstorm...here's a start:\n- Always use both sides of paper when writing, drawing, photo-copying, faxing, etc.\n- Recycle paper, cans, glass, and plastic.\n- Read the newspaper on-line.\n- Buy paper products made from recycled paper: notebook paper, paper towels, toilet paper, books, etc.\n- Use pencils until they are stubs! Think of pencils as gold (you'll never lose them if you do).\n- Encourage your parents, relatives, and friends to buy furniture and wood that is Certified. That means the wood was legally cut-down.\n- If you buy a product and you notice they use wood chips to package it, write to the company and suggest they use another packaging material.\n- Trees get cut down for cattle to graze. Instead of eating meat, think of eating other sources of protein such as fish, soy, beans, whole-wheat, and nuts.\n- Buy organic fruits and vegetables. That means there are no insecticides or pesticides (poisonous chemicals) sprayed on the food. If these chemicals kill insects and pests that try and eat the vegetables, think about how harmful they can be to you and the environment.\n- Instead of buying gold or diamonds, which are mined and cause environmental damage, consider jewelry that is made from materials that are not mined...such as glass.\n- Encourage your parents, relatives, and friends to drive fuel efficient cars that get good gas mileage. Hybrid and bio-diesel cars get great mileage and use less or no gasoline.\n- Even better, whenever possible, walk, bike, carpool or use mass transit (bus or train).\n- Save electricity by turning off lights, t.v., radio, computer, etc when you are not using them.\n- Save water by NOT taking baths; instead take quick showers (turning off the water while you soap up) and then turning it back on to rinse quickly.\n- While washing your hands and brushing your teeth, turn off the water. You'll save gallons if you do.\n- When washing the dishes or your parent's car, turn off the water while washing it with soap. Rinse quickly after washing.\n- Hmmm, can you think of other ways to conserve wood, oil and gas, electricity, minerals and elements, and water, etc...? Brainstorm with your pen pal or a family member.\nOkay, now show YOURSELF what you have LEARNED by answering the following questions:\n- What does deforestation mean? (Hint: The prefix de- means to remove or reduce).\n2. Why does deforestation happen? For what purpose(s)?\n3. The largest rainforest in the world is located in:\na.) The Philipines\nb.) The Congo Basin in Central Africa\nd.) The Amazon Basin of South America\n4. If 2 U.S. football fields are destroyed every second, how many football fields are destroyed in 5 seconds?\n5. If 50,000 species become extinct every year, how many will become extinct in half a year?\n6. T or F: Rainforests contain over half of all plant and animal species in the world?\n7. Fill in the blank: One environmental consequence of deforestation is __________. This occurs when heavy rains wash nutrients from the soil.\n8. Name two things you can do as a global citizen to decrease deforestation.\n9. Biodiversity refers to:\na.) The loss of animals and plants\nb.) A variety, or many different kinds of living things\nc.) When animals lose their living space or habitat\nd.) An increase in the earth's temperature\n10. Fill in the blank: Indigenous people _______ in the rainforest. They depend on the forest for their food, clothing, medicine, cooking and building materials.\nAnswers are located after the references (please don't look until you have completed all 10 questions).\nPen Pal Letter: Imagine you're in class and your teacher reads an article about a U.S. company which is deforesting a rainforest in Brazil. Your teacher encourages you and your classmates to write letters to the company. Using the information you have learned in this lesson, write your letter to convince the company to STOP the deforestation.

40	searching for absorbent materials what was first commercial use super absorbent polymers	In the early 1970s, super absorbent polymers were first used commercially in disposable hygienic products, specifically feminine sanitary napkins and adult incontinence products, rather than their originally intended use for soil amendment applications.	['Until the 1980s, water-absorbing materials were cellulosic or fiber-based products. Choices were tissue paper, cotton, sponge, and fluff pulp. The water retention capacity of these types of materials is only 20 times their weight – at most.\nIn the early 1960s, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) was conducting work on materials to improve water conservation in soils. They developed a resin based on the grafting of acrylonitrile polymer onto the backbone of starch molecules (i.e. starch-grafting). The hydrolyzed product of the hydrolysis of this starch-acrylonitrile co-polymer gave water absorption greater than 400 times its weight. Also, the gel did not release liquid water the way that fiber-based absorbents do. The polymer came to be known as “Super Slurper”. The USDA gave the technical know-how to several USA companies for further development of the basic technology. A wide range of grating combinations was attempted including work with acrylic acid, acrylamide, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).\nSince Japanese companies were excluded by the USDA, they started independent research using starch, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), acrylic acid, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and isobutylene maleic anhydride (IMA).\nEarly global participants in the development of super-absorbent chemistry included Dow Chemical, Hercules, General Mills Chemical, DuPont, National Starch & Chemical, Enka (Akzo), Sanyo Chemical, Sumitomo Chemical, Kao, Nihon Starch, and Japan Explain.\nIn the early 1970s, the super absorbent polymer was used commercially for the first time – not for soil amendment applications as originally intended – but for disposable hygienic products. The first product markets were feminine sanitary napkins and adult incontinence products.\nIn 1978, Park Davis (d.b.a. Professional Medical Products) used super absorbent polymers in sanitary napkins.\nThe super absorbent polymer was first used in Europe in a baby diaper in 1982 when Schickendanz and Beghin-Say added the material to the absorbent core. Shortly thereafter, UniCharm introduced super absorbent baby diapers in Japan while Proctor & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark in the USA began to use the material.\nThe development of super absorbent technology and performance has been largely led by demands in the disposable hygiene segment. Strides in absorption performance have allowed the development of the ultra-thin baby diaper which uses a fraction of the materials – particularly fluff pulp – which earlier disposable diapers consumed.\nOver the years, technology has progressed so that there is little if any starch-grafted super absorbent polymer used in disposable hygienic products. These super absorbents typically are cross-linked acrylic homopolymers (usually Sodium neutralized).\nSuperabsorbents used in soil amendments applications tend to be cross-linked acrylic-acrylamide copolymers (usually Potassium neutralized). Besides granular super absorbent polymers, ARCO Chemical developed a super absorbent fiber technology in the early 1990s. This technology was eventually sold to Camelot Absorbents. There are super absorbent fibers commercially available today. While significantly more expensive than granular polymers, the superabsorbent fibers offer technical advantages in certain niche markets including cable wrap, medical devices, and food packaging.\nIt mixes with soil to increase the soil’s capacity for holding water (with water gel form which stays in the soil for months) and making it available to plants. This improved soil readily releases moisture, along with water-soluble nutrients, to plant roots on demand.']	['<urn:uuid:4536df3d-ae7d-40c8-8e0a-9d9a8716ff31>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	12	33	520
41	list equipment tools materials used create custom furniture manufacturing workshop	Cabinetmakers work with a variety of tools including a saw table, drum sander, and dust extraction system. They also use hand tools like laminate trimmers, cordless drills, finish staplers and jigsaws. For assembly, they work with wood glue, nails, screws, dowels and other fasteners to create finished furniture and cabinets.	"[""What is a Cabinetmaker?\nCabinetmakers are artisans.\nThere is something very special about a handmade piece of furniture for your den or living room, or custom made cabinetry for your kitchen or bathroom. Unlike prefabricated pieces, fine wood furniture is built to last for generations.\nA cabinetmaker will build to a customer's specifications, providing the customer with original drawings of what the finished product will look like. Various woods, materials and styles can be used.\nWhat does a Cabinetmaker do?\nBefore the art of industrial design came to be, cabinetmakers were responsible for the entire creation process of a piece of furniture, from its initial conception to its shape and colour all the way to final production.\nSome of the more famous cabinetmakers like George Hepplewhite, Thomas Chippendale and Thomas Sheraton even authored books about the art of furniture making, featuring their designs and compositions.\nWhat is the difference between a carpenter and a cabinetmaker? While both professions master the art of working with wood, it is the cabinet maker who goes one step further by focusing on the finer details of the wood and what one can do with it. It is this attention to detail that distinguishes them from carpenters.\nCarpenters concentrate on much larger projects, such as framing a house, building a deck etc., while cabinetmakers focus on detail work, more complex building materials and the construction of furniture pieces and cabinets used within a house.\nCabinetmakers work with a vast array of tools like a saw table, drum sander, and dust extraction system. They also carry with them a selection of hand tools like laminate trimmers, cordless drills, finish staplers and jigsaws. They work with wood glue, nails, screws, dowels and other fasteners to create finished furniture and cabinets.\nMeasuring the client's interior space accurately is imperative, whether it's for making kitchen cabinets that fit perfectly within the space available, or making a piece of furniture with exact proportions. Creating drawings for the client of what the finished piece will look like is necessary in order for the client to visualize and proceed with the project.\nBefore starting any project, it is necessary for the cabinetmaker to prepare a list of what project materials, tools and type of wood that he/she will need. This is something that will not only save a cabinetmaker's time, but will help to keep the project within budget for the client.\nAside from the technical prerequisites, a cabinetmaker also requires other skills, such as precision, patience, perseverance, dedication, and pride of workmanship. A project, depending on the skill of the carpenter and the difficulty in making a particular piece, may take a couple of days or stretch up to weeks or months at a time.\nWhat is the workplace of a Cabinetmaker like?\nCabinetmakers can work in either a commercial or a residential setting. They can be self-employed or employed by furniture manufacturing and repair companies, construction firms or cabinetmaking contractors. There are other venues as well, such as crafting wood interiors for boats, planes, or hotels.\nNearly all of the work is done indoors in large, well-lit and well-ventilated areas.\nCabinetmakers are also known as:\nCabinet Maker Cabinet Builder Furniture Maker Furniture Builder""]"	['<urn:uuid:29c7337a-0c0d-45e6-8e0d-b36b4c711579>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	10	50	533
42	I work near loud machines. When should I wear earplugs?	You should use hearing protection when noise levels exceed 85 decibels. A simple test: if you need to raise your voice to speak to someone three feet away, the noise levels may be exceeding 85 decibels.	['October is National Protect Your Hearing Month\ninformation provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nSPRINGFIELD, Ill. (October 25, 2019) – The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 22 million workers are exposed to potentially damaging noise at work each year. Much can be done to mitigate damage to people’s hearing, which is the message the Illinois Department of Labor (IDOL) is stressing during October—National Protect Your Hearing Month.\nExposure to loud noise can kill the nerve endings in the inner ear, causing permanent hearing damage. While devices such as hearing aids can assist, nothing can reverse hearing damage once it occurs. Noise-induced hearing damage affects a person’s ability to hear high frequency sounds and understand speech.\nBut how loud is too loud? According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), if you need to raise your voice to speak to someone three feet away, noise levels may be exceeding 85 decibels. Long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 decibels can cause hearing loss.\nSome situations pose obvious dangers for hearing damage. Working around jet engines, operating a jack hammer, or using a chainsaw for long periods all qualify as extreme noise environments. But plenty of other less obvious workplaces can pose a risk as well.\n“We had never been concerned about noise levels at our jobsites because we always felt the levels would be below the permissible exposure level,” said Stephennie Brumley, Health and Safety Officer for Andrews Engineering in Springfield.\nHowever, about a year ago, Andrew Engineering began working with Illinois OSHA—a division of IDOL—in pursuit of the top national workplace safety ranking, which it achieved earlier this month. Illinois OSHA’s On-Site Consultation Program staff explained that as part of the process, testing would need to be done to ensure that jobsite noise levels were below allowable levels.\nAfter completing noise testing, Andrews Engineering found peak levels were high enough to warrant a hearing conservation program for its field staff, something Brumley says the company has now instituted.\nWhile specially calibrated instruments are used to do OSHA testing for noise levels, a slightly less sophisticated device is easily available for anyone curious about the noise levels around them. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health offers a free download of a sound level meter for any IOS-operating device.\nThe louder the noise, the less time you need to be exposed to it to suffer hearing damage. A worker who is consistently exposed to 85 decibels for an eight-hour shift, should be provided some form of hearing protection or mitigation.\nNoise mitigation can take several forms and can often be accomplished without great expense or engineering. Some simple steps include keeping machinery properly lubricated, choosing low-noise tools and machinery, and placing barriers between the noise source and workers. Employers can also reduce the amount of time a worker spends in a noisy area and provide quiet areas for relief from hazardous noise levels.\nIf it is not possible to reduce noise to safe levels, hearing protection devices such as earplugs and earmuffs should be used to protect workers.\nMore information is available on the Illinois OSHA website.']	['<urn:uuid:b7c2e83e-f325-4ff2-9fcf-bab5e16cf218>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	10	36	527

44	What's Erin Virtue's journey in the High Performance program?	Erin Virtue has spent 11 seasons coaching in the High Performance program, mentoring athletes in the Select (U16), Youth (U18) and Junior (U20) age groups. She served as head coach of the U.S. Girls' Youth National Team that won silver at the 2016 NORCECA U18 Continental Championship. In spring 2017, she joined Karch Kiraly's staff and is also an associate head coach at Northwestern University. She started as a player herself, being selected as captain of the USA Collegiate National Team in May 2004.	['Like the players, the coaches at the 2018 USA Volleyball High Performance Championships are being evaluated and developed throughout the 10 days in Tulsa.\nThere are 60 coaches working with USA teams within the USAV High Performance program.\nWho are they? At this level they’ve been active doing HP tryouts for years. They’ve done multiple programs. If everything lines up and they look like a good coach to represent USA, they are brought in. Newer coaches are paired with more experienced staffs. This allows for new people to join the program and be developed as coaches at the same time.\n“This is our charge,” said Heath Hoke, USAV Director of High Performance. “Keep raising the bar, have a steady flow of coaches who are ready for our youth and junior national teams, the college national teams and then ultimately the senior national team.”\nSo, there is development within the coaching staffs, but there are also mentors to help all coaches.\n“This is our third year of the mentor program,” Hoke said. “We bring in senior, respected, well-established coaches of the game to actually work with the coaches. We have the one environment that is safe to have someone over your shoulder who can say, ‘Hey, try this. Take this risk.’ It’s a learning environment. In any other regular season – club, college, high school – they have success on the line.\n- Ken Shibuya, associate head coach for the Stanford University’s men’s program\n- Cecile Reynaud, former long-time head coach at Florida State University\n- Aldis Berzins, 1984 U.S. Olympic gold medalist; 1996 U.S. Olympic women’s assistant coach\n“The optimum is being mentored and having the coach right there with you,” Hoke continued. “We have this one protected environment where we can create an opportunity for coaches to get outside of their comfort zone and take some risks.”\nThe USA and region teams have amazing coaching staffs, but imagine if you’re a kid coming to Tulsa and you look up and find an Olympic superstar giving you direction.\nJeff Nygaard and Danielle Scott-Arruda are coaching USA squads in Tulsa.\nNygaard is a three-time U.S. Olympian, a middle blocker for the U.S. Men’s team in 1996 and 2000, who then switched over to beach, partnering with Dain Blanton, at the 2004 Olympic Games. Now he is the head coach at the University of Southern California. Scott-Arruda played in five straight Olympic Games (1996-2012), earning silver medals in 2008 and 2012. Two legends on the court.\nHP is like a box of chocolates; you never know who you’re going to get as a coach.\nIn fact, John Speraw, the head coach of the U.S. Men’s National Team, was an assistant coach at the youth and junior levels in High Performance. But the perfect illustration of the Path to the Podium for coaches is Erin Virtue.\n“Erin Virtue has worked tryouts. She was an assistant coach at this program (HPCs), has coached the Youth National Team and Junior National Team and is now one of the assistant coaches this quad of the Women’s National Team, so there’s a path,” Hoke said.\nVirtue has spent 11 seasons coaching in the High Performance program, mentoring athletes in the Select (U16), Youth (U18) and Junior (U20) age groups.

I was selected as a captain by my coaches John Cook, Lee Maes and Paula Weishoff. It was such a proud moment for me to represent USA and one that I won’t soon forget,” she said in a Q&A with the mgoblue.com.\n“It is an absolute honor to work with USAV High Performance and to represent our country through USA Volleyball,” she said. “It is my passion to coach the game that I love and I will forever be grateful for opportunity to work with such talented athletes in the USAV High Performance Pipeline.”']	['<urn:uuid:9a3331d7-768a-4c5e-82fe-7935d38deda7>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	9	84	717
45	rtl sdr dongle internal crystal replacement tcxo stability specifications comparison	While the internal 28.8MHz quartz crystal in RTL-SDR dongles has poor temperature stability, replacing it with a TCXO can achieve ±1ppm stability from 0C-55C. This is significantly better than standard crystal oscillators which typically show ±25 ppm drift over 0-70C range.	['RF filter design is a piece of cake these days thanks to computer design and simulation tools.

(Or at least the ones who aren’t in-the-know 😉 )\nWith some inspiration from The Fifth Element and Iron Man, here’s a voice-activated light switch that provides the illusion of a more advanced artificial intelligence, with the simplicity of “the clapper”.\nI’ve gotten a lot of questions on the blog about the new version of the MHS5200A function generators available on eBay. Viewer Tolga was kind enough to send one in to me to review and tear down. Although some improvements have been made over the older models, there are some concerning issues with these new models too!\nI recently designed an infrared sensor board (dubbed “IRis”) for my friend’sDefcon talk. This video walks through the circuit design of the photodiode amplifier, and discusses some of the pitfalls associated with photodiode amplifier design.\nSchematics, BOM, and KiCAD design files for the described IRis board are available on github.\nEver tried searching through your datasheets for the motional parameters of that quartz crystal you just bought? Good luck! Vendors simply don’t specify these parameters to general end users, and for most applications that’s OK. But for high Q oscillator and filter design, measuring and matching crystals can be important.\nThis video discusses crystal motional parameters, how to measure them with a crystal impedance meter, and finally examines the measured values of 150+ real world crystals.\nBelow are some interesting correlations/statistics gathered from the measured data; raw measurement data is available here.\nAverage C0 capacitance for each crystal holder type\nAverage motional resistance vs frequency\nAverage motional inductance vs frequency\nAverage unloaded Q vs frequency\nAverage unloaded Q for each crystal holder type\nUnloaded Q of glass-sealed crystals vs average unloaded Q\nOverall statistical analysis of unloaded crystal Qs\nReferences and additional reading:\nCrystal motional parameters and relevant equations\nIts hard to beat the cost and versatility of the ubiquitous RTL-SDR dongles, but the temperature stability of their reference oscillators isn’t sufficient for some applications. While the internal 28.8MHz quartz crystal in these units can be replaced by a high qualitytemperature compensatedoscillator, these tend to be relatively expensive and/or difficult to source.\nHere’s a scratch-built 28.8MHz TCXO capable of +-1ppm stability from 0C-55C; best of all, it’s not only easy to build, but is designed entirely from readily available and inexpensive components. For improved temperature stability, the main oscillator can even be replaced with one of many commercially available TCXOs!\nToday we explore the use of oscillator synthesis software (Genesys) for practical crystal oscillator design, and the impact of the Randall-Hock correction formula on linear open loop analysis accuracy.\nHere’s an inexpensive precision peak detector circuit that accurately tracks the peak voltage of input signals at frequencies up to 100kHz and has zero voltage droop over an indefinite period of time…no microcontrollers required!\nThe following circuit uses a dual comparator, three op amps, and a digital potentiometer to provide two peak detection outputs: one “real-time” peak output, accurate to within 2% for input signals up to 100kHz, and one maximum peak output which outputs the maximum peak voltage seen since the last reset:', 'TCXO, Temperature Compensated Crystal Oscillator\n- the TCXO, temperature compensated crystal oscillator is used for providing a much higher levels of temperature stability than are possible with a normal crystal oscillator.\nThe TCXO, Temperature Compensated Crystal Oscillator (Xtal oscillator) is a form of crystal oscillator used where a precision frequency source is required within a small space and at reasonable cost.\nBy applying temperature compensation within the crystal oscillator module, it is possible to considerably improve on the basic performance of the oscillator.\nIn view of their usefulness, a wide range is available from many suppliers in a whole variety of packages from a host of different surface mount varieties through to through hole mounted ones, some of which are compatible with the dual in line format used for many through hole mounted integrated circuits.\nEffect of temperature\nAlthough crystal oscillators offer a highly stable form of oscillator, they are nevertheless affected by temperature. The cut of the actual crystal element from the overall grown crystal can help to minimize the effects of temperature, but they are still affected to some degree. For a crystal cut known as the AT cut, the drift with temperature can be minimized around normal ambient temperature, but the rate of drift will rise above and below this.\nTypical frequency / temperature curve for quartz crystal\nThe effects of temperature are, to a large degree, repeatable and definable. Therefore it is possible to compensate for many of the effects using a temperature compensated crystal oscillator, TCXO.\nA typical comparison of the typical or expected performance levels is given in the table below:\n|Temperature range||Basic crystal oscillator||TCXO|\n|0C to 70C||±25 ppm||±1.5 ppm|\n|-20°C to 70°C||± 30ppm||± 2.5 ppm|\n|-40°C to 85°C||± 40ppm||± 3 ppm|\nNote: These performance figures are very generalised and can only be used for a rough guide. Exact figures will depend upon the item used and figures for these should be gained from the manufacturers datasheets.\nA TCXO adjusts the frequency of the oscillator to compensate for the changes that will occur as a result of temperature changes. To achieve this, the main element within a TCXO is a Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillator (VCXO). This is connected to a circuit that senses the temperature and applies a small correction voltage to the oscillator as shown below.\nBlock diagram for a typical TCXO\nThere are a number of different elements that comprise the overall temperature controlled oscillator:\n- Compensation network: The compensation network is the key to the operation of the whole system. An approximate curve for the temperature frequency response of the oscillator is seen above. The actual curve can be expressed approximately in the form of a 3rd order polynomial expression, although a more accurate representation takes into account some non-linearities and works out to be close to a 5th order polynomial. The compensation network needs to sense the temperature and produce a voltage that is the inverse of this.\nEarly designs would have used analogue circuitry and often directly used a network of capacitors, resistors and thermistors to directly control the frequency of oscillation. This type of circuit included both blocks on the diagram of the compensation network and the crystal frequency pulling block.\nCompensating voltage for TCXO temperature linearisation\nCurrently technologies typically adopt an indirect approach where the temperature is sensed in the compensation network, and a voltage is generated that provides a frequency change that is the inverse of the temperature curve. This can be achieved using analogue components, but current technologies often incorporate some form of digital signal processing to be able to generate a far more accurate response, with the possibility of linearising units separately by programming a ROM with the response of the particular oscillator. The DSP circuitry is often contained within a special ASIC to enable it to be tailored to suit the application without draining too much current.\n- Oscillator pulling circuit: Once the voltage has been generated, this is applied to a circuit that can pull the frequency of the crystal oscillator. Typically this incorporates a varactor diode and some low pass filtering.\n- Crystal oscillator : The oscillator circuit is normally a standard circuit, but one that is designed to give the operating operating conditions for the crystal with ideal drive levels, etc.\n- Voltage regulator: In order to prevent external voltage changes from introducing unwanted frequency shifts, the overall TCXO should incorporate a voltage regulator which itself should not introduce unwanted temperature effects.\n- Buffer amplifier: A buffer amplifier is required to give the increased drive to the output. It should provide isolation to the crystal oscillator from any external load changes that may be seen.\nAdditionally TCXOs normally have an external adjustment to enable the frequency to be reset periodically. This enables the effects of the ageing of the crystal to be removed. The period between calibration adjustments will depend upon the accuracy required, but may typically be six months or a year. Shorter periods may be used if very high levels of accuracy are required.\nSome of the main performance figures are summarised below:\n- TCXO PPM performance: The TCXO temperature performance is better than that of a normal crystal oscillator. Typically figures of between 10 and 40 times improvement can often be seen. Typical figures are given in the table above for the different temperature ranges. Figures of better than ±1.5 ppm over a 0 to 70°C temperature range are difficult to achieve as they then fall into a high precision category where costs increase significantly.\n- Power dissipation: The power dissipation of a TCXO will be greater than an ordinary oscillator in view of the additional circuitry required. Additionally the cost is greater. It should also be remembered that it will take a short while after start up for the oscillator to stabilize. This may be of the order of 100 ms, or possibly longer, dependent upon the design.\n- TCXO package: TCXOs can be supplied in a variety of packages dependent upon the way they have been designed and the requirements of the end user. The most common form of construction is to construct the circuit on a small printed circuit board that can be house in a plat metal package. This is then suitable for mounting onto the main circuit board of the overall equipment. As the crystal itself is sealed, this means that sealing of the overall TCXO package is not critical, or even required for most applications.\nPackage sizes such as 5x3.2x1.5 mm or 5x3.5x1 mm are widely used for TCXOs and smaller packages available if required.\n- Output format and level: With many TCXOs being used for driving digital circuits, most of the small oscillator packages produce what is termed a clipped sine wave. This is suitable for driving a logic circuit, although in many cases it is wise to put it through a logic buffer to ensure it is sufficiently square. Often the output is an open collector circuit. If a sine wave output is required, then this must be chosen at the outset and it will limit the choice available.\n- Power requirements: The actual power requirements will depend upon the particular device. Many operate from supplies of 3 V, and may draw as little as 2 mA, although this will depend upon the general type, the manufacturer and the particular device chosen.\nAlthough temperature compensated crystal oscillators are normally referred to in this manner, occasionally more detailed descriptions are used. This has resulted in the variety of techniques that can be used to provide the temperature compensation.\n- ADTCXO: This is an Analogue Digital TCXO. This form of TCXO has been widely used in cell phones. This uses analogue technology to provide temperature correction to the oscillator. It has the advantage that changes take place slowly and no phase jumps are experienced as occurs with some all-digital types.\n- DTCXO: As may be guessed, this is a digital TCXO. It uses a temperature sensor and then logic and mathematical functions use digital circuitry along with a look up table. The resulting digital correction figure is converted to an analogue signal using a digital to analogue converter, DAC.\n- DCXO: This is a form of oscillator where any correction is calculated by the host processor within the equipment. In this way, the TCXO is not a separate entity, but the processing is incorporated within that of the overall equipment. This can help save costs in some instances.\n- MCXO: This form of TCXO uses a microprocessor to provide a considerably increased level of processing to provide more accurate compensation under a variety of circumstances. While performance is a little better, costs are above those of the other forms.\nTCXOs are widely used where accurate frequency sources are needed. They are less expensive and smaller than oven controlled oscillators, as such they offer an ideal solution for many portable units requiring a reasonably accurate source.\nBy Ian Poole\nWant more like this?

46	I'm new to conservation and wondering about the challenges of setting up wildlife corridors - what are the key social and environmental issues involved, and what specific solutions are being implemented to make them work?	Setting up wildlife corridors involves both environmental and socioeconomic challenges. On the environmental side, corridors must be properly designed to maintain habitat quality and connectivity for different species. The social aspects include building support among various interest groups and addressing governance issues. To make corridors work, specific solutions are being implemented, such as road mitigation measures (including lowered speed limits and wildlife-friendly culverts), roadside improvements for safer crossing, land conservation efforts, and local land use planning. For example, in Vermont, they're using creative zoning strategies and carefully crafted subdivision regulations to ensure new development doesn't negatively impact wildlife crossings.	"[""By Anthony Anderson, Clinton N. Jenkins\nThe fragmenting of habitats is endangering animal populations and degrading or destroying many plant populations in the course of the global. to deal with this challenge, conservationists have more and more grew to become to organic corridors, parts of land put aside to facilitate the circulate of species and ecological approaches. in spite of the fact that, whereas enormous quantities of hall projects are lower than means world wide, there's little functional details to lead their layout, position, and administration. Applying Nature's Design deals a accomplished evaluation of present wisdom on corridors, their layout, and their implementation. Anthony B. Anderson and Clinton N. Jenkins learn quite a few conceptual and functional concerns linked to corridors and supply special case reviews from worldwide. Their paintings considers the way to deal with and govern corridors, easy methods to construct help between a variety of curiosity teams for corridors, and the stumbling blocks to implementation. as well as assessing a variety of environmental and ecological demanding situations, the authors are the 1st to contemplate the significance of socioeconomic and political concerns in developing and keeping corridors.\nRead or Download Applying Nature's Design: Corridors as a Strategy for Biodiversity Conservation (Issues, Cases, and Methods in Biodiversity Conservation) PDF\nBest logic & language books\nScientists and mathematicians often describe the improvement in their box as a approach that incorporates enlargement of recommendations. Logicians generally deny the potential for conceptual enlargement and the coherence of this description. Meir Buzaglo's leading edge research proposes a manner of increasing common sense to incorporate the stretching of thoughts, whereas enhancing the rules which it appears block this risk.\nThis quantity examines the proposal of an analytic facts as a traditional deduction, suggesting that the proof's worth could be understood as its common shape - an idea with major implications to proof-theoretic semantics.\nF. P. Ramsey was once a remarkably inventive and refined thinker who within the briefest of educational careers (he died in 1930 at 26) made major contributions to good judgment, philosophy of arithmetic, philosophy of language and selection thought. His few released papers exhibit him to be a determine of similar significance to Russell, Carnap and Wittgenstein within the historical past of analytical philosophy.\nI used to be more than pleased whilst in 1997 Fiachra lengthy got here to spend a part of his sabbatical go away on the documents Maurice Blondel at Louvain-Ia-Neuve. This allowed him to assemble and entire his translation of 3 vital articles from Maurice Blondel, referred to as the thinker of Aix-en-Province. those 3 articles fonn a cohesion: they make particular yes elements of the strategy utilized in the good thesis of 1893, motion.\nExtra resources for Applying Nature's Design: Corridors as a Strategy for Biodiversity Conservation (Issues, Cases, and Methods in Biodiversity Conservation)\nCorridors in Canada’s Bow Valley provide linkage for wildlife moving among several protected areas and other available habitat in the northern Rocky Mountains (case 4). • A network of corridors in Florida, USA, is designed to connect Florida panther populations in protected areas located in the southern part of the state to habitat on private lands in central Florida and, ultimately, to protected areas farther north (case 3). Ideally, a biodiversity vision for an ecoregion should be developed before beginning efforts to design corridors, so as to focus scarce resources on key biodiversity targets and in priority areas.\nNodes may consist of protected areas or simply larger habitat fragments that have not been converted. They provide resources to support individual animals, populations, communities, or ecological processes along the corridor length. Nodes become important when animals spend so much time in the corridor that they need to forage or take shelter. The desired area of nodes, and the resources they contain, depends on which species they are expected to support and for how long. Habitat Quality Closely related to corridor connectivity is the issue of quality, which refers to how closely corridor habitat approximates intact or interior habitat.\nProponents also argue that corridors will increasingly be necessary to allow movement of entire biotic communities in response to climate change (Harris and Gallagher 1989, Hobbs and Hopkins 1991, Noss 1991). To do this, however, corridors would have to be designed to include space for each species in the community to live and breed as well as to move (Simberloff et al. 1992). Because each species has distinct ecological requirements, in practice corridors designed for climate change probably would act as a selective filter, allowing some but not all species to migrate (Hobbs and Hopkins 1991)."", 'Building Corridors and Critical Paths for Vermont Wildlife\nHow do moose cross the road in Vermont? That\'s a question the National Wildlife Federation\'s Northeast Regional Center is helping answer through the ""Critical Paths"" Project.\nWorking with NWF\'s state affiliate, the Vermont Natural Resources Council, as well as the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife, Vermont Agency of Transportation, and U.S Forest Service, Green Mountain and Finger Lakes National Forest, NWF is studying the best places for corridors to help wildlife have room to roam.\nIdentifying Priority Wildlife Corridors in Vermont\nCurrently, the Critical Paths Project has identified 11 priority zones out of the 38 wildlife crossings along the spine of Vermont’s Green Mountains. Once the priority zones are identified, we then work with transportation officials to implement practical solutions that help reconnect habitat and protect wildlife.\nHow Were the Priority Zones Chosen?\nThe project uses a combination of cutting-edge computer modeling and good old fashion on-site field work to determine where bottlenecks and impermeable crossings exist that can impede the free movement of animals.\nNational Wildlife Federation worked with a team of state biologists and conservation organizations to identify 11 critical ""Priority Crossing Zones"" along the spine of the Green Mountains that are essential to south-north wildlife movement.\nThe researchers assessed the physical features of the crossings and the natural features of adjacent landscapes. They also tracked and monitored wildlife movement patterns at each crossing over an extended period of time.\nWhat is Going to Happen Next in the Priority Zones?\nWe\'re working with resource professionals, transportation experts and local citizens to develop key strategies to make Vermont\'s roads safer and improve wildlife habitat connectivity.\nThese strategies include:\nRoad mitigation. Gaps in guardrails allow animals to exit the road quickly. Less salt can be used. Along with lowering speed limits, improved road signage warns motorists they are entering a wildlife crossing zone. Culverts (water pipes under the road) constructed with wildlife in mind allow reptiles, amphibians, and small mammals such as fox and coyote to pass under the road. Over- and underpasses allow animals to pass above or below traffic.\nRoadside improvements for traffic safety and wildlife crossing. Removing trees and thick brush along the shoulder of the road improves visibility for drivers. Removing salt licks reduces the time wildlife spend near roadsides. Roadside vegetation and other improvements are made to encourage wildlife to cross at places where it is safe.\nLand conservation. Conserving land adjacent to a critical road crossing may afford wildlife several safe crossing options and promote habitat connectivity.\nLocal land use planning. Towns and regions can incorporate specific provisions within their plans and related ordinances that provide for crossings for wildlife and safer roads for people. For example, carefully crafted subdivision regulations and creative zoning strategies, such as wildlife overlay districts, can ensure that new development minimizes the negative affects to wildlife crossings.\nAs wildlife habitat comes under increasing pressure from road development and climate change, the work of the Critical Paths Project will help enhance migration pathways, strengthen wildlife populations, and reduce animal-vehicle collisions.\nClimate Change and Wildlife Corridors\nSince 1970, the Northeast has been warming at a rate of 0.5 degrees F per decade, with winter temperatures rising 1.3 degrees F per decade. This warming trend is changing the vegetation and the migratory behavior of animals.\nSpecies that survive in northern temperate climates are moving farther north to find suitable habitat and sources of food that no longer exist where they are. They are encountering roads all along the way.\nIn a warming world, connecting migratory corridors for wildlife is more crucial than ever.\nCritical Paths Support\nThe Critical Paths Project was made possible with funding from the Wildlife Conservation Society, Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife and generous donations from individuals.\nYou can help us protect wildlife from habitat fragmentation and other threats.

47	human cell therapy commercial applications safety concerns clinical trials development	Commercial applications include drug discovery and development through partnerships like Bit Bio's collaboration with Charles River Laboratories, where human cells are used for research. Regarding safety, both embryonic stem cells and iPSCs pose concerns - they must have their self-renewal properties controlled to prevent tumor formation. No iPS cells have yet reached clinical grade standards required for patient use, and regulatory approval from bodies like FDA and EMA will take time due to standardization challenges and the need to fully understand cell behavior.	['Bit Bio, the new startup that pitches itself as the “enter button for the keyboard to the software of life,” only needed three weeks to raise its latest $41.5 million round of funding.\nOriginally known as Elpis Biotechnology and named for the Greek goddess of hope, the Cambridge, England-based company was founded by Mark Kotter in 2016 to commercialize technology that can reduce the cost and increase the production capacity for human cell lines. These cells can be used in targeted gene therapies and as a method to accelerate drug discovery at pharmaceutical companies.\nThe company’s goal is to be able to reproduce every human cell type.\n“We’re just at a very crucial time in biology and medicine and the bottleneck that has become really clear is a scalable source of robust human cells,” said Kotter. “For drug discovery this is important. When you look at failure rates in clinical trials they’re at an all-time high… that’s in direct contradiction to the massive advancements in biotechnology in research and the field.”\nIn the 17 years since scientists completely mapped the human genome, and eight years since scientists began using the gene editing technology known as CRISPR to edit genetic material, there’s been an explosion of treatments based on individual patient’s genetic material and new drugs developed to more precisely target the mechanisms that pathogens use to spread through organisms.\nThese treatments and the small molecule drugs being created to stop the spread of pathogens or reduce the effects of disease require significant testing before coming to market — and Bit Bio’s founder thinks his company can both reduce the time to market and offer new treatments for patients.\nIt’s a thesis that had investors like the famous serial biotech entrepreneur, Richard Klausner, who served as the former director of the National Cancer Institute and founder of revolutionary biotech companies like Lyell Immunopharma, Juno and Grail, leaping at the chance to invest in Bit Bio’s business, according to Kotter.\nJoining Klausner are the famous biotech investment firms Foresite Capital, Blueyard Capital and Arch Venture Partners.\n“Bit Bio is based on beautiful science. The company’s technology has the potential to bring the long-awaited precision and reliability of engineering to the application of stem cells,” said Klausner in a statement. “Bit Bio’s approach represents a paradigm shift in biology that will enable a new generation of cell therapies, improving the lives of millions.”\nKotter’s own path to develop the technology which lies at the heart of Bit Bio’s business began a decade ago in a laboratory in Cambridge University. It was there that he began research building on the revolutionary discoveries of Shinya Yamanaka, which enabled scientists to transform human adult cells into embryonic stem cells.\n“What we did is what Yamanaka did. We turned everything upside down. We want to know how each cell is defined… and once we know that we can flip the switch,” said Kotter. “We find out which transcription factors code for a single cell and we turn it on.”\nKotter said the technology is like uploading a new program into the embryonic stem cell.\nAlthough the company is still in its early days, it has managed to attract a few key customers and launch a sister company based on the technology. That company, Meatable, is using the same process to make lab-grown pork.\nMeatable is the earliest claimant to a commercially viable, patented process for manufacturing meat cells without the need to kill an animal as a prerequisite for cell differentiation and growth.\nOther companies have relied on fetal bovine serum or Chinese hamster ovaries to stimulate cell division and production, but Meatable says it has developed a process where it can sample tissue from an animal, revert that tissue to a pluripotent stem cell, then culture that cell sample into muscle and fat to produce the pork products that palates around the world crave.\n“We know which DNA sequence is responsible for moving an early-stage cell to a muscle cell,” says Meatable chief executive Krijn De Nood.\nIf that sounds similar to Bit Bio, that’s because it’s the same tech — just used to make animal instead of human cells.\nIf Meatable is one way to commercialize the cell differentiation technology, Bit Bio’s partnership with the drug development company Charles River Laboratories is another.\n“We actually do have a revenue-generating business side using human cells for research and drug discovery. We have a partnership with Charles River Laboratories, the large preclinical contract research organization,” Kotter said. “That partnership is where we have given early access to our technology to Charles River… They have their own usual business clients who want them to help with their drug discovery. The big bottleneck at the moment is access to human cells.”\nDrug trials fail because the treatments developed either are toxic or don’t work in humans. The difference is that most experiments to prove how effective the treatments are rely on animal testing before making the leap to human trials, Kotter said.\nThe company is also preparing to develop its own cell therapies, according to Kotter. There, the biggest selling point is the increased precision that Bit Bio can bring to precision medicine, said Kotter. “If you look at these cell therapies at the moment you get mixed bags of cells. There are some that work and some that have dangerous side effects. We think we can be precise [and] safety is the biggest thing at this point.”\nThe company claims that it can produce cell lines in less than a week with 100 percent purity, versus the mixed bags from other companies cell cultures.\n“Our moonshot goal is to develop a platform capable of producing every human cell type. This is possible once we understand the genes governing human cell behaviour, which ultimately form the ‘operating system of life’,” Kotter said in a statement. “This will unlock a new generation of cell and tissue therapies for tackling cancer, neurodegenerative disorders and autoimmune diseases and accelerate the development of effective drugs for a range of conditions. The support of leading deep tech and biotech investors will catalyse this unique convergence of biology and engineering.”', 'Ethics and reprogramming: ethical questions after the discovery of iPS cells\nReprogramming allows us to turn any cell of the body into a stem cell. This discovery surprised many scientists and changed the way they think about how cells develop. Does the new technology also change ethical discussions about stem cell research? What new questions does it raise?\nUse of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) for medical treatment and research is debated because of the moral implications of using human embryos. In 2006, a method was developed for artificially transforming skin cells (and other cell types) into ‘induced pluripotent stem cells’ (iPSCs), cells that have similar abilities as ESCs.\nDo we still need ESCs? Should researchers switch to using iPSCs to avoid moral issues? What moral issues do iPSCs pose?\niPSC treatments will likely require donor’s cells to undergo genetic alterations. Will it be acceptable to people that their cells have been modified?\nMany questions still remain about how cell reprogramming works and how closely/exactly iPSCs resemble ESCs.\nResearchers believe that both iPSCs and ESCs are important in answering how stem cells grow, replicate and create specific types of cells.\nResearch on ESCs has lead to the discovery of iPSCs and has greatly helped understand how iPSCs work. In turn, iPSCs offer new insights into how ESCs naturally control pluripotency and differentiation. Knowing more about both iPSCs and ESCs will greatly help researchers develop reliable methods to control the cells and use them in medical treatments.\nOne benefit to developing treatments with iPSCs is that transplanted iPSCs (made from a patient’s own cells) will not be rejected by the immune system.\nA challenge to developing iPSCs treatments is that procedures to make iPSCs will require tailoring to each patient’s genetic background and needs, making iPSC treatments labour intensive and expensive.\nThe practicality of getting iPSC or ESC cell therapies to patients will be challenging. Specialists will need to be hired to deliver treatments and laboratories will need to be built to create and distribute large amounts of cells for treatments.\nIn 2006, Shinya Yamanaka showed that skin cells can be ’reprogrammed’ into stem cells. Like embryonic stem cells, these lab-grown ’induced pluripotent stem cells’ or iPS cells can make all the different cells found in the body. This discovery has led some people to argue that research on human embyronic stem cells is no longer necessary, and that human iPS cells solve the ethical dilemma posed by human embryonic stem research. But many questions remain about how reprogramming works. Most scientists think more research is needed to establish how similar or different iPS cells and embryonic stem cells really are.\nCan we decide today whether iPS cells could or should replace embryonic stem cells? And would using only iPS cells resolve all ethical dilemmas about this research? To answer these questions, we need to consider both current scientific understanding and moral aspects of the issues: Are there any ethically relevant differences between iPS cells and embryonic stem cells?\nMany scientific questions remain about both human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). There is considerable disagreement among scientists about how these two types of cells may compare in terms of safety and likely effectiveness (‘efficacy’) in future cell therapies.\nAs with organ transplants, cells transplanted into the body may be rejected by the patient’s immune system. Since hiPSCs can be made from the patient’s own cells, e.g. skin cells, it is hoped that reprogramming can provide a source of patient-specific specialized cells that would be recognized by the patient’s body and would not be rejected. However, producing tailor-made cells to treat individual patients would be a time-consuming, slow process and is likely to be costly. Many scientists believe it is more likely that large banks of cells with different immune properties will be created so that acceptable matches can be found for most patients. These cell banks could contain cells made from hESCs or hiPSCs.\nSafety standards for cells used in patients\nThe first clinical trials using hESCs are just beginning, focussed on eye disorders. No iPS cells have yet been grown at ‘clinical grade’ – the quality standard required for use in patients.\nBoth hESCs and hiPSCs can self-renew (copy themselves) indefinitely and this property must be turned off to prevent tumours from forming. In addition, the reprogramming techniques involve manipulating the genes inside the cells and hiPSCs may also be affected by the age of the cells they are made from. These issues pose challenges for scientists attempting to grow cells with controlled characteristics for use in patients. Some solutions have been proposed for such problems but further research is needed to assess all the effects of the reprogramming process and produce hiPSCs suitable for clinical use. Since the cells are patient specific, standardization will be a challenge. This means it is likely to be some time before reprogrammed cells will be approved for use in patients by regulatory bodies such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA.\nThe safety and efficacy of hESC- or hiPSC-based therapies are complex issues, and it is not yet possible to draw any conclusions about whether one of these cell types is safer or more valuable for therapeutic use than the other. In both cases, more work is needed to fully understand how the cells behave and how they can be controlled to produce the particular specialized types of cells needed for treating certain diseases.\nAn important ethical consideration is accessibility of any new stem-cell-based therapy. Who should these therapies be available to and when? Will they be available only to rich patients in developed countries, or will they also be accessible to those in developing countries who may not be in a position to pay for the treatment? It seems difficult to identify any clear differences between hESC- or hiPSC-based therapies in this respect. Some points to consider are:\n- Either hESC- or hiPSC-based therapies would need a well-developed healthcare system with the necessary infrastructure for producing and distributing the cells, and highly trained specialists to manage and deliver treatments.\n- hESC-based therapies may not be made available to patients in the countries where use of cells from early embryos is viewed as morally unacceptable. However, it is not yet clear whether such moral objections will in reality prevent patients from obtaining life-saving therapies when they become available.\nIf it becomes possible to produce therapeutically useful hiPSCs from umbilical cord blood or other easily accessible sources of cells, this may make hiPSC-based therapies more readily accessible in the future.\nScientists have shown that iPSCs made from a mouse can be inserted into a mouse embryo, where they can contribute to the mouse as it grows. hiPSCs could also in theory be turned into sperm and egg cells and used to make a new embryo. Although this has not been done using human cells, some people argue that it is unacceptable to use any cells in research that have the potential to develop into a new life. If hESCs have a special moral status because they can contribute to a human embryo under appropriate conditions, then hiPSCs should have the same special moral status if they, too, can contribute to a human embryo. Some also think hiPSCs do not resolve the discussions about use of embryonic cells in research because iPS technology was developed based on knowledge obtained by studying hESCs - though the force of this argument is debated.\nBut if we assign hiPSCs a special moral status, then should we also give that moral status to the skin cells from which they were derived? Some argue that there is a difference between what a cell can be converted into using human technology, and what its ‘active potency’ or ability is under natural conditions. They argue it is the cell’s active potency that determines what the cell is. For example, simply because a house can be converted into a pile of rubbish by the action of a tornado does not eliminate the important differences between a house and a pile of rubbish.\nOther, less debated differences between hESCs and hiPSCs concern their use as tools for drug testing and in disease studies, their possible application in reproductive medicine and the impact of hESC and hiPSC research on women. These areas do not constitute ethical dilemmas to the same extent as the issues above, although there is some scientific debate regarding which type of cells is more suitable as tools for drug testing and disease research.\nThere are still many scientific questions that need to be answered before any final judgement can be made about whether hiPSCs could or should eventually replace hESCs in research and future therapies. Most scientists agree that further research is needed on both types of cells in parallel.\nThe most contested differences between hESC- and hiPSC-based therapies concern patient safety, effectiveness for use in treatments, the possibilities of standardization, accessibility to large numbers of patients and ethical controversy about the moral status of the cells. All these issues are ethically relevant and none can yet be answered definitively. Research on both hESCs and hiPSCs is in rapid development and as the scientific picture develops, the moral implications of both scientific and ethical differences between these cells must be re-assessed.\nLead image © iStockphoto.com/marekuliasz.

48	How does moss spread on lawns?	Moss spreads by releasing spores that travel in the wind. When these spores land on exposed lawn thatch and encounter damp conditions, they germinate.	['WHAT, WHY, HOW\nWHAT, WHY, HOW\nMoss is an indicator of your lawn’s health – the more moss, the poorer the health. So, if you have a moss problem, as well as addressing it NOW you need to improve your routine lawn care to discourage it in the future. And even if you enjoy the springy feel it adds to your lawn, it is a warning sign that all is not well, and you need to investigate your lawn conditions.\nWhat is lawn moss?\nMoss is a rootless plant that derives water and nutrients through its leaves. There are several types of lawn moss, usually loose, yellowish-green tufts between the grass, but sometimes densely matted tufts.\nHow does moss reach my lawn?\nMoss spreads by releasing spores that travel in the wind. If they land on exposed lawn thatch they bed in and then, when it is damp, they germinate.\nWhen is the biggest risk of moss?\nMoss needs moist conditions to grow, so September to March are the worst months, but with changing weather patterns, ideal moss conditions can occur at any time of year, especially if the thatch prevents good drainage or rain prevents regular mowing.\nHow do I discourage moss?\nBasically, you need to maintain good basic lawn care. A healthy lawn offers neither the space nor the conditions for moss to thrive. Here are four key areas to work on to discourage or prevent moss:\n- Drainage: Moss needs a moisture-retentive surface. You can maintain good drainage through routine scarification and aeration, as well as correct mowing.\n- Nutrition: Poorly fed grass thins out and lets moss spores land on the thatch. Once established, the moss competes with the grass for nutrients, leading to further grass loss and more space for the moss to fill. Properly-fed grass is too thick to allow moss room to thrive.\n- Thatch: Moss loves a moisture-retentive thick layer of thatch. So, use routine scarification to keep the thatch under control.\n- Mowing: Cutting the grass too short will open up the thatch to moss spores. Also, an exposed thatch, in both wet and arid conditions, worsens drainage, thereby eventually creating that moist environment the moss loves so much.\nSome people blame shade for their moss, but often the underlying reason for moss in shady areas is the condition of the lawn itself. So before chopping down bushes or tree branches, check whether the lawn can be improved first.\nHow do I kill moss?\nYou need to use ferrous sulphate, but BEFORE you do this, scarify the lawn. This ensures that the moss control reaches the base of the moss plants, rather than just the upper part, and kills it completely. Apply moss control as a liquid application not a granular or feed ‘n’ weed product; this reaches the moss more evenly and kills it without blackening the grass (if it does blacken, you have simply used too much or have not used enough water).\nHow do I remove dead moss from the lawn?\nFor small areas you can use a wire rake. But on larger areas, another scarification is the best way to remove the moss (see photo above). Your aim is to gently tease the moss away from the surface without disturbing the grass too much.']	['<urn:uuid:48c7c3ce-f176-440c-b5f0-a61aa2ac6d56>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	6	24	547
49	transportation methods south nahanni river canadian pacific railway compare historical development	The South Nahanni River and Canadian Pacific Railway represented different eras and approaches to Canadian transportation. In 1927, the Nahanni required arduous upstream travel using traditional tracking techniques inherited from the Hudson's Bay Company and First Nations, involving ropes and physical labor to move against the current. In contrast, by the 1940s the Canadian Pacific Railway had evolved into 'the greatest transportation system in the world' with modern infrastructure including tracks, stations, roundhouses, and shops, employing tens of thousands across its network. While river tracking remained a manual technique using simple tools, the railway represented industrialized mass transportation.	"['The Rope Trick — Tracking Your Way up a River\nBy Tamia Nelson\nJune 4, 2002\nIt was one of those beautifully simple things that any\nfool can understandand it was flexible and perfect. With that and a\nstrong hand on the paddle and the ability to use a pole a man can go\nThe Rope Trick — Tracking Your Way up a River\nBy Tamia Nelson\nJune 4, 2002\nIt was one of those beautifully simple things that any fool can understandand it was flexible and perfect. With that and a strong hand on the paddle and the ability to use a pole a man can go anywhere.\nSound too good to be true? Well, Raymond M. Patterson wasn\'t a man who was much given to irrational exuberance. Nor was he describing some high-tech piece of gear designed by a team of engineers and constructed of space-age materials. (After all, anything that was state-of-the-art in 1927 is ""traditional"" today.) In fact, he wasn\'t talking about equipment at all. Instead, he was extolling the virtues of a particular technique for climbing a riverthe technique known as ""tracking.""\nAnd the river he was proposing to climb was no rivulet. Patterson was setting out to follow the South Nahanni to its headwaters in Canada\'s Northwest Territories. It wasn\'t a walk in the park. In Patterson\'s day it was terra incognitaunknown country. Even today, the South Nahanni is a river worthy of respect. It\'s remote. It\'s got cataracts and gorges. It\'s got Virginia Falls. A river to reckon with, in short.\nSo why climb a river, you ask? Good question. Nowadays, anyone who wants to paddle the South Nahanni need only pick up the phone and dial 1-800-GOTODAY, credit card in hand. A float plane or jet boat will meet the would-be explorer at Fort Simpson and take her upriver. Once there, it\'s a relatively easy ride back to the Mackenzie, going with the flow all the way.\nPatterson didn\'t have it so easy. While in London on business in the winter of 1926-27, he picked up a copy of Michael Mason\'s The Arctic Forests. When he settled down ""in front of a blazing fire"" to read his new book, he was intrigued by an empty place on one of the maps. A river ran through it, and that river was the South Nahanni. Patterson decided then and there that this river would be his royal road into the little-known Mackenzie mountains. But it was 1927. Patterson couldn\'t call 1-800-GOTODAY, and he couldn\'t charter a Twin Otter or jetboat to take him upriver. If he wanted to climb the South Nahanni to its headwaters, he\'d have to do it on his owntwo hundred miles against the current of a mountain river. He wasn\'t worried, though. He knew that with a long rope, ""a strong hand on the paddle and the ability to use a pole a man can go anywhere."" He was right.\nOf course Patterson didn\'t invent upstream travel. The Hudson\'s Bay Company had been using North America\'s rivers as highways since the seventeenth century. (They weren\'t alone. The continent\'s First Nations had been doing the same thing long before the voyageurs arrived on the scene.) And the Company\'s key to the continent was tracking. While the idea is probably as old as canoeing itself, the word is a legacy from the days of canal boats, when barges were pulled by men or horses, hauling on lines attached to each vessel\'s bow and stern. Walkwaystracksparalleled the canals and provided good footing for the beasts of burden.\nThe same technique was pressed into service on wilderness rivers of North America. When the current got too strong to paddle against, and when the bottom was too deep for poles to get a purchase, the hardy servants of the Hudson\'s Bay company broke out their long ropes. Tracking was a sweaty and dangerous business, but it worked, and that was what mattered.\nOK. The Hudson\'s Bay Company isn\'t moving bails of furs by water these days, but there\'s no reason why you shouldn\'t follow in their footsteps. In fact, there are lots of good reasons to go against the flow of a river. You don\'t need to shuttle cars, for one thing. Back in the days when Farwell and I chased the spring runoff all over New York and New England, we sometimes spent more time driving than paddling. Nowadays, I\'d rather spend my time on the river than on the road. The solution? Climb a river upstream in the morning and float back to your put-in at the end of the day. Simple, isn\'t it?\nYou learn a lot by going against the flow, too. Heading upstream, you\'ve got more time to study a river and its ways. If you measure your trips by the density of experience rather than the number of miles traveled, there\'s no contest. Upstream travel wins hands down. Once you\'ve climbed a river just one time, it\'s yours forever.\nAnd going against the flow also means that you don\'t get unpleasant surprises. There\'s no danger of drifting over a falls from downstream, after all. (You can get caught in the reversal below a falls, though. Use common sense in approaching any hazard, whichever way you\'re heading.) And what if you reach an impassable stretch late in the day? No problem. Point your bow downstream and head back to your put-in.\nSound easy? It is. But that doesn\'t mean it\'s for everyone. Upstream travel is usually hard work, and it requires that you master a number of complementary techniques. Sometimes you can paddle, though paddling won\'t get you far if the water\'s too fast or too shallow. That\'s when a pole comes in handy. But poling, too, has its limitations. It requires a reasonably firm bottom and water that\'s not too deep. If there\'s more than a couple of feet under your keel, you\'ll have trouble. Poling is also a skill that must be learned. You can\'t grab a pole and expect to master it the first time out. Or the second. You\'ll need to practice first.\nThe art of tracking, on the other hand, can be picked up pretty quickly. It\'s versatile, too. You can do it if you\'re alone, or you can do it with a partner. As long as there\'s enough water to float your canoe and a path for you to walk on, you can track.\nAnd you don\'t need special equipment. You do need rope, though. For easy rivers, your bow and stern painters may be enough, provided that they\'re securely attached and at least 25 feet long. Real tracking lines are 50 feet long, howeverand sometimes even longer. (Patterson used an 80-foot line on the Nahanni, and the Company often employed lines as long as 200 feet on big rivers.) Whatever the length of your tracking line, you\'ll want it to be at least 1/4-inch in diameter: anything less will cut your hands.\nMaterial matters, but not much. Nylon and dacron lines are both good, though nylon is stretchier. Polypro floats, and that\'s handy, but the cheaper grades are very abrasive, and they don\'t hold knots well. That\'s not so good.\nBack to length: there\'s no free lunch. Longer lines give you more scope, but you sacrifice control. The rope\'s stretch increases with its length. There\'s also the danger of tangles. If you get a long line tangled up in an alder thicket, it\'s just a nuisance, but if you get tangled up in your line in a strong current, you could be in serious trouble. Be sure that you have a sharp knife with you whenever you work around rope, and be sure that you can get at your knife with only one free hand.\nConfused? That\'s not surprising. Tracking lines are always either too long or too short. What\'s the solution? Bring several lengths of rope and tailor your tracking lines to the needs of the moment.\nOnce you have your lines secured at bow and stern, you\'re almost ready to begin climbing a river. Tie your paddles and gear inside your canoe first, though. And always wear your life jacket, zipped up and cinched down. It\'s easy to slip off a wet rock and fall into the river. Is the water cold? Then don a wetsuit. Wear something protective and grippy on your feet, too, and watch where you put your feet. Avoid stepping into cracks between rocks. If the time ever comes when you\'re tempted to track your boat up a demanding rapids, consider wearing a helmet. When you take a header into fast water, a slam dunk is often the result.\nThat sort of thing comes later, though. You should choose an easy river for your maiden voyage. Pick one with a noticeable current, but with no rapids harder than a very easy Class I. There should be a good track, too. Often you can walk along the cobble beach left by receding spring flood waters. Begin alone, handling both bow and stern lines. Once you get the knack, let your partner have a turn at the ropes. When you\'ve both mastered the ""rope trick,"" practice working together.\nReady? Let\'s start. Your canoe should be pointed the way you want to go: upstream. Face the river, holding the coiled bow line in your ""upstream"" hand. The stern line, also neatly coiled, should be held in your other hand. Now shove the bow of your canoe out till it leaves the shore eddy and catches the current. Let out both lines a little bit at a timethe bow line a bit faster than the stern, just enough to keep the bow angled away from you toward mid-river. If the canoe moves too far, or too fast, let out more stern line till the movement\'s checked. On the other hand, if the boat insists on hugging the shore, give the bow line more scope. Then, once your canoe is riding steady in deep water, start walking upstream\nBe careful. Don\'t let either line tangle around your feet, and never wrap a line around your wrist or hand.\nSooner or later you\'ll encounter an obstacle a mid-stream rock, say. If you\'re on a collision course with the rock, pay out more of the bow line. The boat will angle toward mid-river and move further out, away from the rock. Keep walking. When you\'ve put the danger behind you, snub the bow line in just a bit and work the canoe back toward you, keeping the bow pointing out. You\'ll have to muscle the boat back in. If you let the bow swing in toward shore, you\'ll lose control. You can\'t push with a rope.\nSimple, isn\'t it? To move your boat out, away from shore, give the bow line more slack. To check this outward movement, take the slack in or let out a little more of the stern line.\nSeem familiar? It is. When you track a boat, you\'re doing an upstream ferryexcept that you aren\'t in the boat, of course. The speed at which your canoe moves away from shore will depend on a number of things: how fast the river\'s flowing, how fast you\'re walking, and how great an angle your canoe makes with the current. Don\'t open this angle too much. If you do, your canoe may broachswing broadside to the currentand swamp. Stay alert. It can happen very fast.\nThat\'s it. Some people recommend using ""bridles"" for tracking your canoe, but the additional lashings are tedious and time-consuming, and I\'ve never felt the need for them. I just tie the bow and stern lines to the deck or stem fittings instead. It works fine.\nThere\'s one other wrinkle you may want to try, though. When Patterson tracked his 16-foot Prospector up the South Nahanni, he used a single 80-foot line. One end of the line was tied to the bow of his boat; the other, to the stern. Then, instead of having to manage two lines, he only had to pass the single line through his hands: forward to let the bow fall off toward mid-river, back to check it and bring it in. It was ""beautifully simple,"" he said, ""flexible and perfect."" I agree, particularly if you\'re alone.\nTracking. Why bother? Why not just dial 1-800-GOTODAY and go with the flow? After all, there aren\'t any blank spaces left on the map, are there? Maybe so. But none of us has seen everything. We all have unknown lands on our personal maps of the world, and upstream travel is a great way to fill in some of these empty spaces. Even on familiar rivers, you\'ll make new discoveries every time you go against the flow, and Patterson\'s rope trick is your passport. Give it a try.\nCopyright © 2002 by Verloren Hoop Productions.

I did not find any information on the hotels but did discover some images of sketches depicting employees of the CPR that were produced on postcards. I was immediately attracted to them because the detail of the subjects depicted looked so real that they appeared to jump right off the card. I can think of no better way of introducing you to these cards than quoting the text that appears on the face of the cover card included in the series.\n“One’s first thought of a railway brings to mind parallel lines of steel tracks over which run trains of passenger or freight cars drawn by a locomotive. Beside the tracks are telegraph poles, and at intervals there are stations with platforms. In some larger centres are roundhouses and railway shops.To run and operate this equipment there is an army of employees with some of whom the traveller comes in contact, though far more remain unseen by him except in casual glimpses.”\n“Within the sixty years of its Charter, the personnel of the Canadian Pacific Railway has grown and changed greatly. The number of its employees over the past few years, not including those who serve on its Trans-Atlantic and Trans-Pacific steamships, has averaged between fifty and sixty thousand. The problem of making a representative selection of portraits from these employees for a set of pictures was quite a knotty one.”\n“Miss Kathleen Shackleton, the distinguished artist who undertook the job, limited her subjects mainly to those who wore some kind of distinctive costume, even if it might only be overalls, in the exercise of their craft, and was guided further in her selection by representatives of the Railway Labour Organizations and by Officers of the operating department of the Company. Forty-eight types have in this way been chosen, divided, for convenience in handling, into two packages. So far as known this is the first attempt to present in handy pictorial form the personnel of a great railway – which in this case is the Canadian Pacific Railway, the greatest transportation system in the world.”\nThese postcards were issued in two sets of twenty-four cards each. A short explanation of the subject’s duties appears at the foot of each portrait. The cards were issued in standard size and the portrait of each employee was drawn top-to-bottom along the long edge. (See some images of representative cards appear at the end of this article.) All sketches appear to be signed by the artist and many are also dated, either ‘1940’ or ‘1941’. The publication date for this series was scheduled for October 20, 1941 but production delayed their introduction. They were eventually made available before Christmas 1941 in time for employees to purchase them as gifts. For the convenience of those who wished to see the whole series a number of the sets were mounted on large cards and displayed through the offices of the general superintendents of the CPR at places where railway men were most likely to see them. They were also made available through CPR restaurants and newsstands and through the General Publicity Agent. The set of cards was first sold at 50 cents for the complete series. Miss Kathleen Shackleton spent eight months, which included much traveling, to get all these representative types.\nThe contents of each set are as note following. The TPC has images of 34 of these postcards. If you have any of the missing ones highlighted, we would be pleased to receive a scan to include in this archive.\nCapt. Francis S. Middleton, S.S.

She was the sister of the famous Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton. She immigrated to Canada in 1912 where she settled in Montreal and produced and exhibited numerous paintings. She returned to England in 1916 and stayed until the late 1920’s before eventually returning to Canada. She became known for her skillfully drawn pastel portraits. Her sitters were people from all walks of life and her clients came mainly from Montreal and the surrounding area.\nBetween 1930 and 1938 Shackleton executed a series of cultural portraits which were used by the Canadian Pacific to promote folkdance, folksong, and handicraft festivals. Her portraits also appeared as illustrations in “Canadian Mosaic” – a book written by J.M. Gibbon, general publicity agent of the Canadian Pacific. In 1937-38, on a commission from the Hudson Bay Company (HBC), she produced 55 pastel portraits of people indigenous to northern Canada that are now part of the HBC Archives. Some of these images can be viewed on the Archives of Manitoba website.\nIn the early 1940s Shackleton created a series of portraits of Canadian Pacific employees. The portraits were exhibited in Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton, Vancouver, and other Canadian cities.\nShackleton was an accomplished artist, exhibiting on several occasions with Art Association of Montreal and with the Royal Canadian Academy. She also wrote articles, lectured and gave talks on the radio. After a successful career in Canada, she returned to England, where she spent the remaining years of her interesting life.\nIt was very difficult to find anyone who knew of this postcard series. But I continued to look and eventually my hunting paid off. I have 38 of the 48 cards in the set and also lack the cover card. They are extremely difficult to find postally used because the employees, who presumably purchased the majority of sets, kept them as souvenirs. A few months ago I again browsed the CPR website, only to find that the images have been removed. On a recent correspondence I learned that the some (and quite possibly all) of the original sketches were given to the employee pictured upon their retirement from the company. The biographical information on Kathleen Shackleton came through correspondence with people found on the Internet. Without the Internet I probably wouldn’t have discovered these cards nor been able to share the facts about them with you. There are still a lot of unanswered questions I have. Who was contracted to print the cards? How many sets were sold? When did the CPR discontinue sales of the series? Maybe the answers lie out on the Internet or perhaps with a reader of this article.\n1. Canadian Pacific Railway Archives\n2.

50	zoonotic disease prevention healthy pets immunocompromised	Prevention of zoonotic diseases involves several key measures for both healthy pets and immunocompromised individuals. For general prevention, it's essential to keep pets' vaccinations up-to-date, use parasite preventatives (flea/tick collars, oral products), and practice good hygiene like washing hands after pet contact. For immunocompromised people specifically, additional precautions include having pets tested for infectious diseases, adopting pets older than 1 year to avoid scratches and bites, feeding only commercially prepared food, and having someone else change the litter box when possible. If an immunocompromised person must change the litter, they should wear rubber gloves and a disposable face mask. Both groups should avoid contact with wild animals and maintain clean pet feeding areas separate from human food preparation spaces.	"['Zoonotic diseases or zoonoses are diseases that can be passed from animals to humans. Zoonoses are caused by microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi. These microbes spread between animals and people in the following ways:\n- Direct contact – spread directly through immediate contact with an infected animal, including its saliva, blood, urine, mucus, and feces. Infections can spread through a direct touch, bite, or scratch.\n- Indirect contact – spread indirectly through contact with contaminated areas or objects, such as soil infected by an animal’s feces or a pet’s food dish contaminated by bacteria.\n- Vector-borne – spread through a “middleman” that carries the disease from animals to people. Common vectors that spread disease between people and pets include fleas, ticks, and mosquitos.\n- Foodborne – spread through eating contaminated food, such as raw or undercooked meat, unpasteurized milk, or fresh produce contaminated by the feces of an infected animal. Either pet food or human food can be contaminated and cause illness.\n- Waterborne – spread through drinking or direct contact with water contaminated by the urine or feces of an infected animal.\nIt is possible for an animal to be infected with a microorganism and show no signs of illness. However, the animal will still be able to pass along the microorganism to people and cause illness or vice versa.\nThe risk of infection from certain zoonotic diseases can vary widely based on a person’s or pet’s contact with animals and the surrounding environment. However, certain groups of people are more at risk of contracting zoonoses and falling ill, which include:\n- Children under the age of 5\n- Adults over the age of 65\n- Immunocompromised individuals\n- Pregnant women\nTypes of Zoonotic Diseases\n- Campylobacter – food or water contaminated with the bacteria Campylobacter can cause gastroenteritis, or inflammation of the digestive tract.\n- Canine Influenza (Dog Flu) – like the human flu, canine influenza, or “dog flu”, is very contagious. It can easily be spread to other dogs through natural behavior, such as barking or sneezing, or from shared toys or water bowls. While humans can’t catch dog flu, humans can spread it to other dogs if they come into contact with an infected dog or item and then touch another dog.\n- Canine Scabies (Mange) – mites are a type of parasite that cause mange, which is characterized by irritated skin, itching, hair loss, and inflammation. The mite that causes canine scabies is called Sarcoptes scabiei var canis and can be passed to both dogs and people.\n- COVID-19 there is some evidence indicating that pets can become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 in humans, but these cases are rare. Cats are more easily infected than dogs and may show signs of respiratory illness. There is no evidence at this time that dogs or cats can be a source of infection in humans.\n- E. coli – food or water contaminated with the bacteria E. coli can cause gastroenteritis (inflammation of the digestive tract), fever, and abdominal pain in both humans and pets. The source of contamination is typically from the feces of an infected animal.\n- Intestinal Parasites – most internal parasites live in the intestines and require a fecal analysis for proper diagnosis. Parasites that can infect both people and pets include roundworms, hookworms, tapeworms, and Giardia.\n- Leptospirosis – a disease that can cause kidney and liver damage. It spreads through contact with the nasal secretions, urine, or saliva of infected animals. Rats, mice, squirrels, and other rodents are common carriers of the bacteria.\n- Lyme Disease – a bacterial infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. It can cause inflammation of the joints and both dogs and people are susceptible to developing the disease.\n- Rabies – a deadly infection caused by a virus secreted in saliva that attacks the nervous system. Unvaccinated dogs who spend time outdoors, especially around wild animals, are at the greatest risk for contracting rabies.\n- Rat Bite Fever this zoonotic disease is caused by one of two different bacteria found in the normal biome of a rat’s respiratory tract. Rats typically do not show signs of illness, but people can become infected through a rat bite or exposure to the rat’s urine, feces, or saliva.\n- Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever – a bacterial infection caused by Rickettsia rickettsii transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. Dogs and humans are both susceptible to developing the disease. Despite its name, this disease most often occurs east of the Mississippi River States.\n- Salmonella – food or water contaminated with the bacteria Salmonella can cause gastroenteritis (inflammation of the digestive tract), fever, and abdominal pain in both humans and pets. The source of contamination is typically from the feces of an infected animal. Pet birds and reptiles can also carry the bacteria without appearing ill.\n- Toxoplasmosis – an infection caused by a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii that is found in cat feces and undercooked meat. Pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals are most at risk for developing health problems after exposure to the parasite. Cats can become infected after eating infected prey or undercooked meat that contains the parasite.\nManaging the Disease\nIf Your Pet is Diagnosed with a Zoonotic Disease:\n- Talk with your veterinarian about how to keep your family and other pets in the household safe.\n- If possible, keep your sick pet in an area separate from any other pets and people in the household.\n- Wash your hands after any contact with your pet or objects in its environment, such as its bedding, toys, or food.\n- Sanitize the area your pet has used and, if necessary, get rid of contaminated objects.\nThere are many steps pet owners can take to prevent the spread and contraction of zoonotic diseases in themselves and their pets.\nKeep Your Pet Healthy\n- Keep your pet’s vaccinations up-to-date and schedule regular wellness visits with your veterinarian.\n- You can protect your pet against parasites such as fleas, ticks, and mosquitos through various preventatives such as flea/tick collars, oral products, or spot treatments, and by checking their coat after being outdoors. Talk with your veterinarian to see which preventatives are right for your pet.\n- Protect yourself from fleas, ticks, and mosquitos by using an insect repellant and wearing light-colored clothes that cover the body to better spot potential parasites when spending time outdoors.\n- If you live in a specific area or will be traveling somewhere new with your pet, talk with your veterinarian to see if you and your pet will have a greater risk of exposure to certain zoonotic diseases.\nPractice General Hygiene\n- Wash your hands after touching or being around animals, particularly if you are about to eat. Always use soap and water if they are available. If not, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\n- Clean up after your pet and wash your hands whenever handling their food, bedding, or waste before you eat.\n- Always use a bag and cover your hand when picking up after your dog.\n- Wear gloves and use a scooper when changing your cat’s litter box. Make sure to change the litter box daily to lower the risk of exposure to parasites.\n- Sanitize your cat’s litterbox with hot soapy water weekly or whenever excessively soiled.\nHandle Food Safely\n- Try to prepare pet food in a separate area from where people’s food is prepared and avoid feeding your pet while in the kitchen.\n- Your pet should have their own designated food and water bowl that are washed daily in the dishwasher or with hot soapy water, ideally in an area separate from where human food is prepared and consumed.\n- Use caution when handling food, particularly raw or undercooked meat. Always refrigerate food properly and check the expiration dates before consumption. Wash dishes, utensils, and pans with hot soapy water after preparing raw meat for cooking\nPractice Safety Around Animals\n- Avoid approaching or touching wild animals.\n- If you have the opportunity to interact with an animal in a zoo or farm setting, practice good hygiene by washing your hands after the animal encounter and avoid eating or drinking in the animal area.\n- Always supervise children 5 years of age or younger when they are interacting with an animal. Stop behaviors that could hurt the animal, such as your child tugging on the animal’s ears or tail, in order to prevent a bite or scratch. If you have a family pet, make sure your child doesn’t put their hands in their mouth after playing with your pet and teach them to wash their hands right after.\n- The CDC recommends that children under 5 years of age avoid certain animals to decrease the risk of exposure to harmful germs. These animals include:\n- Reptiles (lizards, snakes, turtles)\n- Amphibians (frogs, toads, news, salamanders)\n- Poultry (baby chicks, ducks)\n- Rodents (rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs)', ""Pets and the immunocompromised personAIDS patients and pets; Bone marrow and organ transplant patients and pets; Chemotherapy patients and pets\nSome people with weakened immune systems may be advised to give up their pets to avoid getting diseases from the animals. People in this category include those who take high doses of steroids and others who have:\n- Alcohol use disorder\n- Cancer, including lymphoma and leukemia (mostly during treatment)\n- Cirrhosis of the liver\n- Had an organ transplant\n- Had their spleen removed\nIf you decide to keep your pet, you and your family must be aware of the risk of diseases that can be passed from animals to humans. Here are some tips:\n- Ask your veterinarian for information on infections that you might get from your pets.\n- Have your veterinarian check all of your pets for infectious diseases.\n- Wash your hands thoroughly after handling or touching your pet, cleaning the litter box, or disposing of pet feces. Always wash before you eat, prepare food, take medicines, or smoke.\n- Keep your pet clean and healthy. Make sure that vaccinations are up to date.\n- If you plan to adopt a pet, get one that is greater than 1 year old. Kittens and puppies are more likely to scratch and bite and to contract infections.\n- Have all pets surgically spayed or neutered. Neutered animals are less likely to roam, and therefore less likely to get diseases.\n- Bring your pet to a veterinarian if the animal has diarrhea, is coughing and sneezing, has decreased appetite, or has lost weight.\nTips if you have a dog or cat:\n- Have your cat tested for the feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency viruses. Although these viruses DO NOT spread to humans, they affect the cat's immune system. This puts your cat at risk of other infections that may be spread to humans.\n- Feed your pet only commercially prepared food and treats. Animals can get sick from undercooked or raw meat or eggs. Cats can get infections, such as toxoplasmosis, by eating wild animals.\n- DO NOT let your pet drink from the toilet. Several infections can be spread this way.\n- Keep your pet's nails short. You should avoid rough play with your cat, as well as any situation where you could get scratched. Cats can spread Bartonella henselae, the organism responsible for cat scratch disease.\n- Take measures to prevent flea or tick infestations. Several bacterial and viral infections are spread by fleas and ticks. Dogs and cats can use flea collars. Permethrin-treated bedding can decrease risk of flea and tick infestations.\n- In rare cases, dogs can spread a condition called kennel cough to people with weakened immune systems. If possible, DO NOT place your dog in a boarding kennel or other high-risk environment.\nIf you have a cat litter box:\n- Keep your cat's litter box away from eating areas. Use disposable pan liners so that the entire pan can be cleaned with each litter change.\n- If possible, have someone else change the litter pan. If you must change the litter, wear rubber gloves and a disposable face mask.\n- The litter should be scooped daily to prevent the risk of toxoplasmosis infection. Similar precautions should be taken when cleaning a bird's cage.\nOther important tips:\n- DO NOT adopt wild or exotic animals. These animals are more likely to bite. They often carry rare but serious diseases.\n- Reptiles carry a type of bacteria called salmonella. If you own a reptile, wear gloves when handling the animal or its feces because salmonella is easily passed from animal to human.\n- Wear rubber gloves when handling or cleaning fish tanks.\nFor more information on pet-related infections, contact your veterinarian or the Humane Society in your area.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website.

Additionally, make sure to replace filters if necessary.\nOnce the juicing process is complete, transfer the liquid into airtight containers and store them in a refrigerator right away. Freshly-made juices should remain good in the fridge for up to 3 days at most—although some recipes may keep longer depending on what ingredients were used. It’s also a good idea to label each container with the date so you know how old it is before consuming it.\nIf you plan on making larger batches ahead of time, be mindful about freezing instead of refrigerating until you’re ready to drink it. Freezing will help preserve flavor and nutrition better than keeping it cold since frozen beverages can generally last 1–3 months before becoming unpalatable or unsafe for consumption.\nFreezing Juice For Long-Term Storage\nHey there! If you’re looking for a way to make your freshly-juiced juice last longer, freezing is the perfect solution. By freezing it, you can store your homemade juice in batches and enjoy it whenever you want. Not only is this a great way to save time on juicing, but it’s also an effective method of pasteurizing the juice as well.\nWhen freezing juice, there are some techniques that will help you get the best results possible. Firstly, use sterilized glass bottles or plastic containers with tight lids to store the juice.\nSecondly, add one tablespoon of lemon juice per cup of frozen juice to prevent discoloration and preserve its taste and nutritional value.\nFinally, don’t fill the bottle or container all the way up – leave about 2 inches of space at the top (this allows room for expansion when liquids freeze).\nNow that you know how to properly store your fresh-squeezed juices in the freezer, you can enjoy them for weeks or even months after first making them – without ever having to worry about any spoilage!\nStoring Juice In A Mason Jar\nI’m wondering how long juice from a juicer will last when stored in a mason jar?\nI know it’s important to make sure the jar is sealed properly to maintain the freshness.\nIs it also necessary to pasteurize the juice before storing it in the jar?\nWhat is the shelf life of the juice when stored in a mason jar?\nI’m curious to know the best methods for storing juice in a mason jar.\nSealing The Jar\nWhen it comes to storing juice in a mason jar, sealing the jar is one of the most important steps. If you don’t properly seal your jar, any bacteria or contaminants can get inside and ruin your juice before you even have the chance to drink it.\nFortunately, there are several different techniques that can be used for sealing a mason jar with juice.\nOne of the easiest ways to seal a mason jar is by using an airtight lid. This not only ensures that nothing gets into the jar but also keeps oxygen out so that no nutrient-rich vitamins and minerals escape from your juice either.\nAnother option is vacuum sealing which involves removing all of the air from the jar before placing on a tight-fitting lid. Vacuum sealed jars will help keep your juices fresher for longer periods of time as opposed to simply using an airtight lid alone.\nFinally, if you want to extend shelf life further still then preservative options such as citric acid or lemon juice can be added to preserve flavor and nutrition while keeping any potential microbes at bay.\nSo regardless of what method you use, proper sealing plays an essential role in making sure that your freshly made homemade juices stay fresh and tasty!\nPasteurizing The Juice\nNow that you’ve sealed the jar, it’s time to take a look at pasteurizing your juice.\nPasteurization is an important part of any home juicing process and involves heating the juice up to kill off any potentially harmful bacteria or microbes.\nThis can be done either by boiling or using an Ultra High Temperature machine.\nAdding preservatives like citric acid or lemon juice beforehand will also help extend its shelf life even further.\nThere are several advantages to pasteurizing your juice.\nFirst, it helps make sure that there won’t be any harmful contaminants in your drink which could lead to health problems if consumed.\nSecond, it allows you to store the juice for longer periods of time without having to worry about it going bad quickly due to spoilage from yeast or mold growths.\nFinally, pasteurizing can help retain more of the vitamins and minerals found naturally in fresh fruits and vegetables since heat destroys some of these beneficial nutrients over time.\nSo if you’re serious about making homemade juices then adding this extra step into your process is definitely worth considering!\nOnce you’ve pasteurized your juice, it’s time to think about shelf life. The pasteurization process helps extend the shelf life of your homemade juices due to its ability to kill off potentially harmful bacteria and microbes.\nIn addition, adding preservatives like citric acid or lemon juice beforehand will also help preserve more of the beneficial nutrients found naturally in fruits and vegetables since heat can destroy some of these over time.\nWith this extra step taken into account, you’ll be able to enjoy your home-brewed juices for longer without having to worry about them going bad quickly!\nThe Impact Of Different Fruits And Vegetables\nI’m sure you’re all aware of the different types of juice extractors available on the market. It’s important to consider which type your juicer is when it comes to determining how long your freshly made juice will last. Some juicers may produce a higher quality, longer-lasting juice than others.\nWhen it comes to shelf life, cold pressed juices usually have the longest lasting powers due to their high nutrient level and lack of added preservatives. However, some other juicers can still yield great results in terms of longevity if they are stored correctly with minimal exposure to air and light.\nTo ensure maximum freshness, store your juice in an airtight container such as a mason jar or glass bottle immediately after extracting it from the juicer and consume within 24 hours for best results.\nIt’s also worth noting that different fruits and vegetables will affect the amount of time your juice stays fresh and tasty – leafy green veggies tend to lose their nutritional value more quickly compared to citrus fruits or softer berries. So experiment with different combinations before settling on one that works for you!\nThe Shelf Life Of Bottled/Store-Bought Juice\nI’m sure you’ve heard the saying, “the fresher the better” when it comes to juice. But if you buy store-bought or bottled juice, how do you make sure that it lasts as long as possible?\nThe answer lies in bottling methods and pasteurization processes employed by manufacturers. Bottled juices are typically pasteurized: a process of heating the liquid at high temperatures for a short period of time. This kills off any potential bacteria or microorganisms, extending shelf life up to several months.\nDepending on what kind of juice is being made, the type of bottle used can also add an extra layer of protection against spoilage. For instance, bottles with airtight seals like those used for tomato juice tend to last longer than other types of packaging due to their superior ability to keep oxygen out.\nOverall, most commercial varieties of store-bought or bottled juices will stay fresh for between two weeks and six months depending on how well they’re stored and handled. To ensure maximum longevity from your juice purchase, always check the expiration date before buying and try to drink it within one month after opening!\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow Do I Know When Juice From A Juicer Has Gone Bad?\nThe best way to know when juice from a juicer has gone bad is by observing the color and smell. If you notice any changes in the appearance or smell of your freshly-made juice, it’s likely past its prime.\nTo help preserve your juices for longer periods of time, be sure to store them in airtight containers away from direct sunlight. Additionally, adding lemon juice as a preservative can also extend the shelf life of your juices.\nFollowing these tips will ensure that you’re always getting the most out of every batch of homemade juice!\nCan I Use Juice From The Juicer For Smoothies Or Other Recipes?\nYes, you can use juice from the juicer for a variety of recipes such as smoothies.\nHowever, if you plan on doing this it’s important to store your juice properly so that it stays fresh and flavorful.\nTo do this, make sure you are storing your juice in an airtight container and keeping it refrigerated.\nYou should also try to drink or use the juice within a day or two of making it, otherwise the flavor will start to decline over time.\nBy following these tips, you’ll be able to enjoy delicious homemade juice whenever you’d like!\nDoes The Type Of Juicer I Use Affect The Shelf Life Of The Juice?\nWhen it comes to preservation methods, the type of juicer you use can definitely affect how long your juice will stay fresh.\nCentrifugal juicers extract juice quickly by using sharp blades that spin at high speeds, while masticating or cold-press juicers press and grind ingredients at a much slower speed.\nThese models tend to produce more nutrient-rich juices with longer shelf lives than those made from centrifugal juicers.\nSo if you’re looking for a juice that will keep for several days, then investing in a cold-press or masticating model might be worth considering.\nIs It Safe To Drink Juice That Has Been Left Out At Room Temperature?\nIt’s important to know that juice left out at room temperature isn’t safe to drink.\nIf you’re cold pressing your own fresh fruit and vegetables, the general rule is that it should be consumed within 24 hours of being made.\nThis is because freshly-pressed juice can spoil quickly due to its lack of preservatives or pasteurization.\nIt’s also important to store any leftover juice in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 72 hours if kept below 40°F (4°C).\nWhat Is The Best Way To Store Freshly-Squeezed Juice?\nWhen it comes to storing freshly-squeezed juice, the best way to do it is by refrigerating it.\nJuicing techniques and juicer maintenance are key in keeping your juice fresh.\nRemember, heat accelerates spoilage so make sure you keep your juices cool as soon as possible after being squeezed from a juicer.\nIf done correctly, this can ensure that your freshly-squeezed juices last longer!\nIn conclusion, knowing how long juice from a juicer will last can be tricky. However, with the right information and techniques, you can ensure that your freshly-squeezed juice stays fresh for as long as possible.\nPay attention to the type of juicer you use and always store any leftover juice in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\nIf you want to enjoy smoothies or other recipes made with freshly-squeezed juice, make sure to use it within 24 hours after squeezing.\nWith these tips, you can maximize the shelf life of your homemade juices and make sure they remain safe to drink!', 'Bulletin #4191, Food Safety Facts: Safe Home Made Cider\nFood Safety Facts\nSafe Home Made Cider\nPrepared by Jim Schupp, Tree Fruit Specialist, University of Maine Cooperative Extension.\nRevised by Jason Bolton, Assistant Extension Professor for Food Safety, University of Maine Cooperative Extension.\nReviewed by Beth Calder, Extension Food Science Specialist, University of Maine Cooperative Extension, and Alfred Bushway, Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, University of Maine.\nFor information about UMaine Extension programs and resources, visit extension.umaine.edu.\nFind more of our publications and books at extensionpubs.umext.maine.edu.\nOutbreaks of foodborne illness have been attributed to the consumption of fresh, unpasteurized cider contaminated with a foodborne pathogen like E. coli O157:H7 The risk is low but it is still probable. Certain age groups are at a greater risk of complications from harmful bacteria like E. coli O157:H7 especially children, the elderly and persons with compromised immune systems. You can prevent these risks by boiling unpasteurized apple cider before drinking it, or drinking pasteurized cider or juice.\nIn addition to bacterial concerns, there is a fungal toxin called Patulin that can form during apple cider production and storage. Patulin forms when there is mold growth on or in the apples. This toxin is heat stable and can survive pasteurization.\nThe safety of cider relies on its acidity and refrigeration, as well as sanitation during processing and manufacturing. Producers who make cider for sale must be licensed by the Maine Department of Agriculture and are inspected regularly to make sure that safe and sanitary practices are being followed. According to Maine State Law, cider producer may not sell, advertise, offer or expose for sale any cider that has not been heat-treated to a temperature of 155 degrees F or higher for 10 seconds unless it is labeled as being unpasteurized and is labeled as unpasteurized. In the case of hand-pressed or homemade cider, it is your responsibility to assure the safety of the cider.\nThe following list of guidelines has been prepared by Maine’s apple growers, the Maine Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources and the University of Maine Cooperative Extension to help you make safe, healthful delicious cider. If you have questions about cider production or other food safety issues please contact Jason Bolton at the UMaine Extension: email@example.com or 207-942-7396.\nGrowing and Harvesting the Apples:\n- Pick apples at the proper stage of maturity, before they drop.\n- Pick apples when they are dry.\n- Allow animals to feed in the orchard.\n- Use animal waste as fertilizer.\n- Allow apples to begin to spoil on the ground.\n- Use apple drops to produce cider.\nStoring the Apples:\n- Use only clean, dry containers.\n- Store the apples at a cold temperature, if possible below 40° F.\n- Let the apples be contaminated by rodents, birds or insects.\n- Store the apples out in the open or directly on the ground.\n- Store wet apples.\n- Wash the apples with clean water to remove debris just before grinding them.\n- Keep press cloths and racks off the floor in a clean place between batches.\n- Make sure equipment and cloths are clean and sanitized before using them, including the apples press, which should be scrubbed with a warm soapy water, rinsed with clean potable water and sanitized.\n- Blend in some tart apples to increase the cider’s acidity.\n- Use food-grade plastic or stainless steel containers to catch the cider.\n- Heat the cider to 155° F for 10 seconds.\n- Store cider at 40° F or lower if not bottling immediately.\n- Bottle in clean and sanitized containers as soon as it is pressed.\n- Use spoiled, moldy or defective apples.\n- Expose the juice to air and insects.\n- Allow spoiled or partially spoiled apples to enter the grinder.\n- Leave cider at room temperature for longer than two hours.\nUsing and Storing the Cider:\n- Use the cider promptly.\n- Cool the cider to 40° F or lower as quickly as possible after bottling.\n- Reuse food containers that cannot be thoroughly cleaned.\n- Use containers with porous surfaces, such as crockery, to store cider.\n- Forget to clean and sanitize equipment before putting it away.\n- Sanitize: Removal of microorganisms both spoilage and pathogenic\n- Clean: Removal of dirt and debris\nCleaning and Sanitizing\nAfter each day’s cider making, all equipment, including press cloths, should be:\n- Rinsed with potable water to remove apple and cider residue.\n- Wash with warm soapy water and a clean brush.

52	gps fleet tracking rfid tool tracking compare maintenance benefits	GPS fleet tracking and RFID tool tracking both offer maintenance benefits but in different ways. GPS fleet tracking enables predictive vehicle maintenance by alerting to malfunctioning components before major breakdowns occur, reducing downtime and maintenance costs. RFID tool tracking improves maintenance operations by ensuring tool availability, reducing time spent searching for tools, and preventing maintenance delays due to lost or misplaced tools, which helps avoid missed maintenance commitments and added costs.	"[""Operating a fleet of vehicles brings with it a number of challenges, from understanding where your vehicles are at all times to dead-of-night accidents, driver performance issues and asset maintenance, among others. Fortunately, today's fleet management solutions not only tell you where your vehicles are by leveraging a connected global positioning system (GPS), but they can also give you valuable context to improve efficiency, reduce accidents and protect the bottom line.\nNo matter the purpose of your fleet—transporting people and goods, supporting construction sites or even emergency response—fleet management solutions that automate tasks and tap into near real-time data can help solve a myriad of fleet management challenges that can get in the way of profit, productivity and most of all, safety.\nSolving fleet management challenges with near real-time decision-making on the road\nMany issues organizations face in optimizing their vehicle fleets can be addressed through improved connectivity and more near-real time data, which are made possible through GPS-enabled fleet management solutions. Here's how technology is helping tackle a range of fleet management challenges.\nAccidents happen, unfortunately. Not only are they expensive and can lead to injury and even hospitalization, but they also hurt productivity, bottom line and reputation. They can even lead to company liability for damages and injuries.\nSince many accidents are caused by driver error or fatigue, a fleet management solution can help prevent accidents by tracking hours of service and shifts worked by a driver. It can also track a driver's training and experience to ensure they are matched with a vehicle while also helping to coach drivers to drive safely and help with efficient route planning that can have significant cost advantages.\nWhile routine maintenance means taking a vehicle off the road for a short period, putting it off can lead to a major breakdown and longer periods of downtime, which means the vehicle isn't generating revenue. Predictive maintenance actions can be taken before fleet vehicles may succumb to a longer downtime because of important service that needs to be performed to avoid unnecessary and expensive breakdowns.\nMoreover, vehicle tracking enabled by GPS can alert you to any problems onboard the vehicle, including components that may be starting to malfunction, rather than relying on a driver to report it. Early intervention can reduce your maintenance costs and reduce downtime.\nThe quickest way to get anywhere is a direct line, but that's not always possible on the road. However, if you have a lot of regular customers and destinations, drivers can be coached in near real-time about the best route options, based on time of day, traffic conditions and exceptional events, such as ongoing construction.\nFrom there, GPS-enabled connectivity with near-real time data can even let a driver know there's a major accident that will snarl traffic for the rest of the day and plot an alternative. By streamlining regular routes and adjusting one-time trips using a well-informed fleet management system, you can reduce idle time, minimize distance required and optimize fuel consumption.\nKeeping your vehicles fueled is a cost of doing business, but it's one that can fluctuate widely. Even when prices are low, you want to optimize consumption. Efficient routing can help, but tracking fuel usage can provide clues as to where you can make those improvements as well as identify other issues. You may uncover a maintenance issue that can improve mileage or decide a vehicle is due for retirement in favor of a more fuel-efficient one. You can also use fuel cards to help combat fraud.\nFleet management challenges can also include poor communications due to limited channels such as phone, email or text. Today's fleet management solutions leverage connectivity to display information as part of a driver's dashboard based on near real-time data, including that generated by GPS.\nThis enables you to optimize a route on the fly or flag a maintenance issue because you're able to monitor a vehicle's components from a central point. Meanwhile, drivers can contribute by updating their status and reporting issues that might affect other drivers, such as construction delays and collisions."", ""RFID Tool Tracking in\nAviation, Manufacturing, Rail, Construction\nTool Tracking RFID systems are designed to actively prevent FOD and FME incidents and drive safety in mission-critical operations such as Aviation, Rail, Defense, Manufacturing, Nuclear, Construction.\nThey automate tool management procedures by tracking and controlling tools throughout their workflow and lifecycle using tags, tool storage hardware, and software.\nTHE CHALLENGES OF TOOL MANAGEMENT\nTool Tracking RFID systems are deployed in mission-critical environments that cannot afford the FOD and FME risks that come with relying on employees to manually track and record the hand tools, power tools, and equipment they use throughout the day. But successfully deploying tool tracking systems involves overcoming many challenges regarding the tool inventory, existing processes, change management, and technology.\nAviation and industrial operations have first-hand experiences of the limitations of manual Tool Management processes relying on tool foam organizers, sign-in/sign-out procedures, visual identifiers, or barcodes:\nLoss of tools due to misplacement or outright theft, and therefore the direct cost of replacement.\nLost productivity due to personnel check-out/check-in of tools, searching for lost tools or waiting for replacements to arrive.\nPoor customer satisfaction from missed commitments, maintenance, and added costs.\nSmall Tool Tracking is another sizeable challenge: With sockets and ratchets accounting for up to 30% of a typical tool inventory in MRO operations, delivering a near 100% tool tracking coverage is critical in environments prone to FOD and FME incidents.\nUSING THE RIGHT RFID SYSTEM\nStarting a Tool Tracking RFID System involves a tagging strategy to RFID-enable a tool inventory made of various hand tools, smaller tools, power tools, and equipment to track.\nXerafy has developed a unique range of RFID tagging options, built on overcoming several challenges of traditional RFID technology relating to Tool Management when it comes to metal interference, harsh environments, and long-range read distance requirements:\nRFID for environments with a high density of metal surfaces\nRFID tagging options adapted to various form factors and materials (metal, plastics, wood)\nRFID optimized for tool tracking applications: Size-to-performance ratio, long read-range, accuracy, and reliability\nReliable tagging techniques that are proven in the field for shocks, abrasion, fluids, chemicals\nScalable tagging methods adapted to larger tool inventories\nXerafy provides tool tagging options that can be either mounted or embedded into tools and equipment at point-of-use. Many industries favor a combination of Epoxy and Heat-Shrink Tubing to retrofit their tool inventories. In addition, some use a carrier to add an extra level of protection against shocks and fluids.\nWorking with leading manufacturers such as Stanley Black & Decker (for its Cribmaster, Proto, and Facom brands), Kyoto Tool, SnapOn, Xerafy has pioneered a new approach that sees them offering ranges of 'smart tools' with native RFID features embedded at point-of-manufacture to enable tracking, identification, location, usage data capture. In doing so, tool manufacturers respond to strong demand for evolutions in tool management towards Connected Tools.\nIndustrial operations rely on specialized tools and equipment: Securing them from theft and locating them quickly when they are needed is critically important in their daily operations.\nBy improving both the accuracy and the effectiveness of tool tracking, RFID tool tracking reduces the substantial costs of tool availability and life cycle.\nThe drawbacks of manual tool tracking in industrial environments are well documented:\nLoss of tools, due to misplacement or outright theft, and therefore the direct cost of replacement\nLost productivity due to personnel check-out/check-in of tools, searching for lost tools, or waiting for replacements to arrive\nPoor customer satisfaction from missed commitments, maintenance, and added cost\nIn mission-critical operations such as Aircraft MRO, unaccounted tools and other maintenance incidents can have catastrophic consequences.\nTool Control procedures traditionally rely on visual tool identifications such as tool foam organizers for toolboxes and drawers. Tool cribs and sign-in/sign-out procedures provided another level of control but with limited efficacy and accuracy.\nMRO operations have been early adopters of technology solutions for Tool Control, setting the standard for how other industries can address their own safety, compliance, and productivity challenges.\nAutomated Tool Control (ATC) solutions from market leaders such as Cribmaster Storeroom and Tool Crib Management, SnapOn Level5 Automation Solutions, Nexess Smart Cabinet, bring tool control RFID systems to drive safety, efficiency, and digitization.\nThe ATC solutions are built around multiple smart RFID-enabled mobile and fixed tool storage options, including tool crib, tool trolley, tool cart, tool cabinet, CICO kiosk, tool room, toolbox.\nRailway operations leverage RFID for the management of their tools and rolling stock.\nOperators of passengers, freight, and metro services rely on RFID systems for smart tool management of train maintenance operations.\nXerafy RFID also powers self-reporting communications systems to drive rolling stock availability and safety as used by manufacturers of locomotives and unpowered rail vehicles.\nConstruction sites rely on a complex and fluid organization. RFID Systems for Tool Tracking brings them the situational awareness required to run smoothly and safely, helping with the location and availability of tools and equipment in the field.\nTools, equipment, teams, materials, sites: Maintaining a safe and efficient on-site environment is a daily challenge for the Construction industry.\nConstruction Tool Tracking RFID Systems are helping to increase the availability of tools on site by reducing losses and delivery movements to different sites. Employees can easily check-in and check-out tools and equipment with a simple scan. RFID Systems extend to materials and yard management, for instance, keeping track of rebars.\nMarket adoption is supported by a very diversified offering with RFID solutions and software adapted to team sizes, contractors, tool and equipment types, IT configurations (onsite / cloud, mobile / ERP).\nRFID is particularly well suited to construction sites: The technology's traditional advantage over Barcodes and other optical identification methods are at their maximum when it comes to operations in the field.""]"	['<urn:uuid:687d9201-8549-40b8-a41d-64b724d30c62>', '<urn:uuid:4548ec9e-f141-4e0a-a7e6-3bb2a9b578c2>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	9	71	1628

54	early coin materials composition compared modern manufacturing techniques	Early Australian coins like the Holey Dollar were made from Spanish silver dollars, specifically using 1810 Silver Dollars from the Lima Mint in Peru. In modern times, coins use more complex compositions - for example, some coins have faces made of 75 percent copper and 25 percent nickel, with a pure copper core. The manufacturing process has also evolved significantly - while early coins were manually cut and stamped, modern production involves sophisticated processes including annealing in special furnaces, cleaning in rotating barrels with chemical solutions, edge-rolling operations, and high-speed presses that can simultaneously strike multiple coins.	"[""Location: 1st Floor, RACV Club, 501 Bourke Street, Melbourne\nDate: Monday 27th August 2012\nThe most famous example of Australia’s first coin, the Holey Dollar, goes under the hammer on 27 August in Melbourne at the RACV Club on Bourke Street at 7pm.\nKnown as the ‘Hannibal Head’ Holey Dollar, it was created in New South Wales in 1813 from an 1810 Silver Dollar that had been minted at the Lima Mint in Peru.\nThis coin is the only example of its type in private hands. The only other known example is housed in the State Library of New South Wales.\nThe Hannibal Head Holey Dollar was last offered at public auction in 1988 and sold after the auction for $39,000. Solid interest is expected from private collectors, investors and institutions at the pre-auction estimate of $450,000.\nAlso offered at the Coinworks Eminent Colonials Auction one of the finest 1813 Colonial Dumps and the finest example of Australia’s first gold coin, the 1852 Adelaide Pound.\nThe three rare coins have national significance and are expected to fetch in excess of one million dollars. (See Fact Sheet below)\nThe ‘Hannibal Head’ Holey Dollar is rich in history. In 1808, while Napoleon was invading Spain after defeating the Spanish fleet at Trafalgar, mints in Mexico and Lima were still busily turning out Spanish silver dollars.\nGovernor Lachlan Macquarie made the most of Spanish spare change by acquiring 40,000 silver dollars to alleviate Australia's coin shortage.\nMacquarie enlisted the services of a convicted forger, William Henshall, to cut a hole in the centre of each silver dollar. The resulting ‘donut form’ was over-stamped with the words New South Wales, the value Five Shillings and the date 1813 to create Australia’s very first coin, the 1813 Holey Dollar. The centrepiece that fell out of the hole wasn’t discarded. Over-stamped it became the 1813 Colonial Dump: the diminutive partner to the Holey Dollar with a value of fifteen pence.\nWhat makes the ‘Hannibal Head’ Holey Dollar so special is that the original Spanish Dollar ‘holed’ by William Henshall had been minted in 1810 at the Lima Mint in Peru with a portrait design that protested Joseph Bonaparte’s ascension to the Spanish throne. And it is the only example privately held.\nDiscovered in Tasmania in 1881 near Hobart, the coin was subsequently presented to Sir John Henry Lefroy, Governor of Van Diemen’s Land 1880 – 1881.\nOne of Australia’s well known and highly regarded auctioneers, Warren Joel of ByJoel, will officiate. No buyer’s premium applies in the auction of these rare coins.\nApproved Valuer of Australian coins under the Commonwealth Government’s Taxation Incentives for the Arts Scheme and Professional Numismatist (now retired), Barrie Winsor believes that the coin has the potential to far exceed its auction estimate. “It’s Australia’s very first coin. And this is the most famous of them all with only one example available to buyers. Let’s not forget that next year is the 200th anniversary of its striking.”\n“This is a coin that will attract worldwide interest”.\n“That the Macquarie Bank chose as its logo a stylised version of the Holey Dollar reflects the respect with which this coin is held”.\nCatalogues are available by registering on our web site or phone 03 9642 3133\n‘Hannibal Head’ Holey Dollar\n- Unique in private hands. The only other known example is housed in the State Library of New South Wales\n- One of the finest known of all the surviving Holey Dollars\n- Discovered in 1881, 20km north of Hobart in what was believed to be a ‘Bushrangers’ hoard and presented to General Sir J H Lefroy, the then Governor of Tasmania\n- The coin’s discovery was written up in several newspaper articles published in the early 1880s: the Hobart Mercury (1883) and the Sydney Morning Herald (1884)\n- First offered at an Australian public auction in March 1988. The coin was passed in and sold after the auction for $39,000\n- Held from 1988 to 2007 by a Queensland collector\n- Acquired by Coinworks in 2007 and sold to the current vendor\n- Auction estimate $450,000 - $500,000\n1813 Colonial Dump\n- One of the finest Colonial Dumps … in the top six of the known surviving specimens\n- Acquired by renowned collector H M Lingford in 1934 from Spink London\n- First publicly offered in Australia in 1985, Spink Auctions, selling for $13,200\n- Offered a decade later at Auction selling for $25,300\n- Sold to current vendor in 1997\n- Auction estimate $200,000 - $250,000\n1852 Adelaide Pound\n- Finest known example of Australia’s very first gold coin\n- Purchased in 1962 by Harold Hastings Deering for £80 (Deering owned Sydney’s first franchise for Ford Motor vehicles in 1935)\n- Sold to current vendor in 2005\n- Auction estimate $300,000 - $350,000"", 'Nov 13, 2010nbsp018332The face of these coins is 75 percent copper and 25 percent nickel and the core, which is visible along the edges of the coins, is composed of pure copper. In 2000, the United States Mint released the Golden Dollar coin, changing the alloy of the dollar coin to a clad composition manganese-brass, containing 88.5 percent copper, 6 percent inc.Get A Quote\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States CFIUS.\nMacroeconomic and Foreign Exchange Policies of Major Trading Partners.\nAll of the materials used for producing our coins are purchased from commercial manufacturers. The United States Mint obtains one-cent coin blanks already made, but produces the blanks for five-cent coins and the cupronickel clad coins from strip. Coin strip is fed into high-speed automatic presses which cut the coin blanks, known as planchets.\nThe cupronickel planchets are softened by annealing in a special furnace, then they are cleaned in large rotating barrels which contain a chemical solution that washes and polishes them, and then they are dried.\nNext, the planchets are put through an edge-rolling operation in the upsetting machine. This gives them the familiar thickened edge found on the one-cent coins and five-cent coins. It also serves two other purposes. The edge hardens during the upsetting process, thereby preventing soft metal from squirting between the collar and the dies during stamping. It also removes any burrs and smoothes the edge, making it easier to automatically feed them into the high-speed coin presses.\nFinally, the upset planchets go to the coinage presses, where with a single stroke, they are stamped with the designs and inscriptions that make them into coins. Most of the presses are equipped to strike four coins simultaneously, while others simultaneously strike two coins.\nAfter striking, each coin is inspected. The coins are then counted and bagged. Each bag is weighed before shipment to ensure that it contains the correct number of coins.\nHomenbspraquonbsp Process Systemsnbspraquonbsp Gold Refining Plant.\nGold Refining Plant We have cemented our presence among the successful Manufacturers and Suppliers of Gold Refining Systems.

The Mint lacked experience designing and engraving coins, and coin production got off to a slow start.\nCopyright © 2020 Borex Machinery Company All rights reserved']"	['<urn:uuid:5e34aeda-da17-4ec5-a65c-b2313ec0efca>', '<urn:uuid:19dffecd-3154-47e8-8abb-51010dcb03f8>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	8	97	1696

56	what happens to intellectual property license rights when licensor files bankruptcy	When a licensor files for bankruptcy, they may reject (stop performing) their executory contracts, including IP licenses. However, licensees are protected under section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code. Under this section, if the license is executory and involves IP rights, the licensee can either terminate the contract or maintain their IP rights under the contract for its duration and any extensions they would have rights to under the contract.	"[""Most companies do not own all of the intellectual property (IP) rights that their businesses rely on. It is not uncommon for some portion of a company’s IP rights to be in-licensed from other persons or entities under a license agreement. In such cases, the licensee has contractual rights to use the IP that is the subject of an in-license but not full ownership of such IP. In the day-to-day operations of a company, the distinction between owned IP rights and in-licensed IP rights can easily get lost. But what happens if a licensor files for bankruptcy? Will an in-license protect the licensor’s right to continue to use the IP rights?\nIP Licenses in Bankruptcy\nWhen a licensor files for bankruptcy, it may reject (i.e., stop performing) its executory contracts. IP licenses can be considered executory contracts if the bankrupt licensor and other party still have obligations to perform and if nonperformance would constitute a material breach. Congress gave licensees protection against losing their IP rights in this situation when it enacted section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUnder this section, if the license is executory and its subject matter is granting a right to IP, a licensee may either (1) consider the contract terminated or (2) keep its IP rights under the contract and supplementary agreements (excluding specific performance) for the duration of the contract and any extensions the licensee would have rights to under the contract.\nAlthough a bankruptcy court will have broad discretion in making the final determination about whether section 365(n) applies to any license, a licensee can help the court make such a determination by using clear and unambiguous language in the in-license to explicitly describe the parties’ intent and by understanding how the license should be treated in the event of a licensor’s bankruptcy.\nTo help protect the licensee’s IP rights in the event of a licensor's bankruptcy, the contract should state that\n- the license is intended by the parties to be a grant of a right to “intellectual property,” as defined by the Bankruptcy Code;\n- the parties intend for the protections of section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code to apply to the license;\n- nothing in the license limits the licensee’s rights under section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code; and\n- if the licensor’s obligations under the in-license are terminated in bankruptcy, the licensee shall receive a copy of all applicable IP (and embodiments thereof).\nAll licenses and rights to licenses granted under or pursuant to this Agreement by one Party to the other Party are intended to be, for purposes of section 365(n) of the US Bankruptcy Code (the Code), and any such equivalent law in the United States or any other country, licenses of rights to “intellectual property” as defined under section 101(35A) of the Code. The Parties agree that the non-bankrupt Party, as a licensee of such rights under this Agreement, shall retain and may fully exercise all of its rights and elections under the Code and any such equivalent law. The foregoing is without prejudice to any rights that the non-bankrupt Party may have arising under the Code or other applicable law.\nUpon commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding by or against the other Party under the Code, the non-bankrupt Party shall be entitled to a complete duplicate of or complete access to any such intellectual property and all embodiments of such intellectual property. Such intellectual property and all embodiments thereof shall be promptly delivered to the non-bankrupt Party (i) upon any such commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding upon written request therefor by the non-bankrupt party, unless the bankrupt Party (or the bankruptcy trustee) elects to continue to perform all of its obligations under this Agreement or (ii) if not delivered under (i) above, upon the rejection of this Agreement by or on behalf of the non-bankrupt Party upon written request therefor.\nEven with the recommended language above, it is possible that a bankruptcy court will not afford a license the protections of 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code and will terminate a licensee’s right to use such IP. There are other ways that a licensee can ensure continued use of such IP, including IP escrow agreements and step-in rights. Before entering into any key IP licenses, consult with a strategic commercial transactions lawyer to make sure that your IP rights are protected to the greatest extent possible.""]"	['<urn:uuid:4f7e80cb-9efc-47b6-b332-d44932c77468>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	11	69	729
57	How did the medieval hospital in Jerusalem combine medical care with spiritual practices, and what modern cleaning methods are used to prevent infections in hospitals?	The Jerusalem hospital combined medical and spiritual care by having an altar in the ward for Mass, providing Holy Communion to patients upon admission, and conducting regular Gospel readings and Holy Water ceremonies. In modern hospitals, infection prevention relies on frequent hand washing with soap for 20-30 seconds, using barrier protection like latex gloves, and proper disinfection techniques. These include using EPA-registered hospital disinfectants with 10-minute dwell times and microfiber cloths submerged in disinfectant to effectively clean high-touch surfaces like bed rails, light switches, and bathroom surfaces.	"['Spiritual and historical Background of the Brotherhood of Blessed Gérard\nBlessed Gérard (who died on September 3, 1120) was most probably a Benedictine monk who was the guest master of the Benedictine Monastery St. Maria Latina in Jerusalem. The guest house, situated on the other side of the road of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, was very big as it was always occupied by numerous pilgrims who came to see the places where Jesus lived and died and rose from the dead. Because the journeys in those days were a big strain, most of the pilgrims arrived in Jerusalem exhausted or sick.\nTherefore the guest house of St. Maria Latina was more a hospital than a hotel and it was in those days commonly known as the Hospital of Jerusalem. Apart from nursing the sick they used to accommodate abandoned children, feed the starving, clothe the needy and care for discharged prisoners. Blessed Gérard\'s hospital was a well organised charitable organisation.\nBlessed Gérard founded the Brotherhood of St. John of Jerusalem to run the hospital.\nThis community is the historical root of the Hospital Order of St. John, the oldest hospital order of the Church (founded in 1099), known as the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta or in short the Order of the Knights of Malta, whose Anglican branch, The Grand Priory in the British Realm of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem (founded in 1831), is well known in South Africa as The Priory of the Order of St. John through its offspring the St. John Ambulance Association and Brigade (founded in 1877).\nThe statutes of the Brotherhood of St. John of Jerusalem are the basis of the Rule of the Order of St. John whose spirituality is going back to the Benedictine principle of hospitality, expressed in chapter 53 of the Rule of St. Benedict which reads: ""All guests who present themselves are to be welcomed as Christ, for he himself will say: I was a stranger and you welcomed me (Matt 25:35). Proper honour must be shown to all, especially to those who share our faith (Gal 6:10) and to pilgrims"". And that is exactly what the hospital of Jerusalem and its brotherhood did.\nBlessed Gérard and his successors called the sick ""the poor of Christ"" or simply ""the holy poor"" indicating that they being welcomed as Christ, thus represent Christ to those who have the honour of serving them. Loving ones neighbour therefore becomes worship of God and the members of the hospital order made the promise ""to be servants and slaves to our Lords, the sick"". A principle of the brotherhood\'s spirituality was right in the contradiction of the spirit of the time not to gracefully grant favours to those in need and to be honoured for what they had done, but to consider it a favour to have the honour of serving the needy and thus receive the grace of being close to Christ who is being represented by the poor.\nSuch an attitude is still a contradiction to the Spirit of our times, where helpers often consider themselves superior to those they help and do not realise what graceful chance they miss to meet the Lord in the needy.\nOn the other hand the hospital of Jerusalem did not disregard the spiritual needs of their Lords, the sick. The hospital was actually regarded as a spiritual community and the sick were not only cared for bodily but also benefited from the pastoral care of the hospital.\nThe Rule of the Order of St. John reads in chapter 17: ""When a sick comes to the house ... he may be received as follows: After he has first faithfully confessed his sins to a priest, he may receive Holy Communion, and afterwards he may be carried to a bed and may be lovingly fed every day like the Lord, according to the possibilities of the house, even before the brothers have their meal. And the Reading and the Gospel may be read in the hospital on all Sundays and the sick may be sprinkled with Holy Water during the procession.""\nThe hospital was considered both a church building and church community anyway. The ward was a big room with an altar inside, so that all the sick could participate in Holy Mass without having to leave their beds.\nAll in all the brotherhood and the hospital order founded b Blessed Gérard thought of the hospital as a community of saints: The brothers extended God\'s loving care to the needy. They acted on Christ\'s behalf, because the church is the body of Christ and Christ is thus acting at all times through his church. But the brothers met Christ in the Sick as well (cf. ""Whenever you did this for one of the least important of these brothers of mine, you did it for me!"" Mt. 25.40).\nAll involved, the brothers on the one hand and the sick on the other hand, are mutually representing Christ, making life in the community of the hospital a mutual encounter with the Lord and therefore an event of salvation.\nThe Brotherhood of Blessed Gérard sees itself as a revival of the Brotherhood of St. John founded by the Blessed Gérard. It wants to revitalise the charisma of these origins and adopt them and the brotherhood\'s spirituality into the context of our present time and life situation.\nIt seeks to brotherly relate to all communities and organisations standing in the same tradition and spirituality.\nBlessed Gérard was a holy man ...\nIt was in the year 1099, that Blessed Gérard Tonque founded a brotherhood of dedicated people at the house of the hospital of St. John the Baptist in Jerusalem, who were referred to as ""the brothers, who come to serve the poor and protect the Catholic Faith"". This brotherhood developed into a religious Order by AD 1113, which is in our days called the Sovereign Military and Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta (or the Order of Malta).\nBlessed Gérard was a holy man, who was praised by contemporary sources as well as posthumously. Blessed Gérard died on 3. September 1120 and his epitaph in the convent he founded reads as follows:\nHere lies Gerard, the humblest man among the dwellers in the East;\nThe servant of the poor, a welcoming friend to strangers;\nHe was lowly in mien, but within him shone a noble heart.\nThe measure of his goodness may be seen within these walls.\nHe was provident in many things, painstaking in all he did;\nHe undertook many tasks of diverse nature;\nStretching out his arms diligently to many lands,\nHe gathered from everywhere the means to feed his people.\n(Quoted from H. J. A. Sire: The Knights of Malta, Reprint New Haven and London 1994)', 'Reducing Disease In Healthcare Facilities\nTo the naked eye, a healthcare building might look clean. The floors are polished, windows glisten, the trash is emptied and there’s no apparent dust on furniture. Yet there are millions of potentially dangerous germs on surfaces such as push plates, doorknobs, toilet surfaces, bed rails, bedside tables and privacy curtains.\nGerms are everywhere, and are especially prevalent in hospitals and clinics. In these critical areas, many patients’ ability to fight disease or infection is dramatically reduced by their weakened immune system from illness or surgery. Building service contractors play a critical role in meeting best practices for disinfecting, and the first steps are to educate cleaning crews on the potential risk of infection and to train in appropriate disinfecting techniques for patient-care areas.\nIn today’s healthcare setting, a great concern is the patient’s risk of a nosocomial infection. When a patient is infected in the hospital, it’s called a nosocomial, or “hospital-acquired” infection. In other words, the person contracted the infection while a patient in the hospital, and the infection was not a result of their medical condition when admitted to the hospital. While most nosocomial infections are treatable, some can be deadly.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that in the United States, as many as one in 10 patients, or 2 million patients a year, acquire a nosocomial infection; of those patients, about 90,000 die as a result of the infection. Estimates of the resulting annual cost range from $4.5 billion to $11 billion. One third of nosocomial infections are considered preventable, and can be directly related to BSCs’ standard of practice in infection control cleaning techniques.\nHowever, not all exposure to germs and bacteria results in infection. Factors that affect the risk of contracting an infectious disease depends on the type of organism, the virulence or strength of the organism to overcome the body’s natural defenses, the number of live organisms received in an exposure and the host’s resistance to infection.\nInfections require three elements in order to spread disease, and can be thought of as a chain, according to the book, “Infection Control for Prehospital Care Providers.” The chain-linked elements are: Source of infection, route of transmission and susceptible host. If any one of the links in that chain is broken, infections cannot be passed.\nInfection sources can be found on living things such as people, animals and insects, as well as on inanimate objects such as bed rails, clothing, bed linens, water glasses and toilets.\nThe route of transmission is through direct contact with an infected person and susceptible host, through contact between an infected inanimate object and a susceptible host, through droplet contact such as sneezing or coughing, via food, air, water, blood and insects.\nThe last element in the spread of disease is through a susceptible host which is defined as a person or animal that is capable of becoming infected with the disease being transmitted.\nRecently, the most feared disease in healthcare facilities is Clostridium difficile, or C-diff. It is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and is transmitted by the contaminated hands of healthcare and cleaning workers, or on objects such as toilet seats.\nFrom 2001 to 2004, a particularly unusual strain of C-diff caused outbreaks in seven hospitals in Georgia, Illinois, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon and Pennsylvania. While 23 percent of C-diff-infected patients can be treated with an appropriate course of antibiotics such as Metronidazole or Vancomycin, according to the CDC, C-diff can kill patients with severely compromised immune systems.\nC-diff is shed in feces and surfaces that come in contact with feces serves as a reservoir. One of the most common harbors for C-diff spores is on portable and in-room toilet surfaces. The disease can be transmitted throughout the hospital simply by a nurse touching an infected surface and visiting the next patient without either changing gloves or washing hands. It’s easy to see how fast an outbreak can occur.\nAnother source of concern in healthcare environments is Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The first reported case of MRSA in the United States occurred in 1968, and recent CDC estimates indicate more than 100,000 are hospitalized annually with MRSA-related infection.\nMost MRSA cases have been limited to long-term care facilities such as nursing homes and rehabilitation hospitals, or to patients with a prolonged hospital stays. The CDC identifies the following as associated with the spread of MRSA: Close skin-to-skin contact; openings in the skin; contaminated items and surfaces; crowded living conditions such as hospitals and nursing homes; and poor hygiene such as infrequent hand washing.\nStaph is a common bacterium found in the nose, mouth, genitals and anal area of about 25 percent of the population. It becomes a problem when it manages to get inside the body of people with a weak immune system.\nStaph is transmitted via person-to-person contact. The highest transmission route is from infected nasal discharge and skin lesions, but 10 percent of infections can be attributed to cross contamination via medical equipment or infected surfaces. MRSA is classified among hard-to-treat “super bugs,” which are resistant to Methicillin, and must be treated with a high concentration of antibiotics such as Vancomycin.\nAnother bacteria present in every human body, enterococci bacteria, can sometimes cause infection. A common antibiotic use to fight this infection is Vancomycin; however, some enterococci no longer respond to the antibiotic and are thus termed “Vancomycin-resistant” (VRE). VRE was first reported in U.S. hospitals in 1989, and the CDC has determined that one in every three infections in hospital intensive care units can be attributed to VRE.\nVRE shares some common denominators with C-diff, and MRSA. At risk for VRE are patients hospitalized for an extended period of time with a weakened immune system, those who have had a recent surgical procedure and patients who have been on a heavy regimen of antibiotics.\nVRE is typically spread by direct contact with feces, blood or urine containing VRE, and through indirect hand contact or surface contact. VRE is not spread airborne through coughing or sneezing, nor is it passed with casual contact such as hugging.\nFor healthcare BSCs, the prime focus should be on eliminating the sources of disease by adequate surface cleaning, prevention of transmission by using proper barrier substance protection and reducing susceptibility to infection by continuing good hygiene and health.\nThe first line of defense against the spread of disease is through frequent hand washing. While waterless hand cleaners and antimicrobial soaps are good, extended and overuse of these cleaners may actually decrease the effectiveness of eliminating bacteria. Using soap and friction for 20 to 30 seconds is the best method to clean hands.\nThe use of barrier substance protection such as latex gloves, the use of gowns if soiling of clothing is likely, and the changing of gloves between patient rooms are also important in preventing the spread of disease, and diligent training of the cleaning staff in this area is imperative.\nEvidence-based practices for cleaning show that by reducing the bioload (number of infecting microorganisms on a surface) on high hand contact surfaces, outbreaks of C-diff, MRSA and VRE can be decreased. The highest concentration of bioload that will be encountered by the cleaning staff is found in the patient’s bathroom, light switches, bed rails, on privacy curtains and table surfaces — and these are the areas that staff should focus their infection control efforts on by using proper disinfecting chemicals.\nManagers should team with the hospitals’ infection control officer and chemical manufacturer to determine which EPA-registered hospital disinfectant will be most effective against C-diff. A challenge in eliminating C-diff in particular is that the spores do not effectively react to quaternary disinfectants or phenols. They do, however, respond to the use of hypochlorite-based products. Quaternary disinfectants are usually effective with MRSA and VRE.\nMost EPA-registered disinfectants suggest a 10-minute dwell time. Otherwise, the disinfectant may not be as effective.\nOne concern about current disinfecting practices is the use of spray bottles to disperse the chemical to the contaminated surface. Spraying a surface followed by a quick wipe with a paper towel is not sufficient to reduce bioload. Only germs that come in direct contact with disinfectant will be killed, which typically takes four applications of spray on a surface to properly kill microorganisms.\nWhen partnered with disinfectant, microfiber cloths are effective in achieving proper disinfecting using fewer applications.\n“At our Madigan Army Hospital in Tacoma, Wash., we have found that the procedure of submersing the microfiber cloth in the disinfectant is ideal for frequent cleaning and total disinfecting of applied area,” says Hugo Galatoire, vice president of operations at Aztec Facility Management in Houston. “The cloths are replaced after every patient room in order to decrease cost-contamination. This method significantly helps reduce the spread of disease and nosocomial infections which are a high priority in today’s healthcare environment.”\nThis practice allows a sufficient drop in the bioload by a wider coverage of disinfectant on the surface. Added benefits of microfiber products have shown they use a lesser amount of chemicals, and microfiber towels are reusable after laundering with a mild bleach solution.\nFinally, BSCs can benchmark their cleaning programs against standards to ensure they are performing proper infection-control measures. The best standards and protocols in healthcare infection control are set by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). JCAHO was designed to be a risk-reduction, patient safety arena, and an effective control program is a partnership between the hospital’s infection control officer and the EVS service provider, with everyone following JCAHO policy standards.\nImproving cleaning practices requires multidisciplinary collaboration between the hospital and its BSC. With well-defined cleaning protocols and a good in-service training program, reduction of microorganisms will promote a healthy environment for patients, visitors, cleaning staff and healthcare workers.\nDannette Young Heeth, CEH, NREMT-B, is the director of medical treatment facilities at Aztec Facility Management, Houston.\nDisclaimer: Please note that Facebook comments are posted through Facebook and cannot be approved, edited or declined by CleanLink.com.

58	What comprehensive measures prevent falling hazards in construction sites?	Preventing falling hazards in construction sites requires multiple safety measures. For falling objects, OSHA guidelines mandate securing tools and materials, using barricades with warning signs, installing toe boards and screens on guardrails, and utilizing debris nets or catch platforms. Workers must wear ANSI-compliant hard hats with proper shell and suspension systems. For preventing worker falls, which cause over 310 deaths annually, employers should implement fall protection programs, ensure proper ladder and scaffold maintenance, use correct anchorage systems, monitor weather conditions, and provide appropriate training. This includes using scaffolds on stable surfaces, following manufacturer guidelines, and maintaining three points of contact on ladders.	['Working on a construction site poses many hazards. Dropped tools–or other objects–can cause serious injuries and even fatalities for those down below. We’re well into our National Safety Month tribute and this week we’re focusing on staying protected from falling objects. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tells us that there are more than 50,000 “struck by falling object” events recorded every year in the United States. Learn how to minimize the risk of injury or death from falling objects on the job.\nHow can you prevent injuries and fatalities from falling objects?\nBoth employers and employees play important roles in preventing injuries from falling objects. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has several guidelines for environments where there are risks of falling objects:\n- Secure tools and materials to prevent them from falling on people below\n- Barricade hazard areas and post warning signs\n- Use toe boards, screens on guardrails or scaffolds\n- Use debris nets, catch platforms or canopies to catch or deflect falling objects\nHard Hats 101\nOSHA tells us that workers must wear a protective helmet when working in areas where there is a potential for injury to the head from falling objects. The hard hat you choose needs to comply with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z89.1-2009, “American National Standard for Industrial Head Protection” standard. Each helmet needs to have a shell and suspension system (such as a headband). The suspension’s job is to absorb the shock of a blow to the top of the hard hat; it needs to be adjustable to prevent the helmet from falling off the head.\nProper care of your hard hat will help you ensure it’s doing its job to keep you safe. Giving your hat’s shell and suspension routine inspections will help you maintain its efficiency. When inspecting the shell, Occupational Health & Safety Magazine recommends to look for cracks, nicks, dents, gouges, and any damage caused by impact, penetration, abrasions, or rough treatment. If your hat is made of thermoplastic materials, look for stiffness, brittleness, fading, dullness of color, or a chalky appearance. If you see any of these signs of wear, it’s time to remove the shell and replace it immediately.\nWhen inspecting the suspension, look closely for cracks or tears, frayed or cut straps, loss of pliability, or other signs of wear. All keys of your suspension keys should fit tightly and securely into their slots. If it shows signs of damage, remove the suspension immediately and replace. If you’re in doubt about the quality of your hat, contact the manufacturer.\nAt Working Person’s Store we offer a wide variety of hard hats to keep workers safe. If you’re looking for special features, like cooling pads, we can help. We also carry many different designs—from classic to cowboy—so you can find the one that’s right for you.\nStaying safe from falling objects takes active participation from employers and employees. Do your part to minimize this hazard at your workplace by following safety guidelines and always wearing protective head wear.', 'Preventing falls in construction\nAccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, falls are the leading cause of death among construction workers on the job, who average more than 310 fatal falls and 10,350 serious fall-related injuries a year. Additionally, the majority of fatal falls from scaffolds (86 percent), roofs (81 percent) and ladders (57 percent) occur in construction with a disproportionate number of those injuries and fatalities coming from small residential construction contractors.\nThe sixth annual National Safety Stand-Down to prevent falls — established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 2014 as part of the National Falls Campaign to raise awareness surrounding the severity of fall hazards in construction and the importance of preventing them — will take place the week of May 6–10, 2019. The goal of this national campaign is to prevent fatal falls from roofs, ladders and scaffolds by encouraging residential construction contractors to plan ahead to get the job done safely, provide the right equipment and train everyone to use the equipment safely.\nConstruction sites are dynamic spheres of activity where workers engage in many responsibilities that may expose them to a variety of safety hazards such as falling objects and working from rooftops or scaffolding. The International Code Council is just as concerned about jobsite injury prevention and ensuring the safety of code officials and construction workers as it is about building safety and making our communities safer and more resilient. Starting May 1, the Code Council kicks off Building Safety Month 2019, which raises awareness about building safety and building safety building codes. Week five of the international month-long event covers Innovations in Building Safety and shows how science and technology are leading the way to not only designing and constructing safe, efficient and resilient homes and buildings but also for ensuring job site safety for construction workers, code officials and other skilled technicians.\nIn a construction setting, the term “safety stand-down” is used to describe a wide variety of activities where normal work is paused and the entire site focuses on a particular safety issue. While some employers may use stand-downs to call attention to specific hazards present on their site as an intervention, the campaign has adopted the use of the stand-down to draw attention to fall hazards in a nationwide weeklong event. It’s an opportunity for employers to pause work and have a conversation with workers about fall hazards, protective methods, and the company’s safety policies, goals and expectations. This should also be an opportunity for workers to talk to management about fall hazards they see.\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation Program studies fatal workplace injuries and has published a new fact sheet intended to help construction employers and workers prevent falls from roofs, ladders and scaffolds. The fact sheet, which stresses the importance of training and regular ladder and scaffold maintenance, offers several recommendations for avoiding falls:\nFor workers on roofs\nImplement a fall protection program, wear proper fall protection and undergo corresponding training.\nUse correct anchorage for fall arrest systems.\nUse a buddy system.\nMonitor weather conditions when working at height.\nFor workers on ladders\nChoose the right ladder for the job.\nDon’t overload the ladder.\nUse the ladder on flat, level ground.\nFace the ladder while climbing and maintain three points of contact at all times.\nFor workers on scaffolds\nTrain and assign a person to supervise scaffold setup.\nEnsure scaffolds comply with manufacturer guidelines and OSHA standards.\nPlace scaffolds on stable ground or surfaces.\nInspect scaffolds and scaffold parts before each use.\nVisit the following sites for more information and resources:\nCDC Campaign to Prevent Falls in Construction\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Falls Campaign Site\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration Falls Campaign\nStop Construction Falls Campaign']	['<urn:uuid:dc8f3de0-8c10-4b7a-ac9d-2fd5822ef0b0>', '<urn:uuid:99c59d58-5387-42e9-af94-32b7429749b6>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	9	102	1142
59	parallel similarities between torah new testament structure compilation development	The Torah and New Testament were both compilations developed over time. The Torah was given to Moses and handed down through generations - from Joshua to the elders, to the prophets, and to the men of the Great Synagogue. It consists of 613 commandments embodying divine mysteries. Similarly, the New Testament developed gradually, with its earliest book (1 Thessalonians) written around 51 CE. While there was no universally recognized New Testament canon in the first three centuries, by the 2nd century a common collection of letters and gospels was considered authoritative. The final 27-book canon was first listed by St. Athanasius in 367 CE and accepted at the Third Council of Carthage in 397 CE.

Judaism is based on Zoroastrianism. It has given rise to two great religions of the world, i.e., Christianity and Islam. The Muslims admit that their religion is founded on Judaism. The Koran also is very clear on this point.\nZoroastrian conception of Ahura Mazda as the Supreme Being is perfectly identical with the idea of Elohim (God) Jehovah which we find in the books of Old Testament.\nAbraham, the Prophet, was the first man who has revealed God to all humanity. He is the Founder of the Hebrew race. Hebrew is one of the descendants of Jacob, an Isralite, a Jew. Isaac had two sons, viz., Essan and Jacob and their descendants are the Christians and Jews respectively. Abraham had two sons (one from Sarah and one from Hagar, the Egyptian woman), viz., Isaac and Ismael who are the fathers of Jews and Muslims respectively.\nOLD AND NEW TESTAMENT\nThe Old Testament contains the sacred writings of the ambient Jewish race. The newer portion is known as the New Testament which was begun after the coming of Jesus Christ, more than nineteen hundred years ago. Long before Jesus came to this world, the Jews wrote and studied their sacred books. These were written in their Hebrew tongue. The old Hebrew books were translated into Greek about two hundred years before the Christian era.\nThe books of the Jews were arranged into three main divisions. The first was called ""The Law"". It dealt with the laws of the world. These books are now the first part of the Bible, viz., Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The second class was that of the Prophets. It included Joshua, Isaiah, and Jeremiah. Psalms and Proverbs constituted third class. The Old Testament contains 39 books.\nThe New Testament contains 27 books. The first four books are Gospels which describe the life of Christ on this earth. The next book tells us of the Acts of the Apostles, particularly of the important Apostle Paul. The twenty-one shorter books give out the ideas underlying the Christian faith of the early Christians. The last book is the book of Revelations. It gives a description of the series of visions, viz., the lamb of God and the heavenly city. The author is John, the favourite Apostle of Jesus. All these books were written in Greek, which was the language of educated men at the beginning of the Christian era.\nThe Law was set forth as a complete system by which men should live. By the Law was understood in a special sense the Pentateuch. Every word of Pentateuch was considered as inspired and an immediate revelation of Moses.\n(a) There was a need for explanation of the Law. The Scribes were the interpreters of the Law. They explained and applied the rules of the Torah to special cases. The Scribes were recognised as the legislators and the judges of Israel. Their decisions had the force of Law. The first Scribes were priests.\n(b) The fraternity of the Pharisees were the popular or nationalist party. They believed in the doctrine of immortality, resurrection of the body, the existence of angels and spirits. As religious teachers, they upheld the authority of oral tradition as of equal validity with the written Law. They were inclined to fatalism in the question of the freedom of the will. The Zealots represented one extreme side of the Pharisaic movement.\n(c) Sadducus were aristocratic priests. They held to the letter of the Mosaic revelation. They denied the authority of the oral tradition as interpreted by the Pharisees. They taught complete freedom of the will in moral action. They had no belief in angels or spirits. They did not accept the doctrine of immortality as a deduction from the Pentateuch.\n(d) The Essenes followed celibacy, isolation, silence, ceremonial ablutions, and abstinence from animal food. They practised asceticism. They did worship of the sun and the angels. They believed in the dualistic theory of good and evil and the symbolism of light. They abstained from sacrifices and temple worship.\nThe Prophets of Israel were the great religious leaders who brought great progress in Behraic thought. Rabbis also were authoritative teachers. They worked very hard in the field of Torah. They produced the massive Talmudic literature. They were the representatives of Pharisiasm. Talmud is indispensable, for a knowledge of Hebraic thought.\nThe Torah was given in ten words. Each word became a voice. Every voice was divided into 70 voices all of which shone and glittered before the eyes of all Israel. Torah denotes the divine revelation to Israel on Mount Senai as embodied in the five Books of Moses. The Torah (Law) as given to Moses consists of 613 commandments which are the essence of the divine and terrestrial mysteries. Torah indicates a way of life rather than a form of belief.\nMoses received the Torah (Law, direction, instruction) on Senai and handed it down to Joshua, Joshua to the elders, the elders to the prophets and the prophets handed it down to the men of the Great Synagogue, a synod of zealous men created by Ezra, the Scribe in the fifth century B.C. The function of the synagogue was to study and teach Torah. The Synagogue was a church, a school, and a court of justice. It was a house of instruction. The unity of God, the Incorporeality of God, and the Holiness of God are the main features of Judaism.\nGod gave His ten commandments to Moses on the Mount Senai. The Lord called unto him out of the mountain and said: ""Thus shall thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel"".\nTHE TEN COMMANDMENTS\n- I am the Lord Thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.\n- Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.\n- Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.\n- Remember the sabbath-day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath-day and hallowed it.\n- Honour thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\n- Thou shalt not kill.\n- Thou shalt not commit adultery.\n- Thou shalt not steal.\n- Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.\n- Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour\'s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour\'s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbour\'s.\nThis is the Mosaic account of Cosmogony. On the first day heaven and earth were created; on the second, firmament and waters; on the third, dry land, grass, the birds, and fruit trees; on the fourth, lights, the sun, the moon, the stars; on the fifth, moving creatures, winged fowls, great whales; on the sixth living creatures, cattle, creepers, beasts, man. In Genesis, the Creation ends with the creation of man. God created Adam on the sixth day and gave him the charge of the animals. Adam had three children viz., Cain, Abel and Sheth. Cain killed Abel. The descendants of Cain were drowned in the flood. The descendants of the Sheth are all the humanity of the world. The Lord took Adam and put him into the garden of Eden to till it and to keep it.\nTENETS OF JUDAISM\nThe Jews believe in resurrection, in angels, and in the existence of two powers, viz., God and the Devil or Satan.\nThe Jews believe that every man\'s actions will be weighed on the day of Judgment in a balance. Men will have to pass after their resurrection along the bridge of Hell.\nThe unity of God is the cardinal principle of the religion of the Hebrews. God is bodiless. This is also a doctrine of great importance. God is ever pure and holy. This is third important attribute of God. He is the Creator of the entire world. He is the Father of all His creatures. He is just and merciful. He is without iniquity.\nThe Jewish saints have spoken much about the efficacy and power of repentance. Happy is the man who repents. The gates of repentance never close. Repentance prolongs a man\'s life. The tears of true repentance are not shed in vain. Even the most righteous shall not attain to so high a place in heaven as the truly repentant. Repent one day sincerely with a contrite heart before you die. After repentance you should not repeat the same wicked act. Even an hour spent in repentance with a contrite heart in this world is preferable to a whole life in the world to come. The end and aim of all wisdom is repentance.\nThe unity of God, the Incorporeality of God and the Holiness of God are the main features of Judaism.\nLast Updated: Sunday, 17-Oct-2004 09:45:56 EDT\nMail Questions, Comments & Suggestions to :', '(Redirected from The Bible)\nPart of the Thelema & Religion series\nThe Bible is the primary sacred scripture of both the Jewish and Christian religions.

The canonical list of the Books of the Bible differs between Jews, Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox, even though there is a great deal of overlap.\nThe general structure of the Bible, including all the various components are:\nThe Old Testament or Septuagint\n- Genesis – Exodus – Leviticus – Numbers - Deuteronomy\n- Historical books\n- Joshua – Judges – Ruth - 1 Samuel - 2 Samuel - 1 Kings - 2 Kings - 1 Chronicles - 2 Chronicles - Ezra - 1 Esdras - Nehemiah - Tobit - Judith - Esther - 1 Maccabees - 2 Maccabees - 3 Maccabees - 4 Maccabees\n- Wisdom books\n- Job – Psalms – Odes – Proverbs - Ecclesiastes - Song of Solomon - Wisdom – Sirach - Psalms of Solomon\n- Major prophets\n- Isaiah – Jeremiah – Lamentations – Baruch - Letter of Jeremiah - Ezekiel - Daniel\n- Minor prophets\n- Hosea – Joel – Amos – Obadiah – Jonah – Micah – Nahum – Habakkuk – Zephaniah – Haggai – Zechariah - Malachi\nThe New Testament\n- The Gospels\n- Matthew - Mark - Luke - John\n- History of the Apostles\n- (The Letters of Paul) Romans - 1 Corinthians - 2 Corinthians - Galatians – Ephesians – Philippians – Colossians – 1 Thessalonians - 2 Thessalonians - 1 Timothy - 2 Timothy – Titus - Philemon\n- (The General Letters) Hebrews – James - 1 Peter - 2 Peter - 1 John - 2 John - 3 John - Jude\nThe Old Testament\nThe Hebrew scriptures of the Bible—portions of which contain stories traditionally held to be historical accounts of much of the early history of the Hebrew Nation—teach that there is one God, Jehovah, ""Creator of Heaven and Earth"" who created Man ""in his own image"", and details the relationship between Man and his Creator.\nThe Old Testament has as many as 52 Books, depending on which version you look at, and is also called the Septuagint—Greek translation of the Jewish scriptures from the second century B.C. Most Protestants omit some of these works, roughly following the second century A.D. Jewish canon called the Tanakh, but with some re-orderings. Within Christianity, there is not complete agreement on what the Christian Bible contains, that is, on the Biblical canon. However, this only extends to a few books—there is no dispute as to the majority of books of the Bible.\nThe relationship between the Old Testament and the New Testament is not fully agreed upon among Christians. The degree to which the Old Testament and its laws applies to Christians is disputed. Very few Christians, for example, follow the dietary laws within the Old Testament, whereas almost all Christians believe that the Ten Commandments are applicable.\nThe New Testament contains many references to, and quotes from, the Old Testament, especially in relation to the fulfillment of prophecies concerning the promised messiah, whom Christians believe to be Jesus Christ. In Christian theological views, this expectation, present fulfillment and eschatological fulfillment of the divine, eternal kingdom under the headship of Jesus are the thread running through both Testaments.\nThe Pentateuch, Greek for ""five containers"", is the equivalent of the Hebrew Torah, is a Hebrew word meaning teaching, instruction, or especially Law. The Torah does not contain a complete and ordered system of legislature, but rather, a general philosophical basis, and a great number of specific laws, including the Ten Commandments. These laws are often reminiscent of the existing customs in the ancient middle east, but have important conceptual variations from them.\nThe book of Deuteronomy is different from the previous books; thus sometimes the first four books of the Bible are known as the Tetrateuch. The first six books of the Bible as a unit (The Pentateuch immediately followed by the book of Joshua) is sometimes referred to as the Hexateuch, as the book of Joshua picks up directly where Deuteronomy leaves off.\nThe New Testament\nThe New Testament, sometimes called the Greek Scriptures, is the name given to the part of the Christian Bible that was written after the birth of Jesus Christ. The term is a translation of the Latin Novum Testamentum, meaning ""The New Covenant"" or Testament. It was originally used by early Christians to describe their relationship with God and later to designate a particular collection of 27 books. For Christians, the NT is both a primary source of religious doctrine and a foundation for their spiritual beliefs. Some religious sects, notably, several of the Protestant Christian sects, believe the Bible to be the ultimate and authoritative guide in all spiritual matters, by a principle referred to as sola scriptura.\nThe earliest of the books of the New Testament was 1 Thessalonians, an epistle of Paul, written probably 51, or possibly Galatians in 49 according to one of two theories of its writing. Of the pseudepigraphical epistles, critical scholars tend to place them somewhere between 70 and 150, with 2 Peter usually being the latest.\nIn the first three centuries of the Christian Church, there was no New Testament canon that was universally recognized. Nevertheless, by the 2nd century there was a common collection of letters and gospels that a majority of church leaders considered authoritative. These contained the four gospels and many of the letters of Paul. The New Testament canon as it is now was first listed by St. Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, in 367, in a letter written to his churches in Egypt. That canon gained wider and wider recognition until it was accepted by all at the Third Council of Carthage in 397. Even this council did not settle the matter, however. Certain books continued to be questioned, especially James and Revelation. Even as late as the 16th century, theologian and reformer Martin Luther questioned (but in the end did not reject) the Epistle of James.\nThe Bible and Thelema\nAleister Crowley had grown up on the Bible, which resulted in many quotes and references to it running throughout his major works, including The Book of the Law. He writes of the Bible in Confessions:\n- I did not hate God or Christ, but merely the God and Christ of the people whom I hated. It was only when the development of my logical faculties supplied the demonstration that I was compelled to set myself in opposition to the Bible itself. It does not matter that the literature is sometimes magnificent and that in isolated passages the philosophy and ethics are admirable. The sum of the matter is that Judaism is a savage, and Christianity a fiendish, superstition. (p.72)\nNevertheless, he often employed aspects of the Bible. As Dionysos Thriambos points out in his essay, ""The Utility of the Bible to the Student of Thelema,"" anyone familiar with The Book of the Law will recognize certain Biblical passages, such as:\n- ""Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.""—Matthew 10:16, (see AL I:57)\n- ""He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.""— Revelation 22:11 (see AL II:57)\nAnd the Greek for Will (Thelema, Θελημα) appears about forty times in the New Testament. Dionysos Thriambos explains:\n- This word is of a particular, Biblical provenance. The Greek New Testament has forty instances of the word Θελημα, of which 32 refer to divine will, and seven refer to human will—although three of these are the will of a figure representing Jesus\' ""Father"" in a parable. One single instance in II Timothy 2:26 is noteworthy for describing the Θελημα of ""the devil.""\n- In fact, the word Θελημα occurs in one of the best-known gospel passages, the only actual invocation prescribed by Jesus, the ""Lord\'s Prayer,"" as it appears in Matthew 6:10, ""Thy kingdom come. Thy will (Θελημα) be done in earth, as it is in heaven."" Crowley wrote two updated versions of that prayer, in The Book of Lies chapters 2 and 44. In each case, ""Thy will is done"" is included to indicate transcendence of the earlier formula.\nCrowley mentions the Bible as a useful text for Thelemites. He lists it in the A.\'.A.\'. reading curriculum, describing it as “The Bible, by various authors unknown. The Hebrew and Greek Originals are of Qabalistic value. It contains also many magical apologues, and recounts many tales of folk-lore and magical rites” (Book 4).\n- The Skeptic\'s Annotated Bible (http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/) —a brilliant and funny version of the Bible annotated from a skeptical point of view.\n- The Bible Tool (http://thebibletool.com/) - contains a huge collection of bible texts, commentaries, glossaries, and dictionaries.\n- The Bible Gateway (http://bible.gospelcom.net/) - Free online Bible in many translations and encompassing literally 40 different languages.\n- King James Bible (http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/10) - plain vanilla text from Project Gutenberg\n- The New English Translation (http://www.bible.org/netbible/) - The first Bible made for the Internet.\n- The World English Bible (http://www.ebible.org/) - a Public Domain (no copyright) Modern English translation of the Holy Bible, based on the American Standard Version of the Holy Bible first published in 1901, the Biblia Hebraica Stutgartensa Old Testament, and the Greek Majority Text New Testament.

60	epica ice core drilling depth age record	The European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) drilled a three km deep hole to attain the oldest ice core ever recorded, at 800,000 years old.	['Posted on 07/06/2016 by julien\nPart 3. White Mars\nI had travelled across the world to come to my new home, Concordia Station. Now I had to get to know the place, how things worked here, and find my place among its crew. They made up the whole population of my new world.\nInland Antarctica has no permanent human settlements in the form of towns or cities, only research stations where crews come and go. What draws people to this harsh environment is not gold or oil but something even more valuable: knowledge.\nDuring the summer months, Concordia Station is a hive of activity, with the international scientific, technical and logistical teams busy preparing for the coming winter. Concordia can host about 60 people during the short summer period, both technicians and scientists such as astronomers, glaciologists, climatologists, seismologists and physicians.\nBuilt and operated by the French IPEV polar institute and the Italian PNRA Antarctic programme, Concordia is the only permanent European station on inland Antarctica. The site was originally selected for the stability of its ice, favourable for drilling into ancient ice cores that represent a treasure trove of climate recordings. The station consists of two towers connected by an enclosed walkway. One tower is dedicated to “noisy” rooms, such as the canteen, social rooms, gym and workshops. The other is the quiet tower containing sleeping quarters, hospital, laboratories and radio rooms. With its three levels the station is quite large: 1500 m2 for a maximum of 16 people during winter – nearly 100 m2 per person. A 15-metre-long seismic vault excavated near the station is used for experiments inside the Antarctic ice. Scientific instruments are dotted outside the station, including a number of telescopes. Still further away from the station, one of the tallest towers in all of Antarctica stands proud. This 40-metre scaffold construction, commonly called the American Tower, holds devices to measure atmospheric data such as wind speed and humidity. Many instruments at Concordia observe the snow and ice, and year-round tower instrument observations run by scientists on behalf of ESA help calibrate Earth Observation satellites, such as the SMOS orbiter looking into the Earth’s water cycle.\nPreparing and launching the experiments I would lead soon kept me pretty busy, although winter would be the main period for running the research protocols.\n“Concordia is a melting pot of personalities.”\nWorking in Antarctica makes you feel part of something much bigger. The international nature of the station permeates everything. Concordia is a melting pot of personalities, from many different countries, professional fields and backgrounds. I enjoyed getting to know a wide range of people and spent a lot of time speaking with people from all the different groups. It was also great to have the opportunity to learn new languages. This summer there were Italian, French, Swiss, German, British and Spanish crew members at Concordia. I enjoyed learning about how different events are celebrated by the other nationalities. At Christmas, for example – which is during summer there – we helped an Italian colleague make Limoncello. On New Year’s Eve we were served frog’s legs and escargots. By sampling from each country’s heritage, we made up our own “Concordian” way, learning a lot in the process – and having fun.\nDuring summer at Concordia there was not much privacy to be had. We shared our bedrooms with other crew members and the laboratories were typically full to bursting of people. All of the bunks had curtains though, which meant you could close the curtain and cut out the world, which could actually be pretty cosy.\nSo the station was far from quiet. Even walking outside of it came with an unexpected level of noise. The many instruments around the station were constantly humming and beeping, as if they were alive. Also, the snow crunched and squeaked loudly under my feet wherever I moved. My breathing was really heavy due to the thin air and quickly made my goggles ice up.\nThat said, there was something quite magical about the Antarctican landscape. It was so vast that everything felt still, epic and relaxing. The cold air was clean, without a trace of pollution. I felt much more in touch with the Earth, as the environment was not shielded from you as it often is at home, in say a shopping mall or a high-rise office building.\nThere were many new impressions, small things to be learned and rules to follow. It took some adjustment to get used to my new home, where rules turned out to be very different.\nTake such a basic thing as water. Because Concordia recycles most of its water, we were only allowed to use special products in the shower. This meant no conditioner for over a year for me … But that was a small sacrifice, knowing that our water recycling machine was originally a prototype for the one astronauts use on the International Space Station. Testing under real-life conditions how to recycle a resource such as water is of direct use in developing the recycling systems for human spaceflight missions beyond Earth, where each kilo brought amounts to a heavy cost and replenishment may not be an option. ESA’s MELiSSA project has been working for over two decades to create self-sustaining ecosystems to support life indefinitely in a closed environment.\n“A power failure would mean almost certain death for all crew unless the emergency source can be initiated in time.”\nOf course, energy is also precious. Concordia has a power station which is powered by fuel that travels about 1300 km from the coast to the station on an overland traverse using special snow trucks. The value of energy becomes all the more apparent as you think of the winter months, when a power failure would mean almost certain death for all the crew unless the emergency source can be initiated in time. We did an emergency exercise to simulate this and it took several hours to heat up the reserve engines. This is also why Concordia is built as two towers – one can be cut off from the other in case of fire, which maintains half the base for the crew.\nElectrical power is also a special chapter. As the station is insulated from the Earth by the ice it is difficult to keep electricity stable. This means you often lose hard disk drives and electrical equipment. I got through three hard disks within my first month of being there. This is of course also relevant for the experiment data and it was really important to back everything up. The dry atmosphere also meant I regularly got a shock when I touched a door handle or another crew member. My hair regularly stood on end and floated around my head because of this. Often at night, when I moved my duvet, I could see the electrical charges set off.\nEverything that reaches Concordia has made such an incredible journey that it is more important than ever not to waste things. All of our unavoidable waste was transported back out of the continent, so as not to pollute the Antarctican environment. This is a huge logistical challenge in itself. You therefore had to be very strict with the waste. We also sorted all of our waste so that it could be compacted and later recycled.\n“It was strange to see how quickly money can become meaningless.“\nAnother peculiar thing was that all our food and beverages were free, along with any other products for personal use, such as polar clothing and shower products. As a matter of fact, no one used money at the station. It was strange to see how quickly money can become meaningless.\nInstead, personal things became more valuable, as they could not be replaced. I guess for me the thing of most value turned out to be my camera. I am a keen photographer and took many opportunities to go outside, although you had to act quickly as the camera could only take a few shots before it froze.\n“With no shops around the corner, people started to get creative.”\nThe other things gaining real value there were gifts from the other crew. With no shops around the corner, people started to get creative. A tinfoil penguin and a lampshade made from can ring pulls and stones were among my favourites.\nThis also means that there are normally no spares of anything around, however much you may need them. In Antarctica you cannot expect things to work like they would back home, so you have to be flexible and accommodating. The French just say “C’est l’Antarctique …” and I think this is a pretty good philosophy to have.\nDuring the summer I spent a good proportion of my free time in the so-called EPICA workshop. The European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica is a famous ice core drilling project, known for having drilled a three km deep hole to attain the oldest ice core ever recorded, at 800,000 years old. Their workshop was composed of a weather haven tent outside, with a small stove in one corner. Although simple, it was without doubt one of my favourite places. I enjoyed, as often as I could, to spend my time chatting to the EPICA crew, who had been coming to Antarctica for many years. Most of them had also worked at other Antarctic stations, like Vostok and Rothera, and had also gone deep into the inland wilderness on scientific traverses. So they had plenty of stories and anecdotes to tell. I love this aspect of Antarctica – the sharing of its history and adventures with international polar colleagues next to a little warming stove.\n“By drilling down into the ice, you can effectively go back in time.”\nThe EPICA team even let me drill my own ice core, which was a very special moment for me. An ice core functions as a kind of time machine. As yearly snowfall turns to layers of ice, bubbles of air become trapped. These tiny “time capsules” contain the gases and chemicals that were in the atmosphere when the snow fell. By drilling down into the ice, you can effectively go back in time, not hundreds of years, or even thousands, but hundreds of thousands of years… To ages when humankind did not even exist on Earth. Analysis of these ice cores shows clearly the major climate shifts between ice ages and warm periods, revealing the link between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the Earth’s temperature in the past. This information helps scientists make the distinction between changes linked to the Earth’s natural cycles and those linked to human activity. The ice thus functions like a huge archive of information on the Earth’s climate through many ages. Frozen and stored, the information is still there, if you can only get to it.\n“Beneath the up to four kilometres of ice lies a hidden world …”\nMany secrets of our world’s history are locked in the ice, rocks and seabed sediments of Antarctica. Beneath the up to four kilometres of ice lies a hidden world of mountain chains, lakes and rivers. Such bodies of arctic water, unseen and untouched for hundreds of thousands of years, may contain microorganisms that would help us understand more about how life adapts to extremely challenging environments, and thus also about the possible existence of life on harsh planets and icy moons, such as Jupiter’s moon Europa. Satellites provide one means of revealing the hidden world beneath the ice, by probing the surface with sophisticated instruments from orbit. ESA’s CryoSat and SMOS orbiters each see through clouds and in the dark, providing continuous year-round measurements over these lands that are prone to both difficult weather and long periods of darkness. In this way, ice-covered lakes, rivers and even vast craters have been found and studied.\nSummer was overall a very exciting time for me, with much that had to be learned, but most of it was so fascinating that it was a pure pleasure.\n“I had been accused of ‘grounding the plane’.”\nI also enjoyed taking in the atmosphere of this very special outpost, getting to know as many people as possible, also those just alighting at the station with one of the aeroplanes. I particularly enjoyed taking a coffee with Jim and the other polar pilots and their Canadian crews. They told me about the places they had been and about their many adventures flying aircraft across the poles. There was one particular incident though, when I had been having coffee and a chat with them just as usual, but afterwards realised that almost the entire station was no longer speaking to me. This was because I had been accused of “grounding the plane”. The pilots had apparently lost track of time, caught up in our conversation, causing those expecting to take the plane that day to be delayed for a week. In actual fact, the plane left the following morning. But I had learnt first-hand how quickly stories and gossip can escalate in a small community like ours.\n“Winter was coming, with its constant darkness and isolation.”\nThe reason for the intense level of activity at the station was of course linked to the change of seasons. Summer is a short window that must be used to the fullest in order to prepare for the other much more challenging months of the year. Everyone knew that winter was coming, with its constant darkness and isolation.\nI heard many stories about the crews of previous winters – some of them wildly exaggerated, I am sure. Still, it made me nervous to consider how I would personally react to the coming experience and what challenges we would face as a crew.\nFor with all the small talk there was also an increasingly perceptible undercurrent of seriousness. People belonged to two categories. The majority would leave before darkness descended and cut off all transportation links. And then there was the small group of thirteen people who belonged to the overwintering crew, which included me.\n“Everyone at the station had an opinion about how our winter would turn out – and most felt compelled to share it.”\nEveryone at the station had an opinion about how our winter would turn out – and most felt compelled to share it with those of us who would stay on. Intermingled with this were also many stories about people in our crew, some true, some certainly not. Gossip at the station was unavoidable.\nAt a few points during the summer period I did consider my decision to come there, and if it was indeed the right choice for me. The approaching day of “no return”, when the last plane would leave and I would be facing nine months with just twelve other people, gave me some anxiety. What if I had made the wrong decision? The most frightening aspect was not the lethal cold outside, but the isolation inside and how we would react to it – me included.\nAs that last day came, I said goodbye to some of the closest friends I had made during summer. I also bade farewell to Jim and the team of pilots I had so enjoyed spending time with. It was quite an emotional time for me. But the planes had to leave.\nI still remember the sinking feeling as the noise of the last aircraft died away as it disappeared from view. Everything went quiet. Torn and forlorn, I went back inside the station, intent upon facing down the coming winter. Back in my bedchamber I looked at the calendar on the wall. The days until the next plane would arrive appeared endless.\nAt least I no longer had to worry about choosing to stay or not. It was too late for that. Only one thing was certain: I would face the longest and coldest winter on Earth, all of it here at Concordia, as part of the winter crew.']	['<urn:uuid:291bb2b8-a765-4b1e-a928-9401bf6e47a0>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	7	27	2667
61	forest carbon storage benefits challenges IPCC PFSI	Carbon storage through forests offers dual benefits and challenges. On the benefits side, as highlighted in the IPCC report, we must improve terrestrial ecosystem health for better carbon sequestration to limit warming to 1.5°C. Forests provide the only readily available means to remove existing CO2 from the atmosphere. Regarding challenges, the PFSI scheme in New Zealand demonstrates key issues that need addressing, including ensuring permanence of carbon storage (preventing loss through harvesting or fire), verifying carbon stocks, and maintaining compliance with protection requirements. The PFSI addresses these through strict regulations like 99-year minimum maintenance periods and prohibitions against clear-fell harvesting, while requiring ongoing carbon measurement and insurance against losses.	['Breaking Down the IPCC Report and What States Can Do\nSeptember 16, 2021\nIPCC Report Overview\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, is the world authority on climate science. Comprised of leading scientists from all over the world, the body releases a new comprehensive report on the state of climate science approximately every seven years, with interim reports on more specialized topics. The most recent report from August, Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis, builds on the 2013 report.\nMany of the report’s findings are not new. However, the evidence and anticipated severity of human-caused climate change is increasingly stronger. The historic heatwaves, wildfires, hurricanes, and flooding that have overwhelmed the US in just the past year are precursors to increasingly worse climatic disruption. The report’s findings are an alarm bell.\nLimiting warming to 1.5°C is possible, but time is of the essence.\nSince the Industrial Revolution, humans have emitted enough heat-trapping climate pollutants to warm the world by approximately 1.1°C. In order to limit warming to 1.5°C – a goal stipulated by the Paris Agreement – we must cut carbon pollution in half by 2030 and completely cease emissions by 2050. The Earth’s climate is complex, so there is a lag time between when greenhouse gas pollutants are released and when we start experiencing the associated warming. We are currently on a path to overshoot the target, but if we cease emissions immediately and improve marine and terrestrial ecosystem health so they can better sequester carbon, we may be able to return to below 1.5°C later this century. Some projections show a potential to hit 1.5° of warming by 2030, so the time for steep emissions reductions is now.\nWithout immediate action, we run the risk of activating irreversible tipping points.\nThe longer we burn fossil fuels and increase emissions, the more likely we are to trigger catastrophic climate tipping points. Climate tipping points are high-impact events where critical earth systems collapse, leading to irreversible cascading effects. Examples of tipping points include Antarctic ice sheet collapse, which would trigger rapid sea level rise, or the Amazon rainforest turning from a carbon sink to a carbon emitter, which would greatly speed up warming. Already, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation appears to be weakening; if it slows significantly or even stops, weather patterns and water cycles across continents will shift abruptly.\nCurbing methane is key to limiting warming.\nMethane is more than 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year time horizon, but it is short-lived in the atmosphere. That means that tackling methane emissions can have an immediate impact in slowing warming. Methane is a precursor pollutant to ozone, so stopping methane emissions would also improve air quality. NCEL recently held a webinar on how states could reduce methane pollution.\nStates Have the Tools to Decarbonize\nThe good news is that there are climate policy solutions out there that states are already implementing. Despite the chaos caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 and 2021 state legislatures passed increasingly ambitious bills on climate change. For example, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Virginia passed net zero emissions targets to decarbonize the state economy by 2050 or earlier. Washington state passed a comprehensive carbon pricing bill to support the implementation of its own net-zero emissions target passed in 2019. Maine became the first state to legislatively divest from fossil fuels. And, in weeks since the IPCC report came out, New York committed to zero-emissions vehicles and Illinois passed a bill to transition to no-carbon energy by 2050.\nThe threat of global climate change requires comprehensive solutions, and this is an all-hands-on-deck moment. Every state legislator can have a role in climate solutions, whether they serve on the transportation committee or the bonding committee or anything else. A helpful overview of climate policy solutions by sector is available here.', 'The Importance of reforestation mechanisms\nThe world is struggling in the fight against climate change. Efforts to maintain, let alone improve, a Kyoto type agreement are faltering while greenhouse gas (GHG) levels continue to rise along the worst case business as usual scenario.\nRecognition of the importance of reducing emissions from destruction of forests has been belatedly recognised with REDD plus initiatives. However the crucial importance of reforestation, and improved forest management to rapidly sequester and store carbon whilst delivering other ecological co benefits is still largely overlooked.\nGrowing more forests provides the only readily available means to suck CO2 out of the atmosphere, and to restore the inevitable overshoot of GHGs to safer levels well below 450ppm (99% of other climate change efforts are focused on avoiding emissions not removing existing atmospheric CO2.)\nNew Zealand (NZ) was the first country to develop and implement carbon forestry under a government regulated framework and now has developed two such mechanisms; one called NZ ETS forestry is designed to be compatible with short rotation timber plantations; while the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative (PFSI) is designed as a ‘best practice’, dedicated long term carbon conservation scheme.\nThis article is about the PFSI, its origins, purposes and attributes as a scheme for dedicated carbon forestry which may well provide a useful model for other jurisdictions.\nWhat is the NZ Permanent Forest Sink Initiative?\nThe PFSI is a Kyoto compliant carbon forestry scheme designed by the NZ government to encourage reforestation of marginal farm land by private landowners. It is also the world’s first Kyoto compliant Annex 1 country carbon and conservation forestry scheme.\nThe PFSI rewards participants by assigning to them all sequestered carbon (whilst holding them to account for maintaining the stored carbon) and enabling the carbon to be traded in Kyoto compliant markets.\nIn return for earning carbon credits landowners undertake stringent obligations to develop and maintain a permanent carbon forest on their land in perpetuity.\nOrigins of the PFSI\nThe invention of the PFSI arose from NZ’s ecological problems on the one hand, and its uniquely high agriculture sector emissions profile and LULUCF requirements on the other.\nWhen the first humans settled New Zealand just 800 years ago 80 percent of the land was covered in pristine rainforest. Human settlement unleashed major forest destruction and species extinctions. Fires during the Polynesian settlement period erased a third of the forest cover, and half of the remaining forest was destroyed by 19th century European settlers. Today remnants of forest are mainly restricted to high rainfall mountains, and are everywhere degraded due to depredations of introduced animal pests such as deer, goats and possums.\nIndigenous Forest Cover loss in NZ following human settlement, 1000 AD-2001.\nThe destruction of forests by the first waves of Maori and European settlers released some 15 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere, perhaps the highest per capita releases of CO2 in human history.\nToday NZ’s economy (c. 4.5 million people) is largely dependent on agriculture and commercial timber plantations located on these former forestlands, and on tourism. A third of NZ - about 9 million hecatares (ha)) is owned and managed by the Crown as conservation estate and includes almost all remaining indigenous forest. Across the productive land bank about 100 million livestock units are farmed on 14 million ha of pasture, and close to 1.8 million ha of plantations are managed for timber production.\nUnsustainable Land Use and Environmental Damage\nNZ is a very young country in geological as well as human terms. Much of the landscape has been uplifted by seismic and volcanic activity over the last few million years. Related to productive land uses NZ has three acute environmental challenges: extremely high erosion rates on steep farmlands (topsoil loss >20t/ha/annum on 700,000ha), faecal and nutrient pollution of streams and lakes in drainages of farmed areas, and loss of indigenous habitat, flora and fauna.\nPhoto; Soil erosion scars on steep hill country farmland following a high rainfall storm event. NZ has c. 1.2 million hectares of steep hill country pasture that is at risk to extreme erosion. Forests are highly effective in protecting against topsoil erosion (Top right forest area has very little soil loss)\nNZ landowners work their land without any subsidies - in other words there has been no economic alternative to continuation of farming or conversion to short rotation timber forestry. Recovery of conservation forest cover onto these problematic lands could effectively solve all of these ecological problems, but an economic driver is required for this to happen.\nKyoto Protocol marginalised forestry\nIn 2002 NZ Government policy advisors conceived the PFSI as a NZ domestic policy initiative to encourage afforestation of marginal farmland by assigning tradable Kyoto carbon offset credits and liabilities to participating landowners.\nThe design had to be Kyoto compliant in terms of the definition of forests and forest rules. But equally importantly the people designing the PFSI knew that to generate carbon credits that would have value in the international carbon market, a number of key concerns about forestry needed to be addressed within the PFSI design.\nIn particular carbon forests had a negative reputation because of concerns about\n- permanence (i.e. forest removals are reversed by harvesting or fire)\n- additionality (i.e. forests can be business as usual timber plantations)\n- verification and monitoring of carbon stocks\n- compliance (i.e. enforcing protection and on-going storage of carbon)\nThe PFSI was designed to meet these concerns.\nKey Design Features:\nThe main feature of the PFSI is the restrictions on harvesting and the permanence obligations. Originally the PFSI was conceived as a no harvest regime for at least 99 years. Following consultation, provision was made for low intensity sustainable timber harvesting during the 99 year minimum period the participating forest is required to be maintained, subject to replacement liabilities on any lost carbon. Provision was also made to allow participants to withdraw after 50 years, subject to full replacement of carbon stocks. In reality it is most unlikely any participants would clear their forests after 50 or 100 years because of the prohibitive cost of carbon replacement.\nAs a result of being maintained for the long term, PFSI forests will sequester and secure high carbon densities. By comparison, sequestration by short rotation bioenergy plantations and industrial timber plantations might be as little as 10% to 30% of long-lived forests.\nFigure 1 represents carbon stocks (t C02/ha) of planted radiata pine forest in NZ from time of planting to 100 years age, The timber regime is clear-felled every 30 years releasing stored carbon. Data on which the modelling is based is statistically ‘rich’ from 0-50 years and ‘poor’ from 50-100 years.\n- The Crown (NZ Government) is guarantor of the scheme and of the issued credits.\n- Each PFSI project is based on a contractual agreement between the Crown and the landowner, registered as a Covenant on the land title.\n- The Crown issues carbon credits for increased carbon stocks within the forest and the landowner will maintain a forest on the land for a minimum of 99 years.\n- There are strict prohibitions against clear fell harvesting for the 99 year period although some limited sustainable harvesting on a “continuous canopy basis” is permissible.\n- The landowner is responsible for any carbon lost from the forest for the duration of the agreement. In other words if there is harvesting (within the rules) or a natural event such as fire or wind-throw, then the forest owner must repay to the Crown the lost carbon.\n- The Crown has extensive powers to ensure the PFSI is complied with. This includes entering the land and establishing a forest where the landowner has failed to maintain one.\n- Registration is a straight forward and low cost process. Preparation of an application with high resolution mapping and registration fees may take less than 4 months to complete and cost less than USD $1500 per project.\n- On-going (5 yearly) carbon measurement is required for projects >100 ha and the cost is typically in the range of USD $4-5 per hectare per annum.\n- The Government maintains a carbon registry for each project under the NZ Emissions Unit Registry that records the assignment of carbon stocks.\n- Insurance offerings to cover against loss of carbon have been developed by several providers. Cost of fire and wind insurance offerings for full replacement value of carbon are available for <USD $15/ha/an\nProgress of the PFSI\nIn late 2006 the empowering PFSI legislation was passed unanimously by NZ Parliament, a rare achievement in NZ’s multiparty politics. A year later when key PFSI regulations and the Government PFSI Covenant agreement were completed the registration of the first PFSI forest carbon conservation projects got underway.\nSince the scheme began in 2007 about 55 projects (c.14, 000 ha) have been registered with another 10 (c. 5000ha) in the pipeline. The projects comprise both indigenous forest recovery projects (70%) and planted forests (30%).\nThe Government undertook a public consultation and review of the PFSI in 2011 and not surprisingly the majority of submissions were supportive, although ETS plantation forestry sector submissions were not. There is strong support for the PFSI from leading environmental NGOs, including Greenpeace, WWF, and Forest and Bird (NZ’s largest environmental NGO), and strong cross-party political support continues.\nIt needs to be remembered that Landowners who register under the PFSI are making a major commitment; to maintain and protect their forest areas as permanent carbon conservation sinks while shouldering replacement liabilities and forgoing other commercial options such as clearing the land for farming or commercial timber plantations.\nUptake of the PFSI will be determined by whether carbon offsetting proves to be a viable commercial alternative to more conventional landuse options, and this rests on support provided through purchase of PFSI offsets. Participants need to know with some surety that carbon sequestered in their forests will be saleable into the future at an attractive price. The greater this surety the greater the uptake will be.\nIf the most ecologically problematic land types amounting to ten percent of NZ’s farmland were afforested for carbon and conservation over the next few decades the resulting sequestration could exceed 2GtCO2 within 50 years, and could serve to offset the entirety of the agriculture sectors intractable emissions over this period.\nThe extent to which this might be achieved will depend on the market value of PFSI carbon units. If there is sufficient payment for the environmental services that PFSI conservation forests provide there is a major opportunity for the environmental damage resulting from human settlement in NZ to be healed.\nThe author is Managing Director of Permanent Forests International Ltd (not to be confused with the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative (PFSI)), a NZ based company that specialises in best practice carbon forestry. www.permanentforests.com']	['<urn:uuid:ea535e6b-4cd0-4c7b-8759-8ce18138f471>', '<urn:uuid:caae2751-297e-4d96-85b5-672b94c421b1>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	7	109	2436

63	comparing durability wooden rc sailplanes fiberglass boating materials real cost effectiveness	When comparing durability, fiberglass boats and wooden RC sailplanes have different maintenance needs and longevity characteristics. Fiberglass boats can last up to 50 years with proper maintenance, requiring protection from UV rays, water saturation, and salt damage. While fiberglass requires less maintenance than wooden boats, it still needs regular care including bottom protection, waxing, and cleaning. For RC sailplanes, wood construction offers the advantage of easier repairs since individual parts can be replaced by competent craftsmen. In contrast, fiberglass hull damage can be almost impossible to properly repair since these hulls are made all at once. RC sailplane wood construction also allows for strategic material choices, like using spruce for increased durability in high-stress areas while maintaining repairability.	"['As far as I know these are the first model aircraft plans published on the web. (Let me know if you if you know otherwise. Click here for more info.\nNo matter what kind of radio control flying you want to do (power scale, power stunt, helicopter, flatland soaring, or ridge soaring), radio control sailplanes are the best way to learn to fly for several reasons:\nEasier to build. No fussing with starting batteries or fuel.\nEasier to repair. While radio control boats seldom sink and cars are pretty rugged, when learning to fly model aircraft you will crash (although the frequency and likelihood can be reduced through proper training with an experienced pilot). Since a training glider is much lighter and does not have a powerplant assisting its descent, damage and risk of injury will be less than with a powered model.\nNo dangerous prop or chopped fingers. A training sailplane will be light weight with sufficient drag to prevent extreme speed build up.\nA training sailplane will have only elevator and rudder, important when learning to fly.\nA complete training setup, kit, materials, and all essential tools can be had for about US $250 with careful shopping.\nMy favorite recreation is to hike and fly our Mount Diablo foothill ridgelands. Even flying from a large flat field with a ""high start"" (rubber tubing and string) will give you plenty of exercise.\nI recommend kit building for the beginner. Since it is inevitable that you will have to repair your sailplane at some point, you will have developed most of the skills and knowledge required by building from a kit. (By kit, I do not mean assembly of a ""Ready to Finish"" (RTF) or ""Almost Ready to Fly"" (ARF) aircraft.\nModel sailplane construction and operation is both a hobby and a sport. The hobby part is the construction, maintenance, and repair of airframes and equipment, while the sport is the development and use of skills in operation. Although forms of the hobby can be pursued without the sport (e.g., building display models), the sport is most economically enjoyed by involvement with the hobby.\nFeatures important to the beginner are simple construction, a rudder/elevator design (no ailerons), a thick, flat bottomed wing (for easy construction, low sink rate and to avoid rapid speed buildup). A ""turbulated"" leading edge, with spanwise square stock across the upper surface forward of the spar will exhibit a low sink rate at slow speed. Foam core wings, while durable, may be too heavy for easy slow flight, and ""D"" tube sheeted leading edge wings are difficult for the beginner to build and repair.\nGood examples of aircraft suitable for the beginner are the ""2 by 6"" (72 inch span) and the ""Pussycat"" (2 meter, or 78 inch span, shown above). These have low parts count, simple fuselages of rectangular cross section and simple wing designs with flat bottomed airfoils. The ""Gentle Lady"", although popular, and flyable over a wider range of conditions, has (in my opinion) an overly complex structure.\nKits can greatly improved for durability while adding very little weight. Most of the modifications suggested here are to improve durability for rough country flying and beginner\'s flying errors and to ease repair tasks by localizing damage.\nA simple change is to use 1/8"" spruce for the wing turbulators (in place of balsa) and to use spruce spar caps in all wing panels. The spruce turbulators add little weight in this small size and are much more durable, especially when the wing is handled. Using spruce instead of balsa in the outboard panels will add some weight, but with a big payoff in ruggedness.\nModify the wing leading edges\nThe Pussycat is designed with cedar arrowshaft leading edges. These leading edges are too durable, in that a collision with a rock or fencepost will often cause the failure of three to five ribs as in addition to a difficult to repair broken leading edge. When building the wing you can easily replace the arrowshaft with 5/16"" square hard balsa (reshaping the leading edge notches in the ribs to accommodate this). Combined with fiber tape as suggested below this leading edge will be tough and will localize damage to a small area.\nLeft view above: turbulators, hard balsa leading edge, ""C"" beam spar webbing, closed trailing edge.\nRight view above: ""T"" section forward ribs. Red object in wing tip is a glued in push-pin for static balance (balanced prior to covering).\nAdd underwing rib caps\nBy removing 1/16 inch from the bottom of each rib (except the center ribs, which are already relieved for the center sheeting), you may then add strips of 1/16 by 1/4 strip stock between the spar and leading edge. This transforms the rib cross section to an inverted ""T"", which adds much collision strength to the leading edge. You can cut these strips from sheet stock.\nThe Pussycat was designed with ""I"" beam spars, which are not only difficult to build, they are not as strong as ""C"" spars, where the webbing extends from the top to the bottom surface on one side of the spar. Buy a sheet of 1/16 inch medium hardness balsa for the webbing. The webbing between the top and bottom spars should be extended all the way to the tip. This and the spruce outer spars will make the wing much more durable if the tip is driven into the ground. The grain of the webbing must be vertical - running from spar cap to spar cap.\nModify the trailing edges\nThe trailing edges of the Pussycat are simple 1/16"" sheet forming a triangle open on one side. By closing the open side of this triangle with 1/16"" sheet strips between each rib, the wing will be much more durable when handled. Unlike the spar webbing, you do not need to put the wood grain vertical - simple grainwise strips will do.\nUse a fiber reinforced packing tape, torn into 1/4"" strips, to reinforce the transverse wing elements. This will not add working strength but will prevent shattering in a crash and will hold broken pieces together. It is then often possible to repair a damaged wing leading or trailing edge by aligning the parts and using thin CA glue to rejoin the pieces. (Repair of a broken spar is usually more difficult, requiring a sawn scarf (angle cut) joint and replacement section glued with epoxy.)\nModify the after fuselage shape\nThe after fuselage of the Pussycat (and most other aircraft) tapers evenly to the end. By making the fuselage a little wider near the end and then increasing the taper, the fuselage is considerably strengthened just forward of the stabilizer. This location is a common point of breakage without this modification.\nSide view showing fuselage ramp for easy wing pop-off. Rudder is ""Bobcat"" sized, for use of fuselage with a Bobcat (aileron control) wing. The only substantial difference between a Pussycat fuselage and that of a Bobcat is the larger rudder and the Bobcat has a ""T"" tail. This ""T"" tail is fragile, heavy, and not worth the trouble. The main advantage of a ""T"" tail is that it is up out of long grass and twigs. This is more effectly addressed with a ""V"" tail (to be the subject of a future page).\nAircraft shown is entirely scratch built from dimension materials, with 1/32"" plywood fuselage and other modifications described here.\nModify the fuselage at the wing leading edge\nThe fuselage of the Pussycat hooks the leading edge of the wing. This is a bad design feature since a hard nose in into the ground (common in ridge soaring) can break the wing, rather than allowing it to pop off. Instead of this hook, modify the fuselage to form a ramp, where the wing can slide forward and upward. If you do not like the appearance of the gap formed, add a fairing to the wing. Filling this gap is not recommended for a trainer since it will inhibit wing rotation about the fuselage when a tip digs into the ground.\nModify the wing hold down pins\nThe wing hold down dowels across the fuselage accept rubber bands across the top of the wing. In an extreme crash the rubber bands will break, but a more readily releasable wing can be obtained by using short angled pins made from the same material. The rear pins (not shown) point backward. These pins should anchor both in the fuselage side and in the nearby transverse bulkhead. Glue them in with a little 5 minute epoxy.\nUse piano wire in tubing\nAlso seen in the previous picture is part of the wire control system. I use the inner (moving part) of a Nyrod(TM) as an outer guide for a wire pushrod, with an appropriate attachment to the servo arm. These are readily adjustable and are much more stable under temperature changes than is the nyrod, while being much lighter than steel cable in plastic tubing. Short segments of nyrod are used where the wire is accessible, with a continuous segment in the tailcone. An alternative (used in hand launch gliders) is to use short segments of aluminum tubing as guides, with no ability to remove and rethread the wire. It is best to be able to remove the wire since it can rust and may need polishing or replacement.\nAdd fuselage gussets under the wing.\nThe fuselage opening under the wing has a central bulkhead. By adding a triangular gusset inside the fuselage between this bulkhead (on the after side) and the fuselage side, the fuselage is greatly strengthened. These gussets increase the resistance of the fuselage to twisting, which is one of the failure modes in an extreme crash. You can also add a simple cross panel gusset at the after end of the fuselage opening (just under the trailing edge of the wing).\nA durable, lightweight fuselage may be built of 1/32"" spruce plywood, edged with 1/8"" spruce. The spruce edge stringers are doubled at the equipment hatch and wing opening. The portion of the sides under and forward of the wing should be infilled with 1/8"" balsa, with the grain vertical. While not trivial to build, such a fuselage is lighter than a ""light ply"" fuselage and is much more durable than either balsa or light ply. In general, keeping the after part of the fuselage and empenage light will greatly reduce or eliminate the need for nose ballast. Any weight saved on the tail will thus be multiplied in overall weight savings. It is possible to build too light, resulting in a lack of penetration and a tendency to wallow in flight, so don\'t go overboard. Light weight construction is much more important for ""Grenade Launch"" (hand launched) gliders.\nYou can heat seal two 1/2"" wide strips of heat shrinkable polyester cloth covering material together (glue side to glue side on a 1/8"" overlap). Be sure that you have a strong joint. Cut this into 2"" strips and use for ""Z"" hinges. Use shorter length strips at each end of the moving control surface. These provide both hinging and aerodynamic sealing and unlike mechanical hinges, strengthen the related components (stabilizer/elevator or fin/rudder). Note that this is not recommended for use on powered aircraft.\nAvailable at craft shops, this glue is appropriate for wing and empenange construction. It dries to a tough and somewhat flexible joint, reducing the tendency for wood to fail just off of the glue joint. It is a water based glue and so is easy to clean up. (It is also ideal for attaching bubble canopies as it dries almost clear.) Unlike CA, it looses weight as it dries.\nThick Cyanoacrilic glue will not soak into the balsa and will reduce the overall weight of your model. It can also be used for tacking in combination with Eilen\'s glue, giving the advantage of fast, pinless construction and light weight with toughness\nMost kit plans do not include drawings of every different rib. Carefully preserve the sheet from which the ribs were removed. By carefully removing the ribs the remaining material will form a useful pattern form making whole or part replacement ribs. If your kit has loose (usually pre-sanded) ribs, trace each distinct rib shape onto paper before use.\nAdd some small, low protrusions on the bottom of the wing that will ensure accurate alignment. If you use protrusions, be sure that the wing can still rotate and slide in a hard landing without damaging any components. Better yet, you can simply add some alignment marks which you check before every launch.\nClick here for wing assembly tips. This improved method may help you build a lighter, stronger, more accurate and more easily constructed multi-panel wing.\nMake sure all surface are free of warps, that the wing is balanced from side to side, that the fore and aft balance (CG, or Center of Gravity) is where the designer specified (in a fore and aft sense), and that the stabalizer is parallel to a line across the wingtips. While a little nose heaviness can make the aircraft more stable in pitch, moving the CG back of the design location (typically 25% of chord for a trainer) can result in an unflyable aircraft.\nA pilot with basic flying skills can fine tune the center of gravity by observing the flight response. This is best done by ridge soaring, where you can fly the aircraft back and forth and observe the pitch response at eye level. First adjust the pitch trim control on the transmitter for level flight at moderate speed. Pick up additional speed by flying a shallow dive and release the control. The aircraft should gently pull out into a shallow climb. If it pulls up sharply, you have too much nose weight (the center of gravity is too far forward), while if it continues in or steepens the dive the nose is too light. While this may not seem sensible at first, consider that additional nose weight is countered by additional up elevator in level flight. This up elevator becomes more effective as speed increases. You may notice that even though the aircraft will recover by itself from a shallow dive, it will not self recover from a fast, steep dive. The reason for this is that the center of lift moves aft as the angle of attack decreases. The angle of attack decreases because the required lift is produced at a lower angle due to the increased speed. The aftward movement of the center of pressure is a characteristic of asymmetrical airfoils, such as the flat bottom wing used in a trainer.\nAssuming that the rudder, fin, and stabilizer are properly aligned, then if the aircraft tends to turn in a dive then the wing is warped. If the aircraft tends to turn to one side when the aircraft is slowed, then the wing half toward that side of the turn is heavier than its opposite (the center of gravity is not on the centerline).\nBeginners should find an experienced pilot to guide them. It is especially important for a beginner that the aircraft be properly set up and trimmed. Do not fly in conditions beyond your capability. Repairing damage can be time consuming and frustrating to a beginner.\nBefore each launch, put up the antenna, turn on the transmitter and receiver and check that your controls operate. This will keep you from launching into free flight.\nInspect your aircraft after every hard landing. Damage, even if minor, should be repaired before flight. If you think you want to do field repairs, carry a sharp knife or razor blade, thin CA, thick CA, accelerator, and transparent tape.\nIf you intend to carry your transmitter about (and your plane is not flying), put the antenna down. (This absolutely requires that you put it back up before your next flight!)\nIf you are carrying your plane on a steep slope, hold it on the downslope side. If you slip and fall, your feet will go out from under you in the downslope direction and you will land upslope and not atop your glider.\nI have found the ""Stylus"", a one meter designed for hand launch, an excellent ""Hike and Fly"" plane. Not intended for beginner construction, it is difficult to build to its 11 ounce (308 gram) design weight, but that doesn\'t matter much for hike and fly. Mine is 14 ounces (392 gram) and is flyable over a wide range of terrain and wind conditions. It uses ""micro"" servos and small battery pack, but a standard sized receiver. The ability to toss it to a reasonable altitude is very useful when hiking ridge tops under light or no wind conditions, while its small size light weight, and pop-off wing give it an unexpected ruggedness (mine has spruce leading edges for this type of flying). The big advantage of flying this kind of ship (no ailerons) is that you can ""park"" it in the air. You can set up a stable course and take your eyes off of it long enough to ensure your footing (or even enjoy the view) while moving about. This is not practical with a low dihedral aileron ship, which must be flown at all times. The small wingspan aids in carrying the ship through brush, where a 2 meter ship is inconviently large.\nThe design and construction of a slightly larger, easier to build ship for this use will is now in progress as noted at the beginning of this page.\nYou can fly from flat fields using the equipment and methods shown here.\nFor more info e-mail me with subject ""RC Sailplanes"" at the address shown below in the graphic (this is to foil spambots, net spiders that collect e-mail addresses for mass mailings).

Fiberglass is very durable, and with proper maintenance and care, fiberglass boats can last for many decades.\nFiberglass itself will not break down but instead will break down due to outside factors.\nSome factors that will affect break down are:\n- Exposure to UV rays\n- Fatigue from movement\n- Water saturation\n- Salt from seawater.\nToo much UV rays can cause the fiberglass to become more brittle. Because most boating happens during sunny weather conditions, this is a highly probable issue.\nWater saturation can cause a breakdown between the fiberglass and the resin. This is most often caused by acid formation with the water and products hidden in the fiberglass.\nSalt from saltwater can move between the fiberglass and become deposited in the fiberglass’s larger porous areas. This causes the salt to add to the pressure on the fiberglass.\nOne final issue could be poor production at the beginning of the boat’s life. This is hard to combat, and you will want to ensure you purchase a high-quality boat.\nOne of the biggest issues you will encounter with your fiberglass boat is the other components. Your fiberglass is much more likely to last than your other structural, engine, and electrical components.\n3 Factors That Impact The Durability Of Fiberglass Boats\nSo, what if you already have a fiberglass boat?\nYou’re probably thinking: what should I look out for?\nThe main things you want to look for in your fiberglass are:\n- Small cracks\n- Water damage\n1) Small Cracks\nTo find aging damage, you will want to look for microscopic cracks.\nAt first, they might seem minor, almost hairline. These cracks should not be ignored as they can get bigger with time—the bigger the cracks, the more pressure is applied to the fiberglass’s structure and integrity.\nThis break in the integrity of the fiberglass can further compromise the structure of your vessel. For this reason, fiberglass boat owners need to monitor their boats for cracks constantly.\nWhen cracks are found, they need to be dealt with and filled in.\nFiberglass can also experience fatigue.\nVibration and impact on the fiberglass can cause stress and fatigue. Repetitive waves, engine vibrations, and other activities can cause strain on the fiberglass.\nAfter a certain amount of time, fiberglass can also get worn down. Without proper care, the fiberglass can become weak and brittle.\n3) Water Damage\nYou need to ensure your fiberglass is not experiencing water damage.\nWhile the resin itself is waterproof, if water gets in, it can damage the fiberglass. Eventually, after enough water is absorbed, the damage will apply more and more pressure, which can cause wear, blistering, and cracking.\nThe part of the boat that is most susceptible to this damage is the part of the hull that is below the waterline.\nThe last thing to look out for is heat and sun damage.\nWith enough heat and UV rays, the fiberglass in the hull can become rigid and brittle. This can even cause warping.\nOne major issue with a fiberglass hull is that warping or major damage to the fiberglass itself can be challenging and expensive to repair.\nAs previously expressed, if you own an older boat, your main issue is most likely not in the fiberglass. That doesn’t mean that you should not need maintenance and monitor your fiberglass. Vigilance, maintenance, and preventative care are the best way to maintain your fiberglass’s structural integrity.\nHow To Prolong The Life Of Fiberglass Boats\nSome people will try to tell you that your fiberglass “does not need maintenance.”\nThis is not true.\nCompared to other types of boats, especially wooden boats, fiberglass is much less maintenance. This does not mean that there is no maintenance involved, and you must keep up with it.\nMost importantly, when maintaining your boat, you need to protect the bottom constantly exposed to water.\nIf your boat is left in the water for even a few days, you will want to attempt to protect it from algae and other growth. To prevent this, there are certain protectants and bottom paints you can apply.\nYou will want to ensure whatever growth repellent you purchase works for the area and body of water you plan on having your boat in. Before application, you will want to make sure to properly sand or otherwise prepare your fiberglass.\nThe area between the railing and the waterline needs to have regular maintenance done because this part of your boat takes on most of the waves, spray, and sun. Without proper care, this area will fade, oxidize, and get hazy. To combat this wear, you need to make sure you keep up the wax on your boat.\nIf waxing becomes a hassle, you can get a buffer. This will enhance the process and make it easier to complete.\nThe deck of a boat also sees a lot of wear. This comes from sun, dirt, grime, spills, and other general wear and tear. The main way to combat this is regular washings and a good stiff brush.\nBe sure never to wash a “non-slip” area with wax. This is highly important on the deck where people walk. Safety should always be your priority.\nBesides this maintenance, you will want to maintain cleanliness on all other aspects of your boat. This will help to keep the condition pristine and avoid aging and wear.\nFinally, no matter what type of boat you own, you will want to maintain the engine properly. You want to make sure you maintain your boat engine constantly.\nThis is true if you use your fiberglass boat every day or only occasionally. If you only use your boat occasionally, you will still want to maintain the engine as if you use it regularly.\nMaintaining your boat engine is like maintaining your vehicle engine. You will want to make sure it is properly oiled fueled, and the boat battery is charged.\nLike a car, keeping a boat’s radio or lights on for a long time can drain a battery and even kill it.\nHow To Spot Aging Signs On Used Fiberglass Boats\nWhen buying an old fiberglass boat, especially a “fixer-upper,” there are some things to keep in mind.\nUnlike wooden trim items, fiberglass boat structural issues are more difficult to repair or restore.\nRestoring a fiberglass hull can be almost impossible, depending on the wear accrued. Because these hulls are made all at once, patching them is your only option if the problem is that simple.\nWooden boats are more maintenance and more difficult to maintain, but they do allow for the replacement of parts by competent and qualified artisans.\nWhen purchasing a used fiberglass boat, you will want to look out for the signs listed above. You will need to know if you are looking at any structural issues.\nMake sure to check for cracks, fading, wear, growth, or damage. Look at the high-stress areas for cracks, wear down, or other signs of damage.\nThe pressure created in the fiberglass can cause issues for you later.\nAs well as fiberglass wear, you will want to make sure that your hull is not chipped, blistered, or starting to flex excessively.\nStress on a fiberglass hull can cause flexing as degradation occurs. This can cause major cracks and severe hull issues.\nIssues found with a boat can be fixed. Based on the extremity of the issue and your experience, you should look for a professional opinion on maintenance and damage restoration. This is important before you buy. Taking on too many issues may quickly make your new boat purchase a headache you never wanted and were not prepared for.\nIf everything is intact with the boat, and you do not see any cracks, warping, mechanical failure, or other issues, it would be safe to purchase the used fiberglass boat.\nIf you keep up with the proper maintenance, a used older fiberglass boat could last you many years to come.\nWhy Do Fiberglass Last So Long?\nFiberglass is a form of plastic that is reinforced using glass fiber. The glass fiber is usually woven into a fabric. This makes the fiberglass superior when it comes to durability.\nFiberglass material is relatively lightweight, extremely durable, and less brittle than standard glass or plastic.\nFiberglass can be easily molded and is often used to make more complex shapes. Standard uses for fiberglass are boats, aircraft, bathtubs, etc.\nFor a boat to be considered a fiberglass boat, the hull, deck, liner, and even large parts of the console are made from fiberglass.\nFiberglass boat construction in a mold first uses a gel coat; fiberglass cloth layers are applied, with resin applied on each layer.\nBefore fiberglass, boats were constructed from bark, wood, animal skin, iron, or steel. Today, larger ships are still constructed from aluminum or steel, while smaller recreational boats are made from fiberglass or GRP.\nFiberglass boat construction was experimented with as early as the late 1930s and is the main manufacturing method.']"	['<urn:uuid:9b36d81b-807e-4ae5-aa32-3e1317c3def0>', '<urn:uuid:e2437e29-1570-448f-98ca-a5b77dbb93e5>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	11	118	4552

['Master Alliance Provisions Guide (MAPGuideⓇ)\nCreating Successful Stewardship and Access Plans\nStewardship and access plans can play an important role in achieving equitable access to medical product innovations. Global health funders often include requirements for such plans in their access policies and/or through contractual obligations in product development agreements. However, it can be difficult to understand the key building blocks of an effective stewardship and access plan, as these documents are often agreement annexes that are held confidentially between parties. Even template stewardship and access plans are not widely available.\nOne useful resource is the Stewardship and Access Plan Development Guide recently published by Wellcome Trust and a group of stakeholders. The Guide originates from a contractual requirement for all CARB-X funded product developers to create a Stewardship and Access Plan, or SAP, after they enter into pivotal human trials (generally phase III trials). The SAP will be published on CARB-X’s website following the product’s first regulatory approval. The full text of the SAP requirements included in all CARB-X sub-award agreements can be found in the GHIAA MAPGuide.\nThe SAP Development Guide is intended to serve as a resource for both product developers and the broader global health and scientific communities. It was developed by a cross-sector working group led by Wellcome Trust, with participation from other CARB-X funders, GARDP, and ATMF, as well as consultative input from BIO. All of the funders endorsing the Guide have agreed on the joint principles set out in the Guide. This approach helps to ease the compliance burden on awardees by avoiding duplicative and overlapping requirements.\nAn effective SAP should address the following areas:\n- Product specifications – including product indication(s), target population and conditions of use\n- Potential obstacles and constraints to stewardship and access – describing product specific considerations, for example availability and cost of raw materials, and manufacturing and scale-up challenges\n- Ensuring timely receipt of marketing approvals – detailing factors such as the expected sequence of marketing applications, plans for additional clinical trials for specific indications or vulnerable population, and plans to use accelerated registration mechanisms\n- Supporting global stewardship and access across territories – providing strategies to support these efforts in all territories, including those in which the product developer does not plan to market the product, such as pricing and marketing, education, surveillance and data sharing practices, out-licensing and technology transfer, and supply chain and manufacturing\n- Project intellectual property rights – considering how to prevent intellectual property rights from creating barriers to access in all territories, including those in which the product developer does not intend to market the product, such as partnerships or licensing agreements with third parties\n- Monitoring the effectiveness of stewardship & access activities – discussing methods for reporting on the implementation and progress of the activities outlined in the SAP, for example publishing an annual report, including reporting requirements in partner agreements, and establishing relationships with groups such as the Access to Medicines Foundation\nThe SAP Development Guide represents a significant step forward in supporting stewardship and access across the entire pipeline of antibacterial products, as well as providing a model that can be broadly applied to other products.\nThis blog post was written by Rose Garson, CARB-X, with input from GHIAA.

65	Why were Community Forests created in England?	Community Forests were established nearly 30 years ago as a government pilot project to demonstrate how environmental improvement could support economic and social regeneration. They were specifically created to regenerate areas damaged by heavy industry and landscape degradation. Since then, they have become key to environmentally-led regeneration and sustainability in and around towns and cities.	['Regeneration and the Forest of Marston Vale\nOur guest blogger, Jo Roberts, Community Engagement Officer at the Forest of Marston Vale, tells us about a local success story.\nThe Forest of Marston Vale is a regeneration success story, and the idea of revitalising and restoring landscape continues to be a big part of the work we do.\nNearly 30 years ago, the government at the time established a pilot project to demonstrate the benefit of environmental improvement to economic and social regeneration, and deliver lasting change – ‘England’s Community Forests’ were born, and have been transforming the landscapes and communities in and around our towns and cities ever since.\nThe aim of the Community Forests was to regenerate areas that had been hit hard by heavy industry and landscape degradation. In Bedfordshire this meant first the brick making industry, and then the landfill sites (some of the largest in Europe) that followed. Since their creation, Community Forests have become a mainstay of environmentally-led regeneration and sustainability.\nWhen the Forest of Marston Vale was designated, just under 5%, of the 61 square-mile Forest area had tree cover. Our work over the last 2 decades has seen this increase to over 15%, as we’ve created new woodlands throughout the Forest and planted over 2 million trees – our aim is to reach an impressive 30%!\nPlanting trees and creating woodlands continues to be recognised – by experts and the government alike – as the most effective way of regenerating landscapes, and for so many good reasons. Woodlands provide habitats for huge numbers of species: mammals to invertebrates; trees to fungi and everything in between. Hedgerows regenerate wildlife corridors, providing shelter for animals moving between habitats, and are an important landscape feature with a lot of wildlife value. And the value of woodlands to people is hard to overestimate – they give us cleaner air, places to get closer to nature, havens to escape to when we’re stressed, and places to improve our physical health and mental wellbeing.\nTrees are able to provide so many more benefits too. Their regenerative effects on our air quality are incredible – not only do they remove particles of pollution from the air and store them in their tissues, but they also provide cooling shade. As our climate warms, this is something that we will come to appreciate more and more, especially in urban areas where the cooling qualities of trees can help to combat the ‘Urban Heat Island’ effect. Trees and hedgerows also have an important role to play in regenerating our watercourses, again removing pollution and preventing erosion of soils into streams and rivers by binding soils with their roots.\nSome of the woodlands we create stand surrounded by arable fields, but where possible we look to regenerate and safeguard our local semi-natural ancient woodlands too. Our ancient woodlands are under threat from fragmentation, climate change, and pests and diseases – in a recent study by the Woodland Trust, only 7% of our native woodlands were found to be in a ‘good’ condition. Creating new woodlands adjacent to these ancient ones should make them more resilient to the challenges they face, increasing the area in which species can move. At the Forest of Marston Vale we plant a combination of native species including oak, hornbeam, wild cherry and alder – all grown and sourced within the UK, and chosen for their ability to tolerate and address climate change and increasing temperatures, safeguarding our Community Woodlands and this habitat for the future.\nAnd finally trees and woodlands can have a regenerative effect on how we feel about where we live and work. Green and leafy areas are seen as places to be proud of. New jobs have been created in the woodland industry, managing woodlands and using the raw materials we get from them. In short, the power of trees and woodlands to give new life to damaged and scarred landscapes is second to none.']	['<urn:uuid:598e867b-64a6-44cd-ba4b-ee99b5760f8e>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	7	55	659

Cat6a cables support 10 Gbps speeds over longer distances, with a maximum length of up to 100 meters or 328 feet. However, for most standard network installations, Cat6 cables are often sufficient and provide reliable performance within their maximum length limitations.\nWhen planning your network infrastructure, it is crucial to consider the specific requirements of your network, the desired data transfer speeds, and the limitations set by the Ethernet standards. By doing so, you can ensure optimal network performance and reliability with the appropriate length of Cat6 Ethernet cables.\nMaximum length for Cat6a Ethernet Cable\nCat6a (Category 6a) Ethernet cables are an advanced version of Cat6 cables, providing even higher performance and faster data transfer speeds. Cat6a cables are designed to support 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10 Gbps) speeds over longer distances, making them suitable for high-speed network applications. The maximum length for Cat6a Ethernet cables is typically 100 meters or 328 feet.\nThe increased maximum length of Cat6a cables compared to Cat6 cables is possible due to their enhanced internal construction and improved specifications. With better insulation and shielding, Cat6a cables offer improved resistance to external interference and signal loss, allowing for longer cable runs while maintaining reliable data transmission.\nWith their 10 Gbps capability and longer maximum length, Cat6a cables are often chosen for professional network installations that require high data transfer rates, such as data centers, server rooms, and larger corporate networks.\nIt is important to note that the maximum length for Cat6a cables includes the length of the cable from the device to the network switch or router. Exceeding this maximum length can result in degraded signal quality, increased error rates, and reduced network performance.\nWhile Cat6a cables provide superior performance, it is essential to consider the specific requirements of your network and the networking standards you are working with. In some cases, Cat6 cables or even Cat5e cables might be sufficient and more cost-effective, depending on the desired data transfer speeds and the length of cable runs needed for your network infrastructure.\nWhen deploying Cat6a Ethernet cables, it is beneficial to ensure the cables are of high quality, properly installed, and meet the necessary industry standards. This will help ensure optimal performance, minimize signal degradation, and achieve the desired data transfer rates over the maximum allowable length.\nBy carefully considering the specific needs of your network and the limitations set by the Ethernet standards, you can confidently choose the appropriate length of Cat6a Ethernet cables to meet the demands of your high-speed network infrastructure.\nFactors to consider when choosing the length of an Ethernet Cable\nWhen selecting the length of an Ethernet cable for your network infrastructure, it is crucial to take several factors into consideration.

Professional installation vary on hardware based on needs, such as space, number of devices, storage, budget, and other constraints.\nWorkstations – A workstation is a place where configuration devices are held, servers, hard drives, and other equipment. Primus Cable carries an excellent line of LAN workstation solutions by Kendall Howard.\nServer Racks – standardized frames or enclosures designed for mounting and organizing networking equipment that is rack-mountable. The height of a server rack shelf is standardized in multiples of 1.75 inches, which is designated as one rack unit (1U). Examples include patch panels, servers, Ethernet switches, and other devices.\nSwitches – An Ethernet switch is a central device that connects your server, Ethernet connection, PCs, and other devices. It typically uses female RJ45 ports that you will plug in your patch cables and bulk cable. Those then connect and route to each of your devices.\nPatch Panels – A patch panel is a bay of circuits that are used to manually connect incoming and outgoing signals in your network. While not always necessary, they help organize and configure your network. By color coding and labeling patch cords and patch panels, you networking installation will be easier to manage, arrange, and re-arrange the connections between devices and the Ethernet switch, server, and other necessary network connections.\nMedia Converters – As technology is speeding up our connectivity, fiber optics are leading the way. Unfortunately, our personal computers are not fully compatible. In this case, we use a media converter to connect fiber optic cables with copper cables such as cat5E and cat6.\nKeystone Jacks – A keystone jack is a standard snap-in module for low-voltage wiring. Keystone jacks snap into wallplates, surface-mount boxes, and blank patch panels.\nWall Plates – Wallplates protect electrical outlets and accommodate a variety of cabling solutions including keystone jacks. They protect your network connections from dust, physical damage, and foreign objects. No wall plate is secure without a proper fitting drywall bracket.\nAs you transition to rolling out your network installation, you will install, run and test your network cables.\nCat5E Ethernet Cable – Cat5e is short for “Category 5 Enhanced.” It consists of 8 copper wires twisted to make 4 pairs. The twists maintain a clear signal to prevent interference and eliminate crosstalk. While Cat5e Ethernet cable is generally said to support frequencies of 100 Mhz, there are many cables that do support higher speeds, and our Cat5e network cable is tested up to 350 Mhz.\nCat6 Ethernet Cable –Cat6 Ethernet cable is a step up for your network. With Cat6 cable, you’ll enjoy the benefits of more rigorous specifications for interference, crosstalk, and signal loss at Gigabit Ethernet speeds. Normally, a Cat6 cable is limited to 200-250 MHz, but a high-quality cable can run well beyond that. Our Cat6 Ethernet cable tests around 550-600 MHz.\nCat6A Ethernet Cable – Category 6a cable is designed to outperform standard Cat6 cable – at twice the speed. Our Category 6 Augmented cable features solid bare copper conductors and is rated to 10G. Our Cat6A cables are perfect for 10G-750 MHz high speed data applications, Gigabit Ethernet, fast Ethernet and 155Mbps TP-PMD/CDDI networks.\nCat7 Ethernet Cable – Cat7 CM solid Individually Shielded Pairs (S/FTP) cable is quality manufactured to meet and exceed product certifications and standards – in fact, they surpass ANSI/TIA 568 B.2-1, ISO/IEC 2nd Edition 11801 Class F Specifications. Our Cat7 cable can handle the following network applications: 10GBASE-T Ethernet, 1000BASE-Tx Gigabit Ethernet, 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX Fast Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), 10 VG - AnyLAN (IEEE802.12), 550 MHz Broadband Video, Voice, T1, ISDN and 155/622 Mbps ATM.\nFiber Optic – Fiber optic cable transfers allow data to be transferred over long (and short) distances at very high speeds with low attenuation and without significant signal loss. In high-density network situations, a fiber optic network also saves space; a single strand of fiber can transmit much more data than regular Ethernet cable – at faster speeds, too.\nLAN Testers – While LAN testers will assist you throughout the installation process, in this state you will be checking to make sure that all of your cable runs and drops are making connections. A LAN tester finds all the problems associated with testing such as opens, shorts, and cable integrity.\nManaging your Network\nThe work you do just after setting up your network will save you lots of time and money.\nMap your network for easier network and troubleshooting. On the hardware side, make sure you color code and label patch cables, patch panels, and other networking equipment.']	['<urn:uuid:27a6250e-8c8d-4a2d-9e43-f28b44d8e2dd>', '<urn:uuid:df14e337-e5bf-4111-b1e8-e94e58994c1b>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	8	75	3625
67	In my relationship counseling sessions, I want to help couples manage emotional flooding better - what's the recommended minimum time for a timeout when partners get flooded?	The recommended timeout should be at least 20-30 minutes, as this is how long it takes for the average person's system to reset. During this time, partners should go to separate places where they won't see or hear each other, though they shouldn't drive off. If after the initial 20-30 minutes someone is still flooded, they should take another timeout. If they're still unable to resume the conversation after that, the discussion should be tabled for 24 hours.	['You’ve probably heard the phrase: Fight-or-Flight. This phrase is describing DPA (Diffused Physiological Arousal) or what therapists call “Flooding.”\nWhen someone is flooded, their brain shuts down the rational prefrontal cortex, the logical thinking part of the brain that allows you to utilize higher thought process. This part of the brain allows us to take in other points-of-views, consider additional information, and stay focused on the issue without getting sidetracked.\nWhen this function temporarily goes offline, a person is unable to engage in a productive conversation. You lose the ability to access humor, empathy, creative problem-solving, and are unable to think clearly. You become deaf to anything your partner is saying and it gets filtered through as criticism.\nA narrative of blame takes shape in your mind. You might start accusing your partner of past infractions and you might start laying out your score card (who does what in the relationship).\nThe diverted blood that fuels rational thinking goes to your muscles so you can fight or flee.\nSomeone who is flooded may experience:\n- Tightness in their muscles\n- May feel jittery\n- Experience cramps in their stomach\n- Jaw may clench\n- Experience dry mouth\n- Flushed skin\n- Start to sweat\n- Feel shaky\n- Have rapid breathing and shallow breaths\n- Heart rate over 100 bpm\n- Blood pressure will increase\n- Experience tunnel vision\n- May repeat themselves\nThese experiences are indicators that your nervous system is reacting to a perceived threat and is getting you ready to fight or flee by sending out cortisol and adrenaline.\nAs such, our natural inclination to keep on talking when we have reached this state almost always makes the situation worse because our bodies are primed and ready to fight and that manifests in words, usually the angry, hurtful kind.\nWhen we are in this emotional state we may say things or do things that convey a message we do not intend, and that might hurt our partner and trigger them.\nWhen we opt to flee we may leave the room or stop talking. Someone in this state may appear calm, but on the inside they feel chaotic. The retreat is an attempt to self-soothe and to escape the interaction. They are simply trying to diffuse what is happening inside them before it escalates.\nWithdrawal isn’t a way to punish or abandon, it’s a way to calm down. To a partner, it may look like shutting down or not caring, which often elicits a stronger reaction from the partner such as: to get louder, call names, accuse, and follow your partner around as they try to flee.\nIn order to manage flooding, couples need to do the following:\n1. Know Your Triggers\nPay attention to your physical reactions. Trace them to what was said or what body language you reacted to. By being able to identify what sets us off, we are better prepared to make difference choices in the moment when they present themselves. If we know what triggers us, we can share it with our partner so they don’t unintentionally trigger us. Once you know your triggers, you will find that you’ll have more control over how you manage your reaction.\n2. Know Your Partners Triggers\nYou need to know their triggers so you don’t unintentionally trigger them.\n3. Know Your Bodily Symptoms\nBecome an expert on what happens to you when you become flooded. What thoughts run through your head and what do you feel in your body? If you notice tension in your body, work on relaxing those areas. Reflect on arguments of the past and see if you can recall what you felt in your body during those moments.\nThe trick is to be able to ID when you are getting close to flooding so you can call a time out. And get your partners feedback about their experience of you when things are a bit tense; sometimes partners can clue us in on things we miss.\n4. Master Self-Soothing\nTake deep breathes to help slow down your heart rate which will help get blood pumping back to your prefrontal cortex and bring those higher thought processes back online. Inhale for a count of four and exhale for another count of four. Inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. When you inhale make sure your shoulders are not moving up and down, but instead focus on your stomach extending out when you inhale.\nConsider your five senses to help you self-soothe. Go for a walk, exercise, swim, or do yoga. Soak in a bubble bath, take a hot shower, walk barefoot on a soft rug, or wrap up in a soft blanket. Listen to some music, read a book, light some aroma therapy candles while you watch an episode of your favorite show. All of these serve to distract you and assist your body in returning to a relaxed state.\nStore a mental picture of your partner. This should be a memory of a time when they were at their best and you felt loved and respected by them. A moment when they were generous. Make the memory strong by adding positive details. When you start to get flooded retrieve this memory and focus on it. This helps you move from being reactive to being more relaxed.\n5. Agree To A Time Out\nWhen things are neutral, set a time for your time out. It should be at least 20-30 minutes because that’s how long it takes the average person’s system to reset.\nWhen either one of you start to feel like you’re going to become flooded, take the agreed upon time out. You can even call a time out if you notice your partner is becoming flooded.\nHonor the time out.\nWhen we become activated, we want to avoid saying something we will later regret. We want to be able to connect and engage with our partner. So take the time out and use that time to self-sooth.\nPartners need to go to separate places where they won’t hear or see each other. Don’t get in the car and drive off. While in time out DO NOT keep the argument going in your head, this will only keep you flooded. When the 20-30 minutes have passed, return to talk. If you, or your partner, is still flooded then take another time out. If at the end of that time out one of you is still unable to resume the conversation, then agree to table the discussion for 24 hours.\nIf you delay resuming the conversation more than 24 hours, your partner may feel abandoned or feel like the delay is an attempt to punish them. So resume the discussion as soon as everyone has returned to a relaxed state.\nMake a commitment to self-soothe, give your bodies time to reset, and then check back in with each other. The relationship will benefit when each person is mindful of what triggers the other and takes intentional steps to avoid those triggers so that emotional conversations can be had without it turning into an unnecessary fight.']	['<urn:uuid:89420b8e-55a8-4809-9352-0b38d86a6d4b>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	27	78	1184
68	environmental stress effects compare needle loss in spruce vs pine drought impact	Both spruce and pine trees show specific responses to environmental stress, particularly drought. In spruce trees, drought stress is one of several 'abiotic' stresses that can cause needles to turn brown without any apparent infectious disease or insect damage. For pines, drought can cause needles to shed prematurely, disrupting their normal needle retention pattern. While pines normally shed needles seasonally (particularly noticeable in white pines), environmental conditions like drought can accelerate this process and cause needles to drop before their typical lifespan is complete.	"[""A needle fungus is one problem that can cause spruce trees to become unsightly.\nBy Christine Engelbrecht\nIowa State University\nSpruces are a favorite evergreen for yards and windbreaks in Iowa. However, they are susceptible to a few problems that can leave them unsightly. Knowing about these common spruce ailments is the first step toward minimizing problems with these beautiful trees.\nRhizosphaera needle cast\nPerhaps the most common disease of spruces in this area is Rhizosphaera needle cast, caused by the fungus Rhizosphaera. This disease is most apparent on older needles on the tree, causing them to turn purplish-brown before falling off. Trees are usually affected first on the inside of the tree, working out, and at the bottom of the tree, working up. Affected trees become sparse over time and can eventually die from this disease.\nYou can scout for Rhizosphaera needle cast by using a hand lens to observe both green and brown needles. Tiny, black dots (fungal growths) are visible in lines along the length of some infected needles.\nDamage by Rhizosphaera needle cast can be minimized by inspecting plants before purchase, spacing the trees properly when planting, weeding and pruning to promote airflow in the canopy, and avoiding shearing when plants are wet. When trees are found to be infected, fungicide sprays can be used to reduce spread. Several common fungicides can be used, including Bordeaux mixture, other copper compounds, or chlorothalonil. Timing of the sprays is especially important; spray once in the last two weeks of May and again four to six weeks later. Sprays must be applied yearly until symptoms no longer appear.\nAnother common problem, mite damage, causes spruce needles to turn a dusky yellowish or gray. Mites are tiny spider-like creatures that suck the sap from spruce needles, so that when viewed under magnification the needles appear speckled with yellow flecks. Affected needles may fall from the branch, leaving a sparse tree.\nSeveral types of sprays may be used to minimize damage from mites, but they must be applied when the mites are actually present. You can scout for mites by shaking a symptomatic branch over a white sheet of paper and then looking for tiny, moving dots (mites). When mites are found, sprays you can use include horticultural oil, insecticidal soap, or malathion. Spraying tree branches with a forceful stream of water can also help to dislodge mites, and using chemical sprays may not be necessary.\nSometimes individual branches of spruces turn brown and die. Scattered, dead branches are the hallmark of Cytospora canker, another fungal disease. A canker is an area of dead bark, and when that dead area grows all the way around the branch, it girdles and kills it. When a canker grows all the way around the trunk of a tree, it can kill the whole tree. On spruces, Cytospora canker is most visible as areas on the bark leaking abundant white, sticky resin on dead branches.\nBranches with resin-leaking cankers should be pruned out to reduce the amount of fungus in the tree. Canker diseases occur on trees that are undergoing other stresses, especially drought, so keeping trees in good vigor (such as by watering during dry periods) can help to prevent Cytospora canker.\nSometimes needles on spruce trees turn brown and no infectious disease or insect damage is apparent. A variety of “abiotic” (noninfectious) stresses can cause damage to spruce trees. Such stresses include drought stress, injuries to the trunk, winter injury, damage from misapplied chemicals, or root problems. A thorough review of the tree’s location and recent history can help to diagnose these problems.\nWith a little awareness of the common problems on spruce, homeowners can enjoy the abundant beauty that spruce trees bring.\nJean McGuire, Continuing Education and Communication Services, (515) 294-7033, email@example.com\nTwo high-resolution photos are available for use with this week's column:\nRhizoNeedleCast.jpg Caption: Spruce tree affected by Rhizosphaera needle cast.\nSpruceCanker.jpg Caption: Scattered dead branches in a spruce caused by Cytospora canker."", 'Every once in a while in this line of work we’re actually able to give a homeowner some good news about their trees. A case in point is a call that we frequently get this time of year that starts like this: “My pine tree looks like it’s dying! It’s dropping all of its needles!” If the caller has access to the internet and a digital camera I usually request that the send me a couple of photos; if not, I ask them whether the tree is shedding needles along the outermost part of the limbs or on the interior.\nIn the vast majority of cases the tree is an eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) and the homeowner is observing is normal needle shed. White pine needles often persist for only two growing seasons. So in the fall they begin to shed their previous-years needles, which often turn an eye-grabbing bright yellow in the process. Actually all pines and evergreen conifers shed their needles; it’s just more noticeable in white pines because they are common in the landscape and their needles are short-lived.\nThe lifespan of pine needles varies widely among species. In some species, such as white pine and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), needles may only persist for two growing seasons. On the other end of the spectrum is bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva), which can retain needles for up to 40 years. For the most part, needle retention is correlated with shoot growth rate; trees with fast growth rates have fast needle turnover, while slower growing trees have long needle longevity. Of course there are lots of exceptions to this trend and environmental conditions can impact needle life-span as well. For example, needles may shed prematurely during a drought.\nBottom-line: If it’s fall and your pine is starting to drop interior needles, chances are it’s normal needlefall and nothing to worry about.\nEwers, F.W. and R. Schmid. 1981. Longevity of Needle Fascicles of Pinus longaeva (Bristlecone Pine) and Other North American Pines. Oecologia 51:107-115\nHennessey,T.C. , P.M. Dougherty, B.M. Cregg, and R.F.

The interaction between leaf longevity and shoot growth and foliar biomass per shoot in Pinus contorta at two elevations Tree Physiology 7:209-214.\n19 thoughts on “What’s wrong with my pine tree…? Nothing!”\nOn the west coast we often have the same questions about western redcedar (Thuja plicata).\nI’m glad to see this. I moved to Seattle this summer and am seeing needles changing color on the western red cedar mentioned by Ryan in the comment above. I’ll probably still ask someone about it, since where they’re changing is an area that was previously ‘buried’ in an English Laurel that I cut back and it’s not happening anywhere else. But it’s interesting to learn that all of them do this.\nMy sister was strongly advised by her last employer never to use Facebook. She needs this information. How can your blogs be emailed?\nThis isn’t a Facebook site. She (or you) can subscribe to it using the “Subscribe” feature in the upper right hand corner of the blog.\nWhite Pine is also a brittle wood, and shedding 1/3 or so of its needles decreases surface area..thus it’s able to ‘shed’ snow and not carry as much of a load. It’s one of natures ways of protecting the branches from snapping.\nEastern white pine are not particularly adapted to shed snow and ice. In fact, they are often one of the most heavily damaged trees during winter storms http://blogs.extension.org/gardenprofessors/2013/12/30/the-ice-pocalypse-of-2013-winners-and-losers/\nVariation in needle turnover in pines is thought to be associated with growth rate and nutrient conservation. i.e., needle turnover is slower for species adapted to nutrient-limited sites and that have relatively slow growth rates.\nDo new needles ever grow where the old ones fell off? Or does the tree have increasingly long empty branches in the interior? (There aren’t any pines near me to observe.)\nMost conifers, including pines, will not form needles on old wood. Yews are one of the few exceptions to this trend.\nActually one exception to this is Canary Island Pine which can sprout needles and even new branches from very old wood on old bark, even down to the base of the trunk. Like Big Cone Douglas fir, they will also sprout from the trunk and branches if ravaged by fire\nInteresting info Kevin. Some other pines will re-sprout when young but lose the ability when mature.\nI rake up all the white pine needles I can on the lawn and re-distribute them under the pines and throughout the shade garden. I think they look beautiful. Can someone comment on the pros/cons of using pine needles as mulch? Are they too soil-acidifying for many herbaceous plants over time?\nIt’s hard to argue with free mulch! I used to do the same when I lived in South Carolina and our house was in a development that had a lot of slash pine trees. I agree it makes a nice looking mulch. Pine straw mulch can reduce soil pH, however. In one vegetable (okra) production study, pine straw reduced pH by about 0.5 pH units. Whether this is good or bad depends on what you’re growing and your starting soil pH. I would probably give your bedding plants the final say. Pine straw is a predominant landscape mulch (if not THE predominant landscape mulch in the South) and many plants seem to thrive in it.\nOkay. This saved me a trip to Extension to look this up. Will share on my local blogs.\nEvery year I try and take photos of fall needle drop so I’ll have them to explain when someone asks about why the needles are yellow in the fall (example: https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=fallneedledrop&sort=relevance&user_id=38395710%40N07) Is there a Garden Professors Flickr group? It might be interesting to join and exchange photos of fall needle drop on different pines (among other things).\nHi Karen we don’t but it’s an excellent idea!\nIs the same true for spruce trees? We have Black Hills , and Colorado Spruce. We live in Minnesota.Needl es are browning from the interior.\nSpruce drop their needles eventually but needles usually persist 5 or 6 years so their normal needle loss is not as dramatic as in white pine. If you are experiencing extensive needle drop on a spruce, it could be a needlecast disease. There are a couple of keys to diagnosing needlecast in spruce. 1) Current-year (outermost) needles are unaffected. 2) Older (interior) needles have black dots that appear under a hand lens (see link below). These dots are actually the fruiting body of the needlecast fungi. Treatment is possible for needlecasts but proper timing is essential and will require professional spray equipment to get good coverage on large trees.\nIt’s been a cold winter. My evergreens are dropping needles/ branches. It looks different than normal needle drop because the needles are green and the branches are about 6+ inches long. Is anyone else experiencing this? Could they have a disease?\nWill need a little more info to sort out your issue. Do you know what type of evergreen? Pine? Spruce? Something else? Where are the trees?\nThe type of needle-shed described in this article happens to pine in the fall. If you’re seeing needle loss now if could be some type of winter injury. We talked about winter burn on conifers last winter http://blogs.extension.org/gardenprofessors/2014/04/14/feel-the-burn/ If you are east of the Rockies I expect we will see similar damage from this winter’s severe weather as well.\nIf you have access to a digital camera, you are welcome to send photos to my e-mail: email@example.com. If you send photos try to send a close up of the damage and also a longer shot of the tree(s) and the site.']"	['<urn:uuid:17a5643d-6d03-411e-8c4a-57d6d4bffeb5>', '<urn:uuid:4f228f91-4fb3-49f6-94b0-4ba37fa1f0e8>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	12	84	1973
69	which creature bigger octopus cuttlefish australia	The giant Australian cuttlefish is bigger than the gloomy octopus. While the gloomy octopus (Octopus tetricus) has a size of about 80 centimeters across with a tentacle span of up to 2 meters (6 feet), the giant Australian cuttlefish (Sepia apama) is larger, reaching a total length of up to 1 meter and weighing over 10.5 kg, making it the world's largest cuttlefish.	"['The gloomy octopus latin name Octopus tetricus is setting up home in the now warmer seas around Tasmania. Climate change is causing its native waters off the coast of NSW and Victoria have made it too hot for the creature.

Australia\'s \'Gloomy Octopus\' Finds Warmth, Food, Happiness in Tasmania. Kimberly Hickok. Warming ocean temperatures are encouraging Australia\'s notably reclusive gloomy octopus to branch out. seas native nsw hot creature. Australia\'s \'Gloomy Octopus\' Finds Warmth, Food, Happiness in Tasmania. Alamy. This creature\'s range was limited to the rocky tidal shores of eastern Australia; that was true until about 2000,has expanded its territory from the shores of New South Wales on the east coast of Australia down to the now-warmer waters off the northeast of an island state about 150 miles (240 kilometers) south of the mainland. Researchers mapped the gloomy\'s range expansion and reported their results in a study published June 22 in the journal Scientific Reports. The gloomy octopus,The heat-loving cephalopod,named for its droopy-looking white eyes,or 31.5 inches across) and has a tentacle span of up to 2 meters (6 feet),also known as the common Sydney octopus (Octopus tetricus),is a little bigger than a beach ball (80 centimeters,when the octopuses were first found off the southern coast of the Australian state of Victoria,according to the Australian Museum. Historically, Oceana reported.\nAnd thanks to persistent gene flow from the animals\' historical population — meaning genes from one population are carried to another — and moderate genetic diversity, the species is likely to adapt nicely to its extended habitat and may continue to expand its range, the scientists predicted. [Octlantis: See Photos of Tight-Knit Gloomy Octopus Communities]. ""People send in photo observations,"" Pecl told Oceana. ""We get an early indication of what species might be shifting, and then we initiate a more targeted research study."" The data from the citizen science project led to the new study from Pecl and her colleagues, which confirms the gloomy octopus\' southward range expansion. Scientists discovered the breadth of the gloomy\'s range expansion thanks to recreational fishermen and divers reporting their cephalopod sightings to Redmap. This citizen science project was created by study co-author Gretta Pecl, a marine ecologist at the University of Tasmania.\nAn octopus fishery aimed at gloomies might be a win-win solution for fishers and shellfish populations. Another predator is the last thing the struggling shellfish population needs after combatting fatal marine heat waves caused by increasingly warm currents. That\'s because these eight-tentacled outsiders love to chow down on shellfish such as abalone and rock lobster, which make up the most profitable fisheries in the region, Oceana reported. But while the gloomy octopus seems well-adapted to its new home, its territory expansion has fisheries experts worried. The gloomy\'s expansion is also part of a larger, growing trend of shifts in wildlife territory caused by climate change. The gloomy octopus is just the latest example of dozens of species carried south by the East Australian Current in recent years, Oceana reported.\nBut the larger size of the gloomies makes them a more attractive catch, he said. Craig Hardy, a Tasmanian fisherman, told Oceana that fishermen in the area have historically caught smaller octopus species.\n| ★ images ★', 'Giant Australian cuttlefish (Sepia apama)\n|Also known as:||Australian giant cuttlefish, giant cuttlefish|\n|French:||Seiche géante Australienne|\n|Spanish:||Sepia gigante Australiana|\n|Size||Mantle length: up to 52 cm (2)|\nTotal length: up to 1 m (3)\nMaximum weight: over 10.5 kg (4)\nThe giant Australian cuttlefish is classified as Near Threatened (NT) on the IUCN Red List (1).\nThe giant Australian cuttlefish (Sepia apama) is the world’s largest cuttlefish, and, like many other cephalopods, it is able to camouflage itself exceptionally well. By changing its skin colour and texture, the giant Australian cuttlefish can convincingly disguise itself against its surrounding environment almost instantaneously (4). Cephalopods, which literally means ‘head-footed’, are a class of marine molluscs which, along with cuttlefish, includes squid, octopuses and nautiluses. Unlike other molluscs, cephalopods have a closed circulatory system, where blood is contained in vessels, and a highly developed nervous system with a large brain (4) (5).\nThe giant Australian cuttlefish has eight arms and two extended tentacles, which are used for mating and catching prey, as well as to transform and camouflage the shape of the body (6). The giant Australian cuttlefish is reddish brown, with white bars and spots on the arms and the mantle, and pale fins (4).\nAll cephalopods, and in particular cuttlefish species, have large, highly-developed eyes, and can detect very low light levels, vital in detecting prey and avoiding predation at night (4) (5). Cephalopods are widely considered to be the most intelligent group of invertebrates,with one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of any invertebrate (7) (8).\nThe giant Australian cuttlefish is found exclusively around the southern coast of Australia and Tanzania, leading to its alternative common name of the ‘giant Australian cuttlefish’ (3).\nFound in coastal waters up to 100 metres deep, the giant Australian cuttlefish generally lives on rocky reefs or among kelp forests, but it can also be found in seagrass meadows (3) (4).\nThe giant Australian cuttlefish spends a lot of time resting, allowing it to channel more energy into growth, which has been dubbed the ‘live-fast-die-young cephalopod philosophy’ (9). Like all cephalopods, the giant Australian cuttlefish is an active predator, using its excellent camouflage to stalk fishes, crabs and other crustaceans (3) (4).\nThousands of individual giant Australian cuttlefish aggregate every winter to spawn, peaking in May to June, with the number of males outnumbering the females by up to 11:1 (2) (4). During courtship, the male will perform spectacular displays to attract a female, in which bands of colour pass rapidly along the body (4). Males tend to establish territories around the best egg laying sites (3). As larger, aggressive males will often guard females entering their territory, small males, known as ‘sneaker males’, may adopt female colourings to avoid the larger males and achieve a mating (4).\nThe eggs of the giant Australian cuttlefish are lemon-shaped. Laid in crevices, the eggs hatch after 3 to 5 months (4).\nThe mantle cavity, a feature common to all molluscs, has adapted to help the giant Australian cuttlefish avoid predation. Water can be rapidly sucked in and ejected from the mantle, and is directed using a moveable ‘funnel’ to create a form of ‘jet propulsion’ which enables the giant Australian cuttlefish to swiftly escape from predators (10). Like many species of squid and octopus, the giant Australian cuttlefish is also able to protect itself by squirting ink, which obstructs the predators view or acts as a diversion. There is also evidence that the ink may block the scent of the cuttlefish, thereby providing protection from predators which hunt by smell (6).\nMost species of cuttlefish are able to quickly change the colour and texture of the skin, allowing them to adopt similar shapes, colours and textures to the surrounding environment, such as rocks on the sea-bed. This is also the same technique employed when achieving sneaky matings or luring in prey (11).\nThe giant Australian cuttlefish is collected as bycatch in trawl fisheries, although relatively low numbers are caught (3). This species is also caught for human consumption and as bait for snapper fishes. Few details on the quantities and origins of catches of the giant Australian cuttlefish are available, and so it is difficult to quantify the effects of this on population numbers (4).\nThe giant Australian cuttlefish reproduces once in its short lifespan. This means that a decline in one generation will have profound effects on population numbers, as seen in the mid-1990s when mating aggregations of the giant Australian cuttlefish were actively targeted by fisheries (12).\nAfter population numbers began to decline in the 1990s, a ban on fishing was introduced resulting in the recovery and subsequent rise of giant Australian cuttlefish populations (12).\nProposals have been made to protect the Whyalla breeding aggregation site in South Australia as a marine sanctuary (3). Being such an interesting and charismatic animal, there is a degree of public support for the conservation of the giant Australian cuttlefish.\nFind out more about the giant Australian cuttlefish and its conservation:\nThe Australian Government Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts Species Profile and Threats Database - Giant cuttlefish:\nBBC Wildlife Finder - Giant cuttlefish:\nThis information is awaiting authentication by a species expert, and will be updated as soon as possible.

70	How can standard form contracts reduce business costs?	Standard form contracts from professional and trade associations serve as important references and benchmarks, reflecting industry best practices. They can greatly reduce drafting and review time, which results in lower overall transaction costs for the company.	['Construction contracts can contain terms that impact your company’s bottom line. Review all contracts carefully before signing to save your company time and money. The following guide highlights some common contract terms and their potential impact. Understanding these will help protect your company’s assets. Always seek the help of licensed counsel to analyze the commercial risks associated with your construction contracts.\nScope of the Agreement – Examine the definition of services to be provided to ensure the language is clear enough for an unrelated third party to understand the scope. The contract should include a time frame for completion of services. The rights and obligations of both parties should be clearly outlined. Any mechanism for changing the scope of the contract, as well as any of the terms, if allowed, should also be outlined within the contract.\nTerms of Payment – Terms of payment should be clearly listed within the contract so that the expectations of both parties are clear. The contract should specify the agreed payment schedule for goods received.\nWarranties – There are two types of warranties: express and implied. Both types are assurances regarding particular issues, such as performance. Express warranties are those that are defined specifically in the contract. Implied warranties are based in statutory and/or common law, depending upon your jurisdiction. They are two-fold: a warranty of merchantability, which requires that goods/services must reasonably conform to an ordinary buyer’s standards, and a warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, which states that if a seller knows the intended purpose for the product or service, the act of selling the product to that customer implies that it is fit for that purpose. Be aware of warranty disclaimers and understand how the disclaimer limits your statutory rights. If it disclaims all warranties, express and implied, then you will likely be limited to the remedies in the contract for issues related to things like performance. You should also examine any disclaimer in the context of the contract. While it may require you to disclaim your statutory rights, other contract language may give you adequate rights and remedies regarding the points about which you are most concerned.\nDamages, Limits of Liability and Indemnification – These three items are often in close proximity to one another in a contract, as they are interrelated. Damages may be defined as certain types of losses that could create liability under the contract. A limit on liability would restrict the amount of damages that a party would be required to pay if found liable for such damages. Sometimes this may also include a limit for indemnification. Indemnification provisions allocate risk and cost between the parties. It is important to examine whether the party assuming the risk is the party with the most control over that risk. For instance, when a company’s employees are required to work at a customer’s location, the company is often asked to release the customer from all liability relating to the employees’ presence at the customer’s location. In some cases, indemnification is limited to negligence or to a specific dollar amount, under a heading of “limits of liability.”\nInsurance – Some contracts will contain minimum bodily injury and property damage liability coverage amounts that the party must possess and also may require that the customer is added as an additional insured on those coverages. Prior to consenting to any contract, it is prudent to examine insurance coverage against the amount of liability exposure in a particular contract.\nTerms and Conditions – It is also vital to examine any terms and conditions contained in the contract:\n- Governing Law & Jurisdiction – Look at the governing law provision to make sure that you are comfortable with the implications of the state law chosen by the drafter. This can impact the interpretation of the contract from warranties to indemnification. Additionally, when specific statutes or regulations are referenced in the body of a contract, it is as though that statute or regulation is wholly contained within the contract itself. It is vital to read and understand that language prior to giving your consent. This happens regularly in government contracting situations.\n- Dispute Resolution – This is another clause with which you must be comfortable with the laws of the state or forum chosen by the drafter. The rules chosen to govern dispute resolution can impact the outcome. Additionally, you should consider whether dispute resolution is right for your situation.\n- Intellectual Property – When you are disclosing and/or licensing your company’s intellectual property, be it trademarks, copyrights or patents, it is important to include a clause that recognizes the owner of such intellectual property and affirmatively states that the agreement does not transfer any rights.\n- Standard of Care – A standard of care clause may appear in certain types of contracts. The standard of care that is provided by the law should provide the minimum standard of care for the provision of services under the contract.\n- Term/Termination – The contract should provide both parties with the right to terminate the contract. The situations in which termination is allowed will vary from contract to contract. Some contracts will allow the right to terminate in cases of dissatisfaction; others will allow it with a specific notice, for no cause. It is important that you contemplate in what cases you would want the right to terminate the contract. There should also be language defining the term of the contract. Does it have a finite term? Does it automatically renew each period?\n- Right to Cure – Related to termination, some contracts will contain a right to cure clause. This would give the defaulting party notice of a breach and a finite period of time in which to remedy such a breach.\nStandard Form Contracts – Unlike other industries, construction lacks a consistent set of laws like the Uniform Commercial Code or a federal statutory scheme. Contracts produced by professional and trade associations for architects (American Institute of Architects), engineers (Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee) and commercial contractors (Associated General Contractors of America) can serve as important references and benchmarks when drafting a new contract. They are a good source of industry best practices, and using them can greatly reduce drafting and review time, meaning lower overall transaction costs for your company. For all of their advantages, there are several things that you should be cautious about when using standard form contracts. Note the following cautions about standard forms before using them:\n- Standard forms, which are written broadly to encompass many different contexts, require transaction-specific and jurisdiction-specific modifications. For example, certain states require that indemnities be written in a certain way.\n- Changes made to one part of the document, such as definitions of words or terms, may affect other parts that make reference to it.\n- Custom-drafted and industry-drafted forms are often incompatible. Even industry-drafted forms from different publishers can be incompatible.\n- Standard forms always contain the bias of the drafter. Use this bias; know when to use various standard forms published by different industry organizations.\nReviewing general terms and features of construction contracts will help you grasp the consequences of their terms and conditions for your business. In any case, to ensure its completeness and accuracy, it is necessary to submit each contract you must sign to legal review.']	['<urn:uuid:3314e167-4de0-4f4b-a9e1-7e1c57b8d557>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	8	36	1218
71	What happened to Maui's original dryland forests?	The original dryland cloud forests on the leeward side of Maui were destroyed during the 1800s due to logging, grazing and fire. Archaeological evidence shows that native Hawaiians previously inhabited this area, suggesting there were water sources at higher altitudes during that time, likely from fog drip in forested areas.	"[""Quantifying the importance of fog drip to ecosystem hydrology and water resources in tropical montane cloud forests on East Maui, Hawaii\nMartha Scholl, U.S. Geological Survey, Water Resources Division, Reston, VA, USA\nStephen Gingerich, U.S. Geological Survey, Water Resources Division, Honolulu, HI, USA\nLloyd Loope, U.S. Geological Survey, Biological Resources Division, Haleakala National Park, HI, USA\nThomas Giambelluca, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Geography Department, Honolulu, HI, USA\nOn the windward side of East Maui, the forests are a crucial watershed, providing water for irrigation, residential and commercial use. Despite the extremely high rainfall in the area, evidence from previous studies (Juvik and Ekern, 1978; Scholl et al., 2002) indicates that fog may be a substantial part of the water budget of these forests, especially at altitudes between 600 and 2000 meters. There have been no studies done to quantify fog input to the water cycle in this area.\nOn the leeward side of Maui, the original dryland cloud forests were destroyed during the 1800s, due to logging, grazing and fire. Archaeological evidence shows that the area was once inhabited by native Hawaiians, so presumably there were water sources at the higher altitudes during that time. It is likely that fog drip from forested areas was the source of the water. Fog is the major source of moisture during much of the year, as rainfall occurs mostly during large winter storms.\nThe objectives of the research are to answer the following questions: How much does fog contribute to cloud forest water budgets? Do plants utilize fog water, rain water, or both? Does fog recharge the deep ground-water system? What factors contribute to fog-interception efficiency of the forest canopy? There is growing interest in reforestation on the leeward side of the island. We hope that gaining an understanding of the role of fog in forest hydrology on the windward side will help in learning what factors are most important in restoration of forests in leeward areas.\nWe measured the amounts of water input from fog at two sites, one each on the windward and leeward sides of Haleakala volcano. Water samples were analyzed for stable isotope composition. Previous work (Ingraham and Matthews, 1995; Scholl et al., 2002) has shown that rain and fog have unique isotopic signatures, so that stable isotopes of water can be used to track the fog water through the hydrologic cycle.\nSites and Instrumentation\nThe leeward site is in the Auwahi land unit (ahupua'a) on the south-facing slope of Haleakala volcano. The area is mostly pasture land, but has one of the few remaining areas of native forest, at 1220 m elevation in the fog belt (click on small photo for larger version).\nThe windward site is in the upper Piinaau Stream drainage basin at 1950 m altitude. The vegetation is mixed height, consisting of ohia and koa stands and shorter ferns and brush (click on small photo for larger version).\nThe location map above shows the two fog research sites. East Maui (Haleakala volcano) rises to an altitude of 3055 m at the summit. The north and east slopes comprise the windward side, as trade winds blow from the north-northeast direction. Orographic rainfall occurs almost daily. The south and west slopes are the leeward side, with a much drier climate; rainfall occurs from storms or fronts, generally in winter months.\nSamples of fog, rain, soil water, tree sap, (and stream water at the windward site) were collected for stable isotopes, and amounts of fog and rain precipitation and throughfall were measured. Other meteorological measurements were made by a weather station at each site. Below is a list of instruments/measurements at each site:\nProgress and Results\nWeather station data and isotope samples were collected from the Waikamoi site beginning in August 2001; the site was fully instrumented by November 2001, and data collection ended August 2003. The Auwahi site weather station and fog collectors were deployed as of November 2001, and the visibility sensor was installed in December 2001.

72	endangered american horse breeds conservation efforts	Two notable endangered American horse breeds are the American Cream and the Florida Cracker Horse. The American Cream is the only native U.S. draft horse breed, characterized by its unique chestnut-champagne coloring, with fewer than 100 individuals remaining worldwide. The Florida Cracker Horse, descended from Spanish colonial horses of the 1500s, had only three small herds and 100 privately owned horses by 1989. While numbers have increased to about 300 registered horses today, it remains extremely endangered. Both cases demonstrate how conservation efforts can help preserve endangered breeds, whether through private initiatives or government intervention, similar to successful conservation stories of other American species like the bald eagle and black-footed ferret.	"['Some horse breeds are flourishing in today’s world. Others are struggling to survive. Although there are several endangered horse breeds, there is also a lot of hope. Many of the most popular horse breeds today were also once endangered, often not that long ago. In just 50 years, many breeds have made an incredible recovery.\nThese are the next endangered breeds that many hope will make a similar recovery in the near future.\n#1. American Cream\nThe American Cream is a draft horse and it is the only draft horse breed that is native to the United States. It’s unique coloring comes from a combination of chestnut and champagne genetics instead of the potentially hazardous all-white coat genetics. Fewer than 100 of these horses are believed to exist in the world today.\nAnother drafting horse is incredibly endangered, with fewer than 1,000 known to exist at the moment. All of them have a chestnut coat, though there can be varying shades of it. It is one of the few remaining horses that was specifically bred for regional farm work needs. The Suffolk region is filled with wetlands and marshes, so this breed was adapted to those conditions. It’s also one of the few draft breeds that has not been adapted to riding or driving.\n#3. Cleveland Bay\nOne of the oldest recognized endangered horse breeds hovers around the 1,000 marks as well in terms of population. This horse breed was often used to transport goods between religious institutions. Today it is a carriage horse, riding horse, and can be competitive in dressage and show jumping. They have a smooth gait, a sensitive personality, and generally have a dark brown or chestnut coat.\nIn the 1960s, this Iranian horse breed almost went extinct. It’s more of a miniature horse than a pony, especially since the average height tends to be between 9-10 hands. Most of the horses in this breed reach their full height around 6 months of age.\n#5. Exmoor Pony\nThis horse breed is the foundational breed for many of the modern pony breeds, but it is also quite endangered. After World War I, there were fewer than 50 horses remaining to this breed. Although the numbers are still quite restricted, there are an estimated 2,000 horses in the world today. There is even a feral herd that roams in Exmoor. When domesticated, they are often used for driving or riding.\nThis draft horse was originally used for farming and agricultural work. When war broke out, their mild-mannered nature and larger size made them an attractive war horse. Their strength allowed them to carry a knight clad in full armor out into battle with relative ease. Although their numbers are estimated to be around the 2,000 mark, they are still used for heavy agricultural work, especially in the forestry industry.\nIn the 17th century, the Canadian breed was one of the most popular in the world. They were exported globally because of their extreme versatility. They were war horses, farm horses, and carriage horses primarily, but could be called upon to do almost anything. This versatility also eventually contributed to their eventual almost-extinction, as only a small pool of purebred horses were left in Canada.\nSince the 1970s, there has been a large push to preserve this strong and sturdy horse.\n#8. Dales Pony\nThis is a hardy breed that is native to England. Often used in the mining industry, their numbers have continued to dwindle since World War II. There are believed to be fewer than 3,000 of them in the world today.\n#9. Przewalski’s Horse\nThis is the only breed of horse that is recognized as being a wild horse. All other horses are considered to be feral, including Brumbies and Mustangs, because of how the herds or mobs were originally formed. Although the current populations are born in the wild, the ancestry of the feral horse is one that includes domestication. This is not the case for Przewalski horses.\nThere are only a few hundred of these horses in the world today and they are all protected. They would be completely extinct if a zoo hadn’t maintained a single stallion and a handful of mares to preserve it. You’ll find this horse in national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and even in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.\n#10. Florida Cracker Horse\nSimilar to the Spanish Colonial Horses, this breed is a direct descendent of the horses that were brought to the United States in the 1500s during the beginning of the Colonial Era. The name comes from the work that the horses were asked to do instead of the food that they like to eat. Cowboys in Florida during the 1930s were referred to as crackers.\nIn 1989, only three small herds existed for this breed, along with 100 horses owned by private families. Although an estimated 300 horses are currently registered and numbers are continuing to rise, this rare breed is still considered to be extremely endangered.\n#11. Marsh Tacky\nNative to South Carolina, this is another horse breed that is directly descended from Spanish colonists in the 1500s. It is a smaller horse, but has adapted well to the lowland swamps of the region. Fewer than 300 of these horses are currently known to exist. To help protect the breed, DNA testing was conducted in 2006-2007, leading to a closed stud book to be created in 2010.\nMost of the horses in this breed stand about 14 hands in height, with up to 15 hands being considered normal. The original breed had Pinto coloration in addition to all other color varieties, but the Pinto pattern was not selected for breeding, so it has been phased out of the breed. It has a gait that is comparable to a fox trotter and is known for being sure-footed with a good stamina.\nThis breed has one of the most unique coats in the entire equine world. It has a sheen that almost appears to be metallic when seen from a distance. This horse tends to be thinner and lankier compared to other breeds as well, creating features that appear to be quite delicate. Originally developed in Turkmenistan to be used for transportation and agricultural work, this breed is hardy and athletic.\n#13. Black Forest\nThis horse breed was almost exclusively developed in the Black Forest region of Germany. The history of this breed dates back for almost 600 years because of the need for agricultural help in the region. After mechanization reduced the need for farms to have working horses, this breed dropped in popularity almost immediately. By the early 1980s, fewer than 200 horses remained. That’s when the German government stepped in to create a preservation program.\nThere are now about 1,000 horses in this breed and its popularity continues to bring it back from the brink of extinction. It is strong, gentle, and an excellent carriage or riding horse.\nAnother one of the oldest horse breeds in the world today is one of its most endangered. They tend to be somewhat feral, tending to prefer living in the wetlands of Southern France. They are gray, but appear to be nearly white, and when a herd gallops through the wetlands, it makes for quite a sight. Watching them has become so popular, in fact, that tourism opportunities to take photographs has started to create a resource base that can help to preserve the breed.\nSome believe the origins of this breed could date back over 17,000 years. It is known that these horses were present before Roman and Celtic occupations. Local land owners help to control herd size and structure.\nOne of the most unusual miniature horses is the Falabella, which is one of the smallest horses in the world. Most stand less than 32 inches tall at the withers. The breed originally developed in Argentina in the mid-1800s before being imported to the United States in 1962. They are highly intelligent as a breed, often used as guide or service and support animals for those with physical or emotional disabilities.\nThey are also one of the longest-lived horse breeds in the world today, with many living longer than 40 years.\nOriginally from Poland, the goal of this horse breed was to reproduce the qualities of the Tarpan breed, which has been extinct since 1910. Bred with Przewalski horses, Icelandic horses, and others that have a similar coat color, these horses are typically used for wetland grazing projects throughout Europe. Their presence is known to restore the balance of a local ecosystem because of their endurance in wetland systems.\nEndangered horse breeds can be saved when the right supports are put into place. Sometimes that comes from private efforts, while sometimes the local government may need to step in to help. With diversity, the equine world is stronger. By promoting awareness of these breeds, that diversity can continue to be encouraged.', '8 Endangered Species Making Epic Comebacks\nIt\'s easy to become disheartened when perusing the endangered species list. However, conservationists are making strides to keep these animals from disappearing forever. Their hard work, and dedication are making enormous progress each and every day.\n1. Bald eagle\nOne of countless victims of the egg shell-thinning effect of DDT, the bald eagle population declined from an estimated 300,000-500,000 to just 412 nesting pairs in the lower 48 states in the 1950\'s. The national bird of the U.S. was helped by the 1940 Bald Eagle Protection Act (which banned trapping and killing them), and then by the eventual ban of all uses of DDT, and the bald eagle was removed from the ""threatened"" list in 2007.\nThe American Bald Eagle Foundation and the state of Alaska have teamed up to create a 48,000 acre preserve to protect the world\'s largest population of Bald Eagles. You can read more about the Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve and make donations\n2. Swift fox\nSwift foxes were decimated by 1930\'s predator control programs that were aimed at wiping out gray wolves and coyotes. Though populations are now stable and no longer listed as endangered in the United States, the species only inhabits 40% of its former range and are still endangered in Canada. Numerous state agencies have pooled their conservation efforts to form the Swift Fox Conservation Team with the aim of restoring their population to its former size.\nThe Endangered Wolf Center works with the Swift Fox Conservation Team as well as other groups collaborating to preserve and increase swift fox populations. You can read more about them and sponsor their efforts by ""adopting"" a swift fox here.\n3. Peregrine falcon\nLike many species, the peregrine falcon was moved to the endangered species list prior to the restriction of DDT, which weakened the calcium content of eggs and thus dramatically decreased the percentage of falcons that survived until they hatched.\nWith pesticides more closely regulated now and captive breeding operations enormously successful, the peregrine falcon was removed from the endangered species list in 1999. Captive bred falcons are fed via a chute or a peregrine hand puppet (so as to prevent them from imprinting on the human trainers). Over time, feeding is reduced and the falcons are forced to learn to hunt before being fully released into the wild.\nAs the world\'s largest member-supported raptor conservation organization, Hawk Mountain in Kempton, Penn., offers international conservation training and plays a large role in scientific research. You can join their organization by purchasing a membership here or volunteering at the preserve.\n4. American alligator\nThreatened by over-hunting and habitat loss, the United States Fishing and Wildlife Service has teamed up with state wildlife agencies to restrict and regulate legal commerce of alligator meat and products. Their efforts have resulted in the American alligator being removed from the endangered species list in 1987, and they are now listed in the ""Least Concern"" category, indicating a profound comeback.\nThe National Parks Conservation Association seeks to protect America\'s national parks, including ones with important American alligator habitats such as Biscayne National Park, Everglades National Park and others.\n5. Black-footed ferret\nThe black-footed ferret was thought extinct, their population ravaged by plague and human contact with their main food source, the prairie dog. Then a Wyoming woman\'s dog showed up with a dead black-footed ferret in its mouth in 1981, leading to the discovery of a few dozen.\nIn 1987, 18 black-footed ferrets were artificially inseminated with the hopes of reviving the species. Reintroduction began in 1991 and as of 2013, a total of 1200 is believed to live in the wild. Despite their monumental comeback, they are still listed as endangered and efforts to protect them are fought by ranchers seeking to control prairie dog populations on their land.\nThe Black-footed Ferret Recovery Implementation Team is tracking the progress of countless state and federal agencies, non-profits, universities, and conservation groups as they strive to bring back black-footed ferret populations. You can follow along with the ferret\'s recovery and learn more about how you can help here.\n6. California condor\nThe California condor was nearly wiped out by effects of the pesticide DDT, lead poisoning from feeding on carrion with bullet fragments inside, power line collisions, and human contact.\nIn 1987, the 22 remaining members of the species were captured and put into captive breeding operations. The newly bred population were trained to avoid humans and power lines, which aided in their survival. As of 2013, there are believed to be 435 California condors (237 in the wild and 198 in captivity). They are still critically endangered and extremely rare, but scientists have gathered evidence that they are breeding in the wild so there remains hope for the species, especially with groups like the Center for Biological Diversity spearheading efforts to protect this rare, slowly rebounding species.\n7. Florida panther\nBy the 1970\'s, the panther population had been reduced to an estimated 20 remaining in the wild. Conservation efforts have boosted the population to 160 as of 2013, but this species still faces countless challenges in its fight for survival.\nHuman encroachment has devastated the Florida panther\'s habitat. Each breeding unit (one male with anywhere from two to five females) needs a wide, 200 square mile expanse to establish their territory. So, our population of 160 panthers needs 32,000 square miles. We have made available an estimated 3,800 square miles for them.\nAdditionally, vehicular collisions, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus, inbreeding, and contact with chemicals that feminize male panthers and decrease their likelihood of reproducing are also contributing to this species\' struggle.\nConservation efforts have centered around maintaining their habitat in the face of a rapidly developing south Florida real estate market. Numerous conservation groups have proposed the Florida Panther Protection Program to establish a large, contiguous habitat for the species.\n8. Przewalski\'s horse\nTheir population of this never-domesticated horse declined as its habitat was lost or degraded due to human interference. The last sighting of Przewalski\'s horse in the wild was in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia in 1969.\nThe Przewalski\'s horse has endured a long road to recovery, rebounding from a captive population of only 15 in the 1970s to more than 400 in the wild today (with another 1,500 in captivity). Reintroduction programs in China, Khazakstan, and Mongolia are proving fruitful so far, but genetic diversity and inbreeding remain a serious concern.\nOverseeing efforts to restore this wild horse to the fields it once roamed is the Conservation Centers for Species Survival. Their successful conservation efforts -- and the never-ending works of others -- prove that it\'s never too late to save a population from the brink of extinction.']"	['<urn:uuid:a1f26b58-1990-4696-b2fc-6fd73b1141fb>', '<urn:uuid:5f764e04-aa23-4d77-9fe8-50bcd3733d02>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	6	111	2600
73	female advancement rights worldwide impact family violence	While feminism has helped advance women's rights globally, even helping topple authoritarian governments like in Liberia, research shows that relationship distress remains one of the strongest risk markers for intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization. Mental health distress is also a significant factor in domestic violence cases.	"['| Part of a series on|\n|Spectra and binaries|\n“”I myself have never been able to find out precisely what feminism is: I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat or a prostitute.\n|—Rebecca West, 1913|\nFeminism refers to any ideology that seeks equality in rights for women, usually through improving their status. Feminism is rooted in ending men\'s historical power over women. Recrudescences in feminist theory particularly focus on issues that disproportionately hurt females, such as ending gender pay gaps, enacting female voting and political rights, and reassessing what is considered ""female"" and ""male"".\nWhile modern feminist thought is largely rooted in the Western intellectual tradition, the ideology is gaining currency throughout the whole world. In many cases, the feminist goal of equality for women has helped push movements around the world to change the entire way private society is viewed, and in some cases even helped topple authoritarian governments. One of the greatest vindications of feminism is the power women in Liberia showed when, with some assistance from the international community, they ended the civil war and subsequently replaced the chaotic, unabashedly corrupt, and genocidal dictatorship with a reasonably functional democracy.\nFeminism can be studied from the perspectives of the actual movements for equality or from the writings of both observer, commentator and participant addressing the underlying issues of why women have not been and are not seen as equal.\n- 1 History\n- 2 Current status\n- 3 Criticism and backlash\n- 4 See also\n- 5 External links\n- 6 References\nPrecursors to feminism\n“”It is not women\'s inferiority that has determined their historical insignificance: it is their historical insignificance that has doomed them to inferiority.\n|—Simone de Beauvoir|\nWomen\'s roles in society have long been debated. Plato\'s Republic suggests that in a true utopia women would be educated and would work beside men equally. Jesus, especially in extra biblical writings, appears to demand that women be allowed to study with him beside the men.\nHowever, most of this discussion was carried out by men. Feminism has the distinction of being a movement ""of, by, and for women,"" though somewhat ironically, the term was coined by French philosopher Charles Fourier.\nIn the United States and Great Britain, feminism began with the demand for legal autonomy, such as the right to be seen as more than a man\'s wife or daughter, the right to hold property, or the right to have one\'s choice of husband. Later, women demanded to be allowed access to political systems, e.g. by being given the vote. Once women saw what that agency brought, they began to demand further measures of equality. Finally, once these measures of equality had been accepted (in theory, at least), some feminists broadened the scope of their challenges to systems on a civilizational scale.\nThe history of feminism is conventionally divided into three waves, each echoing a broader political movement of its era: the first wave reflecting the rise of liberalism, progressivism, and (towards the end) communism; the second, the Civil Rights Movement and the New Left; the third, identity politics in general.\nThe first wave: legal agency (19th–early 20th c.)\n“”Sir, everyone seems to agree upon the necessity of putting a stop to suffragist outrages; but no one seems certain how to do so. There are two, and only two, ways in which this can be done. Both will be effectual. 1. Kill every woman in the United Kingdom. 2. Give women the vote.\n|—Bertha Brewster to the Daily Telegraph, 1913|\nAlso, at the time, voting was largely by household, with only householders able to cast a vote. Hence, although there were comparatively few direct prohibitions on women voting, the restrictions on women owning property kept most of them disenfranchised. Later in the 19th century, when property qualifications for voting were eliminated, women became explicitly excluded from the franchise.\nBecause there were no other waves at the time, first wave feminism did not describe it self as such. In fact, the term feminism was not coined until decades after first wave feminism ended. Second wave feminists retroactively dubbed the suffragettes first wave feminism to clarify their continuity with but divergence from that earlier movement.\nHence, the feminists of the first wave set out to extend to women the assertion of Thomas Rainsborough during the Putney Debates: ""I think it\'s clear, that every man that is to live under a government ought first by his own consent to put himself under that government.""\nFirst-wave feminists often joined other social movements, including abolitionism, the temperance movement (the Woman\'s Christian Temperance Union, for example, was headed for many years by a feminist, Frances Willard), the labor movement, and the anti-war movement in regards to World War I.\nSome famous feminists from this era are Mary Wollstonecraft, Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Sojourner Truth, Alice Paul, Emmeline Pankhurst, Margaret Sanger, and Emma Goldman.\nThe second wave: the women\'s liberation movement (1960s - 1970s)\n“”One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.\n|—Simone de Beauvoir|\n“”Feminism is the radical idea that women are people.\nDuring the two world wars, with so many men leaving nations\' workforces to fight, the demands of total war required putting women into jobs previously reserved for men. Women quickly proved themselves more than capable of doing virtually all ""men\'s work""; but when the wars ended, someone or something pressured women to leave their new jobs to make room for the returning veterans.\nHowever, many women had found that they greatly preferred employment to the traditional female role of rattling pots and pans, changing diapers, and having to beg their husbands for pin-money; thus was born what became called the ""feminist movement"", or second-wave feminism.\nWhile first-wave feminism had focused on removing the most overt legal disabilities for women and making women equal to men before the law, second-wave feminism tackled a wider range of social restrictions, advocating for women\'s full and equal participation in the larger social world.\nIssues tackled by the second-wave feminists included:\n- Access to birth control. In the U.S., the Supreme Court legalized contraception in 1965 in Griswold v. Connecticut; eight years later, in 1973, abortion became legal through Roe v. Wade.\n- Workplace discrimination, whether this meant excluding women from certain jobs altogether, or paying them less than a man doing the same work. In the U.S., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned sex discrimination in employment. Of course, it was added to the bill in order to kill it, but nonetheless it became binding law that had to be enforced.\n- Spousal abuse. Second-wave feminists engaged in a good deal of legal advocacy on behalf of battered wives and started many women\'s shelters as safe refuges.\n- Marital rape, which was legal throughout the U.S. until Nebraska passed a law against it in 1973, and was not criminalized in all states until the 1990s.\nThe third wave: clashes of values (1980s–present)\n“”I’m glad she didn’t want me to take her name.\n|—Nelson Mandela on why he didn\'t care when his wife, Graça Machel, kept her surname|\nLike the first- and second-wave feminists before them, third-wave feminists are taking on numerous core concepts of the society they live in; and for this, like the first- and second-wave feminists before them, have been labeled ""radical."" However, third-wave feminism is sometimes considered more radical than the waves preceding it: for example, where in the first wave Sojourner Truth asked ""Ain\'t I a woman?"" as a rhetorical question, one major question in third-wave feminism is, ""What is a \'woman\'?""\nTo wit: third-wave feminism is intellectually informed by postmodernism and post-structuralism, both of which challenge feminism to re-evaluate (and sometimes redefine) societal concepts including the notion of gender itself. They de-emphasize attacking women\'s second-class status directly in favor of attacking systems of religion, government, education, media, and even the family, all of which they believe are partly responsible for reinforcing women\'s second-class status.\nThird-wave feminism challenges not only the status quo of women\'s roles within these systems, but the systems themselves, making it largely overlap with and feed into the social justice movement. This sometimes makes people who fully support the goals of second-wave feminism uncomfortable with the third-wave variety. Sex-negative feminism has also diminished in prominence within third-wave feminism, while there is a much stronger sex-positive element, as seen through works like The Vagina Monologues. However, accusations of ""sex-negative feminism"" are routinely used as a snarl word to dismiss points of view which are not necessarily sex-negative, such as criticism of the porn industry, of the objectification of women in the media and popular culture.\nIn many ways third-wave feminism, a far more intellectual and academic form of feminism, is less relevant to the average woman on the street than its predecessors — far more women are receptive to the idea of getting an honest day\'s pay for an honest day\'s work than are receptive to the idea of overthrowing capitalism or other huge systems designated as tools of patriarchy — but in other ways it is actually more relevant to many women. In its specifics, it contains numerous legacies of the struggles that gave it birth: third-wave feminists explicitly attempt to treat women\'s issues as larger than those of upper-class white women, highlighting the similar but distinct experiences of minorities in the First World, as well as women in other countries where different traditional roles have led to different kinds of discrimination that Western-style feminism may not adequately tackle. For example, female genital mutilation, a hot-button issue in Western feminism, is seen as a less pressing issue by a number of African feminists, especially considering the history of colonial opposition to the practice (seriously).\nFeminism is ultimately about women\'s empowerment, and their right to make the choices that work for them, even when those choices may seem to conflict with basic ideals of equality. Thus, at least one modern feminist source has argued that Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann are feminists, although the pair rail against things most\nsane people feminists hold dear, particularly the right to have an abortion.\nSecond-wavers are very grateful to third-wavers for having provided feminism with a framework for thinking about intersectionality. The term was coined in 1989 by black third-wave feminist Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw.\nFeminism, just like any other philosophy, has its vocal fanatics too.\n“”Feminism is the struggle to end sexist oppression.\n“”There is something sexy about women in power. I like when you can see that a person believes in him/herself that much.\n|—Borgen\'s Mikael Birkkjær|\nAs with most movements against discrimination and inequality, feminism is still a long way from achieving its goals, with many prejudices and much bias persisting. Women still get paid less than men, mostly because of society\'s expectations of women pushing them into less lucrative jobs, and of course direct discrimination.\nBut, on the bright side, the situation of women in general has been consistently improving, at least in the First World. The proportion of wealth held by women has risen significantly enough to prompt speculation as to the effect that the continuation of this trend would have on the economy, and although large wage gaps remain in specific professions, in the general case the income gap is now almost nonexistent among the younger generation of women, especially in urban areas. These developments led Hanna Rosin of The Atlantic to remark: ""Yes, the U.S. still has a wage gap, one that can be convincingly explained — at least in part — by discrimination. Yes, women still do most of the child care. And yes, the upper reaches of society are still dominated by men. But given the power of the forces pushing at the economy, this setup feels like the last gasp of a dying age rather than the permanent establishment."" That may be overly optimistic, but if feminist (and labor and small-d democratic) momentum keeps building, it doesn\'t have to be.\nDomestic violence has decreased dramatically in the United States since the launching of second-wave feminism. The problem was rampant in the 1960s and 1970s. It still happens plenty, but it\'s rare by comparison to earlier periods, yet another example of the success of the feminist movement. Though the problem continues, rates of incest have declined significantly as well; you can thank feminism for that too.\nCriticism and backlash\nSince its inception, the feminist movement has faced significant backlash, from varying opponents and with varying reasons. A significant amount of the population opposes the third wave, some of the nuttier still oppose the second wave, and some of the most misogynistic even oppose the first wave.\n- A good overview on the types of feminism\n- Straw Feminist, TV Tropes\n- Let\'s Say Good-Bye to the Straw Feminist, PLOS\n- Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Approaches to Feminism, Topics in Feminism\n- 5 Ways Modern Men Are Trained to Hate Women, Cracked\n- Some definitions of feminism, Stanford 101\n- Three  articles on women\'s roles in the Arab Spring\n- Simone de Beauvoir, Sonoma State University\n- Letters of Note\n- The Putney Debates, 1647, British Civil War Project (Similarly, in Romer v.

Research exploring risk markers associated with IPV has the potential to enhance our ability to understand and prevent IPV. This meta-analysis examined various life stressors as risk markers for physical IPV perpetration and victimization for men and women. The life stressors chosen in this study were based upon the American Psychological Association’s Stress in America survey results, which identified work, money, health and relationships as the most commonly experienced stressors in the United States. Primary findings from this study suggest that strongest risk markers for IPV perpetration and victimization were relationship distress and mental health distress. When exploring gender differences, we found that unemployment was a significantly stronger risk marker for male IPV perpetration compared to female IPV perpetration. Implications for therapists are discussed.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution.\nBuy single article\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\nTax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nData reported in the meta-analysis were from previously published studies.\nAmerican Psychological Association.

74	How do German Christmas markets create unique shopping experiences through themed environments, and what sustainable alternatives exist for traditional holiday shopping practices at these markets?	German Christmas markets create distinct shopping experiences through themed environments, as seen in Stuttgart's traditional market with 300 wooden huts, Ludwigsburg's Baroque-themed market with angel motifs, and Esslingen's Medieval market featuring period-costumed merchants and traditional crafts demonstrations. To make shopping at these markets more sustainable, visitors can implement various eco-friendly practices. These include reusing gift wrapping materials, converting old Christmas cards into new decorations or greeting cards, using recyclable materials for gift packaging, and saving ribbons and bows. Digital alternatives like e-cards can also help reduce paper waste, while creative reuse of materials like newspapers, magazines, and brown paper bags can provide environmentally conscious gift-wrapping options.	"['If you’re looking for a trip that puts you in a holiday mood, visit a Christmas market. It’s one of our favorite ways to get the season started.\nThrough the years at My Itchy Travel Feet, we’ve shared many festive travel ideas, including how to visit Germany’s top Christmas markets. Or why we think that an early December Rhine River cruise is so much fun.\nMITF Featured writer, Debi Lander of ByLanderSea, adds to our collection. If you’re planning a holiday trip to Stuttgart, read Debi’s tips for three Christmas markets to add to your itinerary.\nYou’ll discover that Stuttgart at Christmas is a delight!\nI’d long wished to visit some of Europe’s famous Christmas Markets and recently got my chance. I learned I could experience three different markets from the same home base — Stuttgart — in the Baden -Württemberg region of southwest Germany.\nI looked forward to shopping for hand-made German wooden crafts and those colorful character nutcrackers. At one point in my life, I’d amassed quite a collection of nutcrackers but then passed them along to my grown children. Hopefully, they will survive and get passed down to my grandchildren.\nAnother travel treat would be German sweets and pastries. I have a fondness for gingerbread and cookies made from cookie molds.\nBoomer Travel Tip\nIn today’s travel climate, trip insurance is a must. Compare policies and rates at InsureMyTrip.\nThe history of German Christmas Markets\nThe winter markets harken back to the thirteenth century and the celebration of the winter solstice. Munich claims to be the oldest in Germany, dating back to 1310.\nAs we might call them today, the pop-up stores serve much the same function they have for centuries. They provide a lively meeting place for locals and a market for shoppers.\nThe festive markets bring all the delights associated with Christmas: Old World aromas of roasting chestnuts, the taste of sweet and spicy gingerbread, the sounds of Yuletide carols, the sight of colorful lights, plus the interaction of people in good cheer. The little shops feature old-fashion wooden toys, seasonal decorations, and tree ornaments.\nMany of them are exquisitely hand-carved while the less expensive variety machine manufactured. Hand-knit winter accessories are also popular, and, naturally, traditional German food and drink await in abundant supply.\nStarting with the Stuttgart Christmas Market\nI began exploring Stuttgart’s downtown market bustling with nearly 300 wooden huts. Their roofs were covered with 3-D figures and designs, often animated characters, and festooned with lots of fresh greenery (no artificial garland).\nEach booth is filled with goodies, usually hanging from the ceiling or strung from beam to beam. I started to browse in the late afternoon, getting my first look at items I might want to buy. No surprise, I snacked on a gingerbread cookie.\nOf course, a massive downtown Christmas tree glimmered with hundreds of lights, but I was attracted to the life-size Nativity figures in a large rotating pyramid. Nothing like an Egyptian pyramid, German Christmas pyramids are circular, descending wooden tiered platforms that rotate by the heat of burning candles.\nSmaller versions of these become cherished annual centerpieces in German homes. They are intricately carved and almost always include the Nativity family, animals, and figures (shepherds, wise men) associated with the manger.\nThe big rotating pyramid in the center of Stuttgart mesmerized me. I’d never seen one like that before.\nMarketgoers stop to drink Glühwein — hot mulled wine, served in a mug — along with sausages, pretzels, nuts, or sweets. The grab and go meal felt like eating at a fair, but some people dine in the downtown restaurants.\nA holiday light show, against the backdrop of the Old Palace, included typical yuletide music and dancing designs. You can’t miss the floodlit models of a Mercedes and Porsche. After all, the city is home to those luxury automakers, which makes a fun trip to Stuttgart for car lovers.\nBoomer Travel Tip\nMedjetAssist Members who are hospitalized 150 miles from home receive medical transport to a home-country hospital of choice. Memberships from $99.\nVisiting the Baroque Christmas Market at Ludwigsburg\nAfter sunset, I rode a commuter train about ten miles to reach Ludwigsburg, a smaller town with around 100,000 residents. Ludwigsburg presents a Baroque Christmas Market.\nA walk through the modern downtown, illuminated by an angel theme, soon brought me to the holiday market. Folks passed through arched greenery, near two illuminated baroque churches, and a glittery angel hovered above the stalls.\nThe Ludwigsburg market shops were very family-friendly, and I wished my grandchildren were with me. Young ones debated their choices while picking out gifts, candy, or ornaments to hang from their tree.\nI heard singing, the sweet sound of children’s voices, and followed it until I came to an outdoor stage. I listened to elementary-aged students perform a medley of holiday songs, all in German, except Jingle Bells, sung in English. Equally, heart-warming was the delighted faces of parents and grandparents beaming with pride and love.\nAs I stood there, I felt the spirit of Christmas rekindle within me, spreading like a warm glow. I smiled and thought, “This is what it’s all about.” I connected with Ludwigsburg and its residents, a nice feeling for a tourist.\nHad I come earlier in the day, I could have toured Ludwigsburg’s Palace, nicknamed the “Versailles of Swabia.” It’s is a 452-room palace complex of 18 buildings and gardens — the largest palatial estate in the country.\nAlthough I think the Baroque style is a bit over the top, I wished I had toured. But this gives me a reason for a return trip.\nExperiencing a Medieval Christmas market at Esslingen am Necker\nThe next evening, I took the train a bit farther to historic Esslingen am Neckar. Picturesque doesn’t capture the magic of this town.\nEsslingen lies on the Neckar River, and nearly every building in the historic center remains a half-timbered architectural gem. The 200 fairytale-like buildings were thankfully left largely undamaged during World War II.\nIn fact, Esslingen lays claim to the oldest row of half-timbered houses in the entire country, dating back almost 700 years.\nEsslingen hosts an extraordinary Medieval Christmas Market, even earning the title of Best Christmas City back in 2018 for its size category. The big beautiful red Rathaus, old City Hall, makes the perfect backdrop for the theme fully embraced by merchants dressed in period-looking costumes.\nThey demonstrate and sell their classic handicrafts using Middle Age methods. Blacksmiths, glass blowers, potters, woodcarvers, minstrels, and more engage the crowds. I immediately fell under its spell, feeling like I was walking through a medieval fair frozen in time.\nA midway of traditional fair games called for active participation. The egg toss and archery had folks waiting in line.\nI kept running into jugglers, fire eaters, and crowd performers. A special children’s area even fits in a small Ferris wheel, kid-sized games, and puppet shows.\nScents from a whole pig roasting on a spit wafted through the night air, mixing with aromatic cinnamon and pine. The Medieval Market was alive and oh so much fun, by far the favorite market of my trip.\nThe Stuttgart or Baden -Württemberg Christmas markets were all I imagined and hoped for, and I sure wish I were going again this year.', ""10 Eco-friendly Tips for the Holidays\nIt’s time for some eco-friendly tips for the upcoming holidays. Christmas is considered the most wasteful time of the year. Did you know that the U.S. alone produces an extra 25 million tons of garbage during the holidays from Thanksgiving to New Year?\nExtra waste includes the gift wrappers, ribbons, Christmas cards, decorations, and other stuff that people throw away after the holidays. If only people would learn to reuse or recycle these things, our planet will be much better off. For example, if families just reuse two feet of ribbon, think about the 38,000 miles of ribbon saved. If individuals re-use gift wraps, such as gift bags and wrapping paper, imagine how much paper will be saved.\nHave you ever thought about how you can personally help reduce Christmas' carbon footprint? By taking simple steps to make the holidays more eco-friendly, it doesn’t mean that Christmas will be less special or memorable. It would actually make a good impact on your pocket, the environment, and the people around you.\nIf you would like to take part in this earth-friendly movement, then you’ll want to take a look at these awesome tips you can adopt during the holidays. Check them out below:\nChristmas Card Recycling\nTip #1: Turn them into handmade Christmas cards\nDon’t throw away the Christmas cards you receive. Recycle them by reusing the decorative part of the cards. Just buy a pack of thin card and adhesive. Cut off the back part of the card and mount the graphic design on a blank card. Fold in half and write your Christmas greetings inside.\nMake the cards more personal and fun by adding some glitter or star decals. This is a great activity for children who enjoy doing arts and crafts. See an example on the right of a pretty handmade recycled Christmas card.\nTip #2: Turn them to Christmas decors\nThere are many recycled Christmas card crafts you can do that makes good Christmas decors. Martha Stewart has tutorials on making Christmas ornamental balls and holiday card monogram labels.\nYou can also simply make Christmas card garlands. Just cut the Christmas cards into triangular pieces, tape them to a string and hang them up.\nRecycled Christmas Card into Decors\nTip #3: Reuse envelopes\nFor every Christmas card, you get an envelope. You can also reuse these when you need to send your handmade Christmas cards. Just buy special “sticker labels” to cover up the old details.\nTip #4: Send digital Christmas cards or e-cards\nTo reduce the quanity of Christmas cards sent each year, you can opt to go digital. Design your own greeting cards on the computer and send it to people that you regularly communicate with via email. Limit the paper greeting cards you send to only your family and closest friends.\nRecycling Christmas Gift Wrapping Paper\nWrapping paper is often used once and thrown away. But if you’re really careful when opening gifts, you can reuse the wrapping paper again. Gently remove the adhesive tape and fold or roll the paper neatly before keeping it.\nHere are some ways to recycle gift wrappers:\nTip #5 Reuse them for wrapping gifts again\nYou can iron out the wrinkled part of wrapper before using. Or just choose portions of the wrapping paper that have no wrinkles. You can fold on the old folds to be able to use more of the paper.\nTip #6 Reuse them for your craft projects\nHere are some craft ideas you can use for old gift wrappers:\n- Making paper beads which you can make into a mosaic of any pattern you like or make them into necklace or bracelet.\n- Use them for embellishing greeting cards, posters and bookmarks.\n- Use them as matting for picture frames.\n- Cut them into squares or circles and use them as box labels.\n- They’re great for making origami.\nTip #7 Make them into handmade paper\nYou can pretty much use any paper for making handmade paper. Then you can use what you make as stationery or wrapping paper once again. The colorful design of the wrapping paper will add extra nice details to handmade paper.\nHow to Make Recycled Handmade Paper\nTip #8 Reuse them to make money or cash envelopes\nIf you like giving cash as gifts for the holidays, you can use old Christmas wrapping paper to make colorful little envelopes. You can also use the envelopes for your own personal use like when budgeting your finances.\nHow to Make Money Envelopes\nTip #9 Use other recyclable materials for wrapping your Christmas presents\nYou can use old newspaper, colorful magazines, brown paper bag, and old maps as gift wrapper. You can even use plastic cups and bottles to wrap gifts. If you’re buying new wrapping paper, look out for those made of recycled paper.\nTip #10 Reuse ribbons and bows\nWhen you receive gifts, be sure to save the ribbons and bows. You can use them again for embellishing presents or for your craft projects like bookmarks or scrapbooks.\nHow to make paper cups gift boxes\nHopefully, you can use some of these tips to make Christmas celebration this year more eco-friendly.""]"	['<urn:uuid:b1c02da5-3115-4267-90c5-ba932123b344>', '<urn:uuid:e7b4259b-12a9-45a0-b648-e19fc879d567>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	25	106	2081
75	Can a virus cause mental health problems?	Yes, CNS infections by specific pathogens can mimic psychiatric diseases. Studies have shown that viruses like HIV, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2), Epstein-Barr, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), measles, mumps, coxsackie, and influenza viruses can cause psychiatric disorders. Additionally, bacterial infections like syphilis and Borrelia burgdorferi have been associated with schizophrenia-like symptoms.	['Infectious Agents in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder\nInfectious Agents in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder\nThe idea that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder might be caused by infection is not new. This was a prominent hypothesis in the early years of the last century. For example, an article entitled, Is insanity due to a microbe? was published in Scientific American as early as 1896. Research to test this hypothesis by identifying causative viruses was already being conducted by the 1930s, when data were reported from experiments in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with schizophrenia was injected into rabbit brains.1\nNew research in the field continues, aided increasingly by impressive technologic advances in microbiology and virology. As recently as the past decade, reports documented the presence of influenza virus, rubella virus, bovine disease virus, and other infectious agents in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as the presence of other infectious agents in childhood pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn this article, we briefly highlight the background of such research; discuss our own research on Toxoplasma gondii, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and endogenous retroviruses; and consider the future implications of such research for psychiatric clinicians.\nBackground and rationale\nWhy should we look for infectious agents in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder? Such a hypothesis is consistent with the known genetic contributions to these disorders. Indeed, a genetic predisposition is well established for most chronic infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, malaria, polio, AIDS, and peptic ulcers caused by Helicobacter pylori.2 The hypothesis is consistent with the role of neurotransmitter abnormalities in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, because specific infectious agents have been shown to alter dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid, and acetylcholine in animal models. The hypothesis is also consistent with neurodevelopmental models of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Pearce3 and others developed animal models that show how exposure to specific infectious agents during neurodevelopment correlates with later behavioral alterations in animals.\nAn additional important reason to look for infectious agents in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is that CNS infection by specific pathogens frequently mimics the clinical symptoms of primary psychiatric diseases. For example, Caroff and colleagues4 reviewed 108 cases of psychiatric disorders resulting from suspected or confirmed CNS viral infections; in 62 cases, a specific virus was implicated, including HIV, HSV-1, HSV-2, Epstein-Barr, and CMV; and measles, mumps, coxsackie, and influenza viruses. Among bacteria, the fact that the spirochete of syphilis can cause the symptoms of schizophrenia was well known to psychiatric clinicians of an earlier era. More recently, infection with the spirochetal organism Borrelia burgdorferi has also been associated with schizophrenia-like symptoms in some persons.5\nAnother reason to look for infectious agents in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is the well-established association between the risk of these disorders and winter-spring seasonal birth.6 There have been more than 200 studies of this phenomenon, and it remains one of the most highly replicated findings of these diseases. Because many infectious diseases occur seasonally, with a peak in the winter or spring, it is reasonable to postulate that fetal or newborn infection could contribute to subsequent mental illness.7\nAt the present time, we are focusing our research on 4 infectious agents as possible causes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These are T gondii, HSV-1 and HSV-2, CMV, and endogenous retroviruses.\nT gondii is a protozoan parasite whose definitive host is the cat family. Humans become infected by ingesting oocysts shed in the feces of infected cats or by eating undercooked meat from an animal that came into contact with infected cat feces. T gondii is one of the most widespread human parasites; 10% to 20% of Americans test seropositive by adulthood. Exposure to T gondii during early pregnancy can cause severe fetal CNS abnormalities. Exposure during late pregnancy was never considered a problem until recently, when animal data showed that late exposure to the organism causes behavioral changes, neurologic symptoms, and stillbirths.8,9\nSince 1956, more than 20 studies have compared antibodies to T gondii in adults with and without schizophrenia.10 An overall analysis of the studies indicates that serologic evidence of Toxoplasma infection is almost 3 times more common in persons with schizophrenia than in controls living in the same geographic region.Two additional studies reported an increased level of T gondii antibodies in the late-pregnancy serum of women giving birth to infants in whom schizophrenia later developed. 11,12 Other studies have reported greater childhood exposure to cats among persons with schizophrenia than among controls.13,14 Our research is focusing on the timing of Toxoplasma infections in relation to development, as well as on possible differences in T gondii strains and human genetic susceptibility.\nHerpes simplex viruses\nLike Toxoplasma, HSV-1 and HSV-2 are common causes of infection in humans. HSV-1 may be spread by either sexual or nonsexual contact with infected persons, while HSV-2 is primarily spread through sexual contact. Both of these viruses are known to cause encephalitis and to be highly neurotropic. Traditionally, however, these viruses have been regarded as relatively benign in the majority of asymptomatic patients who carry them. Recent data suggest that this may not be true. One study evaluated the mothers of patients in whom schizophrenia or bipolar disorder developed. These women had increased levels of HSV-2 serum antibodies just before parturition.15\nComparison studies of persons with and without schizophrenia or bipolar disorder show that HSV-1 infection significantly increases cognitive dysfunction—especially recent memory deficits—in persons with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.16,17 This did not occur in persons infected with other viruses in the herpes family and also did not occur in persons without schizophrenia or bipolar disorder who were infected with HSV-1.\nIn a follow-up study, Dickerson and associates18 showed that a polymorphism on the COMT gene (COMT Val 158 Met polymorphism) also increases cognitive dysfunction; this suggests a synergistic effect between HSV infection and the gene. This kind of interaction may be a model for future research that integrates multiple factors in the development of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.']	['<urn:uuid:91febd72-1b36-4a02-9d17-7ddc1fc0e452>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	7	50	995
76	I heard that complete rest during winter break is bad for fitness - how much training time can we save by doing reduced training instead of total rest?	By implementing a winter break program of training at 40% of normal load instead of complete rest, you can reduce the time needed to return to full training load from 32 days to just 14 days, saving almost 3 weeks of recovery time.	['09 Jan How to stay fit during the winter break\nAs a coach you want your team to get fully rested during the winterbreak without losing all fitness after the holidays, so your team doesn’t have to catch up lost fitness when recommencing competition.\nwinter break, generally lasting about 14 days, is the perfect opportunity to\nshrink any accumulated fatigue built up during in-season competition. Including\nholidays Christmas and New Year’s Eve, players are often at absolute rest. At a\nfirst glance this doesn’t seem harmful. After all, it enables players to fully\nrecover from physical discomforts. However, absolute rest for a prolonged\nperiod of time is detrimental for previously built up fitness as well, also\ndescribed as ‘detraining’. More elaborately, detraining consists of loss of\n(an)aerobic power and endurance, strength, flexibility, muscle tone, muscle\nmass and metabolism, with the steepest deterioration in the first three weeks\nof training cessation (1). However, the magnitude of training re-adaptations after\ndetraining is different depending on athlete’s fitness level and duration of\ntraining cessation (2). To ensure optimal team performance at competition\nresumption reduced fitness levels must be caught up again which costs valuable\ntime. It is estimated that after two weeks of absolute rest during winter break\ntime to safely return to full training load will be 32 days (3). Increasing\ntraining load back to pre winter break levels too fast\ngreatly increases risk of injury and illness.\nTherefore, as a coach you want to limit detraining effects and return to full training load as soon as possible without increasing risk of injury and illness. Therefore, absolute rest is not recommended how to spend the winter break. Relative rest (reduced training load) limits detraining effects leading to less time spent on catching up on fitness. Implementing a winter break program of training 40% of normal load greatly decreases detraining effects, reducing time to safe return to full training load to only 14 days (table 1) (3), after which competition matches are often schedules again.\n|% Training Load||Days to safe return||Total days reduced training|\nTable 1. Retrieved from regression AIS whitepaper (3). Number of days to safely return to competition load during two weeks of relative rest (40% or 60%) or absolute rest (0%).\nTrain at 40% normal load\nBased on a schedule of four sessions per week (1 match, 3 training), lower training volume and frequency to two sessions per week of approximately 30 minutes each during winter break. Schedule one session of 40% normal load per every 3 to 4 days to enable full recovery and replenishment. This way, at recommencement of team training players are less affected by detraining and can withstand higher initial training loads leaving less time necessary to restore lack of fitness and more time available for team tactical sessions. Nevertheless, we must remain cautious not to immediately overload players as any reduction in training load leads to detraining. On return to training, session frequency is restored to 4 per week automatically increasing total weekly load. Simultaneously increasing acute training load will further increase player fatigue, lengthen their recovery and greatly increases risk of injury and illness. Therefore after winter break training load must be progressively increased and can be back at competition load in two weeks (see figure 1). Using this program outline will shorten time to safe return to training by almost 3 weeks without increasing risk of injury and illness.\nFigure 1. Schematic outline of absolute rest and relative rest winter break periodisation. The left graph shows safe return to training load (grey line) after two weeks, which is significantly prolonged after absolute rest (right graph, blue line) during winter break.\nWinter break training session\nHow can one train at 40% normal load? What factors need to be considered when making exercises? What kind of exercises are suitable. Basically, any exercise activity that requires physical exertion can be beneficial. Nevertheless, remain as sport specific as possible. Include exercises in winter break programs to expose players to comparable types of physical exertion done in normal training. For example, high amount of sprint distance and accelerations included in regular training sessions should be represented in winter break training sessions. Convert the load exerted by these sprints and accelerations to 40%, so if 100% load contains 400m sprint distance and 100 accelerations, include a running exercise that achieves 160m sprint distance and 40 accelerations. See table 2 for a training session exposing that particular load. After a thorough warm-up, players start with 10x5m sprints focussing on accelerations followed by a 60m lane high speed running targeting sprint distance. Keep in mind that the goal is to expose the body to sprint related stimuli (i.e. limiting detraining) and not to increase fitness. Therefore, make sure for adequate rest in between series.\n|60m Lane Outline||Training outline||Duration [min]|\n|15m accel to max speed||Sprint 10x5m||3|\n|15m max speed||4x60m lane||3|\n|15m roll out||Rest||4|\n|Total||160m SD & 38 Acc||33 min|\nTable 2. Example of 40% load training session.\nResuming team training\nAfter two weeks of 40% relative rest players return to team training less affected by detraining. However, proceeding on competition load levels straight away will still result in high acute load spikes exposing players to increased risk of injury. By reducing initial training load when resuming team sessions players will readapt to higher training loads fast and get 100% fit without increased risk of injury. This can be done by placing focus on volume with a small portion of high intensity small sided games in the first sessions after winter break. In these sessions, include large running/passing/sided games exercises to increase total distance in a controlled way. In the following sessions, gradually progress towards more chaotic exercises (small position games / small sided games) to increase random explosive movements and mimic more match relevant situations.

77	I need blood for surgery next week - how long can blood products stay out of the fridge before they go bad, and what problems can happen if they're not stored right?	Whole blood, red cells, and thawed fresh frozen plasma must be transfused within 30 minutes of removal from refrigeration. If stored improperly above 6°C, bacterial contamination can proliferate. If stored below 2°C, hemolysis can occur, potentially causing fatal bleeding problems or renal failure. In cases of bacterial contamination, patients can develop severe sepsis with symptoms including hypotension, leucopenia, and fever.	"['|Home | About | Journals | Submit | Contact Us | Français|\nDepartments of Anesthesia & Perioperative Care and Laboratory Medicine University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA\nWe report two simultaneous cases of Staphylococcus aureus sepsis initially consistent with and diagnosed as transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI). The sepsis in both cases resulted from transfusion of two split products from a single contaminated plateletpheresis unit. In each case the platelets were given along with numerous other blood products during posterior spine surgery. The discussion includes presentation, clinical course, diagnosis and similarities between sepsis and TRALI. The cases and discussion highlight the importance of considering sepsis as part of the differential for any patient believed to have TRALI with clinical features of sepsis.\nData were collected from the patients’ electronic medical records and the hospital laboratory medicine database.\nOur cases highlight the importance of vigilant investigation in patients suspected of TRALI, as septic transfusions are easily missed and may mimic or coexist with TRALI. Sepsis should be strongly considered whenever clinical features such as hypotension, leucopenia and fever are noted in patients with suspected TRALI. In comparison to patients receiving red blood cells or plasma, platelet transfusion recipients are at a greater risk for sepsis from a contaminated unit. Patients developing sepsis from a contaminated blood product may meet the clinical definition of TRALI. In such cases, if the clinical syndrome is attributed solely to TRALI and bacterial sepsis is not suspected, the correct diagnosis may be missed or delayed. Consequently, appropriate treatment for sepsis would also be delayed or not provided and likely result in increased morbidity and mortality.\nThe risk of most transfusion-transmitted infectious vectors has decreased substantially during past decades(1–4). Transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI)(5) and bacterial sepsis(6) are among the leading causes of transfusion-associated mortality(7). The former has been attributed to plasma containing leukocyte antibody or other bioreactive mediators, while the latter is frequently associated with platelet transfusion, owing to a storage temperature (22°C) that while maintaining platelet function, permits bacterial growth.\nWe report two cases of Staphylococcus aureus sepsis caused by transfusion of two split products from one contaminated plateletpheresis collection unit. In both cases, the initial clinical presentation was consistent with, and diagnosed as TRALI. These cases illustrate the possibility of misdiagnosing a septic transfusion reaction as only due to TRALI, especially those associated with platelet transfusion. Additionally, they demonstrate a need for vigilant investigation including culture of the patient and the platelet product whenever TRALI is suspected but the clinical picture has strong features of sepsis. The IRB was contacted regarding use of the two cases presented below as part of this Clinical Case Report and were excused from needing formal approval.\nA 47 year-old woman with scoliosis underwent a revision posterior spinal fusion (PSF) with an estimated blood loss (EBL) of 6.0 liters. Her history included hypertension, chronic back pain, and two prior PSFs. Prophylactic vancomycin was given pre-operatively secondary to a penicillin allergy. Intraoperatively, she received one liter salvaged blood, 5 units red blood cells (RBC), 5 units fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and one plateletpheresis unit transfused 45 minutes before the end of surgery. In the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), she received an additional RBC unit and 2 units FFP secondary to anemia and increasing coagulopathy. Central venous pressures (CVP) remained 14 to 16 mmHg during this time with less than 200 mL wound drain output. After 4-hours in the PACU she became acutely tachycardic (heart rate 130 bpm), tachypneic, hypoxic (oxygen saturation 84% on 4L oxygen by nasal cannula) and hypotensive (systolic blood pressure near 70 mmHg). Her trachea was intubated, vasopressor infusion started and 2 additional units RBCs transfused. A rash was noted on her chest, and during the next 8-hours, she became febrile to 39.2°C (PACU arrival temperature was 37.2°C). Her white blood cell count (WBC) decreased from 10.0 ×109/L (preoperatively) to 0.9 × 109/L 4.5 hrs after surgery (Figure 1A). Chest x-ray (CXR) showed new-onset diffuse, bilateral pulmonary edema in contrast to a normal CXR just two hours prior. CVPs remained 12 to 17 mmHg. Given the acute hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates on CXR, and no evidence of increased left atrial pressure or cardiac dysfunction, acute lung injury (ALI) was suspected(8). The diagnosis of TRALI was thought likely(5), given the ALI within 6-hours of transfusion. Overnight the patient remained febrile, hypotensive, with evidence of increasing multi-organ dysfunction including respiratory and renal failure.\nInitial blood bank evaluation excluded an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction and supported a clinical diagnosis consistent with TRALI. All transfused blood products were identified and the empty transfusion bags from the operating room and PACU were recovered. Other products from these same donors were identified and those not yet transfused were quarantined. However, the platelet unit transfused to this patient was one of two parts from a split plateletpheresis collection; the second unit from this same split collection had already been transfused to the patient in Case 2 (below).\nAlthough the initial presentation was consistent with TRALI, the patient remained febrile and severely hypotensive with vasopressor support, an unusually severe clinical picture for TRALI. Sepsis was suspected when a peripheral blood smear of a sample drawn 30 minutes after surgery (1-hour after platelet transfusion) showed rare leukocytes with intracellular bacteria (Figure 2A). As bacteria in the platelet unit was suspected, a gram-stain of the spent platelet unit was performed and showed numerous gram-positive cocci in clusters amidst numerous platelets. A culture from this platelet unit grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), as did a blood culture of the patient’s blood taken 12-hours after platelet administration. Isolates from the patient\'s blood and platelet bag showed identical antibiotic susceptibilities.\nUpon investigation, the implicated plateletpheresis unit had been collected with proper aseptic technique at the local blood donation center, by apheresis from a healthy, afebrile donor. Standard unit collection culture included sampling and innoculation 24 hours after collection. The product was split into two parts and both released for patient transfusion following no bacterial growth after 24 hours of incubation. Further review noted that the culture remained negative at the end of 7 days of incubation. Internal and external quality assurance reviews of the donor center procedures showed no deficiencies. Although a follow-up examination of the donor noted no illness reported before or after donation, a nasal swab revealed carrier status of MSSA. Pulse field gel electropheresis of the MSSA isolates obtained from the platelet donor, both spent platelet bags, and the blood culture from the patient (Case 1) all showed identical banding patterns for all isolates. This result made it highly likely that the donor (skin colonization or transient bacteremia) was the source of platelet unit contamination. Testing of this split platelet unit from the male donor showed antibody to human neutrophil antigen (no identifiable specificity), and a cognate antibody against a class II human leukocyte antigen (anti-DR4).\nA 76-year old man with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension underwent uncomplicated anterior spinal fusion, followed five days later by a PSF with EBL of 8.5 liters. Intraoperatively, he received 1.8 liters salvaged blood, 7 units RBCs, 12 units FFP, and 2 units of plateletpheresis. Two hours prior to surgical completion, he had received the second part of the split platelet collection unit previously transfused to the patient in “Case 1."" Both patients had undergone surgery the same day. His condition was initially stable in the PACU, but two hours later he became acutely hypotensive, tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypoxic with increasing surgical wound drain output to over a liter. He received an additional 2 units FFP, 2 units RBCs, one platelet unit, and recombinant activated coagulation factor VII (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) secondary to worsening coagulopathy and anemia. Although the initial CVP was 6 mmHg, it remained 11 to 16 mmHg following fluid resuscitation and initiation of vasopressor support. He remained afebrile throughout. WBC count fell from 9.3 × 109/L preoperatively to a nadir of 1.7 ×109/L (Figure 1B).\nThe initial course was consistent with a diagnosis of post-surgical bleeding. However, his failure to respond to blood products and his acute respiratory compromise suggested the possibility of TRALI. A CXR showed mild, bilateral pulmonary edema. A transthoracic echocardiogram performed in the PACU was not significantly changed from evaluation before surgery (mild left ventricular dysfunction and aortic dilation).\nOvernight, renal function deteriorated and the patient became febrile. Blood cultures drawn 19-hours postoperatively were negative. However, the patient was receiving cefazolin every 4-hours during the case and postoperatively per surgical protocol. When Gram stain results from the platelet bag of ""Case 1"" noted staphalococcus contamination, recipients of co-components were identified as part of the septic transfusion reaction work up. It was determined that this patient ""Case 2"" had received the other half of the same contaminated platelet collection unit. Following retrieval of the spent unit, a gram stain and culture of this empty bag also revealed MSSA (Figure 2B–D). Testing of this split platelet unit from the male donor showed similar results to the other unit with antibody to human neutrophil antigen (no identifiable specificity), and no cognate antibody against a class I or class II human leukocyte antigen. As would be expected, the HLA cognate antibodies determined for each patient were different. Cognate antibodies represent the subset of HLA donor antibodies that match the recipient’s HLA antigens. Although samples from each of the two platelet products contained the same antibodies (same donor), since each patient had different HLA antigens, the matching set of cognate antibodies reported were different for each case.\nBoth patients remained critically ill in the ICU for several weeks and were hospitalized for more than a month. The first patient had continual fevers and persistently positive blood cultures, requiring multiple antibiotic regimens to treat her bacteremia. The second patient had renal failure requiring dialysis and recovered slowly. Both patients required extensive rehabilitation but eventually recovered for discharge.\nThese cases demonstrate that recipients of bacteria-containing platelet units can develop sepsis and present with clinical features of ALI. Until the diagnosis of sepsis was determined, both these transfusion reactions met the clinical definition of TRALI(5), defined(8) as new ALI occurring within 6-hours of transfusion in the absence of other risk factors for ALI. ALI is defined as acutely impaired oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2≤300 mmHg); bilateral infiltrates on CXR; and Paw ≤18 mmHg or no clinical evidence of elevated left atrial pressure(8). Thus the clinical diagnosis of TRALI is generally one of exclusion. One of the clinical features that caused these cases to be considered as TRALI was the acute decrease in WBC (noted in both cases), which has been reported previously in TRALI(9) and is also consistent with sepsis. Although septic transfusion reactions are rare and most diagnosis of TRALI are likely correct, these cases demonstrate that a septic transfusion reaction should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with TRALI, especially if the patient has clinical features of sepsis such as hypotension, leucopenia and fever. Early consideration of a septic transfusion allows initiation of an appropriate clinical and laboratory investigation(10) and timely treatment for sepsis including the use of pre-emptive broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Although specific policies and protocols differ between blood banks, notification of suspected TRALI might only ensure co-components of the implicated products are not transfused to the same patient, whereas notification of a possible septic transfusion reaction would result in quarantine of co-components from release to any patient.\nIf the clinical syndrome were attributed solely to TRALI and bacterial sepsis from the contaminated blood products were not suspected, the diagnosis of sepsis would have been missed or delayed, and would likely have resulted in increased morbidity and mortality. As both patients received platelet products from a donor positive for antibodies to human leukocytes, it is possible that these antibodies contributed in some part to the ALI in addition to sepsis.\nIt is standard blood bank practice to collect blood products aseptically and apheresis platelet products are routinely tested for bacterial contamination. However, sampling error may prevent the detection of small numbers of bacteria found in the product in the first 24 hours post collection. These bacteria can multiply during the remaining 3 or 4 days of shelf life. The residual rate of platelet bacterial contamination is approximately one in 40,000 apheresis units with most due to Staphylococcus species(11).\nSeptic transfusion reactions are easily missed and underreported (12). The diagnosis is often not considered due to underlying and superimposed medical illness. and the transfusion bag discarded and not available for gram stain and bacterial culture. Many institutions discard transfused bags routinely without returning them to the blood bank unless reactions are noted during infusion. Our institution was performing a prospective study of TRALI and we were fortunate that all transfused bags were routinely returned to the blood bank. This practice facilitated definitive diagnosis of these two cases.\nCritical care physicians, surgeons, and anesthesiologists should be aware that:\nDisclosure of Funding:\nThis work was supported in part by Award Number P50 HL081027 from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.\nPublisher\'s Disclaimer: This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

78	When did information theory begin as a scientific discipline?	Information theory began in 1947-1948 with the appearance of Claude Shannon's classical work.	"['A I Khinchin on Information Theory\nOn the Fundamental Theorems of Information Theoryby\nA I Khinchin\nInformation theory is one of the youngest branches of applied probability theory; it is not yet ten years old. The date of its birth can, with certainty, be considered to be the appearance in 1947-1948 of the by now classical work of Claude Shannon. Rarely does it happen in mathematics that A new discipline achieves the character of a mature and developed scientific theory in the first investigation devoted to it. Such in its time was the case with the theory of integral equations, after the fundamental work of Fredholm; so it was with-information theory after the work of Shannon.\nFrom the very beginning, information theory presents mathematics with a whole new set of problems, including some very difficult ones. It is quite natural that Shannon and his first disciples, whose basic goal was to obtain practical results, were not able to pay enough attention to these mathematical difficulties at the beginning. Consequently, at many points of their investigations. they were compelled either to be satisfied with reasoning of an inconclusive nature or to limit artificially the set of objects studied, (sources, channels, codes, etc.) in order to simplify the proofs. Thus, the whole mass of literature of the first years of information theory, of necessity, bears the imprint of mathematical incompleteness which, in particular, makes it extremely difficult for mathematicians to become acquainted with this new subject. The recently published general textbook on information theory by S Goldman can serve as a typical example of the style prevalent in this literature.\nInvestigations, with the aim of setting information theory on a solid mathematical basis have begun to appear only in recent years and, at the present time, are few in number. First of all, we must mention the work of McMillan in which the fundamental concepts of the theory of discrete sources (source, channel, code, etc.) were first given precise mathematical definitions. The most important result of this work must be considered to be the proof of the remarkable theorem that any discrete ergodic source has the property which Shannon attributed to sources of Markov type and which underlies almost all the asymptotic calculations of information theory. This circumstance permits the whole theory of discrete information to be constructed without being limited, as was Shannon, to Markov type sources. In the rest of his paper McMillan tries to put Shannon\'s fundamental theorem on channels with noise on a rigorous basis. In doing so, it becomes apparent that the sketchy proof given by Shannon contains gaps which remain even in the case of Markov sources. The elimination of these gaps is begun in McMillan\'s paper, but is not completed.\nNext, it is necessary to mention the work of Feinstein. Like McMillan, Feinstein considers the Shannon theorem on channels with noise to be the pinnacle of the general theory of discrete information and he undertakes to give a mathematically rigorous proof of this theorem. Accepting completely McMillan\'s mathematical apparatus, he avoids following Shannon\'s original path and constructs a proof, using the completely new and apparently very fruitful idea of a ""distinguishable set of sequences"", the principal features of which will be explained below. However, Feinstein carries out the proof in all details only for the simplest and least practical case, where the successive signals of the source are mutually independent and the channel memory is zero. In the more general case, he indicates only sketchily how the reader is to carry out the necessary reasoning independently. Unfortunately, there remains a whole series of significant difficulties.\nAs is well known, Shannon formulated his theorem on channels with noise in two different ways. One was in terms of a quantity called equivocation, and the other was in terms of the probability of error. McMillan\'s analysis leads to the conclusion that these two formulations are not equivalent, and that the second gives a more exact result than the first. Feinstein\'s more detailed investigation showed that although the first formulation is implied by the second, a rigorous derivation of this implication is not only non-trivial but fraught with considerable additional difficulties. Since both formulations are equally important in actual content, it is preferable to speak about two Shannon theorems rather than combine them under the same heading.\nIn this paper I attempt to give a complete, detailed proof of both of these Shannon theorems, assuming any ergodic source and any stationary channel with a finite memory. At the present time, apparently, these are the broadest hypotheses under which the Shannon theorems can be regarded as valid. On the whole, I follow the path indicated in the works of McMillan and Feinstein, deviating from them only in the comparatively few cases when I see a gap in their explanation, or when another explanation seems to me more complete and convincing (and sometimes, more simple).\nThe first chapter of the paper, which is of purely auxiliary character, requires special explanation. It is devoted to the derivation of a whole set of unrelated inequalities, each of which is a theorem of elementary probability theory (i.e., pertains only to finite spaces). The reader acquainted with my paper The entropy concept in probability theory (Russian) (1953) will be able to begin this paper with the second chapter, returning to the first chapter only, when references to its results appear in the text. All the following chapters are constructed according to a specific plan, and can not be skipped or read in different order.\nThe reader will see that the path to the Shannon theorems is long and thorny, but apparently science, at this time, knows no shorter path if we do not want artificial restrictions on the material studied and if we are to avoid making statements which we can not prove.\nJOC/EFR August 2007\nThe URL of this page is:']"	['<urn:uuid:b204da60-624e-4200-b101-63ed9e261e51>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	9	13	977
79	I study coffee farming techniques and noticed Ethiopia is the world's 5th largest producer at 384,000 metric tons - how does this compare between forest coffee yields of 7-30 kg per hectare versus plantation coffee's 450-1200 kg per hectare yields?	The stark difference in yields explains why only 5% of Ethiopia's coffee production comes from forest coffee (7-30 kg per hectare) while plantation coffee (450-1200 kg per hectare) accounts for 10% of production. The higher-yielding plantation method produces significantly more coffee per hectare, contributing more to Ethiopia's total production volume of 384,000 metric tons.	['Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee. Coffea arabica originates in and still grows wild in Ethiopia in areas which are included in the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity hotspot. This hotspot — which also covers areas in the coffee-growing regions of Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi — has been reduced to 10% of its original extent. In Ethiopia, only about 2000 sq km of high-quality forest with wild arabica coffee remains.\nAs coffee consumers, we often hear about this “wild” coffee, or the generally rustic way in which coffee is typically grown in Ethiopia, and so we generally feel good about enjoying Ethiopian coffee from an ecological point of view. Technically, coffee is wild if it grows and reproduces or regenerates on its own within natural habitats.\nHow much Ethiopian coffee is grown in forests? Is it really coming from a pristine environment? Is this method of coffee production really preserving biodiversity?\nA number of publications over the past few years help shed some light on this topic, and the results are a bit surprising. The diagram at right is one I constructed using data from several sources (list at end of post). It indicates the different methods of coffee cultivation in Ethiopia, with rough approximations of the frequency of occurrence of each. Below are the characteristics of each method. This is all necessarily simplified, but most sources are in general agreement.\nPlantation coffee (10%). This is the most intense method of coffee cultivation, where land is cleared and planted with coffee and managed for yield, which ranges from 450 to 1200 kg per ha annually (around 750 seems “average”). This includes larger estates, but may also involve small holders.\nGarden coffee (or “semi-forest plantation”) (50%). Here coffee plants are transplanted to gardens around farmers’ homes. These plants might come from nearby forest, or farmers may exchange seedlings best adapted to an area or microhabitat; some may originate from a different region. Coffee is typically interplanted with other crops and fruit trees. Garden coffee is found most frequently in southern Ethiopia, including Sidamo, and well as Harerge/Harrar. Yields range from 200 to 700 kg/ha/yr.\nForest coffee (5%). I think this is what most people probably envision when they hear about “wild” coffee. Here, coffee is harvested from trees growing in the forest, with virtually no management of the surrounding forest or vegetation, except perhaps some removal of undergrowth to facilitate access to the coffee trees. However, it should be noted that several authors have stated that coffee is managed in some way virtually wherever it occurs. Even among locals, “forest coffee” is broadly and variously defined. It may mean old overgrown plantations, or a single coffee tree in a pasture that was once forest. In any event, yields are well below 200 kg per ha, often between a mere 7 to 30 kg.\nSemi-forest coffee (35%). Most “forest coffee” is probably really in this category, termed semi-forest coffee. Here, the forest is altered and managed, often quite substantially. The canopy is thinned once to several times a year to allow more light to reach the coffee and increase yields (which vary greatly depending on the extent of management, but are under 400 kg per ha per year). Trees with open, wide-spreading canopies are favored since fewer trees are needed to provide the preferred amount of shade. Undergrowth, competing shrubs, and emerging seedlings of other plants are removed to make harvesting easier and to make room for more coffee. The coffee grows wild, but is also supplemented by shrubs transplanted from elsewhere. Usually this means from a nearby forest, but occasionally even government-supplied cultivars are utilized.\nWhile semi-forest coffee is better than a coffee monoculture with no canopy cover, several studies have shown that the managing of these forests does have serious consequences. Schmitt et al. (2010) found that in the Bonga region, 30% of canopy trees and most undergrowth was removed in these systems, severely disturbing forest structure. Although the overall number of plant species increased by 26% in comparison with intact forest, it was due to secondary and pioneer species, mostly herbaceous species and vines. Forest species declined. Of special concern is the reduction in the number of tree ferns, an ancient family of plants which require shady, moist conditions that are becoming rare in some locations. In Jimma, Aerts et al. (2011) found a near-absence of a true upper canopy >15 m tall, and many climax forest species have nearly disappeared, as they are removed and seedlings are not allowed to regenerate.\nIncreasingly, forest coffee is being managed as semi-forest coffee, and semi-forest coffee is being managed and harvested with increasing intensity as coffee prices rise. The increasing management intensity has profound impacts on the forest and biodiversity. This diversity includes the genetic resources of wild races of Coffea arabica, as the practice of swapping and transplanting coffee, and any interbreeding, erodes the integrity of wild genotypes.\nVolkmann (2008) did an analysis of the areas used by two dozen cooperatives that are part of the Kafa Forest Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union, and concluded that the designation “forest coffee” was probably inappropriate for the output of almost half of them, as they are highly degraded forests, or mostly garden coffee. However, in 2010, this area was designated as UNESCO biosphere reserve. Like other biosphere reserves, the goal is to have a core area that is protected, and buffer zones in which sustainable practices are allowed. Planned projects include reforestation.\nCoffee is a main source of income in for people who live in regions where it grows wild. The solution isn’t prohibition, but probably some sort of incentive or compensation to manage the coffee in such a way that forest integrity and species are conserved. One idea being explored is some sort of certification that includes a production ceiling (so that managing for higher yields is not encouraged). The International Standards for Sustainable Wild Collection of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants might be a starting point.\nThere is much more on the coffee forests of Ethiopia at the web site of the Conservation and use of wild populations of Coffee arabica in the montane rainforests of Ethiopia project web site.\nPapers cited and additional resources:\nAerts, R., Hundera, K., Berecha, G., Gijbels, P., Baeten, M., Van Mechelen, M., Hermy, M., Muys, B., and Honnay, O. 2011, in press.

How is coffee grown and produced?\nHow coffee is made step by step?\n- Planting the seeds: A coffee bean is a seed which when dried and roasted, is used to brew coffee.\n- Harvesting the cherries: Depending on the variety, it can take 3 to 4 years for a coffee tree to bear fruit.\n- Processing the cherries: Once the berries have been picked, the processing must take place immediately to prevent the cherries from spoiling.\n- Drying the beans: Dried beans (aka parchment coffee) are warehoused and ready to export.\n- Milling the beans: Before the coffee can be exported however, it first must be hulled, polished, graded, and then sorted.\n- Exporting the beans: The milled beans (aka green coffee) are then loaded and distributed.\n- Tasting the coffee: Coffee is repeatedly tried and tested for quality purposes by those who (arguably) have the best job in the world: coffee tasting.\n- Roasting the coffee: The roasting process turns green coffee into delicious brown beans.\n- Grinding the coffee: Next, the coffee beans are ground into a fine powder ready for brewing.\n- Brewing the coffee: The coffee grounds are then boiled and brewed away, ready for consumption.\n- VOILA: You sit down with a delicious cup of joe!\nHow is coffee grown and produced?\nCoffee production is quite simply the industrial process of converting the raw fruits of the coffee plant/tree into the finished coffee. It goes through a long and rigorous process, including extensive testing and quality control, in order to produce the most delicious coffee that graces your cups of a morning.\nWhere is coffee produced?\nHere is a list of the top 10 coffee producing countries:\n- Brazil: 2,595,000 Metric Ton (5,714,381,000 Pounds)\n- Vietnam: 1,650,000 Metric Tons (3,637,627,000 Pounds)\n- Colombia: 810,000 Metric Tons (1,785,744,000 Pounds)\n- Indonesia: 660,000 Metric Tons (1,455,050,000 Pounds)\n- Ethiopia: 384,000 Metric Tons (846,575,000 Pounds)\n- Honduras: 348,000 Metric Tons (767,208,000 Pounds)\n- India: 348,000 Metric Tons (767,208,000 Pounds)\n- Uganda: 288,000 Metric Tons (634,931,000 Pounds)\n- Mexico: 234,000 Metric Tons (515,881,000 Pounds)\n- Guatemala: 204,000 Metric Tons (449,743,000)\nTo the un-initiated, coffee is coffee. However, as you explore coffee in greater depth, you’ll grow to notice the various nuances and differences between different types of coffee produced in various regions all over the world.\nThailand is another great country that produces a delicious coffee. Whilst the Kingdom of Thailand only exports about 7% of the coffee that is produced there, it doesn’t change the fact that their Santi Panich brand is among the most delectable in the world. In fact, Santi Panich Coffee and Roasters and becoming increasingly popular among the budding coffee enthusiasts and come highly recommended!\nCan I grow coffee at home?\nCoffee plants can indeed be grown at home, both indoors and outdoors. This gives you plenty of options whether you live in a small apartment with only a balcony, or a large property with a vast backyard. In any case, the fact is that you can grow coffee for your own consumption at home. The question is whether or not you can be bothered with the process.\nAgain, it can take up to 4 years before a freshly planted coffee tree will start bearing fruit. However, when that day comes, you can enjoy a brew of your very own making, which would be an exciting experience.\nJust make sure you do plenty of research, find the best seedlings, and invest in all of the relevant equipment required for the processing of coffee cherries in order to get the best possible product at the end of your hard work.\nAll in all, the process of making coffee is surprisingly interesting. Few people who drink coffee are aware that the beans go through a lengthy process and are grown as cherries from trees! In any case, we hope you have found this article interesting and wish you the best of luck should you decide to try to coffee growing and roasting process by yourself at home.']	['<urn:uuid:7bc533cd-c702-4921-82b1-df4d73596809>', '<urn:uuid:c432bcdb-4294-4ed8-b469-8493bd6f2b0a>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	40	54	1961

81	what platelet levels normal versus dangerous and how to process platelet samples for testing	Normal platelet levels should be above 150,000, and most people don't experience problems if levels are above 100,000. However, levels below 100,000 require more medical attention. For proper platelet testing, samples must be processed to create platelet-poor plasma (PPP) with a platelet count less than 10,000/mm3. This requires centrifuging blue top tubes at 1500 rpm for 15 minutes, then removing the top 2/3 of plasma to a plastic tube, centrifuging again and removing the top 3/4 of plasma to a second tube. This processing is essential because platelets can affect test results by releasing platelet factor 4 and phospholipids.

Some occur almost immediately, such as platelet activation and the initiation of the clotting mechanism dependent on surface contact.\n5 Sample Collection Anticoagulant of choice 3.8% or 3.2% Sodium Citrate 3.2 % Preferred as the standard measure due to stability and closeness to the plasma osmolalityAnticoagulant/blood ratio is critical (1:9)Exact amount of blood must be drawn.

oxalate, heparin, and EDTA, are unacceptable.The labile factors (factors V and VIII) are unstable in oxalate, whereas heparin and EDTA directly inhibit the coagulation process and interfere with end-point determinations.Additional benefits of trisodium citrate are that the calcium ion is neutralized more rapidly in citrate, and APTT tests are more sensitive to the presence of heparin.\n7 Sample Collection : Samples with High hematocrits According to the latest CLSI (formerly NCCLS) guideline on coagulation testing, it is important to adjust the sodium citrate volume when a patient’s hematocrit is greater than 55%.Examples of patients who may have elevated hematocrit values are newborns or people with polycythemia vera.NCCLS* recommends adjusting anticoagulant ratio for patients

assay performed. These can be divided into three principal categories, as described in the following sections.ImmunologicalAssays Using Chromogenic Peptide Substrates (Amidolytic Assays)Coagulation AssaysOther Assays\n20 ImmunologicalInclude immuno-diffusion, immuno-electrophoresis, radioimmunometric assays, latex agglutination tests, and tests using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).Fundamentally, all these tests rely on the recognition of the protein in question by polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies lack specificity but provide relatively high sensitivity, whereas monoclonal antibodies are highly specific but produce relatively low levels of antigen binding.\n22 latex agglutination kit: Latex microparticles are coated with antibodies specific for the antigen to be determined. When the latex suspension is mixed with plasma an antigen–antibody reaction takes place, leading to the agglutination of the latex microparticles.Agglutination leads to an increase in turbidity of the reaction medium, and this increase in turbidity is measured photometrically as an increase in absorbance.Usually the wavelength used for latex assays is 405 nm, although for some assays a wavelength of 540 or 800 nm is used. This type of assay is referred to as immuno- turbidimetric.\n23 Notes:Do not freeze latex particles because this will lead to irreversible clumping.An occasional problem with latex agglutination assays is interference from rheumatoid factor or paraproteins. These may cause agglutination and overestimation of the protein under assay.\n24 Chromogenic AssayChromogenic, or amidolytic, methodology is based on the use of a specific color-producing substance known as a chromophore.the chromophore normally used in the coagulation laboratory is para-nitroaniline (pNA), which has an optical absorbance peak at 405 nm on a spectrophotometer.\n25 Coagulation AssaysCoagulation assays are functional bioassays and rely on comparison with a control or standard preparation with a known level of activity.In the one-stage system optimal amounts of all the clotting factors are present except the one to be determined, which should be as near to nil as possible.The best one-stage system is provided by a substrate plasma obtained either from a patient with severe congenital deficiency or artificially depleted by immuno-adsorption.\n26 Coagulation AssaysCoagulation techniques are also used in mixing tests to identify a missing factor in an emergency or to identify and estimate quantitatively an inhibitor or anticoagulant.The advantage of this type of assay is that it most closely approximates the activity in vivo of the factor in question. However, they can be technically more difficult to perform than the other types described earlier.Mixing studies are tests performed on blood plasma used to distinguish factor deficiencies from factor inhibitors, such as lupus anticoagulant, or specific factor inhibitors, such as antibodies directed against factor VIII. Mixing studies take advantage of the fact that factor levels that are 50 percent of normal should give a normal Prothrombin time (PT) or Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) result.If the problem is a simple factor deficiency, mixing the patient plasma 1:1 with plasma that contains 100% of the normal factor level results in a level ≥50% in the mixture (say the patient has an activity of 0%; the average of 100% + 0% = 50%). The PT or PTT will be normal (the mixing study shows correction). However, if there is an inhibitor that inactivates the added clotting factor, the resulting factor level will be low and the clotting test will be prolonged (fails to correct). Therefore, correction with mixing indicates factor deficiency; failure to correct indicates an inhibitor.\n27 Other AssaysUsing snake venoms (The Taipan venom time employs a reagent isolated from the venom of the Taipan snake (Oxyuranus scutellatus) that directly activates prothrombin in the presence of phospholipid and calcium.)Aassay of ristocetin cofactor (used to diagnose von Willebrand disease )The clot solubility test for factor XIII.DNA analysis is becoming more useful and more prevalent in coagulation. However, this requires entirely different equipment and techniques']"	['<urn:uuid:6dcab2bc-014b-4c8f-922c-48d85b7c6a6f>', '<urn:uuid:e32c9b96-6266-468d-9298-7528dda4261e>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	14	99	2433
82	when did james cotton die	James Cotton died on Thursday at St. David's Medical Center in Austin, Texas at age 81. The cause of death was pneumonia.	['Alligator Records is reporting that world-renowned blues harmonica master James Cotton died Thursday. He was 81.\nThe legendary label cited pneumonia as the cause of death. Mr. Cotton died at St. David’s Medical Center in Austin, Texas.\nAccording to the story:\n“His overwhelmingly powerful harmonica playing was one of the iconic sounds of the blues. He toured worldwide for over 60 years. James Henry Cotton, known as “Mr. Superharp,” recorded nearly 30 solo albums, winning one Grammy Award, six Living Blues Awards and 10 Blues Music Awards. He was inducted into the Blues Hall Of Fame in 2006. The New York Daily News called him, “The greatest blues harmonica player of all time.” NPR Weekend Edition said, “Conjure up a list of all-time great blues harmonica players, and high up on it you’ll see the name James Cotton.”\nCotton signed with Alligator Records in 1984, releasing two solo albums and the famed “Harp Attack!” with Junior Wells, Carey Bell and Billy Branch. He won a Grammy Award in 1996 for his Verve album, “Deep In The Blues” and recorded four albums for Telarc Records before returning to Alligator in 2010. His most recent recording was 2013’s Grammy-nominated “Cotton Mouth Man.\nIn June 2010, Cotton was honored by New York’s Lincoln Center, where Hubert Sumlin, Pinetop Perkins, Taj Mahal, Shemekia Copeland and others paid tribute to him in an all-star concert. The Festival International de Jazz de Montréal honored Cotton with their 2015 B.B. King Award for his seven decades of contributions to the blues.”\nIn a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Cotton talked about retirement. “You work so hard to get it that once you get it, you don’t want to let it go, because at that point, it’s yours,” he said. “You paid the price for it, and it’s yours. You didn’t give it up when you didn’t have a place to sleep tonight. It’s because you want to be there and you enjoy yourself.”\nCotton’s recording career began in the 1950s on the Sun Records label, beginning with the singles “Straighten Up Baby”and “Cotton Crop Blues.” In 1966, he formed The James Cotton Blues Band, but his seven-decade career included working with some of the blues greatest artists, including Sonny Boy Williamson, Howlin’ Wolf, Muddy Waters, the Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Keith Richards, B.B. King, Santana, Joe Bonamassa, Junior Wells and Billy Branch, among others.\nAs a boy in Tunica, Mississippi, Cotton heard his mother make the harmonica sound like a freight train or a hen squawk, and he discovered that he could play practically anything he heard on the instrument.\nAcross the river in West Helena, Arkansas, Sonny Boy Williamson had a radio show, “Sonny Boy’s Corn Meal and King Biscuits Show,” where he played the blues on his harmonica every day.\nIn 1954, Muddy Waters recruited the 18-year-old Cotton to come North with him. Muddy’s longtime harp player, “Little Walter” Jacobs, was becoming a recording star in his own right, and Muddy needed a touring musician who could play like Little Walter. As much as Cotton had already learned about the blues harp, he had to start learning all over again.\nCotton also played the Chicago Blues Festival over the years and was slated to play this year’s fest, the first in Millennium Park, on June 9.\nCotton is survived by his wife, Jacklyn Hairston Cotton; daughters Teresa Hampton of Seattle, Washington; Marshall Ann Cotton, of downstate Peoria; and son James Patrick Cotton of Chicag, as well as numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\nContributing: Sam Charles']	['<urn:uuid:e1aec72f-f580-4945-b067-ef09b07b9983>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	5	22	589
83	environmental benefits comparison hitachi intercity trains siemens mireo plus emission reduction	Both train systems offer significant environmental benefits. The Hitachi intercity trains reduce CO2 emissions by around two-thirds across the franchise, with particulate matter emissions reduced by more than 90% and NOx emissions reduced by more than 60% compared to current engines. The Siemens Mireo Plus platform achieves 100% emission-free operation when powered by renewable energy sources and consumes up to 25% less energy than conventional equivalents through lightweight construction and intelligent energy management.	"[""Press release -\nFirst Trenitalia chooses Hitachi Rail to build new intercity trains for Avanti West Coast\n- New trains improve customer experience and capacity with more seats\n- First-Trenitalia chooses British-based train manufacturer in contract worth more than £350m including maintenance services, with trains financed by Rock Rail West Coast\n- Cleaner, greener modern trains with two-thirds reduction in carbon emissions overall\nFirst Trenitalia, whose new Avanti West Coast rail service starts on Sunday 8th December 2019, has today awarded a contract worth more than £350m to Hitachi Rail to provide and maintain 23 new intercity trains (135 carriages), to be built at its County Durham factory.\nBringing additional capacity to services along the West Coast Main Line and in North Wales, these new, state of the art intercity trains will start operating in 2022. The trains will be a mix of ten seven-carriage electric trains and 13 five-carriage bi-mode trains, with the ability to switch seamlessly between electric and diesel power. The electric trains will operate between London, the West Midlands and Liverpool while the bi-mode version will serve the London to North Wales route. They will be part of the fleet operated by the new intercity operator, to be known as Avanti West Coast, that begins operation on Sunday 8 December.\nThese are fast-accelerating 125mph trains which draw from their Japanese bullet train heritage. As a result of their modern design, passengers will enjoy a quieter journey compared to the diesel-only trains they will replace. The new trains will have better and more reliable free Wi-Fi, at-seat wireless inductive charging for electronic devices, plug sockets and USB slots; a brand-new catering offer and a real-time passenger information system that can advise customers of connecting rail services.\nThere are 453 seats on a 7-car service and 301 seats on a 5-car service increasing capacity compared to the Class 221 Voyager trains they replace (which have 258 seats). The seven-carriage version of the electric trains will have similar numbers of seats to a nine-carriage Pendolino, owing to the longer 26 metre carriages of the Hitachi trains.\nThe bi-mode trains will run for most of the journey using electric power only, switching to diesel power for those parts of the network that are not electrified – for example, the North Wales Coast Line to/from Holyhead.\nDue to the high environmental standards of their diesel engines, the new trains are cleaner and more efficient than the trains they are replacing. Particulate matter emissions are reduced by more than 90% and NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions are reduced by more than 60% compared to the engines currently in service. The introduction of these new trains will help to support the UK’s drive for a cleaner, greener environment. Bi-mode technology is an important first step in de-carbonising rail and achieving ‘no net emissions’.\nBy running on electric rather than diesel power for the vast majority of the route is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by around two-thirds across the franchise. Passengers using locations such as Birmingham New Street and Glasgow Central will benefit from cleaner air within the station due to fewer diesel train services.\nThe new trains will be built at Hitachi’s factory at Newton Aycliffe in north-east England, supporting thousands of jobs across the country. Hitachi Rail prioritises UK suppliers whenever possible, including with servicing and maintenance operations. This approach has resulted in Hitachi Rail spending more than £1.6 billion with UK suppliers since 2013. To date, wheelsets have come from Manchester; windows from Newcastle, door handles from Leeds, and overhead panels from County Durham, amongst many other parts made in Britain.\nFirstGroup is introducing new rolling stock to improve our customers’ journeys across all its train companies – Great Western Railway, Hull Trains, South Western Railway and TransPennine Express. Together with today’s announcement, this represents an investment of £1.8bn in more than 1,000 vehicles.

However, electrification isn’t always viable for regional or local routes, and Siemens has developed a new platform which allows operators to fully decarbonise these operations efficiently and economically – Mireo Plus.\nIn Germany, only around 50% of routes are electrified. Drawing on its many decades of experience in building electric trains (Siemens was the most important pioneer of them in the 20th century), it has designed Mireo Plus from the ground up to offer flexibility, range and efficiency.\nThe starting point for Mireo Plus was to offer a design with a modular and scalable traction system integrating fuel cells and batteries to cover the full range of regional and local duties. By using lightweight construction, energy efficient components and intelligent onboard energy management, Mireo Plus consumes up to 25% less energy than its conventional Mireo equivalents. The flexibility is such that a fully hydrogen powered train can be designed for longer distance unelectrified routes, as well as a battery-electric train for those with partial electrification, and any combination in between. Of course, a prerequisite for emissions-free transport is the supply of electricity or hydrogen from renewable energy sources, but assuming this is met, Mireo Plus is 100% emission free.\nTo achieve this, Siemens has developed a completely new system architecture using next-generation fuel cells and high-performance batteries which offer lower energy consumption, high drive power and thus shorter journeys than diesel equivalents. Mireo Plus offers a complete ‘win’ for regional and local rail operators.\nIn battery-electric form, Mireo Plus uses underfloor or roof-mounted batteries to create the Mireo Plus B hybrid vehicle, which draws power from overhead sources and when these are not available uses its battery. A two-car unit has a range of up to 80km and a three-car unit 120km – which in many cases is enough to bridge the gap between electrified sections. The high-performance battery system which includes innovative auxiliary systems such as battery cooling and silicon carbide converter, was bench-tested on a full-scale test bench at RWTH and the Cityjet eco in Austria, with test operation on a real route to validate the system.\nFor routes which require longer self-propulsion, the Mireo Plus H hydrogen train was created, incorporating a fuel cell system as well as a battery. In this train, the battery acts as a dynamic ‘power bank’ to compensate for high dynamic loads such as accelerating from a station and to recuperate the braking energy. A two-coach train has a range of up to 800km and a three-coach train up to 1,000km – enough to cover even the longest regional routes in Europe.\nThe drive of the Mireo Plus H uses two low temperature fuel cells, created in partnership with Ballard Power Systems of Vancouver, Canada. This has been developed specifically for rail applications and offers twice the power density and up to four times the service life compared with fuel cell systems designed for the automotive industry or buses.\nBecause hydrogen has a lower power density than diesel, Siemens has developed special pressure vessels which make optimum use of the train’s clearance profile. They are fully wrapped and made of carbon fibre with non-metallic liners, offering high stiffness and low dead weight, which in turn allow a higher operating pressure than comparable steel containers.\nHigh refuelling speeds are possible, with the tanks filled within aa short time – about the same as a diesel vehicle of comparable range. During the refuelling process, parameters such as temperature and pressure are continuously monitored by each tank and communicated to the filling station to determine the amount of hydrogen required. The fuel cell system has also been tested on RWTH Aachen’s full-scale test bench.\nFor the past two decades, train operators have used driver advisory systems to optimise energy consumption (again, Siemens was a pioneer and systems are in operation in countries such as the United Kingdom), and Mireo Plus takes this a step further. Location recognition means predictive driving is possible, with the train able to recognise performance requirements such as higher acceleration and also likely energy return during braking. This system also includes auxiliary systems such as climate control to optimise energy consumption of all of the train’s systems. The next generation of Driver Advisory System creates recommendations for the train’s driver based on algorithms of optimal control and predictive control. Such is the combined capability of all of these innovations that a fuel cell train is remarkably energy efficient.\nWith strict targets set for decarbonising transport, Mireo Plus offers regional and local train operators a fully flexible train which is completely emission free. It is amongst the most important developments in more than two centuries of railway innovation – and is set to enable full e-mobility - whether battery-electric or fuel cell-electric, the latter drawing on Siemens’ comprehensive H2 supply chain ability.']"	['<urn:uuid:7a96e31a-692b-49bc-a85d-476e8888756c>', '<urn:uuid:689ca79f-6866-4a96-bf2c-003d40546c70>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	11	73	2795
84	what material built boats before plastic	Before fiberglass, boats were constructed from bark, wood, animal skin, iron, or steel. Today, larger ships are still constructed from aluminum or steel, while smaller recreational boats are made from fiberglass.	['Fiberglass is currently the most common material used to craft small recreational boats and other watercraft.\nChances are, if you have purchased a recreational boat, it is made of fiberglass, also known as Glass Reinforced Plastic or GRP.\nIn this article, we will look at how long fiberglass boats last and the factors that impact fiberglass boats’ durability.\nHow Long Do Fiberglass Boats Typically last?\nFiberglass boats can be sound and seaworthy for up to fifty years or more. Fiberglass is very durable, and with proper maintenance and care, fiberglass boats can last for many decades.\nFiberglass itself will not break down but instead will break down due to outside factors.\nSome factors that will affect break down are:\n- Exposure to UV rays\n- Fatigue from movement\n- Water saturation\n- Salt from seawater.\nToo much UV rays can cause the fiberglass to become more brittle. Because most boating happens during sunny weather conditions, this is a highly probable issue.\nWater saturation can cause a breakdown between the fiberglass and the resin. This is most often caused by acid formation with the water and products hidden in the fiberglass.\nSalt from saltwater can move between the fiberglass and become deposited in the fiberglass’s larger porous areas. This causes the salt to add to the pressure on the fiberglass.\nOne final issue could be poor production at the beginning of the boat’s life. This is hard to combat, and you will want to ensure you purchase a high-quality boat.\nOne of the biggest issues you will encounter with your fiberglass boat is the other components. Your fiberglass is much more likely to last than your other structural, engine, and electrical components.\n3 Factors That Impact The Durability Of Fiberglass Boats\nSo, what if you already have a fiberglass boat?\nYou’re probably thinking: what should I look out for?\nThe main things you want to look for in your fiberglass are:\n- Small cracks\n- Water damage\n1) Small Cracks\nTo find aging damage, you will want to look for microscopic cracks.\nAt first, they might seem minor, almost hairline. These cracks should not be ignored as they can get bigger with time—the bigger the cracks, the more pressure is applied to the fiberglass’s structure and integrity.\nThis break in the integrity of the fiberglass can further compromise the structure of your vessel. For this reason, fiberglass boat owners need to monitor their boats for cracks constantly.\nWhen cracks are found, they need to be dealt with and filled in.\nFiberglass can also experience fatigue.\nVibration and impact on the fiberglass can cause stress and fatigue. Repetitive waves, engine vibrations, and other activities can cause strain on the fiberglass.\nAfter a certain amount of time, fiberglass can also get worn down. Without proper care, the fiberglass can become weak and brittle.\n3) Water Damage\nYou need to ensure your fiberglass is not experiencing water damage.\nWhile the resin itself is waterproof, if water gets in, it can damage the fiberglass. Eventually, after enough water is absorbed, the damage will apply more and more pressure, which can cause wear, blistering, and cracking.\nThe part of the boat that is most susceptible to this damage is the part of the hull that is below the waterline.\nThe last thing to look out for is heat and sun damage.\nWith enough heat and UV rays, the fiberglass in the hull can become rigid and brittle. This can even cause warping.\nOne major issue with a fiberglass hull is that warping or major damage to the fiberglass itself can be challenging and expensive to repair.\nAs previously expressed, if you own an older boat, your main issue is most likely not in the fiberglass. That doesn’t mean that you should not need maintenance and monitor your fiberglass. Vigilance, maintenance, and preventative care are the best way to maintain your fiberglass’s structural integrity.\nHow To Prolong The Life Of Fiberglass Boats\nSome people will try to tell you that your fiberglass “does not need maintenance.”\nThis is not true.\nCompared to other types of boats, especially wooden boats, fiberglass is much less maintenance. This does not mean that there is no maintenance involved, and you must keep up with it.\nMost importantly, when maintaining your boat, you need to protect the bottom constantly exposed to water.\nIf your boat is left in the water for even a few days, you will want to attempt to protect it from algae and other growth. To prevent this, there are certain protectants and bottom paints you can apply.\nYou will want to ensure whatever growth repellent you purchase works for the area and body of water you plan on having your boat in. Before application, you will want to make sure to properly sand or otherwise prepare your fiberglass.\nThe area between the railing and the waterline needs to have regular maintenance done because this part of your boat takes on most of the waves, spray, and sun. Without proper care, this area will fade, oxidize, and get hazy. To combat this wear, you need to make sure you keep up the wax on your boat.\nIf waxing becomes a hassle, you can get a buffer. This will enhance the process and make it easier to complete.\nThe deck of a boat also sees a lot of wear. This comes from sun, dirt, grime, spills, and other general wear and tear. The main way to combat this is regular washings and a good stiff brush.\nBe sure never to wash a “non-slip” area with wax. This is highly important on the deck where people walk. Safety should always be your priority.\nBesides this maintenance, you will want to maintain cleanliness on all other aspects of your boat. This will help to keep the condition pristine and avoid aging and wear.\nFinally, no matter what type of boat you own, you will want to maintain the engine properly. You want to make sure you maintain your boat engine constantly.\nThis is true if you use your fiberglass boat every day or only occasionally. If you only use your boat occasionally, you will still want to maintain the engine as if you use it regularly.\nMaintaining your boat engine is like maintaining your vehicle engine. You will want to make sure it is properly oiled fueled, and the boat battery is charged.\nLike a car, keeping a boat’s radio or lights on for a long time can drain a battery and even kill it.\nHow To Spot Aging Signs On Used Fiberglass Boats\nWhen buying an old fiberglass boat, especially a “fixer-upper,” there are some things to keep in mind.\nUnlike wooden trim items, fiberglass boat structural issues are more difficult to repair or restore.\nRestoring a fiberglass hull can be almost impossible, depending on the wear accrued. Because these hulls are made all at once, patching them is your only option if the problem is that simple.\nWooden boats are more maintenance and more difficult to maintain, but they do allow for the replacement of parts by competent and qualified artisans.\nWhen purchasing a used fiberglass boat, you will want to look out for the signs listed above. You will need to know if you are looking at any structural issues.\nMake sure to check for cracks, fading, wear, growth, or damage. Look at the high-stress areas for cracks, wear down, or other signs of damage.\nThe pressure created in the fiberglass can cause issues for you later.\nAs well as fiberglass wear, you will want to make sure that your hull is not chipped, blistered, or starting to flex excessively.\nStress on a fiberglass hull can cause flexing as degradation occurs. This can cause major cracks and severe hull issues.\nIssues found with a boat can be fixed. Based on the extremity of the issue and your experience, you should look for a professional opinion on maintenance and damage restoration. This is important before you buy. Taking on too many issues may quickly make your new boat purchase a headache you never wanted and were not prepared for.\nIf everything is intact with the boat, and you do not see any cracks, warping, mechanical failure, or other issues, it would be safe to purchase the used fiberglass boat.\nIf you keep up with the proper maintenance, a used older fiberglass boat could last you many years to come.\nWhy Do Fiberglass Last So Long?\nFiberglass is a form of plastic that is reinforced using glass fiber. The glass fiber is usually woven into a fabric. This makes the fiberglass superior when it comes to durability.\nFiberglass material is relatively lightweight, extremely durable, and less brittle than standard glass or plastic.\nFiberglass can be easily molded and is often used to make more complex shapes. Standard uses for fiberglass are boats, aircraft, bathtubs, etc.\nFor a boat to be considered a fiberglass boat, the hull, deck, liner, and even large parts of the console are made from fiberglass.\nFiberglass boat construction in a mold first uses a gel coat; fiberglass cloth layers are applied, with resin applied on each layer.\nBefore fiberglass, boats were constructed from bark, wood, animal skin, iron, or steel. Today, larger ships are still constructed from aluminum or steel, while smaller recreational boats are made from fiberglass or GRP.\nFiberglass boat construction was experimented with as early as the late 1930s and is the main manufacturing method.']	['<urn:uuid:e2437e29-1570-448f-98ca-a5b77dbb93e5>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	6	31	1571
85	How did Egypt manage to successfully deal with its slum problems, and what were some of the key programs they implemented to improve housing conditions?	Egypt achieved success in dealing with slums through long-term political commitment and innovative programs. A pioneering initiative began in Hai El Salam, Ismailia in 1978, where the government allowed slum dwellers to upgrade their houses incrementally. In the 2000s, non-governmental organizations introduced valuable programs for on-site redevelopment as an alternative to relocating slum dwellers to remote locations. The government has recently announced 2020 as the target year to end unsafe slums, with NGOs playing an essential role in ensuring the sustainability of development projects. Their approach focused on creating partnerships with local communities and establishing community-based groups for self-monitoring to guarantee the durability of upgrading projects.	"['Urbanization has been a key force of economic development throughout Nigeria and the world. Rural-urban migration provides access to employment and business opportunities, good healthcare, education, communication, transportation, and security. Globally, 55.3% of the world’s 4.2 billion people lived in urban areas in 2018.\nBy 2050, that percentage is projected to reach 68% according to a United Nations report.1 Nigeria’s urban population already makes up over 50% of its +200 million population; it is expected to add 189 million urban dwellers by 2050.\nRural migrants are flocking to urban centres. This is particularly the case in Lagos State, Nigeria’s economic and industrial hub. Its urbanization rate is about 5.8% per annum; it was ranked the 18th largest city in the world in 2018.\nHowever, the urban planning and development policies driving Lagos’s megacity aspirations are disconnected from the livelihood realities of the majority in the state. It is important that Lagos places a higher priority on housing in its overall development plan, as most of its population are poor, rural migrants and slum dwellers.\nLagos State: Case Study\nLagos has grown from a tiny fishing village in the late 15th century to a state of more than 22 million residents today and is the most populous city in Nigeria. It occupies 3,577 km2 making it the smallest state in the country by landmass. 21% of Lagos is wetlands consisting of creeks, lagoons and rivers.\nIts concentration of industry, commerce and administration of capital, labour and technology accounts for over 60% of Nigeria’s activities. It has experienced a much faster growth rate than any other urban centre in the country.\nIn 1985, it was ranked the 31st largest city in the world, with a population of 5.8 million; in 1990, the population increased to 7.7 million, making it the 22nd largest city in the world. The metro area population of Lagos was roughly 13.5 million as of 2018, making it the 18th largest city in the world.\nLagos has been a powerful generator of national economic growth, contributing over 30% of Nigeria’s gross domestic product (GDP). The development goal of the state is to become ‘a model African megacity’ and a global economic and financial hub that is safe, secure, functional, and productive.\nHowever, the urban development policies and regulations driving this megacity aspiration are disconnected from the realities of the majority.\nFor the most part, people in Lagos are poor, rural migrants who live in informal and slum settlements with high infrastructure costs, habitat fragmentation, water and air pollution and reduction in overall quality of life.8 Urbanization tends to increase land values and subsequently rental costs which poor migrants, the majority of Lagos’s population, often cannot afford.\nThese settlements are often targeted for demolition under the cloak of urban development, which in most cases comes with no compensation or alternative living arrangements10, leading to the displacement of the dwellers.\nThere is already a housing deficit of more than 17 million units.11 Meanwhile, Lagos Affordable Public Housing (LAPH), an ongoing private-public partnership, intends to construct 20,000 affordable housing units within five years (2017-2022).\nHowever, the scope of delivery is either not known or masked in a muddle. Given that many of these sub-par residential settlements require significant renewal investment, the shortage of decent affordable housing presents a good opportunity for prospective private sector players to improve the capacity of the construction sector to address these needs.\nThe architectural design should drive affordable solutions and provide economies of scale through which large-scale production could be optimized. In addition, government intervention is needed in Lagos state to provide subsidized credit, cooperative housing and social support programs.\nLessons from Brazil and Egypt\nA close examination of Brazil and Egypt provides important insights about the urban development process and policy with greater emphasis on housing. Both countries have large populations (approximately 211 million in Brazil and 100 million in Egypt in 2019), and both were long classified as “over-urbanized” countries.\nBrazil and Egypt had similar challenges with predominantly informal and slum settlements in the urban cores several decades ago. Nevertheless, the two countries have had success in implementing appropriate urban development frameworks, such as community-based and city-wide upgrading programs, private-public partnerships and an elaborate national housing policy.\nBrazil, for instance, rebuilt its urban governance policy to accommodate the participation of all urban dwellers in decision-making processes, which played a decisive role in affirming the sociopolitical right to adequate housing.\nThe ‘City Statute’, a 2001 federal law that governs urban development, explicitly requires the participation of residents in the urban planning process.\nIn addition, Brazil’s social housing program, Minha Casa, Minha Vida (My House, My Life) launched in 2009, in combination with the Growth Acceleration Program for Slum Upgrading effective from 2007, is a notable example of housing development in the country.\nThese programs primarily target low-income groups and slum dwellers. At the same time, there are curative and preventive measures to develop the prevalent inadequate housing conditions in slums and minimize both the growth of existing ones and the emergence of new ones.\nA robust policy of initial subsidy grants and enhanced housing credits, benefiting from steady economic growth and a well-focused social agenda for Brazil, culminating in the success of these initiatives.\nThe low prevalence of slums in Egypt reflects its long-term political commitment to slum upgrading, slum prevention and housing alternatives for the urban poor.\nThe Egyptian government’s initiative of slum upgrading, which began in Hai El Salam, Ismailia in 1978, is a pioneer in international best practice. The strategy that was used in this context was to allow the slum dwellers to upgrade their houses incrementally.\nIn Lagos state, it is worth exploring this instance of self-redevelopment of a slum with minimal government interference, particularly in view of the limited resources available to the government.\nIn Egypt, non-governmental initiatives for slum upgrading were also implemented in the 2000s through influential non-governmental organizations. They introduced valuable pilots for the on-site redevelopment of homes for the slum dwellers as an alternative to the predominant approach of local governments resettling slum dwellers in new remote locations.\nAs the region became more developed, the initial poor-quality homes were completely replaced by high-quality, well-designed dwellings over time.\nHow Lagos can integrate the complex realities of the majority into its development goal\nInvestment in upgrading programs:\nImplementing citywide, slum-upgrading programs that can improve the housing conditions and the quality of life in existing slums in Lagos is a first and crucial step for the state government to achieve urban modernity.\nJust like Egypt, the Lagos state government should allow self-redevelopment of slums with financial support where needed and in so doing, offer the slum dwellers the prospect of contributing a significant share of domestic capital formation through self-built housing.\nComprehensive development plans:\nSecondly, urban development plans need to be modified around citizen participation, which could be adopted by the local government councils. The transparency in the planning process is central to promoting urban development in Lagos.\nFor instance, in approaching affordable housing delivery in a large city like Lagos, multiple housing delivery outlets are required. This will be difficult to implement without the participation of urban dwellers.\nEveryone in urban centres is affected by the problem of urban slum growth. It, therefore, should be the responsibility of both the public and private sectors to create innovative methods, like mixed-use and low-income housing, for decent affordable homes for the residents of the state, especially those within the low-income bracket.\nAlso, policies enabling investment in quality housing, such as a real estate finance support scheme, should be considered by the state government in order to prevent the rise in slums and informal settlements in the future.\nUrban areas are considered to have multifaceted roles in nations. They are at the centre of a nation’s technical advancement and economic growth as seen in Lagos state. That is why populations will continue to move to urban settings. Thus, the Lagos state government and development agencies should focus on adapting to the trend of urbanization.', ""AN ANALYTICAL STUDY OF THE ROLE OF NGOs IN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT OF SLUMS IN EGYPT (CASE STUDY OF ZEINHUM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT)\nKeywords:NGOs, Urban Development, Slum\nThis paper looks at the different roles of NGO's in the urban development of slum areas. Due to the budget deficit by different countries, and the lack of private sector investment in the development of slums, the need has emerged for the participation of other parties in the urban development processes. In Egypt, the State has announced the year 2020, as the end of the unsafe slums; in fact, the role of NGOs is essential to grantee the sustainability of the development and renewal projects that took place during the last years.\nThe literature review investigated the NGOs' participation in various roles of the urban development in slums, followed by a discussion of lessons learned from international case studies that lead to NGOs active participation. The theoretical part of this paper, has applied inductive and analytical methods. Following the literature review, it discusses the definition of slums and informal areas internationally and nationally. In Egypt, The Informal Settlements Development Fund (ISDF) has classified the informal areas into unplanned and unsafe areas and has classified the unsafe areas into four degrees according to severity. The paper also examines the concept of urban development of the human settlements that suffer from social, economic, and urban problems. The paper also presents the historical background of the rise of NGOs role in the urban development in Egypt. The practical study relied on the case study of Zeinhum housing development project and evaluate its current situation in 2020. This project is one of the first Egyptian models in which an NGO (Egyptian red crescent) was a principal partner in the development project. In the research, a sample of the area residents was interviewed to identify the most critical problems in 2020. Moreover, the research has identified the current situation through several visits to the project during February and March of 2020.\nThe research found that NGOs' role is not a sole role; there is a need for a sustainable partnership with the local community, where NGOs are a partner and not the principal actor.

86	What are the key steps involved in creating and evaluating a structured flowchart for comparing different business options?	Decision trees are flowchart graphs or diagrams that help explore decision alternatives and their outcomes. The process starts by drawing a square box representing the initial decision, either at the top or left side of the page. From there, lines are drawn to represent each option. At the end of each line, circles are drawn for uncertain results, or boxes for new decisions that need to be made. This process continues until all possible outcomes and decisions are mapped. To evaluate the tree, decision makers must assign values to possible outcomes and estimate probabilities for each outcome occurring. These numbers are then used to calculate which option is best.	"['Decision trees are flowchart graphs or diagrams that help explore all of the decision alternatives and their possible outcomes.\nWhen trying to make an important decision, it is critical business leaders examine all of their options carefully. One tool they can use to do so is a decision tree. Decision trees are flowchart graphs or diagrams that help explore all of the decision alternatives and their possible outcomes.\nEach ""branch"" of the tree represents one of the possible options that are available when making a decision. The branches can be extended when one alternative outcome leads to another decision that must be made. Added into each branch are the costs associated with each choice and the probability each is likely to occur. With these numbers, leaders can calculate the value of each set of branches to determine the best choice.\n""The simplest definition of a decision tree is that it is an analysis diagram, which can help aid decision makers, when deciding between different options, by projecting possible outcomes,"" according to the Decision Tree Model blog. ""The decision tree, gives the decision maker an overview of the multiple stages that will follow each possible decision.""\nThe Decision Tree Model blog highlights several benefits to using this technique, including that decision trees are easy to understand and interpret, small details that may have been missed are taken into consideration and that it helps save time because once the decision is laid out, the path to success is easy to follow.\nSince there are a lot of calculations involved in creating decision trees, many businesses use dedicated decision tree software to help them with the process. Decision tree software helps businesses draw out their trees, assigns value and probabilities to each branch and analyzes each option.\nDecision tree software, both free and paid for versions, is available from a variety of vendors, including IBM, TreeAge, SmartDraw, Palisade, Angoss and Edraw.\nDrawing a decision tree\nThe Mind Tools website believes decision trees are a useful technique because they help business leaders form a balanced picture of the risks and rewards associated with each possible course of action.\nWhen drawing a decision tree, leaders should start with a square box, which represents the decision that needs to be made, either at the top of left hand side of a page. From that box, each option should be drawn out from there, either down if starting at the top of the page or to the right, if starting on the left hand side. On each line, write what the option is.\nAccording to Mind Tools, leaders should then consider the results at the end of each line. If the result of taking the option is uncertain, they should draw a circle, if the result is another decision that needs to be made, a small box should be drawn.\n""Starting from the new decision squares on your diagram, draw out lines representing the options that you could select,"" Mind Tools writes on its website. ""From the circles draw lines representing possible outcomes.""\nDecision makers should continue this process until they have drawn as many of the possible outcomes and decisions they believe can come from the original decision that must be made.\nOnce the tree is drawn, decision makers must analyze it to determine what each branch and outcome means. Leaders should assign values to the possible outcomes as well as estimate the probability of each outcome occurring. With those numbers, they can then calculate which option is best.\nDecision tree examples\nTo better understand how decision trees work, it is best to consider some examples. One example MasterClassManagement.com provides its students is on a company trying to decide whether or not to invest in an online training program.\nThe main decision to be made, which starts in the first box, is whether or not to spend money on a new training program. From that box, the two options are yes or no, so one branch is drawn from the first box with a ""yes"" on it and another with a ""no"" written on it. Since the outcome from each is still unknown, circles are drawn at the end of each branch\nFrom the yes branch, there are then two options for different training programs, system 1 and system 2. So, from the circle at the end of the yes branch, two more branches are drawn: one for system one and the other for system two. From there, branches are drawn out of for how the system will be paid for, either in full or monthly installments.\nOn the ""no"" side of the tree, branches are drawn to continue using the existing training method or hire live training experts. Since the existing plan is already in place, no more branches are drawn out from that branch. From the hiring live trainers branch, two more branches are drawn for those to be either field technicians or sales engineers.\nOnce the tree is complete, the costs and probabilities are assigned to each branch in order to calculate and evaluate each option.\nTo help further illustrate how decisions tree work, other examples can be found online by visiting:\n- Mind Tools\n- Logan Mediation\n- Management and Accounting Web\n- MIT Sloan Management Review\nDecision tree templates\nFor those businesses interested in trying to work through the decision tree technique on their own, without the help of dedicated software, free templates can be found online at:']"	['<urn:uuid:d4bae6d5-7eab-4958-80bd-64f2868d3a6e>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	18	109	907
87	I'm learning Spanish and noticed 'g' sounds different in some words - can you explain how the pronunciation changes depending on what letter comes after it and how it relates to spelling rules in English?	In Spanish, 'g' has two different pronunciations: it's pronounced as [x] or [h] when followed by 'e', but as [g] or [ɣ] in other cases. This is similar to how in English, the letter 'g' can have a soft or hard sound - a soft 'g' typically occurs before 'i' or 'e', while a hard 'g' usually appears before consonants or the vowels 'a', 'o', or 'u'.	"[""Tengwar for Latin American Spanish\nThis is a method of writing Latin American Spanish using Tolkien's Tengwar\nalphabet devised by Exelsus. He has based his method strictly on Quenya from\nthe third age, and believes it keeps a good balance between orthography and\npronunciation and a good compatibility with the original Quenya. With few modifications\nit can also be a good method for European Spanish.\n- Type of writing system: vocalised abjad\n- Direction of writing: left to right in horizontal lines\n- Vowels are written with diacritics over the consonants that precede them,\nor over a vowel carrier if they are at the beginning of a word or on their own.\n- 1) c: 'c' is a redundant consonant, when it preceds an a,o and u is pronounced as [k], when it\npreceds e and i is pronounced as [s]. As letter 'k' is rarely used in spanish it can share the same tengwa for the [k]\nsound. For the [s] sound the a the 'Súlë' tengwa is used instead of the 'Silmë' to differentiate.\n- 2) qu: In spanish, 'q' is always followed by an 'u', and in that case the 'u' is silent so is grouped\nin the same tengwa.\n- 3) b/v: 'b' is pronounced as [ß], and ironically 'v' can be either [b] or [ß], and very seldom [v] in day to day use. In\norder to preserve ortography those where assigned to different tengwas, even when 'b' is less comon than 'v'.\n- 4) y: 'y' can be a consonant or a vowel. In case is a vowel in need for a carrier, the silent 'Anna' tengwa is used instead\nthe short carrier used for the other vowels\n- 5) g: 'g' is pronounced as a [x] or [h] when it preceeds vowel e, else is pronounced as [g] or [?]. As the[x/h] sound\ncoincide with the letter 'j' and both are common it was better to keep them in separate tengwas. When 'gu' souds like [gu:] tough, the 'u'\nhas to be represented appart\n- 6) r: In Quenya when an 'r' preceds a consonant, the 'Órë' tengwa is used (n shaped). When it preceds a vowel the 'Rómen'\ntengwa is use (y shaped). The 'rr' can be represented by adding a bar under the 'Rómen' tengwa so it is doubled.\n- 7) w: The 'w' is almost never used in spanish, only in some names, and translated words.\n- 8) l: 'l' represents an [l], and 'll' represents an [j/d?], and this can be done by placing a bar under this tengwa\nso it is doubled.\n- 9) s: This tengwa can be represented in two ways, the downward form is tipically used (and recomended) when it contains a\ntetha, although is not necesary. If this tengwa is the last in a word it can be represented as a curl\nattached to the previous letter, but this is not mandatory.\n- 10) z: This consonant has the same sound as 's'. In order to preserve ortography, another tengwa was used. According\nto Tolkien the 'Ázë' tegwa used to sound as a [?] but in the third age it changed to [ss] which fits this purpouse. As in the previous\nnote, it can be represented in two ways.\n- 11) h: In spanish the 'h' is silent, and is kept only for ortography. The 'Halla' tengwa was used because it lost its meaning\nin the third age when the 'Hyarmen' took it's sound ([h]).\n- 12) x: The 'x' letter souds as [ks]. In order to keep things simple Tolkien attached an s curl to the 'k' tengwa to make the 'x' sound.\nThis is the only case in tengwar when an s curl is allowed in a possition different from the end of the word.\n- 13) Accents can be represented either with a long carrier, or doubling the theta above the consonant. Double vowels can also be\nrepresented by doubling the theta above the consonant.\n- 14) 'a' theta is the only vowel that can't be doubled because it takes too much room. An 'aa' shoud use a carrier.\nTodos los seres humanos nacen libres e iguales en dignidad y derechos\ny, dotados como están de razón y conciencia, deben comportarse\nfraternalmente los unos con los otros.\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

88	How deep can a fish finder see underwater if it has 100 watts of power and uses different frequencies?	At 50 kHz frequency, a 100-watt fish finder can show readings up to 400 feet deep. At 200 kHz frequency, the same 100-watt fish finder can show readings up to 100 feet deep.	['Sometimes it’s so easy to get lost in transducers, transom mounts, flashers, echoes, and sonar, that we forget what the most important decision is when it comes to choosing a fish finder: WILL THIS HELP ME CATCH THE MOST FISH!\nThat’s why we have put together this guide to help you make the best decision possible when it comes to fish finders!\n(This guide is aimed more at a technical level – for a simplified version of this same guide, check out The Casual Angler’s Guide To Fish Finders. You can also find out which fish finder is best for the money.\nFish finders have 8 main features you want to look for when buying:\nFrequencies – Dual, Single, & Multiple\nMany dual frequency transducers will come with both 20 and 60 degree cones.Frequencies also are a big factor in transducers. Most transducers will come with either 50, 83, 192 or 200 kHz frequencies, all in direct relation to the cone angle.\nHigher frequencies, like 192 and 200 kHz work best in shallower water, while the low 50 kHz transducers work best for use in deep water, like for commercial usage and professionals.\nRemember – the higher the frequency, the more detail shows up on your screen – this is because there are that many more sonar waves being sent out and received by the transducer, so if you generally fish shallow waters, this is the way to go. Some fish finders are even capable of a whopping 400+ kHz and multiple frequencies- which will show incredibly detailed images and allow you to switch between them for broader, more general views, and narrower, more detailed views.\nA reading at 50kHz. Notice how the water bed is fuzzy.\nThe same area at 200kHz – notice how much sharper the bottom is – you can even make out some objects on the water bed that seem like plants or small fish.\nPower is a very crucial factor to consider before you make your purchase. At Fish Finder Source, we’ve sorted our fish finders by nearly every specification so you can find your ideal fit very easily. Power of fish finder units is measured in wattage(W). The greater the wattage, the faster your unit can display readings, and the deeper your readings can be. The lesser the wattage, the slower it will be, and suited to shallower water. This is because your fish finder translates the sonar waves it receives from the transducer. If the overall power is less, the sonar waves will be slower, and ultimately, your reading will be fuzzier. If the overall power is greater, the waves will be much faster and your reading that much clearer.\nOn a final note, the shallower the water you fish in, the less power you will need. If you plan on fishing in deep water like the Great Lakes or salt water bodies, it’s best that you go for the most powerful(in terms of wattage) fish finder that your budget can fit.\nRemember: at 50 kHz, for every 100 watts of power, your finder/transducer can show readings up to 400 feet.\nAt 200 kHz, for every 100 watts of power, your finder/transducer can show readings up to 100 feet.\nMost mid-range finders available are dual-frequency, so you can see readings from both frequencies(usually 50/200 or 85/200) in a split screen fashion.\nHere is a table to give you an idea of how much depth a finder can give you with a given power/frequency combination(these are conservative numbers, the actual depth you will get will be higher):\nThe amount of pixels your fish finder’s screen displays is also an important factor to consider. Think of a pixel as a single dot on your screen. This dot is the smallest amount of detail your screen can show you. All of these dots put together are what you ultimately see. Suppose your screen was 640 x 640 pixels: this means that there are 640 dots in each row going right to left, and 640 dots going in each column up to down.\nThe greater number of pixels there are, the more detail you can see. At minimum, you want a screen of 240(v) x 160(h) pixels. Even then, the image will be pretty blocky. For sharper, crisper images, it’s worth investing in a higher-resolution screen.\nScreen resolution, put together with screen size will be the ultimate factor for how clear your display is. The less expensive units will usually have smaller screens, which make them good choices for backup or secondary fish finders. If you are looking to buy your main unit, you should go for the biggest size your budget will allow. This will give you a clearer picture, since the echoes, data, and numbers will be spread out and easier to see and differentiate.\nColor Vs. B/W Screens\nColor screens are the new standard in electronics. They allow for greater detail, showing up to millions of colors compared to just 265 shades of gray! A color fish finder will make fish and underwater objects truly pop out at you from the screen. This makes it much simpler for you to see what’s going on. Color screens are easier to see in bright light than black and white screens, and if the weather is dark or cloudy, the screens will be outstanding!\nBlack and white models are still available, but unless that is the only feature set that fits in your budget at the time, you would get much more enjoyment from a color screen. If not, then, something is better than nothing, and a black and white screen is a good place to start.\nTransducers are the main units that emit and receive sonar waves. The transducers send the sonar signal into the water, and they bounce off of objects underwater and are picked up again by the transducer. It sends the data it picked up to the main unit, which translates the signal into a picture that we can see and understand.\nMost of the fish finder units we carry come with transom mount transducers out of the box. These are easiest to mount and require very little installation. As your needs(or boat) get more and more advanced, it’s better to go for other types of transducers such as thru-hull.\nCone Angles & Beams\nAn important aspect in choosing a transducer is cone angle. Cone angle refers to how wide of a beam is sent from the bottom of your boat into the water. This of it as an upside-down ice cream cone. At the top, it is very thin and pointy(this is where your transducer is). As it goes down further and further, it gets wider and wider. The wider the degree of the cone, the larger the area is that is being covered. As you go deeper and deeper, the cone gets wider and wider. It’s important to remember though that as the cone angle gets wider, the sensitivity starts to diminish in deeper water.\nTransducer cones are available in ranges of 9-degrees to greater than 60-degrees. Most units are usually between 16 and 20-degrees. A 20-degree cone is an excellent point to start at for anglers that fish in different water depths.\nA really cool feature of transducers is that they have more than one cone transmitting from the same starting point. In other words, the standard transducer will have a single beam. As you get more and more advanced, you can progress to a dual beam, triple beam, side beam and so forth. Each additional beam helps you cover more and more water – which is a great option to have when you are looking around in a lake for fish.\nSome models come standard with these accessories, while others will require an upgrade. Cost will come into effect for these pricier, but significant advantages. Dual beams are far superior to single beams if your main playing area is relatively shallow water, as they will cover more of the water effectively.\nEven though, transducers come in different materials, each of which is suited to a particular type of boat, most of the fish finder units we stock come with plastic transom mount transducers out of the box. This is perfectly fine for most casual/sport fishing, and is compatible with mostly all kinds of boats, except perhaps pontoons, in which you would have to creatively mount the transducer somewhere else.\nWhen using an in-hull or thru-hull transducer, plastic housings are recommended for fiberglass or metal hulls. Stainless Steel housings are recommended for steel or aluminum hulls. Bronze housings are recommended for fiberglass or wood hulls.\nMost fish finders geared towards recreational anglers come with transom mount transducers or trolling motor transducers which will work well with any type of boat. Just remember to install them properly!\nIf you want to go for a through-hull transducer, you have a choice between bronze and plastic.\nFor wooden hulls, it’s better to use bronze rather than plastic because the expansion of wood could do damage to a plastic transducer, and end up causing a leak.\nInstallation of a stainless steel housing in a metal hull requires an insulating fairing.\nIf your boat has a positive ground system, you SHOULD NOT install a transducer with metal housing.\nSome units have extra features such as a speed and distance feature. This is particularly important in trolling, as you can tell the speed you were travelling when a fish strikes. The same goes for drift fishermen, when the fish species you are after is choosy about what speed they will chase a bait on.\nHaving a temperature gauge on board is also very important. This will help you find warmer water, or locating an ideal temperature for what fish you are trying to catch.']	['<urn:uuid:83ae3009-f725-4a6a-8846-c7150867dec6>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	19	33	1628
89	quantum mechanics temperature effects atomic motion	Quantum mechanics affects matter differently at varying temperatures. At normal temperatures, atoms and molecules oscillate like spring-mass systems, but at very low temperatures (approaching 0K at -273.15°C), atomic vibrations become extremely weak and atoms can barely vibrate, which allows quantum phenomena to emerge and be observed more clearly.	"[""Applying Particle Models to Matter\nAs previously noted, we are pursuing two goals in Part 1 of this course. On the one hand, we want to get a solid understanding of energy and how we can use this understanding to get answers and make predictions about interesting phenomena. In Chapter 2 we got through the basics–introducing work and potential energy–and applied these concepts to mostly macroscopic phenomena. Now, in Chapter 3, we turn to the development of particle models of matter. We would like to be able to answer questions such as: Why do things melt and/or vaporize at different temperatures? What determines heat capacities of different substances? What aspects of these thermal properties are common to many substances and which are unique to particular substances? What common things can we say about all kinds of chemical bonding? Some of the most important ideas in our particle models of matter are related to the behavior of the spring-mass motion introduced in Chapter 2. We extend these ideas to understand the motion of atoms using a model that has at its core the idea that atoms and molecules in liquids and solids act like they oscillate exactly the way the spring-mass system oscillates. The relation between force and potential energy allows us to really make sense of the forces that act between atoms and molecules in terms of their equilibrium spacing and to understand the differences between solids, liquids, and gases in a much more fundamental way.\nLooking back at Learning Expectations for you, the learner\nBefore going on, it might be helpful to think again about our expectations for you as a learner. After you have carried out the various activities in discussion/lab, had some intense discussions with your classmates, made several attempts at reading this chapter, and worked the Chapter 3 FNT (for next time) homework assignments, you should have a pretty good understanding of the ideas presented in this chapter. You won't understand many of the ideas presented in this chapter the first time you encounter them. This is normal–don’t give up. Your understanding will increase as you work with the ideas, talk to others about them, carry on a conversation with yourself about them, and apply them to new problems and questions. These Chapters in the course packet complement other course activities, and will be most useful if you refer to them at several stages during your work with this material. Things that make no sense at first will become clearer as you make more connections with other areas of knowledge, such as ideas from chemistry you are familiar with, and as you reorganize some of your thoughts in a little more consistent and logical way.\nThis is perhaps a good time to go back and reread several of the earlier parts of this course packet. You should definitely reread again, perhaps with a slightly different perspective now, the Preface on Meaningful Learning. Also, the Appendix M1: Science and the Place of Models in Science should begin to really make sense to you as we work our way through the three models in this chapter.\nA famous Nobel laureate in physics, Richard P. Feynman, in the first chapter of an introductory physics book he wrote for Cal Tech students back in the late 50’s, claims that the particle model of matter is the most important or powerful model in science. Here is what he said:\n“If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis (or the atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied.” -The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Volume I, page 1-2\nYour job over the next couple of weeks is to use “a little imagination” and apply a “little thinking” to the content of this powerful statement.\nIn This Chapter\nThe heart of the content in Chapter 3 is the development of a full understanding of the details contained in the Feynman quote. You already have a lot of useful ideas about this model. Much of it you have studied in chemistry. Keep consciously trying to integrate this new material with things you already know, like the ideal gas model (PV=nRT). It will take mental effort, but the understanding you gain will help your see chemical and biological concepts in a new light.\nOne of the areas in which our particle model of matter really shines is in explaining the experimentally observed thermal properties of matter, e.g., the values and trends of the specific heats of many substances in the gas, liquid, and solid phases. One of the interesting things about science is that it is in trying to resolve discrepancies that we push ahead and make breakthroughs. One of the discrepancies we will meet as we look at specific heats is that values for gases as well as solids are often lower than we would predict, especially at lower temperatures, but tend to rise to the predicted values as the temperature rises. The changes we need to incorporate in our model are due to the quantum mechanical nature of matter on a microscopic scale. We introduce some quantum ideas here and will continue to return to them throughout the course. Of course, you already know a lot about some of the central notions of quantum mechanics from your study of chemistry. For example, you have encountered the notion of orbital, or quantized energy levels, for the electrons swirling about the nuclei of atoms. When you get to the discussion in this chapter on how quantum mechanics alters things, you should definitely connect it to what you already know about quantization.\nThrough the activities in discussion/lab, those using a sophisticated computer simulation and those involving liquid nitrogen, springs and masses, etc., and through the activities you carry out at home, the particle model of matter described in Chapter 3 will become part of your mental tool kit that you regularly use as you answer scientific questions in the future."", 'When we think about to what extent physics has changed our lives, the first examples that come to our minds are the transistor, that allowed processors, kick-starting the microelectronics industry, giant magnetoresistance for storing huge amounts of data, or the photoelectric effect that allowed solar energy conversion. All these effects appear at room temperature. Actually, this is a prerequisite for real-life applications. However, physicists usually look at phenomenas at much lower temperatures to understand physical properties of materials. Why is it needed? One often questions me why I do experiments at low temperatures, where I could do this at room temperature, where real life applications could exist — and at least, we would be able to survive such temperatures to observe the phenomena. For those interested in the photovoltaic effects, one may not care about what happens at 1K (~-274°C, -458°F), because we wouldn’t survive in such conditions. However, without low temperature physics, we may not have had experimental evidences of quantum physics theory, that is the basis of all the phenomenas I’ve cited so far.\nLet’s first define what temperature is. To be short, we may think about individual atoms in a lattice, vibrating around their sites, occasionally colliding with their neighbours pushing them into activity with their excess of energy. The vibrational (and rotational) energy of the collection of particles is the temperature. It is then easy to understand that at low temperature, the movement of atoms becomes very weak. At the theoretical temperature of 0K (-273.15°C, -479.67°F), the atoms can’t vibrate. An interesting phenomena in physics is the understanding of transport. Trying to get the picture of electrons, excitons or quasiparticles flowing into a crystal is of uttermost importance in modern fundamental science.\nNow, there are two ways to represent an electron being transported through a crystal. The first picture is the one of “fast projectiles” (as JM Ziman called them in his seminal “Electrons and phonons” book). In the crystal, an electron would penetrate the closely packed array of atomic hard spheres. “It is as if one could play cricket in the jungle” Ziman says. It cannot really propagate. Therefore, seeing the electron as a particle fails at explaining electronic conduction. On the other side, we may think about electrons as waves, flowing inside a crystal. Bloch states notably describe the fact the electron wave function may have the same periodicity as the one of the lattice, thus ensuring the electron flows inside a crystal without actually seeing it. If temperature is too high, the vibrating atoms would create scattering centres, on which the electrons would bump. Particularly, when the temperature becomes low enough, the probability to encounter scattering processes between atoms and electrons decreases, and the mean free path increases up to the dimensions of the macroscopic specimen.\nFinally, looking at low temperature physics allows us to isolate the electron (or any charge carrier, that can be excitons, polaritons, etc.) behaviour, by reducing the vibrational noise (or the phonon modes) that prevents us from seeing quantum phenomena. At these temperatures, quantum phenomena can also naturally emerge, if the energy distribution of particles involved is very narrow. That is notably the case at low temperature where the width of the Fermi-Dirac distribution becomes narrower as the temperature decreases.\nIf you wanted a response to the question “how cold is low temperature?”, I’d respond that it depends on what you want to observe. Typically, Bloch oscillation can resist up to 200K (~-73°C, -100°F) in pure system, but in most of the cases, Aharonov-Bohm oscillations or Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations do not persist up to 4K.']"	['<urn:uuid:4dbf4fa4-be67-47ea-802e-1b62cef4cacb>', '<urn:uuid:7eafd342-a46f-4634-b766-c0b9e27a1754>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	6	48	1674
90	As an architectural lighting specialist, I'm curious about how the Centre Guillaume II project transformed the previously dark center area. What solutions did they implement to improve natural lighting in the building?	The main transformation involved converting what was previously a dark and cluttered street block center into a glass-covered courtyard. This new design allows light to penetrate through four stories of the building and enhances the former interior façade. The contemporary wing features a continuous silk-screened glass skin that wraps around the steel structure, which interacts with light in varying ways - it can either appear transparent or more opaque, reflecting the historical buildings around it depending on light conditions. The glass exterior also includes a white vertical pattern silk-screen printing applied in various widths, which serves as both a sunshade and provides different levels of protection and intimacy based on orientations and desired views.	"['""Centre Guillaume II manifests itself both as a regeneration and extension project in the heart of the historical center of the capital. Thus, located in a Unesco world heritage context, the project required delicate and strategic architectural interventions in the existing historical environment and buildings.\nThe city of Luxembourg has decided to reorganize the citizen’s services in the historical center of the capital. The project required the rehabilitation of a set of historical buildings from 1691 and the addition of a wing including a new ceremony hall as well as assuring a connection between the City Hall and this new complex. This rehabilitation of the existing buildings offers a thorough redesign of the interior spaces to provide them with clarity and fluidity - essential qualities for a busy public building. The street block center, that was just a dark and cluttered area, has become a glass-covered courtyard that deploys the light over four stories and enhances the former interior façade. New access balconies distribute each story and enable the routing of all technical flows required for the new functions without interfering with the restored heritage.\nEvery historic building element has been closely examined along with archeologists, heritage specialists and the national administration of ‘Sites & Monuments’ to set up the implementation of the new programs while respecting the existing structures. The analysis of the historical phases was crucial to both the design of contemporary interventions and the civil engineering issues specific to such interventions. A complete inventory of all parts of the heritage to be preserved was drawn up detailing their mode of conservation and the specific restoration techniques. Pastiche was banned, authentic decors were restored and contemporary elements were integrated through careful choices of materials, colors and moldings. The elements of styles from five centuries of history are blending in with new harmony.\nThe new construction, which combines the two ancient buildings, incorporates a clear confrontation of ages for reciprocal enrichment. Surrounded by historical buildings with orderly moldings made of sandy stones, sealers, slates and zinc, the contemporary wing offers a clear contrast of a geometrical but irregularly shaped pavilion made of glass and steel.\nThe first part of the wing, housing the new ceremony hall, rests on the ground to reinforce the urban features of the pavilion next to the public square. The second part, a metallic structure exposed inside the gallery, looks flexible and evolutionary until it becomes a cable-staged footbridge protruding from the square to the city hall. The wing is abstractly materialized by a continuous silk-screened glass skin wrapping the steel structure. Depending on the light conditions, it will adopt the color of the sky or that of the surroundings and will either be transparent or more opaque reflecting the historical buildings around. The white vertical pattern of the silk-screen printing is applied in various widths on the exterior side of the glass. Hence, it provides a sunshade to the building and gives it an original materiality. A four-density alternation allows modifying the level of protection and intimacy depending on orientations and views desired. Inside, the vertical wood-slat acoustic partitions repeat the pattern of the windows and provide the touch of warmth for the reception and authority functions of this public service facility.""']"	['<urn:uuid:c54edf18-241b-47d9-8262-efcda2afca69>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	32	114	538
91	german mystery crime writing culture language barriers translation challenges give examples	German crime fiction (Krimi) faces significant translation challenges due to language and cultural barriers. While the genre is highly popular in German-speaking countries with over 300 current writers, many works remain untranslated due to difficulties in meaningfully translating between languages. This relates to broader translation issues where word-for-word translation is impossible due to differences in values, assumptions, and language structure. For example, even simple words like the Japanese 'hai' (yes) can have multiple contextual meanings that don't directly translate.	"['The Mystery Auf Deutsch\nCrime fiction in German language countries – Germany, Switzerland, and Austria – has a very long and distinguished history and is truly remarkable for its popularity today. The genre, identified in German as ""Kriminalgeschichte"", ""Detektivroman"", ""Kriminalroman"", or simply as ""Krimi"" is sorely under appreciated in English-language countries and has been badly maligned by British and American gurus. William Huntington Wright in ""Great Detective Stories"" (in The Art of the Mystery Story, Howard Haycraft ed.) wrote that ""Germanic attempts at this literary genre read like painstaking official reports, lacking imagination and dramatic suspense … and the methods employed are generally obvious and heavy-footed and … these efforts are abortive and ponderous"". The venerable Howard Haycraft in his Life and Times of the Detective Story refers disdainfully to ""continental [detective story] writers"" as ""quite inferior""!\nThese ""experts"" have clearly not read German mysteries or are chauvinists of the worst sort!\nThe earliest crime literature in the German lands were true crime reports published from 1730 to 1865 and popularly known as ""Der Pitaval"" after the French author of the original publications, F. Guyot de Pitaval . It is fascinating to note that a number of the early, classic German authors anticipated the genre in some of their work. The great Schiller in his 1786 novel, Der Verbrecher aus verlorener Ehre (Verlag der Bremer Presse, Munich, 1922) created a crime story of a sort. Similarly the renowned E.T.A. Hoffmann story Mademoiselle von Scuderi, (in Selected Writings of E.T.A. Hoffmann, Vol. 1, University of Chicago Press, 1969) written in 1820, is a crime story in which Fraulein Scuderi somewhat unintentionally plays a detective role, an innocent person is exonerated, and a villain is bagged. A number of literary sources argue that Hoffmann was an important influence on Poe. The venerable poet Annette von Droste-Hulshoff’s The Jew’s Beech (John Calder, London, 1958) published in 1842 is a melodramatic story about a crime that solves itself with the commission of a suicide. German literature specialists argue that the first genuine German mystery was penned by Adolf Mullner in 1829 and entitled Der Kaliber- Caliber- (Verlag von Phillip Reclam, Leipzig). It is indeed a crime story but lacks the complete nature of Poe’s Murder in the Rue Morgue.\nIn the early part of the 20th Century there were a few interesting crime writers including Karl Rosner (The King, London, 1922) Dietrich Theden, and Austrian Baldwin Groller who created Detective Dagobert (Detektiv Dagobert Taten und Abenteuer, Phillip Reclam, Leipzig, 1910). However, one of the most influential authors in this period was Erich Kastner who launched one of the most popular children’s series in 1929 with Emil and the Detectives (Doubleday, N.Y., 1950) and continued with a number of follow-ons (see for example, Emil and the Three Twins, Red Fox, London, 2002). Another influential and very popular writer began a series of novels featuring Sergeant Struder (Wachtmeister Struder, Arche, Zurich, 1954). This Swiss storyteller, Friedrich Glauser, published five Struder novels that were enormously popular. The Struder novels have been translated into many languages (except English) and one of the most prestigious prizes for German-language mysteries is named for Glausner.\nThe 1950s were marked by some very special contributions to the genre. In 1950 the Swiss playwright Friedrich Durrenmatt published a superb mystery entitled The Judge and His Hangman (Dolphin Books, N.Y., 1963), followed by The Quarry (New York Graphic Society, Greenwich, 1962) and The Pledge (Knopf, N.Y., 1959). The latter was made into a very popular Hollywood motion picture. These are outstanding mysteries – clever, suspenseful, philosophical and, in my opinion, brilliant. Durrenmatt is a cross between Jose Luis Borges and Hegel. In contrast, one of the most monetarily successful series ever produced was the ""Jerry Cotton"" novels. These spy-oriented potboilers began in 1954 featuring an American hero – a New York F.B.I. agent – known as Jerry Cotton. The author of the original books was Delfried Kaufmann who was replaced by innumerable writers since the early tomes. The series has been published in 19 languages, has sold over 800 million copies, has been made into at least six motion pictures and continues to be published today. There is no accounting for bad taste.\nAnother unusual series of rather macabre mysteries was produced by Norbert Jacques and centered on the evil Dr. Mabuse (see for example, Dr. Mabuse der Spieler –Dr. Mabuse the Gambler, (Hammerich & Lesser, Hamburg, 1940) and Dr. Mabuse: Master of Mystery, (Allen and Unwin, London, 1923). Mabuse bears a close resemblance to the French villain, Fantomas. The Mabuse mysteries were really immortalized when the German movie director Fritz Lang produced three films based on the novels.\nThe Austrian writer Heimito von Doderer also contributed some excellent mysteries including Every Man a Murderer (Knopf, N.Y., 1964), a very literary mystery in which the main character becomes obsessed with the murder of his sister-in-law and, after much research, learns that he inadvertently caused, not her murder, but her accidental death. He also authored The Waterfalls of Slunj (Sun and Moon Press, Los Angeles, 1994). The postmodern Austrian writer Peter Handke also published a first class mystery, Der Hausierer - The Peddler, (Fischer Taschenbuch, Frankfurt, 1983). The late Heinrich Boll, Nobel Prize winner in 1972, wrote an outstanding mystery, The Lost Honor of Katharine Blum (Penguin, N.Y., 1994), set in Cologne and depicting a corrupt police system as well as an irresponsible press and featuring the antics of the terrorist group, the Red Army Faction. Hans Muller Kirst published more than 40 mysteries although he is best known for The Night of the Generals (Harper and Row, N.Y., 1963), made famous because of the motion picture of the same name. He also wrote an interesting set of mysteries including A Time for Truth (Collins, London, 1974) and A Time for Payment (Collins, 1976).\nThere are an enormous number of mystery writers active in Germany Austria, and Switzerland today. One can find the names of more than 300 current Krimi writers listed on the web atLexikon der Deutschen Krimi-Autoren. One of the most frequently translated is Jakob Arjouni, a German who has created a Turkish born/naturalized German detective named Kemal Kayanaka. The stories are excellent. Try, Happy Birthday Turk (Fromm International, N.Y., 1993) or One Man, One Murder (Harpenden, London, 1997, or More Beer (No Exit Press, London, 1996. Marianne Gruber, an Austrian, has published some very noteworthy mysteries including Calm (Ariadne Press, Riverside, Ca, 1999) and Death of a Plover and Trace of the Buckskin (Ariadne Press, Riverside, Ca. 1994). Pieke Biermann, referred to as the ""Queen of German Crime"" is a prolific author of hard-boiled police procedurals set in the underworld of Berlin and starring a quite narcissistic chief inspector Karin Lietze. Her rather staccato novel Violetta has been translated into English and is filled with prostitutes, neer-do-wells and other grisly characters (Serpent’s Tail, London, 1996). Ingrid Noll has written some excellent mysteries including Hell hath No Fury (Harper Collins, N.Y. 1998) and The Pharmacist (Harper Collins, N.Y., 1999). Doris Gercke’s How many Miles To Babylon (Women in Translation, Seattle, 1991) features Hamburg policewoman Bella Block who loves vodka and Russian literature and is a senior (in her 50s), cynical, sexy and very cool. Gercke is a prolific author who also writes TV and radio mysteries. Other distaff mystery writers include Thea Dorn who recently published Ultima Ratio (Rotbuch, Berlin, 2001), Gabriele Wolff, the creator of an interesting Cologne state attorney – Beate Fox - who solves legal crimes (Kolscher Kaviar – Cologne Caviar – Verlag am Galgenberg, 1990), and Sabine Deitmer who has published a number of mysteries in the 90s the best of which are Bye Bye Bruno (Fischer, Frankfurt, 1988) and Neon Nights (Fischer, Frankfurt, 1996). Malachy Hyde, a pseudonym for Ilka Stitz and Karola Hagemann, is noted for an historical series set in ancient Rome (see for example, Eines jeden Kreuz, Berlin, 2002).\nOn the lighter side and for cat lovers the Turkish-born Akif Pirincci writes a popular cat mystery series that are somewhat silly but fun. A few have been translated including Felidae (Fourth estate, London, 1994) and Felidae on the Road (Fourth estate, London, 1994). Peter Meisenberg sets a popular series in Cologne featuring Commissioner Lohr who battles crime in the ""Chicago on the Rhine"". Similarly Jacques Berndorf has developed a series set in the Eifel region south of Bonn that is redolent of the local culture.\nThere are, of course many more authors that could be described but space does not permit. Clearly, the popularity of crime fiction in the German-language lands can hardly be exaggerated. Television and radio programs, films and publications for children featuring the genre abound. There are three prizes awarded annually for best mysteries – winner’s names are available on the web site Das Syndikat maintained by German crime writers. The German-language mystery is a vibrant and amazingly popular phenomenon. Most mysteries are police procedurals and most authors are concerned with the search for justice. German Krimis have always been a superb and accurate window on German society, especially today in the tumultuous post-Cold War period of unification. It is noteworthy that many very renowned mainstream playwrights, novelists, and poets employed the genre to convey their messages. Crime fiction in the German realm is remarkably vibrant, creative and not readily available to, or fully appreciated by, English-language readers.\nReturn to Mysteries in Foreign Lands\nReturn to Main Menu', 'Culture and Subculture\nCulture is part of the external influences that impact the consumer. That is, culture represents influences that are imposed on the consumer by other individuals.\nThe definition of culture offered in one textbook is “That complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man person as a member of society.” From this definition, we make the following observations:\n- Culture, as a “complex whole,” is a system of interdependent components.\n- Knowledge and beliefs are important parts. In the U.S., we know and believe that a person who is skilled and works hard will get ahead. In other countries, it may be believed that differences in outcome result more from luck. “Chunking,” the name for China in Chinese, literally means “The Middle Kingdom.” The belief among ancient Chinese that they were in the center of the universe greatly influenced their thinking.\n- Other issues are relevant. Art, for example, may be reflected in the rather arbitrary practice of wearing ties in some countries and wearing turbans in others. Morality may be exhibited in the view in the United States that one should not be naked in public. In Japan, on the other hand, groups of men and women may take steam baths together without perceived as improper. On the other extreme, women in some Arab countries are not even allowed to reveal their faces. Notice, by the way, that what at least some countries view as moral may in fact be highly immoral by the standards of another country. For example, the law that once banned interracial marriages in South Africa was named the “Immorality Act,” even though in most civilized countries this law, and any degree of explicit racial prejudice, would itself be considered highly immoral.\nCulture has several important characteristics: (1) Culture is comprehensive. This means that all parts must fit together in some logical fashion. For example, bowing and a strong desire to avoid the loss of face are unified in their manifestation of the importance of respect. (2) Culture is learned rather than being something we are born with. We will consider the mechanics of learning later in the course. (3) Culture is manifested within boundaries of acceptable behavior. For example, in American society, one cannot show up to class naked, but wearing anything from a suit and tie to shorts and a T-shirt would usually be acceptable. Failure to behave within the prescribed norms may lead to sanctions, ranging from being hauled off by the police for indecent exposure to being laughed at by others for wearing a suit at the beach. (4) Conscious awareness of cultural standards is limited. One American spy was intercepted by the Germans during World War II simply because of the way he held his knife and fork while eating. (5) Cultures fall somewhere on a continuum between static and dynamic depending on how quickly they accept change. For example, American culture has changed a great deal since the 1950s, while the culture of Saudi Arabia has changed much less.\nDealing with culture. Culture is a problematic issue for many marketers since it is inherently nebulous and often difficult to understand. One may violate the cultural norms of another country without being informed of this, and people from different cultures may feel uncomfortable in each other’s presence without knowing exactly why (for example, two speakers may unconsciously continue to attempt to adjust to reach an incompatible preferred interpersonal distance).\nWarning about stereotyping. When observing a culture, one must be careful not to over-generalize about traits that one sees. Research in social psychology has suggested a strong tendency for people to perceive an “outgroup” as more homogenous than an “ingroup,” even when they knew what members had been assigned to each group purely by chance. When there is often a “grain of truth” to some of the perceived differences, the temptation to over-generalize is often strong. Note that there are often significant individual differences within cultures.\nCultural lessons. We considered several cultural lessons in class; the important thing here is the big picture. For example, within the Muslim tradition, the dog is considered a “dirty” animal, so portraying it as “man’s best friend” in an advertisement is counter-productive. Packaging, seen as a reflection of the quality of the “real” product, is considerably more important in Asia than in the U.S., where there is a tendency to focus on the contents which “really count.” Many cultures observe significantly greater levels of formality than that typical in the U.S., and Japanese negotiator tend to observe long silent pauses as a speaker’s point is considered.\nCultural characteristics as a continuum. There is a tendency to stereotype cultures as being one way or another (e.g., individualistic rather than collectivistic). Note, however, countries fall on a continuum of cultural traits. Hofstede’s research demonstrates a wide range between the most individualistic and collectivistic countries, for example—some fall in the middle.\nHofstede’s Dimensions. Gert Hofstede, a Dutch researcher, was able to interview a large number of IBM executives in various countries, and found that cultural differences tended to center around four key dimensions:\n- Individualism vs. collectivism: To what extent do people believe in individual responsibility and reward rather than having these measures aimed at the larger group? Contrary to the stereotype, Japan actually ranks in the middle of this dimension, while Indonesia and West Africa rank toward the collectivistic side. The U.S., Britain, and the Netherlands rate toward individualism.\n- Power distance: To what extent is there a strong separation of individuals based on rank? Power distance tends to be particularly high in Arab countries and some Latin American ones, while it is more modest in Northern Europe and the U.S.\n- Masculinity vs. femininity involves a somewhat more nebulous concept. “Masculine” values involve competition and “conquering” nature by means such as large construction projects, while “feminine” values involve harmony and environmental protection. Japan is one of the more masculine countries, while the Netherlands rank relatively low. The U.S. is close to the middle, slightly toward the masculine side. ( The fact that these values are thought of as “masculine” or “feminine” does not mean that they are consistently held by members of each respective gender—there are very large “within-group” differences. There is, however, often a large correlation of these cultural values with the status of women.)\n- Uncertainty avoidance involves the extent to which a “structured” situation with clear rules is preferred to a more ambiguous one; in general, countries with lower uncertainty avoidance tend to be more tolerant of risk. Japan ranks very high. Few countries are very low in any absolute sense, but relatively speaking, Britain and Hong Kong are lower, and the U.S. is in the lower range of the distribution.\nAlthough Hofstede’s original work did not address this, a fifth dimension of long term vs. short term orientation has been proposed. In the U.S., managers like to see quick results, while Japanese managers are known for take a long term view, often accepting long periods before profitability is obtained.\nHigh vs. low context cultures: In some cultures, “what you see is what you get”—the speaker is expected to make his or her points clear and limit ambiguity. This is the case in the U.S.—if you have something on your mind, you are expected to say it directly, subject to some reasonable standards of diplomacy. In Japan, in contrast, facial expressions and what is not said may be an important clue to understanding a speaker’s meaning. Thus, it may be very difficult for Japanese speakers to understand another’s written communication. The nature of languages may exacerbate this phenomenon—while the German language is very precise, Chinese lacks many grammatical features, and the meaning of words may be somewhat less precise. English ranks somewhere in the middle of this continuum.\nEthnocentrism and the self-reference criterion. The self-reference criterion refers to the tendency of individuals, often unconsciously, to use the standards of one’s own culture to evaluate others. For example, Americans may perceive more traditional societies to be “backward” and “unmotivated” because they fail to adopt new technologies or social customs, seeking instead to preserve traditional values. In the 1960s, a supposedly well read American psychology professor referred to India’s culture of “sick” because, despite severe food shortages, the Hindu religion did not allow the eating of cows. The psychologist expressed disgust that the cows were allowed to roam free in villages, although it turns out that they provided valuable functions by offering milk and fertilizing fields. Ethnocentrism is the tendency to view one’s culture to be superior to others. The important thing here is to consider how these biases may come in the way in dealing with members of other cultures.\nIt should be noted that there is a tendency of outsiders to a culture to overstate the similarity of members of that culture to each other. In the United States, we are well aware that there is a great deal of heterogeneity within our culture; however, we often underestimate the diversity within other cultures. For example, in Latin America, there are great differences between people who live in coastal and mountainous areas; there are also great differences between social classes.\nLanguage issues. Language is an important element of culture. It should be realized that regional differences may be subtle. For example, one word may mean one thing in one Latin American country, but something off-color in another. It should also be kept in mind that much information is carried in non-verbal communication. In some cultures, we nod to signify “yes” and shake our heads to signify “no;” in other cultures, the practice is reversed. Within the context of language:\n- There are often large variations in regional dialects of a given language. The differences between U.S., Australian, and British English are actually modest compared to differences between dialects of Spanish and German.\n- Idioms involve “figures of speech” that may not be used, literally translated, in other languages. For example, baseball is a predominantly North and South American sport, so the notion of “in the ball park” makes sense here, but the term does not carry the same meaning in cultures where the sport is less popular.\n- Neologisms involve terms that have come into language relatively recently as technology or society involved. With the proliferation of computer technology, for example, the idea of an “add-on” became widely known. It may take longer for such terms to “diffuse” into other regions of the world. In parts of the World where English is heavily studied in schools, the emphasis is often on grammar and traditional language rather than on current terminology, so neologisms have a wide potential not to be understood.\n- Slang exists within most languages. Again, regional variations are common and not all people in a region where slang is used will necessarily understand this. There are often significant generation gaps in the use of slang.\nWriting patterns, or the socially accepted ways of writing, will differs significantly between cultures.\nIn English and Northern European languages, there is an emphasis on organization and conciseness. Here, a point is made by building up to it through background. An introduction will often foreshadow what is to be said. In Romance languages such as Spanish, French, and Portuguese, this style is often considered “boring” and “inelegant.” Detours are expected and are considered a sign of class, not of poor organization. In Asian languages, there is often a great deal of circularity. Because of concerns about potential loss of face, opinions may not be expressed directly. Instead, speakers may hint at ideas or indicate what others have said, waiting for feedback from the other speaker before committing to a point of view.\nBecause of differences in values, assumptions, and language structure, it is not possible to meaningfully translate “word-for-word” from one language to another. A translator must keep “unspoken understandings” and assumptions in mind in translating. The intended meaning of a word may also differ from its literal translation. For example, the Japanese word hai is literally translated as “yes.” To Americans, that would imply “Yes, I agree.” To the Japanese speaker, however, the word may mean “Yes, I hear what you are saying” (without any agreement expressed) or even “Yes, I hear you are saying something even though I am not sure exactly what you are saying.”\nDifferences in cultural values result in different preferred methods of speech. In American English, where the individual is assumed to be more in control of his or her destiny than is the case in many other cultures, there is a preference for the “active” tense (e.g., “I wrote the marketing plan”) as opposed to the passive (e.g., “The marketing plan was written by me.”)\nBecause of the potential for misunderstandings in translations, it is dangerous to rely on a translation from one language to another made by one person. In the “decentering” method, multiple translators are used.\nThe text is first translated by one translator—say, from German to Mandarin Chinese. A second translator, who does not know what the original German text said, will then translate back to German from Mandarin Chinese translation. The text is then compared. If the meaning is not similar, a third translator, keeping in mind this feedback, will then translate from German to Mandarin. The process is continued until the translated meaning appears to be satisfactory.\nDifferent perspectives exist in different cultures on several issues; e.g.:\n- Monochronic cultures tend to value precise scheduling and doing one thing at a time; in polychronic cultures, in contrast, promptness is valued less, and multiple tasks may be performed simultaneously. (See text for more detail).\n- Space is perceived differently. Americans will feel crowded where people from more densely populated countries will be comfortable.\n- Symbols differ in meaning. For example, while white symbols purity in the U.S., it is a symbol of death in China. Colors that are considered masculine and feminine also differ by culture.\n- Americans have a lot of quite shallow friends toward whom little obligation is felt; people in European and some Asian cultures have fewer, but more significant friends. For example, one Ph.D. student from India, with limited income, felt obligated to try buy an airline ticket for a friend to go back to India when a relative had died.\n- In the U.S. and much of Europe, agreements are typically rather precise and contractual in nature; in Asia, there is a greater tendency to settle issues as they come up. As a result, building a relationship of trust is more important in Asia, since you must be able to count on your partner being reasonable.\n- In terms of etiquette, some cultures have more rigid procedures than others. In some countries, for example, there are explicit standards as to how a gift should be presented. In some cultures, gifts should be presented in private to avoid embarrassing the recipient; in others, the gift should be made publicly to ensure that no perception of secret bribery could be made.']"	['<urn:uuid:edfca7ab-193c-4e19-931e-f8988278850f>', '<urn:uuid:cbfb9446-7b6c-4c2c-9d6f-c11d52280bc4>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	11	79	4076
92	looking for programs goats kids non city families what options costs and programs control goats in countryside	For kids, there are several programs available: FFA (Future Farmers of America) costs about $7/year and requires enrollment in agriculture classes, 4-H accepts children ages 5-19, and the National Grange offers programs for ages 5-35. For controlling goats in rural areas, options include exclusion fencing, shooting, mustering with dogs or helicopters, and trapping around water points. These control methods must comply with animal welfare legislation and should be coordinated with neighbors for best results.	"['Helping Kids Live the Goat Life\nWhat is FFA? And What Other Ways Can Kids Learn About Goats?\nYou don’t have to own goats to introduce children to the “goat life.” Youth and volunteer programs give access to farm life even if you reside in the city.\nHave kids of the human variety? Do you desire to introduce them to the exciting world of goats? As a fellow parent of the wild human child, I considered what sort of life I want my son to live. I am lucky to allow him to grow up on a hobby farm. His best friend is Macchi, a mixed mini goat, and the two are inseparable.\nIf I had no space for goats, or they were illegal where I reside, I would still want my son to be involved in farming and ranching activities. It brings him so much joy and helps him learn valuable life lessons and experiences.\nFortunately, there are many ways to introduce farm life and goats to our human young.\nGoat experts Katherine Drovdahl and Cheryl K. Smith offer valuable tips to avoid disaster and raise healthy, happy animals!\nThe Future Farmers of America (FFA)\nA great opportunity for older kids, the FFA is low cost but has a caveat: Your child must be enrolled in some sort of agriculture class at their school. If the school does not offer one, discuss ways around it with your local FFA chapters. The FFA allows children to learn leadership and responsibility in groups of like-minded individuals. Your child will be exposed to a wide variety of farming life, including raising, caring for, and showing goats. Participation in the program has huge future benefits as well, because FFA alumni are eligible for multiple scholarships and grants for higher education. Membership costs about $7 a year and includes a subscription to their magazine. Local chapters may require additional fees.\nChildren and young adults ages 5-19 years can join 4-H, a program run by your state’s Cooperative Extension. Cloverbud members, between the ages of 5-8, participate in non-competitive activities and hands-on learning experiences. The older members utilize the skills and knowledge they’ve learned to raise and show animals from dogs to horses. 4-H raises self-esteems, helps members make new friends, and instills a lifelong love of livestock and farming. Fees vary depending on your local groups, which can be found via a search module on the main 4-H website, www.4-h.org/find.\nThe National Grange is a family-based grassroots organization that allows members of all ages to learn more about husbandry, community, and personal growth. There are many different programs to choose from. The Junior Grange is a leadership development program for children aged 5-14 years. The Youth Grange is for young adults and couples up to 35 years of age. The Grange is also a national program with numerous local branches. They advocate for rural living, raising livestock, community service, and caring for others. Members have the opportunity to raise, care for, and show goats as well as many other animals.\nMany high schools have rodeos or clubs that can offer children a chance at caring for goats and other livestock. If not, local community colleges often have programs that interested parties can explore. There are national programs such as the National High School Rodeo Association (www.nhsra.com) as well as local state programs of the same sort. Most of these programs have membership fees, but they also offer scholarships and grants. They vary by what they offer, but they all contribute to youth learning to care for and respect animal life. The best way to get in touch with these programs is through an online search engine or by contacting your local Board of Education.\nLivestock Rescues and Nonprofits\nThis one may take a little searching, but most places have some form of livestock rescue or nonprofit organization that deals with large animals. These groups are almost always looking for volunteers! It’s generally easy to get into contact with rescues and nonprofits through their website or over the phone.\nThe website https://www.vegan.com/sanctuaries/ has a directory of farm animal rescues by state, but it is not comprehensive. Getting involved will help kids understand compassion and caring for sick, injured, or neglected animals.\nA little less hands-on, but still a great experience is touring an existing ranch or goat dairy farm. Many established ranches offer tours and education days as an additional income stream. Children can reap educational benefits from a visit, and parents can gauge their child’s interest level without committing to a major program. Every place is different, but kids are often taught about livestock, are permitted to pet, interact, and care for the animals, and may even be offered samples of products the establishment makes, such as caramels or cheese. Touring a goat farm or dairy is a valuable exposure to the lifestyle without a huge upfront commitment.\nMany high schools or community colleges offer agriculture classes that serve as an educational tool as well as a great place to network. Often the classes include hands-on goat care, which can springboard children into raising and showing goats and other livestock in their local fairs or rodeos.\nLocal Goat Owners\nDo you know someone who has goats? Existing owners already have the space and knowledge to keep a goat happy and safe. Don’t be afraid to reach out! Most of these people won’t mind teaching a budding future goat owner about the animal, but it can go further than that. I’ve heard countless stories of children raising their first goats on someone else’s property as their first taste of the farm life.\nAsk! If your child is serious about the commitment of raising a goat, then there is probably someone willing to give them a shot at it. If you don’t personally know anyone, try posting an ad or searching for online backyard hobby farm groups. Facebook has many groups of local farming communities that are open to join for education purposes, animal pictures and stories, and networking.\nDonate a Goat\nYou child can donate a goat to a needy family! World Vision helps people donate livestock to families across the globe. The cost to donate a goat is $85, which can bring a family milk, fertilizer, and extra income. Although you don’t personally see the goat, it teaches your child the gift of giving back in a goat-related way. The program is accessible online via their website, www.worldvision.org.\nIf you and your child are serious about getting involved in the world of goats, then go for it! It is a rewarding lifestyle packed to the brim with fun and adventure. There are so many amazing programs and opportunities. Reach out, ask questions, and get involved. You won’t regret it!\nOriginally published in the September/October 2018 issue of Goat Journal and regularly vetted for accuracy.', ""Integrated feral goat control\nThis page provides advice on integrated feral goat control.\nWhy manage feral goats?\n- In Victoria feral or wild populations of goats (Capra hircus) are declared as established pest animals under the Catchment and Land Protection Act 1994.\n- Under the Catchment and Land Protection Act 1994 all landowners have a responsibility to prevent the spread of and, as far as possible, eradicate established pest animals on their land.\nGoats were first introduced to Australia in 1788 when they arrived with the first fleet. Wild populations quickly established and feral goats have since become major agricultural and environmental pests.\nFeral goat grazing damage affects pastures and crops as well as native vegetation. Feral goats also cause erosion and associated sedimentation of waterways. Feral goats pose a biosecurity risk as vectors of many livestock diseases.\nBefore you begin: Feral goat biology and behaviour\nBefore designing your feral goat control program, it is important to understand feral goat behaviour and characteristics.\nInformation on feral goat characteristics and behaviour.\nManagement of feral goats on your property\nPoints to remember\n- Control feral goats before they cause severe pasture or crop losses, vegetation damage and contribute to waterway sedimentation and soil erosion.\n- Ensure your feral goat control program doesn't affect native wildlife.\n- If you are planning to use traps to control feral goats: the trap specifications, trap checking times, provision of food, water and shade, and humane destruction of trapped feral goats MUST be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986 (POCTA) and associated regulations. Trapping has several animal welfare implications and anyone considering trapping should read important further information. See Humane Vertebrate Pest Control.\n- If you are planning to use dogs for feral goat control, be mindful that there are specific requirements for the use of dogs for hunting. Under Section 28 of the Domestic Animals Act 1994, a person must not set or urge a dog to attack, bite, rush at or chase any animal except when hunting in accordance with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986 (POCTA). Refer to the POCTA Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals in Hunting for specific information on the use of dogs in hunting.\nPlanning your program\nPlanning can maximise the effectiveness of feral goat control while minimising damage to other animals. Consider goat density, distribution and the habitat in which the feral goats are living as this will determine what actions are appropriate. The following steps will help in planning.\n1. Work together\nCoordinate control work with your neighbours the best results are achieved where neighbours conduct simultaneous feral goat control across a landscape, rather than just on individual properties. Work on your property can be undermined by the inactivity of your neighbours. Talk to your neighbours and local Landcare group and work out a plan for coordinated action.\n2. Conduct monitoring\n- Identify feral goat feeding and refuge areas in and around your property. Map these areas for future reference. Feral goats are often found on rocky outcrops, steep slopes, thick vegetation, gullies and ravines, goats can also be found in rangeland country.\n- Feral goats can be monitored by measuring tracks and scats, using motion sensor cameras and visual counts particularly at water points in dry areas. Aerial counts can also be used in some broad-scale infestations.\n- Assess the risks to non-target animals when implementing shooting and trapping, record them on a map for later reference.\n- Establish a benchmark of the impact of feral goats on your property. This will be used to measure the effectiveness of your control programs against the impacts of goats (i.e. vegetation damage).\n- Use the information you have gained from monitoring to:\n- target your control effort;\n- monitor the progress and success of your control program; and\n- vary and improve your program.\nIt is important to continue monitoring on an ongoing basis to detect and treat any re-infestation of your property.\n3. Aim to be feral goat free\nCreate a detailed feral goat management plan that has a specific aim and time-bound objectives to meet that aim. Eradication may not be possible in all areas and feral goats will require ongoing maintenance to manage the population at low levels.\n4. Use all the tools!\nEffective feral goat management utilises all the available control measures that are feasible on your property. Every individual feral goat should be exposed to as many different control measures as possible making your property a feral goat hostile environment.\nYou will need to consider seasonal movements of feral goats and access to areas where feral goats are feeding and living. Drier times when water is limited often concentrate goats around water sources making mustering, trapping or shooting more efficient.\n6. Evaluate your success\nConduct a second round of monitoring after your control program.\n- Are feral goats still present?\n- Are you still experiencing damage caused by feral goats?\n- Is the impact of feral goats above/below acceptable thresholds?\n- What is working well? What could be improved?\n- Do you need to change your plan? Have you managed all the risks?\n7. Follow up\nContinue monitoring on an ongoing basis. When you see signs of feral goat activity, implement control immediately.\nRemember, feral goat control is time-consuming and there is no quick-fix solution.\nThere are a range of parasites and diseases that may provide some small level of feral goat population control in Australia. However these control agents do not have a large enough effect to provide any significant benefit. New biological control agents are unlikely to be released due to potential impacts on agricultural goat and sheep production industries.\nThis involves constructing a fence around highly feral goat sensitive areas on your property and decreasing feral goat movement from areas where they rest to areas where they feed.\nExclusion fencing is a non-lethal way of protecting high-value areas from feral goats however it is expensive and not practical at a large scale. Fences must be strong and high enough to exclude agile animals like feral goats that are excellent climbers and jumpers. Unfortunately no fence will guarantee complete protection from feral goats. Fences need to be regularly checked and maintained as once a breakthrough occurs, a fence becomes ineffective.\nIt is best to have fences erected by experienced or professional fencers.\nWhile shooting is the most target-specific and humane form of feral goat control, it does not provide long-term, broad-scale control unless it is used as part of an integrated management approach. Due to the high reproductive capacity of feral goats, population numbers are likely to recover to original densities after only two years (or less) following successful shooting campaigns.\nGround shooting of feral goats is the most common form of shooting. However it is highly labour intensive and is likely to be opportunistic and uncoordinated. Ground shooting is unlikely to reduce the goat population enough to reduce the impacts of the pest unless the shooting is carried out in a coordinated fashion at a landscape scale. Where small isolated populations of feral goats exist, a coordinated ground shooting campaign may provide a useful management tool.\nAerial shooting of feral goats from a helicopter has become a common population control technique as feral goats often live in steep rocky terrain. Shooting feral goats from the air is suitable for control in a management program covering a large region of land where there is a high goat density. It is also highly target-specific, humane and cost effective where the terrain is suitable to detect and target goats on the ground and where shooting is carried out by an appropriately trained and skilled operator.\nAerial shooting is not cost effective in low density infestations due to the difficulty in finding widely distributed animals, nor is it suitable for areas with closed tree canopies.\nThe use of firearms to control feral goats must conform to relevant firearm legislation and be integrated with other control methods.\nMustering feral goats with the aid of dogs, motor bikes, helicopters or from traps placed around waterholes has become a popular way of managing feral goats. Mustering is only effective in range-land situations with a high goat density.\nMustered feral goats can then be commercially sold to recoup lost production due to feral goat impacts and the cost of muster. In isolation, mustering will not provide long-term feral goat control, as populations will quickly recover.\nThe value of feral goats sold from muster is generally less than the lost production resulting from a feral goat infestation. Managing feral goats as a resource doesn't manage impacts, such as overgrazing and erosion.\nTrapping is an effective method for managing feral goats when their numbers are concentrated around water points and in high density infestations. Trapped feral goats may then be transported for sale or humanely destroyed on site.\nWell-designed traps can be feral goat-specific, allowing access by feral goats but preventing access to non-target species. There are a range of trap designs but traps generally consist of a high sturdy fence around a water supply that has a one-way entrance.\nThe climbing and jumping ability of feral goats can be exploited by constructing a trap entrance that requires feral goats to climb or jump into the trap and they are then unable to escape. Trapping requires considerable time and cost for construction and ongoing maintenance of traps.\nTo comply with animal welfare legislation, traps must be checked at a maximum interval of 48 hours to minimise the time that trapped feral goats or non-target species are held.\nTrapping has several animal welfare implications and anyone considering trapping should read important further information.\nOther management techniques\nFeral goats rely on stock watering points in many drier parts of Australia. Restricting feral goats from gaining access to water (when water is not required by stock) can be an effective way to control feral goat populations as part of an integrated management approach.\n- Parkes J., Henzell R, and Pickles G.

93	How do condolence practices compare in Japanese and Singaporean Buddhist funerals?	In Japanese Buddhist funerals, guests offer condolence money called 'koden' in envelopes, typically ranging from fifty to three hundred dollars, and receive an appreciation gift at the end of the wake. In Singapore, mourners can give condolence money to help with funeral expenses, and they are expected to bring white flowers to place near the altar as a show of honor and respect. Both cultures view these practices as ways to help the bereaved family with funeral expenses, though they should avoid anything red in Singapore. Additionally, in Singapore, mourners can send sympathy cards or make charitable donations to show respect.	['Japan is a country steeped in tradition. Many Japanese-Americans still follow these traditions especially those revolving around the major stages of life: birth, marriage, and death.\nIn Japan, the most common funeral services follow the Buddhist faith. The Buddhist ceremony consists of four parts: a wake, cremation, burial, and memorial services. Japanese-American funeral services follow the same elements although in varying degrees. To understand Japanese-American funeral services, you must first understand the funeral customs and traditions of Japan.\nAt the wake, the body is placed in a casket with the head facing north. Traditionally guests of Japanese funerals wore white, but today it is most common to wear formal black attire. At the wake a Buddhist priest will read a sutra. The priest will be carrying a prayer bead called a juzu. Guests may also be given a juzu upon arrival. Family members will then offer incense before the deceased. Traditionally, condolence money will be offered to the family to help with funeral expenses. People paying their respect will give the family an envelope called a koden which will contain anywhere from fifty to three hundred dollars. At the end of the wake all guests will be given an appreciation gift. Following the wake, close relatives will stay overnight with the deceased.\nThe Cremation Service\nThe day after the wake is the day of cremation. The traditional Japanese cremation service differs from traditional cremation in America. In Japan, the casket is taken to the crematorium, and the family watches as the casket is placed inside. The family members then leave and wait for the completion of the cremation. After the cremation is competed the family returns to transfer the bones of the deceased into an urn. This is traditionally done using chopsticks. Family members will pass the bones from chopsticks to chopsticks and into the urn. The order in which the bones are moved is important. The bones must be picked up starting with the feet to the head in order to ensure the deceased is not placed upside down.\nJapanese Burial Options\nAfter the cremation service, family and friends may travel directly to the family grave – haka in Japanese – or keep the urn at the family home for several days. Traditionally, the entire family will eventually be buried in a chamber beneath the family grave. Today, it is becoming common to keep the urn or to scatter the ashes in a symbolic location. If the deceased is buried in a family grave, family and guests may leave flowers, water, and incense in front of the site.\nJapanese Memorial Customs\nJapanese memorial customs depend strongly on family traditions. Generally, the first forty-nine days are very important for the soul of the deceased, since it is believed that the soul does not enter heaven until the forty-ninth day. A common custom is to hold a memorial service every seventh day until the forty-ninth day. At the memorial service, a Buddhist monk will chant a sutra, either at the family’s home or at the local temple. The family and friends will then place fresh flowers and burn incense at the family grave. Everyone will join together for a meal.\nFinally, it is very important to understand the religious beliefs of the person who has passed. Japanese Americans vary in traditions and beliefs. The first step in planning a funeral ceremony for a Japanese-American is to consider the beliefs of the deceased. For example, a Christian may want a funeral more similar to the traditional American style. Also, if family still lives in Japan, they should be contacted. They could help shed light on family customs. Lastly, it would be most appropriate to contact a Buddhist temple if attempting to conduct a Buddhist ceremony. They may aid the funeral home in properly performing the Buddhist funeral ceremonies.\nBuddhist Offering photograph from acdme on Flickr.', '5 Important Buddhist Funeral Customs and Rituals in Singapore\nIt is important to understand the various customs and rituals when planning for a Buddhist funeral. One important aspect that plays a big role in these customs is the idea of reincarnation. Death is viewed as a transitory state from one life to the next that brings the soul ever closer to Nirvana. In this article, we look at the top five Buddhist funeral customs in Singapore that ought to be kept in mind when planning a traditional Buddhist funeral.\n1. Funeral Space for Buddhism\nBuddhist funeral Services Singapore takes place in a funeral home and not in a temple. The whole funeral is quite simple and dignified and is held within a week after death. The viewing takes place for a night amidst incense and candlelight. It is usually held the evening before the funeral. In Singapore, most Chinese Buddhist will book a funeral venue for the ceremony to be conducted. It can be near the house area of the deceased or it can also be held in Funeral parlour. Commonly seen at HDB void decks, tentages are often a set-up for the funeral services to be conducted. Such an arrangement requires booking of space with the housing board managed by the Singapore Government.\n2. Buddhist Funeral Service\nIn Singapore, Buddhist Funeral customs and rites are often led by monks. During the service, the family sits nearer to the front, greeting all those who come to honour the deceased. Mourners go to the casket to approach the casket quietly with their hands folded in a praying position and show their respect for the dead by bowing in front of the altar. A portrait of the deceased is usually placed at the altar, in front of the casket. Visitors of the wake should approach the altar and pay their last respect and condolences. Monks would then led the funeral ceremony with prayers and food offerings such as fruits and vegetables. A period of meditation takes place during the ceremony to reflect on the life of the departed. The entire Buddhist funeral service usually lasts between three to five days.\n3. Funeral Rites and customs\nDuring the cremation ceremony which takes place on the morning of the burial/cremation, monks are invited as per Buddhist funeral traditions. They chant verses, eulogies and give sermons thereby aiding the family with the whole ceremony. Organ donation is not prohibited since it is seen as a way of helping others. However, the medical practitioner is expected to wait for at least three to four days before the autopsy since it is believed that the soul departs the body during this period. While embalming is a common custom for Buddhist Funeral in Singapore, mourners are advised to wear white as it symbolizes sympathy and grief. Since the traditional Buddhist belief is that it takes 49 days before reincarnation of the deceased, prayers will be conducted by the same monk. Buddhist funeral etiquette is similar to that of Taoist funeral in Singapore, where in both religions, it is believed that after the 49th day, the deceased will reincarnate. The 49th day, Buddhist funeral prayer will be conducted by the monk with a series of chanting. Whereas, Taoist funeral customs are led by priests, a Taoist ritual, known as “Gong Teck” which consists of burning of paper house.\n4. Burial and Cremation\nChinese Buddhists allow the families to either bury or cremate the dead as per their family custom. Once the ceremonies get over, the casket bearing the dead is taken to the burial site which is often on a hillside via a funeral procession. In Singapore, land burial site is at Lim Chu Kang Cemetery. While the casket is being lowered into the ground, it is customary that the family looks away as a show of respect. During cremation, it is a traditional custom for the family to witness the cremation. In Singapore, regardless of land burial or cremation, post-funeral rituals and chanting must be performed by a monk.\n5. Proper Buddhist Funeral Etiquettes\nIn Singapore, mourners can either send sympathy cards or white flowers to the family after learning of the death of their loved one. Chinese customs include giving condolence money to help ease the funeral spendings of the affected family. However, anything red should be avoided. Gifts, donations, or food can also be sent as a show of respect and charity. During the funeral, it is expected to bring flowers to present to the family as a show of honour and respect. These should be placed near the altar. Mourners are also expected to join in the chanting and meditation that takes place during the funeral and should refrain from documenting the ceremony.\nThese are the five most unique aspects of Buddhist funeral customs. With this information, you can now understand how to prepare for the Buddhist funeral and follow the etiquettes that go along with it.']	['<urn:uuid:d24bacb7-3e7a-404b-9499-a6e8bb5fd2c9>', '<urn:uuid:a4ffddd2-22dd-463b-977d-d46dc20c3f4a>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	11	101	1465
94	what counts as bad product design examples	Examples of defectively designed products include: airbags that are not thick enough to absorb collision impact, sun block that does not adequately protect from the sun, and riding lawnmowers with blades that don't immediately stop spinning when the machine is stopped by the operator. A defective design means the entire product line is inherently dangerous, even when perfectly manufactured.	"[""What are the Different Types of Product Liability Claims?\nUPDATED: February 20, 2013\nIt’s all about you. We want to help you make the right legal decisions.\nWe strive to help you make confident law decisions. Finding trusted and reliable legal advice should be easy. This doesn't influence our content. Our opinions are our own.\nIf someone is injured by a defective product, there are three types of product liability claims that may apply to their case: (1) defective manufacture, (2) defective design, and (3) failure to provide adequate warnings or instructions regarding how to properly use the product. Knowing the basics of these three product liability claims will help an injured person determine if they have a valid case.\nManufacturing Defect Product Liability Claim\nThis type of product liability claim is appropriate if an injury is caused by a problem with how the product was made. Essentially, the product that causes the injury is somehow different than all the identical products of its type being sold. For example, a bicycle was built with a small crack in the frame, which breaks down when the consumer rides it, injuring them. A person who feels that they may have a defective product claim based on a manufacturing defect must be sure to evaluate their behavior honestly. If the bike had a crack in the frame, but the victim was injured when she swerved off the sidewalk in rainy conditions, the crack in the frame may not have been the cause of her injury.\nDesign Defect Product Liability Claim\nIn this type of products liability, the product’s design was flawed. Defective design product liability claims do not involve an error in the manufacturing of the product, rather the design of the entire line of products was inherently dangerous, regardless of the fact that the product which caused injury was perfectly manufactured. Some examples of defectively designed products could be:\n- Airbags that are not thick enough to absorb the impact of a collision.\n- Sun block that does not adequately protect a person from the sun.\n- Riding lawnmowers with blades that do not immediately stop spinning when the machine is stopped by the operator.\nAs with manufacturing product liability claims, a plaintiff must show that their injury was caused by the defective design itself. For example, if a person is driving a car that is prone to swerving due to its design and they are injured when the car is rear-ended by another vehicle, they will not have a products liability claim for defective design since the defect making the car swerve was not the cause of their injury.\nFailure to Provide Adequate Warnings/Instructions Product Liability Claim\nIf someone is injured by a product, and the product did not come with strong enough warnings or instructions regarding how to use it safely, they may have a products liability claim for failure to warn. Failure to warn product liability claims arise when a product is dangerous in a way that is not obvious to the consumer, or the consumer needs to exercise extra care in order to properly use the product that is not mentioned in the instructions. An example of this type of product liability claim would be if someone purchased an over-the-counter drug that lacked a warning on the hazards of using it with certain other drugs, and was injured when they combined it with other medication.\nWhether you were the victim of a defectively manufactured or defectively designed product, or the product that injured you posed an unnoticeable risk that you were not warned about, you should consult an experienced product liability attorney immediately.""]"	['<urn:uuid:c84c2495-6e62-4cbb-9460-61831d311c10>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	7	59	605
95	protection care maintenance tips dental caps compare different types	Dental crowns require regular care like natural teeth - brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups every 6 months. To extend their lifespan, avoid hard foods, sticky foods, and harmful habits like smoking or using teeth to open packages. Different types offer varying benefits: metal-based crowns (gold, platinum, nickel) are most durable, ceramic and porcelain crowns are more cost-effective and aesthetically pleasing, while porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns offer both strength and natural appearance. With proper care, non-metal crowns can last beyond their average 10-15 year lifespan.	['Patients with cracked, broken, or damaged teeth might be advised by their oral health professional to get dental crowns. This procedure can dramatically help patients when it comes to easing pain and discomfort, protecting teeth from further damage, and completing smile restoration or enhancement. This guide will give patients the information they need to know if they are considering dental crowns.\nWhat are Dental Crowns?\nDental crowns are artificial teeth installed in the mouth. They can be used to complete a dental implant or can be bonded to the top of an existing tooth. Dental crowns work to protect the tooth by covering any damage to it and preventing worse damage from occurring. There are many different types of dental crowns, and they can be made from different materials to fit each patient’s needs and budget.\nDental Crowns Before and After 1\nHow Long do Dental Crowns Last?\nDental crowns usually last between five and 15 years. It is important to note that the way a dental crown is cared for will dramatically impact its lifespan. Patients looking to get the most time out of their dental crowns should minimize sticky foods and be sure to brush and floss regularly, as well as visiting the dentist at least every six months for an examination and cleaning. Additionally, habits like chewing ice or fingernails, or using teeth to open a package can also reduce the lifespan of dental crowns.\nCan Anyone Notice Dental Crowns?\nDental crowns are usually designed to not be noticed. Crowns that go in the back of the mouth might be made of gold or stainless steel, but crowns in the visible areas of the mouth will usually be made of porcelain or resin that closely resembles the appearance, color, and texture of a patient’s natural teeth. As a result, someone you know well could have dental crowns and you might not ever realize it.\nWhat Kind of Results Can Patients Expect?\nPatients should always ask to see pictures of past results when they are talking to their dentist about dental crowns. This will give patients a good idea of what to expect when it comes to their dental crown procedure. Most patients are happy with their dental crowns, and have reported less pain and discomfort, a better smile, more confidence, an easier time chewing food, and fewer complications with their oral hygiene as a result of their dental crowns.\nDental Crowns Before and After 1\nHow Are Dental Crowns Cared For?\nDental crowns are cared for just like regular teeth. Patients should brush and floss regularly, and see an oral health professional at least every six months for routine cleaning and examinations. Patients can increase the lifespan of their crowns by avoiding very hard foods, sticky foods, and destructive oral health habits like smoking, eating sticky foods, chewing on finger nails, or opening packaging with teeth.\nAre there Any Alternatives to Dental Crowns?\nThere are some alternatives to dental crowns for some patients, but, for the most part, dental crowns are the least invasive procedure that will resolve many oral health issues. Alternatives include dental implants, dentures, fillings, and other options that might not be as effective or may be much more involved when compared to dental crowns.\nAs you can see, dental crowns are a safe, effective option for many patients suffering from broken, cracked, discolored, stained, or otherwise damaged teeth. The result is less pain and discomfort and an easier time eating food. Patients also report feeling better about their smile, and an increased sense of overall well-being. The flexibility when it comes to materials and the procedure means that there is a dental crown solution for many patients.', 'In an age where mindful consumers are overwhelmed with a wide range of facts, figures and news, many patients are often curious about whether or not dental crowds are toxic, why they are needed and which crowns are best suited for them.\nAre Dental Crowns Toxic?\nWhile concerns of dental toxicity fears are understandable, information collected from professional organizations like the American Dental Association suggest that toxicity is not a concern for those receiving dental crowns.\nIn general, dentists understand the importance of trust and work very hard to establish a positive relationship with their patients by giving them several safe and nontoxic recommendations for dental crowns.\nNon Toxic Metals Used In Dental Crowns\nSeveral different metals are used in dental crowns; here is a list of the most popular metals used:\n- Gold. Gold implants are used in dental crowns because they present a nontoxic solution for teeth that are deteriorating from heavy chewing. They also do not fracture or crack, giving dentists a reliable material for restoration.\n- Zirconia. Dental crowns made from zirconia are popular in holistic dentistry because they are 100% ceramic based and visually more pleasing and compatible with other kinds of dental implants. In addition to being non toxic these crowns are more resistant to corrosion than most other metals.\n- Nickel. Nickel has been used for dental work for 150 years, especially for kids who use stainless steel dental appliances such as braces, crowns, and wire retainers. As a result of their use many children are exposed to nickel at a young age.\nBecause nickel exposure often leads to an allergic reaction in younger patients, doctors will often test for nickel and metal allergies before conducting any dental work\nWhy are dental crowns needed?\nDental crowns are an important part of repairing teeth that have been damaged or need some extra sturdiness.\nDentists often recommend dental crowns for the following issues:\n- To strengthen a tooth that has/had a very large or older filling.\n- To repair a damaged tooth.\n- To serve as an anchor for a bridge.\n- To help the patient smile better by repairing misshaped tooth.\n- To help fix a tooth that has been cracked or worn down.\n- To protect a tooth that has undergone a root canal\nDental crowns are designed to mimic the size and appearance of the damaged tooth and offer protection from further decay.\nIn most instances dental crowns cover the damaged tooth at and above the gum line and cemented into place, allowing the dental crown to create a strong foundation that lets the once wounded tooth function as normal.\nThe Lowdown On Types of Dental Crowns\nDentists use different types of crowns in different situations, and each has its own benefits and drawbacks. So there is no simple answer to the question “are dental crowns toxic?”\nStainless Steel Crowns\nOf all the materials used for dental crowns there is the most concern over stainless steel. But stainless steel crowns are nontoxic because they are usually only used for temporary crowns. So they are in the mouth for a limited time until a more permanent crown can be made.\nGenerally, the use of stainless steel crowns is more prevalent with children for several reasons. First, they offer a more affordable solution to using other custom crafted crowns. Second, they do not require multiple doctor visits for application and finally, stainless steel dental crowns can easily be placed over the primary tooth, enabling the tooth in question to be safeguarded from additional decay.\nAnd finally, stainless steel dental crowns can easily be placed over the primary tooth, enabling the tooth in question to be protected from additional decay. When the primary tooth gives way to a permanent one, the applied crown comes free on its own.\nMetal-based dental crowns offer dentists a durable and strong option for crowns. They consist of several alloys, including platinum, gold and nickel, which are used in creating durable dental crowns.\nCeramic And Porcelain Dental Crowns\nCeramic, porcelain and resin-based dental crowns are each an alternative for patients concerned about dental crown toxicity.\nAlthough metal dental crowns use is still common there, has been a shift in recent decades towards ceramic and porcelain crowns. This is because they are easier for dentists to use while also being more cost effective than their metal counterparts.\nWith proper dental care, including, flossing, brushing after meals and using an antimicrobial mouthwash, most non metal dental crowns can outlast their average lifespan of 10-15 years.\nPorcelain Fused To Metal Crowns\nPorcelain fused to metal crowns are much stronger than ceramic ones. When applied they also more closely resemble normal teeth. Although these hybrid dental crowns meld various metals with porcelain to enhance stiffness and strengthen bridges, they are also not toxic.\nIn addition to being nontoxic, they are also popular because porcelain and resin-based crowns are usually more affordable.\nWhether or not toxicity is a concern with selecting a dental crown, patients are encouraged to speak with their dentist about the types of dental crown they are being fitted for.\nIn addition to dental crown safety many patients have concerns about the cost of dental crowns. While porcelain and resin based crows are commonly more affordable, there are several other options available for those who don’t want to break the bank with fixing broken teeth.\nAllergic Reactions to Dental Crowns\nSometimes patients mistake dental crown toxicity with allergic reactions to the materials used to make their crown. As a result some patient claims of reactions to dental crowns toxicity are due to other circumstances like an allergic reaction to a particular metal alloy, an infection or improper dental hygiene.\nThey also should know that dentists recommending dental crowns have several treatment options available for patients that have allergic reactions to materials metals used for making crowns.\nPatients are encouraged to talk to their doctors about any allergies in order to select a crown that best suits their needs.\nOther Challenges with Dental Crowns\nIn addition to allergic reactions, one of the biggest challenges facing patients who are considering dental crown options is sorting through the endless amount of information, both accurate and false, about dental crowns.\nAlthough the Cleveland Clinic, a highly respected academic non-profit medical center and research facility, has found no evidence that dental crown are toxic, they have collected a list of potential side effects that may occur from getting dental crowns.\nTeeth that have received new crowns may be sensitive after the anesthesia from the procedure wears off. Also there is a chance that if the newly crowned tooth still has a nerve in it, there could be heightened sensitivities to the heat and cold. One recommended treatment for this is brushing with toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth. Another cause for discomfort could be feeling pain or sensitivity when biting down. In this case it usually means the crown is too high on the tooth, something that can easily be fixed by a dentist.\nOne drawback of porcelain or ceramic crowns is that sometimes they can chip. Many smaller chips can easily be repaired with the crown remaining in the mouth. However the dental crown may need to be replaced if there are larger chips.\nOccasionally dental crowns can fall off or break free if they were not fitted properly or given the right amount of cement. Loose crowns also can result if the adhesive cement holding them in place is washed out from underneath the crown. Besides the loose crown itself, this is a concern because there is a chance that bacteria could seep into the area and cause further decay to the affected tooth.\nDark Lines On Crowned Tooth\nA dark line next to the gum line of the crowned tooth can sometimes happen with porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns. These lines are actually the metal of the crown showing through.\nDental Crown Safety and MRIs\nHow does getting an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) affect patients with dental crowns? It depends on the material in the crown.\nAlthough crowns made from porcelain, composite resins, or gold pose no risks with an MRI, crowns made from metal based or porcelain fused to metal could pose issues because the combination of metal and magnets could be a problem.\nThose with concerns about MRIs and dental crown safety are urged to consult a dental professional before getting an MRI.\nFind A Dentist Who Provides Information About Dental Crowns\nWhen it comes to dental crowns, patients with concerns over toxicity should use our search tool to locate experienced dental professionals in your area.\nWhen reviewing options, you will want to make sure to choose someone with the appropriate credentials. Referrals from people you know and trust are important and online reviews can be helpful.\nReputable dentists will gladly answer all your questions and concerns about dental crown safety. They will also explain the various alternatives to crowns. If they feel a crown is your best option, they should be able to back up their decision with information that you can understand.']	['<urn:uuid:eab99c28-06eb-465c-80c3-6f9567cdbdf9>', '<urn:uuid:93c50fb9-0b4c-4912-aa1f-ad05d9f0914e>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	9	82	2122
96	modern birds volcanic nesting similarities dinosaurs	Some modern birds show similar nesting behavior to the extinct dinosaurs. Specifically, the Polynesian megapode buries its eggs at nesting sites heated by volcanoes on Niuafo Island, Tonga. This demonstrates that the strategy of using geothermal heat for egg incubation has existed for millions of years.	['At Argentina’s Sanagasta Geological Park, there is a volcanic nursery for giants. It’s a site that is strewn with the fossilised eggs of giant dinosaurs – sauropods. Each of their 80 or so egg clusters sits next to a geyser, a hot vent or other volcanically heated sites. This is no coincidence – eggs need moisture and heat to incubate properly and big eggs are particularly demanding. These dinosaurs were using the planet to keep their babies warm.\nArgentina is a haven for any palaeontologist looking for dinosaur eggs. Different provinces have yielded several large nesting sites. Most belonged to the giant sauropods and some even contain eggs with fossilised embryos inside. The sites have told us much about how dinosaurs looked after their young and even what ate baby dinosaurs but until now, scientists have largely ignored the question of why these particular sites were such inviting locations for expectant dinosaurs.\nEnter Gerald Grellet-Tinner & Lucas Fiorelli. They were the duo who discovered the Sanagasta egg clutches in a valley heavy with geothermal activity. The area is littered with geysers and vents, each around 4 metres high and at least 15 metres wide. Today, they are surrounded by characteristic crystals and minerals, as well as traces of fossilised mud. These signs tell us that all of these structures were already active during the Cretaceous period although they (like the dinosaurs whose eggs they incubated) are long extinct.\nThe eggs themselves told Grellet-Tinner and Fiorelli that they were buried in heavily moist soil. For a start, each egg clutch sites within 3 metres of one of these geothermal structures. The shells have an extensive network of pores. These give them a spongy appearance in cross-section (see below), and they suggest that the eggs were buried in soil that was saturated in water. On the shell’s outer surface, each pore sits between small, rounded nodules that prevent sediment from clogging them up.\nEach huge egg measured around 21 centimetres in diameter. Their shells are almost a centimetre thick and their fragments have been preserved well enough that they could be reassembled into a whole. They are so big and thick that they must have been laid by very large animal indeed, probably one of the giant sauropods. Unfortunately, no skeletons have actually been found so Grellet-Tinner and Fiorelli can’t tell us what species laid these eggs. Whatever they were, they clearly laid their eggs in the valley repeatedly and en masse, forming a long-lasting relationship with this special place.\nIt’s not surprising that at least some extinct dinosaurs did this because some of their living relatives – birds – use the same strategy. The megapodes – a group of birds including brush turkeys and mallee fowl – all bury their eggs in soil that they maintain at specific temperatures, kicking soil on and off an incubation mound and taking the temperature with their sensitive beaks. The rare Polynesian megapode probably comes closest –in its home at Niuafo Island, Tonga, it buries its eggs at nesting sites on that are heated by volcanoes. It’s a strategy that has clearly been around for millions of years.\nReference: Nature Communications http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms1031\nAll images courtesy of Gerald Grellet-Tinner/Lucas Fiorelli\nMore on dinosaur reproduction:\n- Duck-billed dinosaur defended itself by outgrowing predators\n- Dinosaur daddies took care of their young alone\n- Sanajeh, the snake the ate baby dinosaurs\n- Dramatic restructuring of dinosaur feathers revealed by two youngsters of same species']	['<urn:uuid:ecc35b16-1144-4415-b32f-c5445453b96e>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	6	46	576
97	How do actinides transport through geological materials, and what are the health implications of radiation exposure from radioactive materials like actinides?	Actinides can be transported in aquatic systems either in solution or as particles, with their migration influenced by physical chemical interactions on mineral/rock surfaces and with colloids. Their transport behavior involves surface complex formation, mineral dissolution, and precipitation processes. These processes are studied using spectroscopic techniques and modeled using thermodynamic databases. As for health implications, radiation exposure from radioactive materials can cause various adverse effects ranging from mild (skin reddening) to severe (cancer and death). The severity depends on factors like dose amount, radiation type, exposure route, and duration. Children and unborn babies are particularly vulnerable to radiation effects. Exposure is cumulative, similar to sun exposure, and protective measures include minimizing exposure time, increasing distance from the source, and using appropriate shielding.	['Long-lived radionuclides in disposal sites\nIn aquatic systems actinides and radionuclides can be transported in solution or as particles. The knowledge of the physical chemical interactions on the surface of the percolated minerals/rocks as well as those with the generated colloids is essential to characterize both possibilities of migration.\nAim of the research is to identify the dominating surface reactions during the sorption of actinides/radionuclides on mineral, rock and biomolecular surfaces and to qualify/describe them with suitable surface complex formation models. Decomposition into several surface reactions includes the determination of mineral specific parameters like surface binding site density and reactive surface, respectively, as well as cationic exchange parameter. The surface species are verified by spectroscopic techniques such as ATR FT-IR or TRLFS. The investigated surface complex formation constants are integrated in the mineral specific thermodynamic sorption database RES³T (Rossendorf Expert System for Surface and Sorption Thermodynamics) and allow the sorption modelling on complex rocks.\nIt has been shown that decomposition and mineral dissolution and precipitation can significantly influence sorption processes. Therefore the kinetics of dissolution and the formation of secondary phases should be included. This innovative approach leads to a better understanding of sorption processes on geological materials and thereby to enhanced long-term prognoses for radionuclide migration. Special attention is paid to the coupling with thermodynamic databases for aqueous chemistry and mineral formation.\nIn principle this approach of research can also be transferred to colloids having dimensions in nanometer ranges. On one hand colloids exhibit strong sorbat sorbens surface reactions, on the other hand they are not immobile like e.g. rock surfaces. Therefore their colloidal behavior lies between that of real dissolved actinides/radionuclides and that of macroscopic solid phases covered by radionuclides. Relevant colloids are characterized in regard to their chemical and physical properties, namely their interactions with actinides/radionuclides.\nThe long-term aim is to characterize the dissolved and colloidal radionuclide transport via computer programs integratively. This is required to complete the spectrum of characterization and identification methods of colloids and to enlarge the methods for investigating the species and their localization on the solid-liquid interface.\nTransport process studies of dissolved solutes and colloids on the core sample scale are performed by means of GeoPET flow through experiments with complemental geophysical and geochemical characterization of the formations matrix, the fluids and the colloidal system components. These combined methods allow for the conducting of key experiments at the intersection between transport processes and chemical reactions, between experiment and modelling and at the overlap between the pore and the Darcy scales.\nIntermediate Term Requirements and Aims\n- Investigation of reactions and involved species in sorption of actinides/radionuclides on mineral or rock surfaces and in soils\n- Characterization (structural and thermodynamic) of aqueous species and radionuclides incorporated into solid phases\n- Improved understanding of redox-mediated processes, the impact of high temperatures, ionic strengths and pH values on chemical speciation\n- Development and parameterization of surface complexation models\nTherefore research activities dealing with the spectroscopic investigation and the microscopic localization of the surface species will be increased. The focus lies on investigating surface complexation of uranium, extended to other actinides and fission products, in particular Np, Pu, Am, Cm, and Tc. Mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions (e.g. secondary mineralization of uranium) are also included.', 'Radiation & Health Effects\nRadiation and Health\n- Radiation is a form of energy.\n- Radiation comes from man-made sources such as x-ray machines, from the sun and outer space, and from some radioactive materials such as uranium in soil.\n- Small quantities of radioactive materials occur naturally in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, and even in our own bodies. Radiation that goes inside our bodies causes what we refer to as internal exposure.\n- External exposure is from radiation from sources outside our body, such as radiation from sunlight and man-made and naturally occurring radioactive materials.\n- Radiation doses that people receive are measured in units called “rem” or “sievert.” (One sievert is equal to 100 rem.) Scientists estimate that the average person in the United States receives a dose of about one-third of a rem per year.\n- Eighty percent of typical human exposure comes from natural sources and 20 percent comes from artificial radiation sources, primarily medical X-rays\nHealth Effects of Radiation Exposure\n- Radiation affects the body in different ways, but the adverse health consequences of exposure may not be seen for many years.\n- Adverse health effects range from mild effects, such as skin reddening, to serious effect such as cancer and death. These adverse health effects are determined by the amount of radiation absorbed by the body (the dose), the type of radiation, the route of exposure, and the length of time a person is exposed.\n- Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), or radiation sickness, is usually caused when a person receives a high dose of radiation to much of the body in a matter of minutes. Survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs and firefighters responding to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant event in 1986 experienced ARS. The immediate symptoms of ARS are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; later, bone marrow depletion may lead to weight loss, loss of appetite, feeling like you have the flu, infection, and bleeding. The survival rate depends on the radiation dose. For those who do survive, full recovery takes from a few weeks to 2 years.\n- Children exposed to radiation may be more at risk than adults. Radiation exposure to the unborn child is of special concern because the human embryo or fetus is extremely sensitive to radiation.\n- Radiation exposure, like exposure to the sun, is cumulative.\nProtecting Against Radiation Exposure\nThe three basic ways to reduce radiation exposure are through...\n- TIME - Decrease the amount of time you spend near the source of radiation.\n- DISTANCE - Increase your distance from a radiation source.\n- SHIELDING - Increase the shielding between you and the radiation source. Shielding is anything that creates a barrier between people and the radiation source. Depending on the type of radiation, the shielding can range from something as thin as a plate of window glass or as thick as several feet of concrete. Being inside a building or a vehicle can provide shielding from some kinds of radiation.\nOther Sources of Information about Radiation (click the links below for to access these Web sites):']	['<urn:uuid:2ba436d2-1ec3-46a7-9b9e-428490c79c96>', '<urn:uuid:44ba0451-4f0e-435d-a919-ef3e902a7309>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	21	122	1060
98	taking portraits background too messy how make subject stand out	You can use a shallow depth of field to throw the background out of focus while keeping the main subject crisp and in focus. This eliminates the distraction of a busy, cluttered background. You can achieve this by using a larger aperture opening (smaller f-number), shooting from a shorter focusing distance, or using a longer focal length lens.	['When shooting an image, you will often find that keeping the composition as simple as possible results in a stronger and more appealing photo.\nSimpler compositions are easier to process visually because the simplicity makes the subject of the image clear to the viewer. There are no distractions.\nSimplifying a composition means eliminating anything in it that isn’t necessary. You will create a stronger image if you include only the elements that are needed and remove everything else.\nEliminate extraneous elements. Remove distractions. Keep the background simple.\nOf all the compositional skills that work to help us create better images, it seems that simplification is possibly the hardest to put into practice. I think that’s because our eyes see everything. With that, we’ve learned to focus on the subject and ignore everything around it.\nBut to shoot compositions that are simplistic, we have to practice seeing what’s around our subject and then decide what to take out. We need to learn to recognize what we don’t need in our photo.\nHere are some tips for creating simple and more powerful compositions.\nEliminate the Distractions\nMake it a habit of looking over the entire viewfinder before pressing the shutter. Quickly peruse the scene within the viewfinder, keeping an eye out for any extraneous elements that might be intruding into the scene.\nIf you find there’s something that doesn’t belong, recompose, change your camera angle, get closer or zoom in to remove it from the image.\nIn the photos below, you can see how much better the image becomes when the distracting elements are eliminated.\nReduce the Number of Elements in Your Image\nMy first photography teacher was very adamant about this. The strength and impact of a photo is inversely related to the number of elements it contains.\nWith that in mind, evaluate each and every element within the frame of your viewfinder and make sure that each adds something to the image. Keep as few elements as possible.\nUse Depth of Field to Manage Busy Backgrounds\nA shallow depth of field can be used to throw the background out of focus while keeping the main subject of the image crisp and in focus. This can eliminate the distraction of a busy, cluttered background and draw attention to your main subject.\nThere are a several ways to control depth of field.\n- You can use the aperture setting. The larger the aperture opening (and the smaller the f-number), the shorter the depth of field. On a DSLR, shooting in Aperture Priority mode allows you to control the aperture setting while the camera controls the other settings to get correct exposure. On a compact camera, Portrait mode typically gives this same effect.\n- Focusing distance also affects the depth of field. A shorter focusing distance results in a more shallow depth of field.\n- The focal length of your lens influences the depth of field. The longer the focal length (or the more you are zoomed in), the more shallow the depth of field.\nFinally, Simplify Colors too\nI love lots of strong colors.\nBut sometimes a rainbow of bright and vibrant colors can be distracting. Too many colors can take attention away from your subject.\nAvoid surrounding your subject with a lot of colors and, instead, opt for a simpler color palette.']	['<urn:uuid:9d5e5c46-43b0-4d6f-8f1d-39dad2836e66>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	10	58	551
99	crispr cas9 mechanism dna editing process accessibility regulation control different countries	CRISPR-Cas9 works by using Cas9 enzyme as molecular scissors along with RNA that guides it to specific DNA sequences. The system either snips DNA which then rejoins, or installs replacement segments. While CRISPR is remarkably accessible - with DIY kits available for just $150 - regulation varies significantly by country. Canada criminalizes editing inheritable genes with up to 10 years jail time, while China pursues aggressive human experiments. The US Department of Agriculture doesn't regulate CRISPR-modified food at all. This lack of international oversight raises concerns, especially given the technology's power to make permanent genetic changes that could affect future generations.	['How the gene editing system known as CRISPR-Cas9 is transforming how we create animal models of disease.\nLast year, a Chinese group became the first to inject a person with cells that contain genes edited using the CRISPR–Cas9 technique; future trials using the same system are in the works in the US and China.\nBut while much of the excitement around this hot new biological tool relates to its potential for treating human disease or editing human embryos, it is also profoundly changing how we create animal models of disease. The CRISPR-Cas9 system—which consists of a Cas9 enzyme that snips through DNA like a pair of molecular scissors and a small RNA molecule that directs the scissors to a specific sequence of DNA—is fast becoming the preferred methodology for engineering mice because it is much faster than conventional methods. From cancer to Huntington’s, scientists are using CRISPR-Cas9 to generate mouse models of disease and some scientists have begun using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate other animal models.\n“To make a transgenic mouse it used to take 12-18 months using traditional techniques, says Iva Morse, Chief Scientific Officer of Research Models and Services at Charles River. “With the latest techniques such as the CRISPR-Cas9 technology it takes anywhere between 3 months to 9 months.”\nGiven that there are literally thousands of genetically modified animals, and sponsored efforts to knock out every one of those genes, the efficiencies made possible with the CRISPR-Cas9 system is destined to have an enormous impact on laboratories like Charles River that produce transgenic mice on an industrial scale—and the companies that use research animals—primarily mice and rats—to develop and test their drug compounds.\nLast fall Charles River launched a full, end-to-end service offering CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering technology through a licensing agreement with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and developed partnerships with three key groups globally for in vivo model creation services. Other laboratories have also harnessed the power of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to create models on an industrial scale and there are now mouse models—such as the NCG triple-immunodeficient mouse model deficient in T, B and Natural Killer cells—being generated with the CRISPR-Cas9 system.\n“The ability to cut the genome and modify it as game-changer in terms of model creation,” says Prem Premsrirut, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Mirimus, which is partnering with Charles River in using CRISPR and another technology, RNA interference (RNAi) to engineer mouse models for clients.\nMirimus, which was founded in 2010 by scientists from Cold Spring Harbor and Harvard Medical School, started out using RNAi—a natural process of post-transcriptional silencing of genes by small fragments of the nucleic acid—to drive innovative approaches for loss-of-function genetic studies and provide a new path to cancer target identification and validation in vivo. Not long after the first major papers on CRISPR appeared, Mirimus jumped on that technology as well.\nBut it’s still very early days. While it is relatively easy using CRISPR to create knock-out models—where you knock out or inactivate a gene by replacing it or disrupting it with an artificial piece of DNA—it is much harder to knock in genes, says Premsrirut.\n“We still don’t understand how CRISPR cuts in detail to get it to work efficiently every single time,” she said. “That process probably occurs 100 fold or even 1000 fold less than a standard knockout repair.”\nCRISPR can also induce mutations where you don’t want them to be, says Premsrirut. “That is probably one of the dangers of CRISPR. While we can be modifying and creating designer genes we can also be creating mutations at the same time.”\nThis understandably has a number of scientists and ethicists concerned that the field is moving too fast and opening the door to problems that can’t be undone. “Since CRISPR-Cas9 was discovered there have been 1,000s of papers but we still don’t know enough about how it works and the potential for harm that it may cause,” says Premsrirut. “We do need to be careful. It’s a great technology but I think it’s important to also understand what the limitations are.”\n“Like any powerful technology, CRISPR comes with high risks,” Morse says. “The side effects of editing a human genome may not be visible for many, many years, possibly even generations. Being careful is key but proceeding is certainly justified. I do believe in our lifetime we will see diseases cured.”', 'October 8, 2020 — Yesterday the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded jointly to Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier and Dr. Jennifer A. Doudna “for the development of a method for genome editing” through CRISPR/Cas9 genetic scissors.\n“There is enormous power in this genetic tool, which affects us all,” said the chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. “It has not only revolutionised basic science, but also resulted in innovative crops and will lead to ground-breaking new medical treatments.”\nThis marks the first time the Nobel Prize for Chemistry has been awarded jointly to two women, and Drs. Charpentier and Doudna are only the sixth and seventh women in history to win the chemistry prize.\nTo mark this historic occasion, we revisit Luis Granados’ 2018 analysis of CRISPR exploring the profound implications for the future of gene-editing technology.\nThere are some things that are interesting and/or useful to learn about. The causes of the Korean War, Post-Impressionism, how to make a soufflé. There are other things that you really must learn about if you are to be a responsible humanist. Things that fundamentally affect our future as a species fall into this category. Things like CRISPR.\nWhat is CRISPR?\nCRISPR is an acronym for “Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats.” It’s a technique for steering an enzyme, called Cas-9, to a targeted location in the immensely long double helix of DNA. Once there Cas-9 does its thing, which is to snip out a segment of that DNA. The two separated strands then join back together. Or, in a more advanced form, the steering piece (a slice of RNA) can carry with it a replacement segment, which is carefully installed in the proper spot. Some recent research suggests it may be possible to avoid the “snipping” part, and simply use the RNA steering mechanism (aka “biology’s search engine”) to turn particular genes on or off.\nWhat makes CRISPR so special?\nIt’s easy and it’s CHEAP! And it works. DNA, the master code for life, can now be edited almost as easily as this article can be edited. It may not be exaggeration to call CRISPR, as Forbes magazine did last December, “The Next Step in Human Evolution.”\nWhat’s the upside?\nThe days of any number of diseases may be numbered: sickle-cell anemia, muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, diabetes… In agriculture, CRISPR is a vastly more precise (and cheaper) technique for tailoring better (or at least different) animals and plants than “traditional” GMO. (It’s already being used to make a better-tasting beer.) A short step beyond that, CRISPR may also be used to enhance human capabilities, exterminate disease-bearing species like mosquitos, or bring extinct species like the woolly mammoth back to life.\nWhat’s the downside?\nSome people, like me, are a little nervous about the “enhance human capabilities” part. And the unknowable side effects on finely tuned ecological systems. So is Jennifer Doudna, the person most responsible for developing CRISPR in the first place. Like Robert Oppenheimer, the “Father of the Atomic Bomb” who strove to restrict its use, Doudna is raising big red warning flags about going too far, too fast with CRISPR. Example: removing a gene called PSK9 can significantly reduce cardiovascular disease—but it’s also been shown to increase the risk for diabetes.\nCan CRISPR make plants and animals that glow in the dark?\nDoes CRISPR really work as well as advertised?\nIt seems to. There was a kerfuffle last year when researchers reported a suspicion that the Cas-9 was making some random cuts along with the intended ones, but the scientific method has worked its magic and those researchers now admit they were wrong. Moreover, even though the technique has only been around since 2012, the pace at which it’s taking hold is breathtaking. A recent article suggests the CRISPR technique could be used to edit thousands of genes at once, and another CRISPR breakthrough has allowed researchers to turn skin cells into stem cells.\nHow permanent are the genetic changes?\nThat’s a critical question. Some types of changes affect only the organism treated. Others affect the “germline,” so that offspring have at least a 50-50 chance of inheriting the change. This makes a huge difference. If a mutation with unforeseen side effects (or for that matter, intentional harm created by a terrorist) gets loose in the ecosystem, it may be extremely difficult to contain.\nSomething this powerful and dangerous is kept carefully under wraps, right?\nWrong. Just the opposite. You can buy a do-it-yourself CRISPR kit for about $150 and start fooling around with genes in all kinds of organisms to your heart’s content. Last year an foolish exhibitionist injected himself with a CRISPR dose designed to make him more muscular and streamed it live on Facebook. There isn’t much reason yet to believe his effort was successful, but of course he’s spawning copycats. In the agricultural sector, the US Department of Agriculture just announced it’s not going to regulate CRISPR-modified food at all.\nWill CRISPR only be available to the rich?\nKits for experimenting with CRISPR are cheap, but a full-blown program to accomplish a desired goal without causing negative side effects is likely to be quite expensive. We have a terribly hard time paying for medical care as it is—a rush of expensive new enhancement options will ratchet up pressure on a system that’s already broken. My guess is that, yes, many CRISPR options will only be available to the rich. Some people say that’s a problem.\nShould government do more to crack down on this?\nIn Canada, editing genes that can be passed down to future generations is a criminal offense with a maximum penalty of ten years in jail. But that won’t solve the problem by any means. China isn’t cracking down on anything, and is racing ahead with experiments on humans. And no one has any idea what folks are creating with the do-it-yourself CRISPR kits. The regulation of CRISPR would seem to be an urgent topic for an international treaty, but I’m not aware of any movement toward that end.\nWhat can you do?\nLearn as much as you can. The links in this article are a good start. Then, start bugging politicians about what they’re doing about it. This is too big just to keep our fingers crossed and hope everything turns out OK.']	['<urn:uuid:3779347a-2fc0-4235-8df9-a415508e5749>', '<urn:uuid:05c9fa0a-5cd2-4941-8ee5-996924c91ed5>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	11	101	1788
100	How do cyclical tendencies manifest in real-world financial markets, and what makes them valuable for market analysis despite their imperfect nature?	Cyclical tendencies in financial markets manifest as movements in indicator values that repeat periodically. There are two main situations: one where theoretical tops/bottoms exactly match real tops/bottoms (which is rare but well-known to analysts), and another more common situation where the alignment isn't perfect. While perfect alignment is rare, analysts can still use this information in their analysis. A practical example is gold, which tends to top every 2.5 months with a variance of plus or minus 10 days - demonstrating that while it's not a strict rule, it's a tendency that is likely to occur.	"[""A tendency is something likely to happen, although it is not certain that it will happen. Cyclical tendencies are phenomena that are likely to happen regularly, even though there is no guarantee.\nIt’s a sunny, beautiful day. Eric and John meet on their way to work.\nImplication vs. Tendency\nLet's distinguish between two terms: implication and tendency. The difference is subtle, but important. If something tends to happen, it doesn't necessarily mean that it has to happen. For instance, if you like strawberries more than any other fruit, then you most likely tend to buy them more often than other fruit. However, that doesn't mean that you will never buy anything other than strawberries. The same happens in the capital markets because nothing is certain (no implications) therefore, we can only predict (on the basis of tendencies), what is likely to happen.\nTheoretically speaking, a tendency of some indicator is a movement in a specific period of time. Analysis of cyclical tendencies complements Technical Analysis because its focus is time, whereas Technical Analysis is concerned primarily with price. The idea behind Cyclical Analysis is that markets have internal rhythms, and if you are able to identify those cycle periods with a reasonable amount of accuracy, you can then forecast when and where tops, bottoms, support and resistance are likely to develop.\nTypes of Tendencies\nThere are three different kinds of such movements. The first is called a growing tendency and it appears when the values of an indicator regularly increase (think: bull market). The second is called a decline tendency and occurs when the values consistently decrease (think: bear market). The last is a horizontal tendency (think: consolidation) and appears when the value does not fall or rise in a significant way (e.g. the GDP of the US has been constant for the last year and stands at 3.4%).\nIt is worth emphasizing that especially in capital markets a tendency may repeat at certain times. This is called a cyclical tendency and it happens when similar trends occur periodically. Cyclical tendencies are most observable when you look at the historical data of some index. The best way to understand the theory is from real life. A simple example of a cyclical tendency is the growth in consumer spending right before Christmas. Every year at this time Americans tend to spend large sums of money, significantly more than in the middle of the year. This happens year after year; therefore we talk about a growing tendency in expenditures, which repeats every year. In other words we have a cyclical tendency.\nWe can distinguish two situations in the capital markets. The first appears when theoretical tops/bottoms (defined as cycles) exactly coincide with real tops/bottoms. This situation is well known by analysts and investors but, unfortunately, is rarely observed. However, it doesn’t mean that analysts can’t use this knowledge. Moreover, in technical analysis it is not necessary to have actual tops/bottoms line up perfectly with the ideal when researching cyclical tendencies. The second situation appears more often, and as you can imagine, adjusting the theoretical tops/bottoms to real ones isn't ideal, but we are still able to use that information in analysis.\nCyclical Tendencies in Gold - Example\nTo clarify things further, here is an example: Gold tends to top every 2.5 months +/- 10 days. Since we had to include this +/- 10 days to make the sentence true and complete, we know it is not a strict rule, but a tendency which is likely to happen.\nTo sum up, cyclical tendencies are movements in the value of some indicators that repeat periodically. We are able to predict cyclical tendency. Of course, in the capital markets nothing is certain so we can only predict what is likely to happen (no implications). When analyzing cycles or economic trends it is recommended that you useor methods to validate your analysis and to make sure that your prediction is correct.Back""]"	['<urn:uuid:81e6ca03-3bc7-4bc5-9af8-d67298593de2>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:31:35.356953	21	96	655
