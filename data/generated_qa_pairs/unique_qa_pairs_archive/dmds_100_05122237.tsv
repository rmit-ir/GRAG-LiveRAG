1	first program complete chess game history	The first complete chess game programs were developed in 1957 by Alex Bernstein and some Russian programmers independently. This came after Claude Shannon's 1950 paper on computer chess and Alan Turing's 1951 paper-based development of the first program capable of playing a full chess game.	['On May 11, 1997, Deep Blue, a chess-playing supercomputer, defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in the last game of the rematch, and becme the first computer to beat a world-champion chess player in a classic match format.\nFrom The Turk to Computer Chess Programs\nThe story of the chess playing supercomputer started in 1985 with a computer called ChipTest at Carnegie Mellon University by Feng-hsiung Hsu. But actually, the dream of an automated chess player being able to beat a human chess grandmaster is much older. In the late 18th century, The Turk, a fake chess-playing machine constructed in 1770 by Austrian engineer Wolfgang von Kempelen, was the main attraction at the royal court of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. Well, it should take almost 200 years until the development of the very first chess computer program. In 1950, information scientist Claude Shannon published “Programming a Computer for Playing Chess“, one of the first papers on the problem of computer chess. And in 1951, computer pioneer Alan Turing was able to develop on paper the first program capable of playing a full game of chess. An implementation had to wait until 1957, when Alex Bernstein independently some Russian programmers developed the first programs that could play a full game of chess.\nFirst there was Deep Thought\nBut, back to the history of Deep Blue and its predecessors. ChipTest was based on a special VLSI-technology move generator chip developed by Hsu, being controlled by a Sun-3/160 workstation and capable of searching approximately 50,000 moves per second. It’s successor, Deep Thought, named after a fictional computer in Douglas Adams‘ The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Its algorithms were quite simple evaluation functions, but it could examine up to 500 million chess positions per move in tournament games, which is sufficient to reach depth of 10 or 11 moves ahead in complex positions. But, this was not sufficient to beat a human grandmaster. In 1898, Deep Thought was easily defeated in both games of a two-game match with Garry Kasparov.\nWchess and Deep Blue\nNow, IBM held a contest to rename the chess machine and it became “Deep Blue”, a play on IBM’s nickname, “Big Blue” to continue the quest to build a chess machine that could defeat the world champion. In 1995, the Deep Blue prototype played in the 8th World Computer Chess Championship, where it played the computer program Wchess to a draw, while Wchess was running only on a personal computer. In round 5 Deep Blue prototype had the white pieces and lost to the computer program Fritz 3 in 39 moves while Fritz was running on an Intel Pentium 90Mhz personal computer. Should this already be sufficient to beat a human chess grandmaster?\nBrute Force Computing Power\nDeep Blue derived its playing strength mainly out of brute force computing power. It was a massively parallel, RS/6000 SP Thin P2SC-based system with 30 nodes, with each node containing a 120 MHz P2SC microprocessor for a total of 30, enhanced with 480 special purpose VLSI chess chips. Its chess playing program was written in the programming language C and ran under the AIX operating system. It was capable of evaluating 200 million positions per second. On February 10, 1996, Deep Blue became the first machine to win a chess game against Garr Kasparov in Philadelphia, the reigning world champion under regular time controls. However, Kasparov won three and drew two of the following five games, beating Deep Blue by a score of 4–2 (wins count 1 point, draws count ½ point). The match concluded on February 17, 1996. Then, Deep Blue was then heavily upgraded and played Kasparov in a rematch, which has been called “the most spectacular chess event in history”, again in May 1997, winning the six-game rematch 3½–2½, ending on May 11. Deep Blue was able to win the deciding game six after Kasparov made a mistake in the opening, becoming the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in a match under standard chess tournament time controls.\nAt yovisto academic video search, you can learn more about search algorithms, which are part of the core of every chess program working according to the brute force paradigm.

2	factors affecting soil erosion perception fiji cane farmers	Several significant factors affect Fijian cane farmers' perception of soil erosion problems. These factors include age, education, ethnicity, and extension services. Personal characteristics appear to be the main determinants of how farmers perceive soil erosion issues.	"['Factors Affecting the Adoption of Soil Conservation Measures: A Case Study of Fijian Cane Farmers\nThis study explored the extent to which various factors affect Fijian cane farmersâ€™ adoption of soil conservation measures. The significant factors affecting perception of the soil erosion problem include age, education, ethnicity, and extension services. On the other hand, the significant factors affecting soil conservation effort include perception of the erosion problem, net farm income, farm size, land type, and extension services. In general, personal characteristics appear to affect perceptions of soil erosion while the extent of conservation effort is affected by economic and physical factors. The resulting implications for soil conservation policy are discussed.\nVolume (Year): 33 (2008)\nIssue (Month): 01 (April)\n|Contact details of provider:|| Web page: http://waeaonline.org/|\nMore information through EDIRC\nReferences listed on IDEAS\nPlease report citation or reference errors to , or , if you are the registered author of the cited work, log in to your RePEc Author Service profile, click on ""citations"" and make appropriate adjustments.:\n- Doss, Cheryl R. & Morris, Michael L., 2001.\n""How does gender affect the adoption of agricultural innovations?

3	when was vesak holiday restored sri lanka	Vesak Poya was restored as a public holiday in Sri Lanka through a proclamation issued by Governor Sir Arthur Hamilton Gordon on March 27, 1885. This restoration came after the Dutch had abolished the Vesak Poya holiday in 1770 and the British had previously ignored requests to reinstate it.	"['Home Asia Pacific South Asia Sri Lanka\nThe birth of the Buddhist flag\nBy D.C. Ranatunga, Sunday Times, April 29, 2007\nColombo, Sri Lanka -- In recent history, we have not heard of Vesak full moon Poya day falling in April. Vesak has always been celebrated in May. One hundred and twenty two years ago, however, in 1885 Vesak Poya fell on April 28.\n<< The Buddhist flag: A blend of six colours believed to have been exhibited in the aura of the Buddha\nA month earlier, on March 27, 1885, Governor Sir Arthur Hamilton Gordon had issued a proclamation declaring Vesak Poya a public holiday. It was the culmination of a campaign by the Buddhists to get some of their lost rights back. The event called for celebrations and the six-colour Buddhist flag flew high for the first time on that historic Vesak day.\nThe Dutch had abolished the Vesak Poya holiday in 1770 and the British had ignored requests that it be restored. Following the arrival of Colonel Henry Steele Olcott in May 1880, the Buddhist revivalist movement gathered momentum. A Buddhist Defence Committee was formed on his initiative on January 28, 1884 following the inaction by the government to deal with the culprits who attacked a Buddhist procession at Kotahena, killing one person and seriously injuring at least 30 persons.\nThe committee under the presidency of Muhandiram A.P. Dharma Gunawardena met at the Vidyodaya Pirivena at Maligakanda. The other members of the committee were Don Carolis Hewavitarana (Vice President), Carolis Pujitha Gunawardena (Secretary) and H. A. Fernando (Treasurer). Colonel Olcott was appointed an honorary member.\nThe committee considered several issues relating to the injustices meted out to the Buddhists and at the inaugural meeting it was resolved to ask the British government to take action on identified issues. The resolution was proposed by Vice President Don Carolis Hewavitarana supported by J.P. Jayatilake and was seconded by H.A.Fernando.\nAt least six main issues were addressed in a memorandum prepared to be sent to Lord Derby, Secretary to the State for Colonies in London. These were:\n- The need for the culprits of the Kotahena riots to be committed for trial.\n- The British government should follow a policy of religious neutrality or guarantee the religious rights and privileges of the Sinhalese Buddhists.\n- Vesak full moon Poya day be declared a holiday for Buddhist public servants.\n- The removal of all restrictions on the use of national and religious music and the restoration of the right to hold processions which had been enjoyed by the Buddhists from time immemorial.\n- The appointment of Buddhist Registrars of Marriages in Buddhist villages.\n- The removal of anomalies and the formation of a proper management system for Buddhist temporalities.\nColonel Olcott undertook to go to London and personally meet Lord Derby and discuss the issues raised. The Buddhist Defence Committee decided to celebrate the historic announcement of the Vesak holiday and a sub-committee comprising Venerable Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera, Venerable Migettuwatte Gunanada Thera, Don Carolis Hewavitarana, Muhandiram A.P. Dharma Gunawardena, William de Abrew, Carolis Pujitha Gunawardena, Charles A. de Silva, N.S. Fernando, Peter de Abrew and H. William Fernando was appointed to make the arrangements.\nA key item in the programme for celebrations was the ceremonial hoisting of the Buddhist flag in the major temples in and around Colombo.\nThe idea of designing a Buddhist flag was mooted by the Colombo Committee organising the Vesak celebrations and was hailed by Colonel Olcott who made the following observation in his \'Old Diary Leaves\': ""It was at this time that our Colombo colleagues had the happy thought of devising a flag which would be adopted by all Buddhist nations as the universal symbol of their faith thus serving the same purpose as that of the cross does for all Christians. It was a splendid idea and I saw in a moment its far-reaching potentialities as an agent in that scheme of Buddhist unity. Our Colombo brothers had hit upon the quite original and unique idea of blending in the flag the six colours alleged to have been exhibited in the aura of the Buddha.""\nCarolis Pujitha Gunawardena has been credited as the designer of the flag which appeared for the first time in the Sinhalese newspaper \'Sarasavi Sandaresa\' on April 17, 1885. The design consisted of the six colours \'nila\' (sapphire blue), \'pita\' (golden yellow), \'lohita\' (crimson), \'odata\' (white), \'manjesta\' (scarlet) and \'prabhashvara\' (mixture of the five).\nThe flag took the shape of a long streaming pennant which Colonel Olcott commented would be ""quite unsuitable for carrying in processions or fixing in homes"". He suggested that the flag should take the shape and size of usual national flags. The proposal was accepted. And thus was born the Buddhist flag which will be raised at Buddhist homes on Tuesday, May 1, this year\'s Vesak full moon Poya day.']"	['<urn:uuid:97f7f60c-cb8e-4669-9735-4c9a8f8bae31>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	7	49	814
4	I'm researching ancient architectural innovations - can you explain how the Inkas designed their stone buildings to withstand earthquakes in Cusco?	The Inka masonry in Cusco featured a sophisticated design where individual stones were pecked and fitted together with varying numbers of sides. The stones were crafted with slightly curved outward and concave sides that allowed them to slot together while maintaining some flexibility. This small amount of movement capability was intentionally engineered to protect the walls during earthquakes, as Cusco is located in a seismically active area.	['At the breath-taking elevation of 11,200 feet (roughly 3,400 m), the city of Cusco was not just the capital of Tawantinsuyu (“Land of the Four Quarters,” the Inka name for their empire in their native language, Quechua). It was an axis mundi—the center of existence—and a reflection of Inka power. The city was divided into two sections, hanan (upper or high) and hurin (lower), which paralleled the social organization of Inka society into upper and lower moieties (social divisions). Cusco was further divided into quarters that reflected the four divisions of the empire, and people from those sections inhabited their respective quarters of the city. In this way, the city was a map in miniature of the entire Inka empire, and a way for the Inka rulers to explicitly display their power to shape and order that empire. Some scholars think that the city was deliberately laid out so that it was shaped like a puma, symbol of Inka might, but this is still under debate.\nThe masonry of Cusco displays an understanding of stones as being like people, in that many different ones may fit together if they are properly organized. Each individual stone was pecked with tools and fitted to the one next to it, with the result that blocks will have a varied number of sides, such as the famous Twelve-Sided stone in the walls of Hatun Rumiyoq Street. Some sides of each stone were made to curve outward slightly, others to be slightly concave, so that the stones slotted together, while still allowing a small amount of movement. The ability to move a little was important in an area that is seismically active, protecting the walls from earthquakes.\nThe city hummed with activity, both secular and religious. Not only the Inka rulers and their nobles resided in Cusco. Local leaders from all sections of the empire also lived in Cusco—often compelled to do so as a means of controlling their home populations. Girls and young women were drawn from across the empire to the capital to serve as cloistered acllas (“chosen women”): to weave fine cloth for gods and nobles and to make corn beer (chicha) for religious rituals, to serve gods in shrines, and in some cases to be given to Inka favorites in marriage. Young men were also brought to Cusco to be educated and raised in the Inka culture. When they returned to their homes, they would be valuable advocates for Inka traditions and power. In addition to the Inka gods and ancestor mummies kept in the capital, there were also the captured gods of subject peoples, brought there as another means of controlling their followers.\nAt the heart of hurin Cusco was the Qorikancha (“Golden House”), the most sacred shrine of the Inka, dedicated to the worship of the sun. While the Inka had many gods, they claimed descent from the sun, whom they called Inti, and held the sun’s worship above all others. The Qorikancha was the center point of the empire, and from it radiated imaginary lines, called ceques, which connected it to shrines throughout the Cusco valley. Rebecca Stone refers to the ceques as a “landscape calendar and cosmogram,” as the shrines were also a marker of time, with different noble families tending to and holding rituals at the shrines around the ceque system throughout the year.\nAfter the conquest, the Qorikancha was one of many Inka shrines turned into a Christian holy space. The monastery and church of Santo Domingo were built around and on top of the original shrine, incorporating the old structure into the new one in a way that makes for a strange appearance today. Parts of the old temple are still visible, inside and out, alternating with Spanish Baroque architectural features (see image above).\nThe Qorikancha itself was renovated by the first emperor, Pachacuti Inka Yupanqui, after he had a mystical revelation that declared him a divine king. All of the doorways, windows, and wall niches of the Qorikancha were the distinctive Inka trapezoid shape, with doorways double-jambed (see image below) to signify the importance of the building.\nThe exceptionally fine masonry of the Qorikancha was reserved for the most important buildings, since it was even more time-consuming than regular Inka stonework.\nRather than fitting each stone together as an individual shape, creating an irregular-looking surface, here they were shaped into even courses of rectangular blocks, and polished to a smooth finish. The walls were then covered in sheets of gold to signify the shrine’s dedication to Inti, and would have reflected the sun’s rays with a blinding brilliance. But the spectacular, radiant exterior was not the apex of the building’s wonders. Inside, a reproduction of the world in miniature took the shape of a garden made from gold, silver and jewels, with people, animals, and plants. The riches of the Qorikancha would be taken in the looting of the city following the Spanish conquest in 1532, and melted down for their precious materials.\nSaqsa Wayman looks down on the city of Cusco from the northwest. The structure, with its zig-zagging walls, is described as a fortress, although there are still many questions as to how it functioned in that capacity, and the purpose of some of its features is debated. It is possible that it was never finished, or that parts of it were left incomplete at the time of conquest, as Jean-Pierre Protzen has proposed. The stones used to construct it were much larger than those used in the streets and houses of Cusco, as can be seen in the photo at left. The stones were quarried and hauled into place using considerable manpower, obtained through the mit’a, or labor tax, that all able-bodied people of the empire owed the Inka.\nCarolyn Dean, A Culture of Stone: Inka Perspectives on Rock, (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2010).\nRebecca Stone, Art of the Andes: From Chavín to Inca (New York: Thames and Hudson, 2012).\nJean-Pierre Protzen, “The Fortress of Saqsa Waman: Was It Ever Finished?,” Ñawpa Pacha: Journal of Andean Archaeology, no. 25/27 (1987), pp. 155-75.\nRebecca Stone-Miller, Art of the Andes: From Chavín to Inca (New York: Thames and Hudson, 2012).']	['<urn:uuid:b960fdbf-5d29-43c1-a3b0-28892952d8f2>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	21	67	1029
5	Why should kids never wrap lead ropes around their hands?	Wrapping lead ropes around hands or arms could cause a break or major injury if the horse were to spook and pull the rope tight.	['While horses are an amazing experience for kids there are also risks involved so safety has to be paramount. However, with care and attention, it’s easy to instil respect for the dangers without making children fearful and spoiling their enjoyment.\nBy laying down ground rules from the start, using the right kit and equipment and ensuring children are fully aware of all the issues, horse riding can be a safe and beneficial experience for all ages and families.\nThe basics of wearing an appropriate fitting safety helmet, having the right size saddle and appropriately supervised riding sessions should go without saying to keep children safe at all times while riding horses.\nHowever, there are also a number of key areas which children should know about when spending time around horses and handling them, to keep them safe and accident-free. We spoke to Russ from Australia’s top equine classified website, Horseseller, for his advice. Here are his top five safety tips for kids who are spending time with horses:\n- Advise children to always approach a horse shoulder on\nHorses don’t have great vision and have strong blind spots, particularly in the front of their heads. So children need to learn early on that it’s very dangerous to approach a horse head on and they should always approach the animal shoulder on instead. Anyone standing in a horse’s blind spot can cause it to spook and run, which can be incredibly dangerous.\nChildren should also be taught never to duck underneath a horse’s neck as the horse might not see them and could spook. Unfortunately, children do have a tendency to want to go underneath horses so it’s really important they understand the dangers from the beginning.\nLikewise, children often want to sit or crawl around at ground level but around horses, they need to understand that the horse might not be able to see them so it’s important they stand up at all times near a horse. If they make a horse jump it can be incredibly dangerous.\n- Tell children not to run away from a horse, but to face it and back away\nHorses like to play and chase and if a child runs away from them they make think it’s time to play and give chase, which could be dangerous. Children should face the horse and back away, so they can keep their eyes on the animal and show the horse they are not playing, just leaving the field.\nIf a child backs away slowly, the horse will think they are easy to catch and will, therefore, be less likely to start playing chase with them, reducing the risk of danger and potential accident to them.\n- Make sure children know what ears back means\nWhen a horse pins its ears back it means the horse is upset or angry so it’s important that children understand this warning sign. Children are generally good at understanding body language so they won’t have any difficulty making sense of this signal from a horse either.\nThe best way to teach children is to show them when a horse puts its ears back, so they can see and recognise what ears back looks like first hand.\n- Teach children the dangers of wrapping ropes around hands or limbs\nChildren need to understand the danger of wrapping the horse’s lead rope around their hands or arms when holding a horse. Any kind of lead rope or rein around fingers, arms or hands could cause a break or major injury if the horse were to spook and pull the rope tight.\nThe same goes for never leading a horse by its halter with their fingers through the straps – they need to always use a rope and hold the loose bundle of rope within their palm, not wrapped around them.\n- The back end of a horse can kick hard\nIt’s vital for children to understand they should never go behind a horse as the power of a horse’s kick can kill an adult so make sure children know from the start, to stay away from a horse’s hind legs at all times.\nChildren do sometimes get tempted to duck under a horse’s belly as it’s about the right height but they need to understand the dangers of doing this. Children can be too small for a horse to see, so it might not know they are there and get spooked.\nChildren and horses can be a fantastic combination, with many health and fitness benefits associated with riding, as well as the companionship and responsibility of looking after an animal of their own.\nBy providing all of the right equipment during riding, and instilling rules and guidelines for safe behaviour around horses, from the outset, there is no reason why horseback riding can’t become a safe and enjoyable activity for the whole family.']	['<urn:uuid:4d24c51d-6978-45e2-b9f7-d2e30f34528f>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	10	25	810
6	I'm developing a large software project and I'm worried about memory usage. What's special about the Web Modeler compared to the Desktop Modeler when it comes to handling big projects?	Unlike the Desktop Modeler which keeps the whole model in memory, the Web Modeler allows you to edit parts of a model without needing to have the full model in memory. This is particularly beneficial when working with large models.	['Mendix is a model driven fast application development platform.\nThe Mendix Desktop Modeler is used to develop Mendix applications. The desktop modeler is a C# application, running under Windows and has been the only application that can create and change Mendix models.\nThe meta model for the mendix modeling language was embedded in the C# code, and recognizable by the use of C# using annotations. The annotations specified which C# classes were part of the meta model and the storage format used for these classes.\nWhen Mendix decided to start developing a web modeler they realized the need to maintain guaranteed 100% consistency between the meta model used in C# and the one used in the web modeler.\nTo realize this, we defined a custom meta model specification languagu, called MxCore). We then extracted the meta-model from the C# code and used this to generate a first version of the meta model in MxCore. As the C# abnotations were not complete, the meta model needed to be completed manually.\nResulting Meta Model\nThe resulting meta model it currently being used to:\n- Generate C# code, replacing the old manually written C# meta model code.\n- Generate Scale runtime code.\n- Generate meta model documentation references.\n- Generate meta model diagrams for use inside documentation. See the diagrams in [https://docs.mendix.com/apidocs-mxsdk/mxsdk/domain-model-metamodel] for an example.\n- Generate the meta-model schema in JSON for use in the Model Server.\nTogether with the Model SDK, this is th\n******e foundation for the new Web Modeler.\nTo be able to generate all these artefacts in a way that they would fit within the exiisting architecture, we needed annotations on the meta model per generated artefact type. To support this we extended MxCore to allow annotations for the various artefacts.\nThe newly developed artefacts for the Web Modeler and Model SDK are generated directly rom the meta model, without any annotations.\nVersioning models and meta model is often forgotten, or at least added as a (too) late addition. The Mendix Meta Model changes quite a lot, resulting in new versions almost each month. Because of this one of the requirements for the Model SDK is the support for multiple meta model versions with one SDK. This is done though so-called version annotations, which allow a developer to have one meta model specifciation that includes all meta model versions. From this meta model with all versions included we generate Model SDK code that understands all versions of the meta model.\nIn the desktop modeler it has always been feasible to keep the whole model in memory. For the Web Modeler, is is important that you can edit parts of a model without the need to have a full moel in memory. This is especially the case with large models.\nOne of the concept in MxCore is the notion of Model Units. The main idea is that a model is split up into separate model units, where each model unit has a public part (the model unit interface) and a private part. Within a model unit you can only reference elements in other model units though its interface.\nThis concept has been described under the term Partial Models at the ECMDA-FA 2007 conference in Building a Flexible Software Factory Using Partial Domain Specific Models.']	['<urn:uuid:a6af9fb7-8500-4fb7-b7d8-0eb01f1d61d1>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	30	40	545
7	What were the goals for COP 25 outcomes?	COP 25 needed to deliver a strong outcome that adequately responds to the Climate Change Crisis. Specifically, the decisions needed to facilitate enhanced nationally determined contributions, deliver scaled up climate finance - including for loss and damage, and reinforce the objectives of the Paris Agreement without undermining it.	['Statement by the Hon Kausea Natano, Prime Minister of Tuvalu\nTuvalu-PIFS Joint Reception\n10 December 2019\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen\nIt is with great pleasure that I welcome you all to this Blue Pacific reception and extend my appreciation for your efforts to be here, given the many commitments that you all have.\nI have recently assumed the role of Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum with my appointment as Prime Minister of Tuvalu this past September, and so this reception marks my very first official engagement on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum collective. It is most fitting that it is on the margins of one of the most crucial multilateral processes that governs the global conversation on climate change, an issue of great and grave importance to us all.\nExcellencies, Colleagues, the Blue Pacific continent and its peoples face and fear the impacts of climate change now and into our future. The consequences are far reaching and has already impacted and infiltrated all aspects and sectors of our societies, our economies and the integrity of our island and ocean ecosystems. We are not strangers to this.\nThe powerful framing of the Blue Pacific continent by the 50th Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu, has set a strong foundation for heightened political advocacy on climate change action by our collective region. Indeed, the Kainaki Lua Declaration for Urgent Climate Change Action Now! builds on the strong Pacific position advanced at COP 21 in Paris. We have strengthened in our resolve from year to year, including under the presidency of Fiji at COP 23.\nAt its core, the Kainaki Lua Declaration is about our survival – as a people, as economies, as a sea of islands in the largest oceanic continent of the Blue Planet. The political commitment made by our 18 Forum Leaders needs to translate into action within the negotiations and the political discussions and settlements that we engage in and pursue here at COP25.\nUpon reflection, one could offer that the effective translation of Pacific political urgency in regional and global affairs is far too often overlooked, and most especially when it concerns complex multilateral negotiation processes such as the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change. We must ensure that our political commitments count where they matter most – and that is in the negotiating rooms! To this end, may I commend and continue to encourage our negotiators who continue to lead this effort through these multilateral processes, and to commend our partners for embracing our Blue Pacific priorities and principles.\nWe need a strong outcome from this COP 25. We need to ensure an outcome that adequately responds to the Climate Change Crisis that we currently face. The decisions of this COP must facilitate enhanced nationally determined contributions, deliver scaled up climate finance – including for loss and damage, and reinforce the objectives of the Paris Agreement – and not undermine it.\nExcellencies and Colleagues, I see the next few months of my tenure as the Forum Chair as instrumental to progressing and spearheading regional advocacy at the global level on climate change and resilience, among other regionalism priorities. To effectively do this we would need to ensure the strength and solidarity of the Forum collective around the key priorities that the Forum Leaders have identified and committed to through the Kainaki Lua Declaration.\nOur political commitment to these priorities is no secret but how can we position ourselves – as the Blue Pacific collective – to progress with greater clarity and focus – to achieve our common goals and objectives? What form, or forms will regionalism need to take in the future to remain effective and impactful?\nIn today’s context of the climate change crisis that we find ourselves in, and the heightened geopolitical interest in and engagement with our region, the answers to such questions have very real and concrete consequences – for the future of our Pacific region, for the future of our Peoples and for how we optimise our Prospects now and in the future.\nBefore I conclude, Excellencies and colleagues, allow me to touch briefly on the importance of regionally grown and led efforts. The Pacific region continues to spearhead innovative resilience initiatives globally, including the multi-stakeholder approach to integrating climate change and disaster risk considerations in resilient development decisions and action to implement the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific.\nBuilding on this, we are now working to establish innovative regional risk financing instruments and mechanisms to support resilient development, such as the Pacific Resilience Facility which seeks to focus on preparedness by retrofitting and risk-proofing development investments for those on the frontline of risk impacts – being our communities; as well as the Pacific Islands Climate Change Insurance Facility.\nPartnerships are absolutely crucial to the achievement of our regional priorities – we all recognise this. I call on you all to support the Blue Pacific region in progressing our efforts and positions for a climate resilient future for our economies, for our peoples (now and into the future) and for our place.\nI thank you.']	['<urn:uuid:3a9776e1-a55a-4157-8822-0b29c11e79c5>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	8	48	847
8	harlem renaissance african american artists writers musicians sugar hill neighborhood who lived there great migration impact	During the Harlem Renaissance between World War I and mid-1930s, Sugar Hill in Harlem became home to numerous prominent African-Americans including civil rights activists (W.E.B. Du Bois, Walter White), literary authors (Langston Hughes, Ralph Ellison), and musicians (Cab Calloway). This cultural movement coincided with the Great Migration, when hundreds of thousands of African Americans moved to northern cities like New York, creating the largest concentration of black people in the world in Harlem. The migration led to cultural exchange between races, with black and white musicians performing together in clubs throughout the area.	"['Community Gathering & Celebration\nof Black, Afro-Latinx and the African-Diasporic Togetherness & Resistance in the Americas\nTOGETHER WE CAN RESIST ALL EVIL\n10:30 am Worship with storyteller Joy Kelly Smith\nfollowing worship: music and dance, and food for everyone!\nAn African-American holiday, celebrated by enslaved and free Black people, including African music, song and dance.\nA variation of the Dutch word \'Pinksteren\' meaning Pentecost. Dutch colonizers in present-day New York State brought the celebration of Pinkster to North America in the 17th century. However, by the 19th century, Pinkster had evolved into a primarily African-American holiday, celebrated by enslaved and free Black people, including African music, song and dance.\nSome time between 1811 and 1813 despite or perhaps because of its popularity, the city of Albany, New York passed an ordinance banning the drinking and dancing associated with Pinkster. White leaders were concerned that the congregation and socialization of large groups of African Americans could provide them with the opportunity to plot or plan revolution. This law was only repealed in 2011.\n(more info below)\nCelebrating the Black and African-diasporic Community of Harlem\nHarlem has long since been a space for the black and African-diasporic community to gather. According to the Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture:\n""With the end of the Civil War in 1865, hundreds of thousands of African Americans newly freed from the yoke of slavery in the South began to dream of fuller participation in American society, including political empowerment, equal economic opportunity, and economic and cultural self-determination. Unfortunately, by the late 1870s, that dream was largely dead, as white supremacy was quickly restored to the Reconstruction South. White lawmakers on state and local levels passed strict racial segregation laws known as “Jim Crow laws” that made African Americans second-class citizens... Hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) perpetrated lynchings and conducted campaigns of terror and intimidation to keep African Americans from voting or exercising other fundamental rights.\nWith booming economies across the North and Midwest offering industrial jobs for workers of every race, many African Americans realized their hopes for a better standard of living—and a more racially tolerant environment—lay outside the South. By the turn of the 20th century, the Great Migration was underway as hundreds of thousands of African Americans relocated to cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit, Philadelphia, and New York.\nThe Harlem section of Manhattan, which covers just three square miles, drew nearly 175,000 African Americans, giving the neighborhood the largest concentration of black people in the world. Harlem became a destination for African Americans of all backgrounds. From unskilled laborers to an educated middle-class, they shared common experiences of slavery, emancipation, and racial oppression, as well as a determination to forge a new identity as free people.\nThe Great Migration drew to Harlem some of the greatest minds and brightest talents of the day, an astonishing array of African American artists and scholars. Between the end of World War I and the mid-1930s, they produced one of the most significant eras of cultural expression in the nation’s history—the Harlem Renaissance... Alain Locke, a Harvard-educated writer, critic, and teacher who became known as the “dean” of the Harlem Renaissance, described it as a “spiritual coming of age” in which African Americans transformed “social disillusionment to race pride.” T\nhe Harlem Renaissance encompassed poetry and prose, painting and sculpture, jazz and swing, opera and dance. What united these diverse art forms was their realistic presentation of what it meant to be black in America, what writer Langston Hughes called an “expression of our individual dark-skinned selves,” as well as a new militancy in asserting their civil and political rights.""', 'The title of the song refers to the A line of New York\'s subway train service. At the time of the song\'s conception, this line ran from Brooklyn, up into Harlem, and then northern Manhattan where it used the express rails.\nAlthough traditionally played as an instrumental, \'Take The A Train\' does have lyrics. Since most jazz pieces are centered more around instrumentalists, the lyrics are minimal. The following also only represents one version of what can be sung. As is typical of the genre, lyrics and even the instrumental parts often change from performance to performance and musician to musician.\nTo go to Sugar Hill way up in Harlem\nIf you miss the A Train\nYou\'ll find you\'ve missed the quickest way to Harlem\nHurry, get on, now, it\'s coming\nListen to those rails a-thrumming (All Aboard!)\nGet on the A Train\nSoon you will be on Sugar Hill in Harlem\nSo, why are we taking the A Train, why are we going to Harlem, and why are we in such a hurry to get there?...\nWe\'re not just going to Harlem, today, we\'re going to Sugar Hill. Sugar Hill in Harlem, New York was the mythic hub of the Harlem Renaissance which took place between the two World Wars. Sugar Hill was the ritziest, fanciest African-American neighborhood in the whole United States. It wasn\'t just the place where Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn lived. No...Sugar Hill was ""the good life.""\nDuring the early 20th century, Harlem was ""en vogue"". For many decades prior to the 1920\'s and 1930\'s, African-Americans from all over the country dreamed of living here. There were stately homes and apartments to live in, and the entire area had its own uptown, high-society quality about it, which is what gave way to the name \'Sugar Hill\'. The \'Sugar\' part refers to money and the sweet life.\nAs for the \'Hill\', the Sugar Hill neighborhood is actually part of the Hamilton Heights, and sits on a bluff above the Harlem Plain. More specifically, it extends westward from Edgecomb to Amsterdam Avenues. The southern boundary is typically placed at W. 145th St. The heart of Sugar Hill, however, is found between 144th and 155th streets.\nThe area attracted many African-Americans who would later become famous; their fame and notoriety would aid in the advancement of colored people and open many doors for future generations. In these few short blocks lived:\n~Civil rights activists - W.E.B. Du Bois, Walter White, Roy Wilkins, and the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell, Sr.\n~Literary authors - Langston Hughes, Ralph Ellison, and Zora Neale Hurston\n~Musicians - Cab Calloway and Paul Robeson\n~Politicians - Thurgood Marshall\nAs the term suggests, the Harlem Renaissance was the rebirth of discovery, learning, and expansion for people of color, and Sugar Hill was the heart of it all. This new movement sparked change in urban centers from far and wide. This upswing taught intellectuals and artists alike to find new ways to explore the historical experiences of black America and black life in the urban North. Virtually no subject was left unexplored. This revolution took place across the cultural spectrum, appealing not only to performance artists (dance, literature, drama, visual art, music) but also to students of social thought (philosophy and sociology).\nSome might say that this Harlem Renaissance was part of the original spark that caused the Civil Rights Movement. Following so closely on the coattails of the single greatest issue of the Civil War, the Harlem Renaissance allowed black Americans to focus on their past, as well as develop for themselves a unique identity for their future - a culture within a culture. This rebirth brought the people close to their roots, but also fostered the emergence of a new culture within America, hence the term ""African-American"". The residents of Sugar Hill would be a beacon to the rest of black America that the old European racist, paternalistic way was no longer acceptable. However, the Harlem Renaissance was not a time of hostility and violence. Instead, it urged dignity, creativity, and exploration of the intellect to help begin to transform us into a diverse but equal society.\nDuring this time, history records what is called ""The Great Migration"". This term describes the result of the war effort\'s need for unskilled industrial labor on America\'s small black communities. During this time, hundreds of thousands African-Americans moved into more urban areas (like Chicago, Philadelphia, Cleveland, New York) seeking employment. The result was the sudden expansion of the black communities. With this sudden cultural explosion within America\'s big cities there came a greater market for what the black culture had to offer. It wasn\'t long before the black and white cultures began to intermingle, share, and trade. For example, the music of the South came north with the migrants, and soon the ""black music"" was ALSO being played by white musicians in night clubs and hot spots all around town (and the black musicians would play right along side WITH the white musicians and learn from each other). In fact, many white artists and patrons even offered African-Americans access to mainstream publishers and art venues.\nSo, now that we know a little more about what was waiting for us at the end of the line, we can see that that\'s why it was imperative that we Take The A Train (remember those Manhattan tracks are an express!) and get off at Sugar Hill, Harlem, New York! We just had to!! =D\n""Take The A Train"" - Duke Ellington, 1962\nHere is an earlier recording of Duke Ellington\'s piano trio version\n~Informatio track-ed down from places like:']"	['<urn:uuid:d4b63e4a-e927-4422-bb8d-27ead8e0c2f2>', '<urn:uuid:e24e2c69-b5f4-46ff-ac05-675717b18256>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	16	93	1552
9	I've heard that metal fatigue is a big problem in engineering. Can someone explain what makes these fatigue cracks worse and what factors engineers need to watch out for?	Several key factors make fatigue cracks worse in metals: Temperature variations play a major role, especially when combined with stress fluctuations. The ratio between minimum and maximum stress (R Ratio) significantly affects crack growth - a higher R Ratio of 0.7 shows faster crack growth compared to 0.1. The relative loading levels are extremely important in determining fatigue crack growth life. Additionally, the material's crystal structure and orientation matter - in single crystal materials, the orientation affects how cracks grow, particularly at higher temperatures. Engineers must also consider oxidation effects and the material's microstructure. These factors collectively affect the durability and reliability of machines and industrial devices, making material selection crucial for construction longevity.	['Characterization and modeling of thermo-mechanical fatigue crack growth in a single crystal superalloy\nTurbine engine blades are subjected to extreme conditions characterized by significant and simultaneous excursions in both stress and temperature. These conditions promote thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) crack growth which can significantly reduce component design life beyond that which would be predicted from isothermal/constant load amplitude results. A thorough understanding of the thermo-mechanical fatigue crack behavior in single crystal superalloys is crucial to accurately evaluate component life to ensure reliable operations without blade fracture through the use of “retirement for cause” (RFC). This research was conducted on PWA1484, a single crystal superalloy used by Pratt & Whitney for turbine blades.\nInitially, an isothermal constant amplitude fatigue crack growth rate database was developed, filling a void that currently exists in published literature. Through additional experimental testing, fractography, and modeling, the effects of temperature interactions, load interactions, oxidation and secondary crystallographic orientation on the fatigue crack growth rate and the underlying mechanisms responsible were determined. As is typical in published literature, an R Ratio of 0.7 displays faster crack growth when compared to R = 0.1. The effect of temperature on crack growth rate becomes more pronounced as the crack driving force increases. In addition secondary orientation and R Ratio effects on crack growth rate were shown to increase with increasing temperature. Temperature interaction testing between 649°C and 982°C showed that for both R = 0.1 and 0.7, retardation is present at larger alternating cycle blocks and acceleration is present at smaller alternating cycle blocks. This transition from acceleration to retardation occurs between 10 and 20 alternating cycles for R = 0.1 and around 20 alternating cycles for R = 0.7. Load interaction testing showed that when the crack driving force is near KIC the overload size greatly influences whether acceleration or retardation will occur at 982°C. Semi-realistic spectrum testing demonstrated the extreme sensitivity that relative loading levels play on fatigue crack growth life while also calling into question the importance of dwell times. A crack trajectory modeling approach using blade primary and secondary orientations was used to determine whether crack propagation will occur on crystallographic planes or normal to the applied load.\nCrack plane determination using a scanning electron microscope enabled verification of the crack trajectory modeling approach. The isothermal constant amplitude fatigue crack growth results fills a much needed void in currently available data. While the temperature and load interaction fatigue crack growth results reveal the acceleration and retardation that is present in cracks growing in single crystal turbine blade materials under TMF conditions. This research also provides a deeper understanding of the failure and deformation mechanisms responsible for crack growth during thermo-mechanical fatigue. The crack path trajectory modeling will help enable “Retirement for Cause” to be used for critical turbine engine components, a drastic improvement over the standard “safe-life” calculations while also reducing the risk of catastrophic failure due to “chunk liberation” as a function of time. Leveraging off this work there exists the possibility of developing a “local approach” to define a crack growth forcing function in single crystal superalloys.\nAuthor: Benjamin Scott Adair, Dissertation; George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering; Georgia Institute of Technology; August, 2013', 'The Development of Fatigue Cracks in Metals\nDariusz Rozumekdownload PDF\nAbstract. The work presents the development of fatigue cracks in metals (review article). In particular, the reasons for the growth of fatigue cracks, models of the development of cracks, cracks initiation and propagation for various modes as well as effects of the cracks growth were presented. Fatigue of materials, especially the formation of fatigue cracks and their growth, belong to the important problems of solid mechanics. Designers and constructors of machines and industrial devices are focusing their attention on problems concerning durability and reliability of these devices. Therefore, the engineering materials that are used to construct devices should have the best properties, because choosing the right material affects, to a large extent, the durability of construction.\nFatigue Crack Growth, Microstructure, Load, Mixed Mode\nPublished online 5/25/2019, 7 pages\nCopyright © 2019 by the author(s)\nPublished under license by Materials Research Forum LLC., Millersville PA, USA\nCitation: Dariusz Rozumek, The Development of Fatigue Cracks in Metals, Materials Research Proceedings, Vol. 12, pp 124-130, 2019\nThe article was published as article 18 of the book Experimental Mechanics of Solids\nContent from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.

10	As a nutritionist studying food sustainability, I'm curious about the relationship between seasonal produce, nutritional value, and environmental impact - what are the three key connections between these factors?	There are three important connections between seasonal produce, nutrition, and environmental impact: 1) Seasonal produce has higher nutrient content because it's harvested at peak ripeness and has less time between harvest and consumption, as nutritional value decreases over time, 2) Seasonal produce has a lower carbon footprint since it doesn't require heated greenhouses or extensive transportation, and 3) Seasonal foods support our bodies' natural needs - for example, spring vegetables like spinach help alkalize our bloodstream and energize us for increased warm-weather activity.	['The sun lingers a little longer in the sky and the evening breeze feels warmer and more inviting. Flowers are emerging from dormant hibernation and birds have returned to wake us from restful post-winter slumbers. Nature’s rhythms are telling us one thing: spring is on its way! But the return of spring doesn’t merely entail a return to mid-afternoon picnics in the park. It also indicates that a rich and bountiful change is underway in the complexity and the breadth of fruits and vegetables that we can seasonally introduce into our diets.\nIn today’s convenience driven, season blind food economy archaic concepts like seasonality seem dated and passe. We can all be forgiven for buying into the illusion that seasons no longer matter in the modern food system. We have never been limited by lack of availability because our supermarkets have in many ways ruptured the holistic cycle of nature by charting across hemispheres and crossing oceans to ensure year round supply of the produce we love.\nBenefits of Eating Seasonal Produce\nReduced Carbon Footprint\nOne of the most salient benefits to eating seasonally is that you are effectively reducing your carbon footprint and supporting a more geographically sustainable food economy. We are rarely encouraged to think about the physical lengths our food travels before arriving on the market shelves. And all of this travel comes with a hefty environmental cost that is concealed from the consumer’s eye.\nReduced Pesticide Consumption\nIn addition to the fossil fuels used to transport out-of-season produce to all corners of the world a little something extra needs to be added into the mix to keep these jet set fruits and veggies fresh. This ‘something’ would be pesticides and preservatives. Let’s get real: a grapefruit that travels for three days to reach its final home needs a little pick me up to look the fresh and plump part we consumers have come to expect. Pesticides and preservatives are an unfortunately pervasive part of the modern food system and some of these pesky little intruders will inevitably make their way into our diets. However, by avoiding out of season produce and choosing locally grown – and organic where possible – we can minimize the intake of these chemicals. The bottom line is that researchers are still ambiguous about the long term effects of high pesticide consumption. My perspective? Why risk the extra intake.\nHigh Intensity Nutrients\nIn tandem with the environmental karma, you’ll accrue eating seasonally, you’ll also be infusing your diet with a saturation of vital minerals and unretouched flavors and colors. Seasonal produce is generally harvested at its peak so it retains its full nutrient and vitamin content. Because it has naturally ripened on the vine or in the ground it will have a more complex and rich flavor. It’s no lie that the juiciest and most vibrant tasting fruits and veggies are those that are in season. Nature is wiser than we acknowledge and seasonal foods support season specific needs. After a long winter, the human body craves detoxification and longs to shed the extra weight of winter. Spring vegetables like spinach help to alkalize our bloodstream and energize us for the warmer months when we typically expend more energy being active.\nOn a deeper level, eating in harmony with the cycles of nature connects us more deeply to the earth and fosters in us a respectful reverence for the food we eat. It may sound kind of out there but many holistic nutritionists argue that getting in touch with the earth helps us get in touch with ourselves and our natural rhythms.\nHow to Choose Seasonal Produce\nYear round industrially grown food often appears airbrushed: with a photoshopped perfection that seems at odds with its origins in the dirt. Seasonal food allows us to experience all of the authentic contours of our fruits and vegetables, deviations included. This allows us to appreciate the realness of our food, and acknowledge it is a gift from the soil and not a replica from a production line. The best advice we can give newbie seasonal shoppers is to be open minded to the natural state of the produce, flaws and all! The best seasonal produce will be locally grown and organic and will, therefore, resemble all of nature’s creations: imperfect and delightfully unique. Light bruises, bumps, asymmetrical bodies…don’t let these features deter you. I consider these an encouraging sign that the integrity of the produce has been retained rather than compromised in favor of false flawlessness.\nSeasonal Spring Produce\nThe naked truth of the natural world is that every fruit and vegetable shines its brightest when in season. This year I challenge you to think about your food as something that comes from the earth, rather than from the neon aisles of the local market. Not only will this provide you with insight into the rhythms of the natural world (that farmers have adhered to for millennia) but will give you a new appreciation for your food. There is a simple joy in discovering and consuming the fruits and vegetables that nature designed for your specific temporal and geographic locale.\nSome of our favorite seasonal produce picks (and their associated health benefits) are as follows:\n● Artichokes: Chock full of potassium, fiber, and iron this wonder veggie promotes liver health.\n● Asparagus: Versatile and rich, asparagus is an amazing source of Vitamin K and folate. This Veggie Penne Pasta is a great way to increase your asparagus intake.\n● Celeriac: This unusual veggie contains a veritable who’s who of all your most vital minerals! These make amazing oven baked fries.\n● Fennel: This licorice like veggie is a perfect addition to spring salads- and it’s an antioxidant to boot!\n● Fiddlehead Ferns: A whimsical looking veggie that is rich in Vitamin C and Vitamin A and beautiful in salads\n● Mustard Greens: Host to a wealth of nutrients and vitamins C, K, and A, mustard greens are a promoter of positive cardiovascular health.\n● Peas: These go down easy as anything and they’re high in filling fiber, too! Try this Veggie Primavera for a big helping of spring peas!\n● Radishes: Tasty and colorful, radishes are pretty on the inside too; offering antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits. This creamy roasted vegetable soup is delish\n● Rhubarb: This root veggie has a rep for being a bit of a tart but rhubarb’s true power lies in its density of fiber and magnesium! Add to homemade granola for a sour kick.\n● Scallions: These little guys play well with others, sprucing up everything from guacamole to salads to omelets. This Garden Fresh Fritatta is the perfect healthy make ahead breakfast with tons of veggies including scallions.\n● Spinach: A wonder veggie if we’ve ever seen one. High in iron and Vitamin K, spinach shines its brightest in the mildly warm climes of April. Try this Sweet and Simple Spinach Salad or this Garden Fresh Fritatta to enjoy the all the benefits of spinach.\n● Watercress: Iodine, iron, calcium, beta-carotene, Vitamins B6 and K – she’s got it all!\n● Avocados: Yes, this healthy fat and folate packed fruit du jour shines its best in Spring, despite the prevalence of trendy avocado dishes available year round. Try our Berry Avocado Smoothie Bowl for a delicious taste of avocados.\n● Grapefruits: Coming into their own in March, grapefruits are delicious sources of Vitamins A and C.\n● Pears: Hearty and fiber-rich these cottage kitchen staples are delicious raw or grilled. Try them in this creative and comforting salad\n● Strawberries: A vibrant dose of Vitamin C, spring strawberries are particularly sweet. Reach out for some organic seasonal berries for all the goodness without the pesticides. Try this Strawberry Basil Lemonade for a refreshing dose of these sweet berries.\nAs you store your sweaters and look forward to the flowers, sunshine, and relaxed mood of spring be sure to read up on the produce that is in season in your unique location. I love the website Seasonal Food Guide. It provides detailed regional overviews of seasonal produce, month by month.', 'Often, we hear about the nutritional and flavorful benefits of eating seasonally, but what about the environment?\nWhile it’s possible to shop for out-of-season fruit and vegetables at the grocery store at any time, buying in-season produce brings undeniable benefits. We know that eating plenty of fruit and vegetables is part of a healthy diet. Our bodies need fiber, minerals, and vitamins to function. Naturally, plant foods do have a smaller environmental footprint.\nBut it’s important to think about how we can all do our part for the planet. So, how does eating seasonally help the environment? We’re here to answer your questions and dive into what it really means to eat seasonally.\nEvery fruit and vegetable has certain conditions in which it thrives. For instance, raspberries grow best in sunny conditions, so they are naturally the perfect summer fruit. Another example of seasonal crop production comes via oranges, which love hot summers like those found in Spain or Italy.\nWhen you eat fruit and vegetables in season, it means they were grown and harvested in the ideal conditions where the plants naturally flourish.\nBut sometimes knowing what foods are in season can get a little confusing. The word “seasonal” is often used to describe foods harvested in the local area or it can pertain to the plant being grown and harvested in a more “traditional” fashion. While none of these things are negative, they do show how labeling seasonal food can be tricky.\nThe most basic definition to keep in mind is that essentially, seasonality of food refers to the time when the produce is at its peak.\nAt its core, seasonal food is fresh produce ripe for eating and grown in conditions where it naturally thrives. Want to find out what produce to buy and when? Read our guide to seasonal vegetables and fruits.\nWe don’t have to tell you that the food we eat affects our health. But what we eat also has an environmental impact. Industrial agriculture produces pollution in the air, soil, and water. Animals raised for food purposes produce a ton of waste, like methane gas. Air emissions from livestock make up 14.5% of all global greenhouse gas emissions. It’s not just animal agriculture that harms the environment; traditional crop production can affect soil health and cause soil erosion.\nWhile it’s important to think about greenhouse gasses, there’s even more going on. The environmental impact of food production seeps into the water and soil. We also have to think about fertilizers, land use, water footprint, and the effects on natural habitats and biodiversity.\nThe impact of food on the environment is tabbed by a metric called the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). This is a technique that evaluates the potential environmental effects of a product through its whole life cycle. So, from production and distribution to use and end-of-life, the entire life cycle is considered. It includes inputs like growing, harvesting, storing, and consumption.\nTo put it into perspective, researchers have found that the global food system accounts for about 26% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. But, it’s important to know that there’s a big variation between types of food. For example, animal-based foods typically have a higher footprint than plant-based foods, especially lamb and cheese. While poultry and pork usually have lower footprints, they are still higher than most plant-based foods.\nSo, what about fruit and vegetables? Why is seasonal food better for the environment?\nEating seasonal fruits and veggies usually means less distance to travel from harvest site to plate. If we think about seasonality and dietary requirements, eating seasonally could help us step towards a more sustainable way of living, especially on a global level. We also have to consider that it’s not just how far food has traveled but the cost on the environment from production to consumption.\nLet’s break it down.\nIf we grow tomatoes outside but out of season, we need heated greenhouses, which have a higher carbon footprint. Surprisingly, growing tomatoes in season in another country and then shipping them still results in lower emissions.\nAs you can see, buying local produce doesn’t automatically make it the more environmentally friendly choice. While there can be environmental benefits of local produce, there’s a lot more going on that we need to consider. It’s not just about the location. What’s important is that we’re choosing in-season fruit and veg grown outside without artificial help. So, no heating, lighting, or refrigeration. Just some good old-fashioned sunshine and water.\nResearch suggests that eating fresh and seasonal fruit and vegetables is more nutritious. This is because the nutritional value peaks after harvesting and decreases over time. So, the longer it takes to transport and get your hands on fruit and veg, the lower the nutritional value. After picking, chemical changes naturally occur that eventually lead to spoilage and deterioration of the produce.\n(Quick shameless plug for kencko – through freeze drying the fruits and veggies that go into our smoothies, we essentially hit “pause” on these processes and preserve the nutritional content of the produce.)\nThat said, it’s important to know that eating any fruit and vegetables is still great for your health. While there appears to be some loss in micronutrients, they remain full of nutrients and antioxidants that our bodies love.\nThe short answer is 100% yes. (The slightly longer answer is 100% yes, when possible, but any fruit and veggies is better than no fruit and veggies.)\nThere’s just something about sweet, in-season, and perfectly ripe fruit and vegetables. In-season produce is fresher and often cheaper than out-of-season crops. Buying local and seasonal fruit and vegetables is usually more environmentally friendly.\nReducing food’s environmental impact is a huge undertaking that will take effort from producers, consumers, and policymakers to identify solutions. Choosing local and seasonal produce is just one part of the sustainable puzzle, but one that as consumers we can do our best to directly impact. We can’t overlook other dietary behaviors that could have a greater environmental impact, like reducing meat consumption or lowering overall excess and waste.\nEating fewer animal-based products reduces the demand for meat production. In turn, this means we need less land for animals and lowers the environmental damage that comes from the meat industry. It’s easy to think that an individual choice isn’t going to do much. But as a collective, people are powerful and dietary changes can result in a positive effect.\nA sustainable diet focuses on eating patterns that not only encourage healthy eating but have less environmental impact. To follow a sustainable diet, it looks like what you eat is especially important, not just where your food is grown.\nWhile it’s great to choose local and seasonal produce, taking a wider view of global seasonality can benefit the environment. It’s not always black and white, especially if you live somewhere with very limited growing seasons. All over the world, food can grow consistently in its natural and optimal conditions throughout the year. Eating seasonally can help to reduce our environmental footprint.\nBetween misleading marketing and questionable labeling, it’s tricky to determine which fruit and vegetables are the most environmentally friendly option. Sometimes, you might see a sign of the country of origin, but it’s practically impossible to say if it was grown outside, in a greenhouse, or what type of transportation was used.\nWhile the labeling catches up with the demand for transparency, here are some helpful tips we use to choose fruit and vegetables that are kinder on the planet:\n1. Be wary of the combination of out-of-season, very perishable, and air freighted. When fruit and vegetables are perishable, it means they go off quicker. So, to counteract this, companies will use planes for transport which causes a massive uptick in food’s GHG emissions. Typically, this includes out-of-season:\n2. Out-of-season Mediterranean-style produce is usually grown in heated greenhouses or other more energy-intensive fashions, which in turn increases GHG emissions. Produce to consider reducing out-of-season include:\n3. Learn about your country or state’s seasonal produce so you can know what to look out for at the farmer’s market. The Seasonal Food Guide is another great place to start exploring seasonal food.\nFruit and vegetables grown in optimal conditions in their natural season and consumed in the same country tend to be more environmentally friendly. These foods travel fewer miles and don’t need to rely on additional heat or light to grow. But remember that eating seasonal fruit and vegetables takes a step toward a more sustainable world. We also need to think about how reducing animal-based foods and food waste forms part of a sustainable world too.\nWant to eat more seasonal fruit and veg without worrying about the time of year? Add a kencko smoothie to your morning routine. We freeze dry our fruit and veg at the time of harvesting, securing all those nutrients our bodies need, and making for lighter transit weights.']	['<urn:uuid:08c08986-fc5e-4593-b591-4a0255166224>', '<urn:uuid:667d772a-4270-4da8-89bc-361b35cb76d8>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	29	83	2834
11	Which ballet company did both Aleksey Babayev and Jodie Gates work at?	Both Aleksey Babayev and Jodie Gates worked at the Joffrey Ballet - Aleksey as a student at the Kirov Academy of Ballet before joining Stanislavsky Ballet, and Jodie as a principal dancer.	['Aleksey Babayev, was born in Moscow, Russia and then immigrated with his family to America at a young age. He began his training at the Academy of International Ballet, under his parents Anastasia Babayeva and Denis Gronostayskiy. After finishing his training at the Kirov Academy of Ballet, he moved back to Russia to work at the Stanislavsky Ballet. After 3 years, Aleksey joined the Philadelphia Ballet, quickly becoming a soloist. This is his first\nyear at Richmond Ballet.\nOur professional company is made up of elite dancers from around the world who have helped earn Richmond Ballet critical acclaim. Dance/USA says Richmond Ballet is “a jewel among U.S. dance companies,” while The Washington Post calls it “a company to which dance fans everywhere ought to pay attention.” We’re proud of all that our company dancers bring to Richmond, and the world.\nRichmond Ballet II, our second performing company, is comprised of talented young dancers between the ages of 18 and 22. RBII members perform their own diverse repertoire on tour across the Commonwealth as well as alongside the main company in mainstage productions.\nRBII Apprentices are the top level of the Pre-Professional Division of School of Richmond Ballet. They receive an intensive training program, full scholarship, living stipend and are the bridge to RBII, our second company. Their time is divided between RBII rehearsals and the Trainee Program, performing in Lecture Demonstrations, Richmond Ballet Company mainstage performances and the end of season showcase performance with RB Trainees.\nRichmond Ballet II Apprentices\nSeated (L-R): Gianna DeMassio, Rachel Nash\nStanding (L-R): Michael Duncan, Hannah MacLeod, Darius Mealy\nFounded in 1993, the nationally recognized Richmond Ballet Trainee Program offers select advanced students a transitional experience to bridge the gap between the academic ballet setting and the world of professional dance. The Richmond Ballet Trainee Program is one of the few in this country that enables aspiring dancers to pursue formal dance training and gain valuable performance experience with a professional company.\nRichmond Ballet Trainees - Second and Third Years\nFirst Row- Senior Trainees: Kennady Jackson, Sarah Shaw, Gabrielle Goodson\nSecond Row: Katrina May Thomas, Sheridan Brown, Anna Orzulak, Parker Edmondson, Kendall Taylor, Ella Warren\nThird Row: Carter Bush, Gavin Haas, Cade Bolz, Garrett Janiak, Daniel Miller\nRichmond Ballet Trainees - First Year\nFirst Row: Anne Pearson Gremer, Kristen Soyars Green, Isabella Vanik\nSecond Row: Gillian Carr, BriAnna Binzak, Savannah Wyatt, Claire Kehoe, Alexis Dawson, Kinsey Phelps, Chelsea Hacking\nThird Row: Kiera Luci Dulog, Gillian Grossman, Oliver Gardner, Sydney Stutzman, Benjamin Piner\nThe Artistic Staff at Richmond Ballet is made up of international professionals who each bring incredible talent, expertise, and credentials to their respective roles. With impressive backgrounds and world experience, they offer a unique perspective that has helped shape our organization over the years. For over 40 years, Stoner Winslett has served as the founding Artistic Director of Richmond Ballet, the first major company of professional dancers in the Commonwealth of Virginia. She is one of the longest tenured artistic directors of a major ballet company and one of the country’s few female artistic directors. In June 2020, acclaimed choreographer Ma Cong joined Richmond Ballet as its first ever Associate Artistic Director.', 'Jodie Gates Named Cincinnati Ballet’s Next Artistic Director\nCincinnati Ballet announced today that it has named Jodie Gates as its new artistic director, effective August 1, 2022. Gates will take over from Victoria Morgan, who is retiring after 25 years at the helm.\nGates, most recently the founding director of the USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance and founder and artistic director of the Laguna Dance Festival, will inherit stewardship of Cincinnati Ballet’s $11.5 million annual operating budget, 27 company dancers, 12 second company dancers, and the Cincinnati Ballet Otto M. Budig Academy.The organization recently moved into its new $30.8 million Margaret and Michael Valentine Center for Dance.\nBorn and raised in Sacramento, California, Gates trained with Barbara Crockett and Ingrid Carriker. At 15, she was discovered by Robert Joffrey and at 16 joined the Joffrey II dancers. Over the course of her 35-year professional career, she was a principal dancer with Joffrey Ballet, Pennsylvania Ballet, Frankfurt Ballet and Complexions Contemporary Ballet. She is an artistic collaborator with choreographer William Forsythe, staging ballets for Forsythe Productions. In addition, Gates has choreographed over 60 of her own works for dozens of dance companies and academic institutions. She recently received the 2021/22 Residency Fellowship from The Center for Ballet and the Arts at New York University.\nOur friends at Pointe spoke with Gates shortly after she received the news to hear more about her plans for the company.\nWhy did you seek the artistic director position?\nI was recommended for—and then recruited by the search committee for—the job. I feel incredibly fortunate. My career has been so filled with exquisite opportunities, so this was a natural next step. I have this incredibly broad perspective of the dance field, and I feel I am poised at this season in my life to bring all these assets together as an artistic director.\nWhat do you bring to the position?\nI’ve had a 25-year professional career as a performer; I’m an arts educator, a choreographer, a répétiteur; and I’ve founded a nonprofit dance festival.All that embodied knowledge lives and breathes in me; it is part of my DNA. I feel quite ready to be taking on this position. Additionally, in ballet we are at a pivot point; the equity, diversity and inclusion work I have been entrenched in, along with my fellowship from NYU, absolutely aligns with how I can perhaps help move ballet further forward.\nWhat is your vision for Cincinnati Ballet?\nTo build a vision for the organization that leads to an elevated future and to work with the organization on amplifying the identity of the company and its artists. Additionally, looking at equity, diversity and inclusion and embedding that in everything we do.\nHow about the repertoire?\nIt’s a little too soon to go in-depth because I feel incredibly excited about getting to know the city of Cincinnati and also the community and the organization. If you were to look at my resumé it obviously speaks to the breadth of my interests choreographically, my relationship to William Forsythe and my relationship to classical and contemporary ballet.\nBallet for the 21st century reflects our time and the cultural landscape in which we live. For me, it’s incredibly important that it becomes an accessible artform for everyone to enjoy. That includes the unbuilding of certain notions of hierarchy and elitism. My hope is that we address certain issues that the artform has and humanize it so that it continues to thrive and attract more diverse audiences.\nOutgoing artistic director Victoria Morgan was an early proponent of giving more opportunities to female choreographers. Will that be a part of your artistic vision?\nI certainly want to continue to amplify the voices of female choreographers, as well as BIPOC choreographers. It is very important for me to move the needle in that direction.\nDo you ascribe to a certain artistic style for the dancers?\nAt the core of my artistic philosophy is to cultivate dance artists with a point of view. I think having a style is a rather exciting adventure that I am looking forward to exploring.\nYou are part of a recent wave of female artistic director hires, including Tamara Rojo, Hope Muir, Susan Jaffe and Patricia Barker. Do you feel we are beginning to level the field for women directors?\nYes, I do. I am honored to be a part of that group. It’s a start in the right direction to shift the conversation to true inclusion within this form we love.\nCincinnati Ballet has often collaborated on joint productions with BalletMet. Do you see those continuing in future?\nI believe in collaboration, co-producing and partnerships, and will be working diligently on forming all the above. I believe it makes the field stronger.']	['<urn:uuid:7a5f3bf1-c8d2-4ef1-8394-e368bd825cec>', '<urn:uuid:8769b85d-a3ad-4cd5-8eeb-98517ee895ed>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	12	32	1320
12	What is unique about how an albatross flies?	The albatross performs a 'transfer of momentum' by taking momentum from higher, faster layers of air and transferring it to lower, slower layers by diving down, allowing it to propel itself without continuously flapping its wings.	"['Albatross robot takes flight\nCAMBRIDGE, MA – MIT engineers have designed a robotic glider that can skim along the water\'s surface, riding the wind like an albatross while also surfing the waves like a sailboat.\nIn regions of high wind, the robot is designed to stay aloft, much like its avian counterpart. Where there are calmer winds, the robot can dip a keel into the water to ride like a highly efficient sailboat instead.\nThe robotic system, which borrows from both nautical and biological designs, can cover a given distance using one-third as much wind as an albatross and traveling 10 times faster than a typical sailboat. The glider is also relatively lightweight, weighing about 6 pounds. The researchers hope that in the near future, such compact, speedy robotic water-skimmers may be deployed in teams to survey large swaths of the ocean.\n""The oceans remain vastly undermonitored,"" says Gabriel Bousquet, a former postdoc in MIT\'s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, who led the design of the robot as part of his graduate thesis. ""In particular, it\'s very important to understand the Southern Ocean and how it is interacting with climate change. But it\'s very hard to get there. We can now use the energy from the environment in an efficient way to do this long-distance travel, with a system that remains small-scale.""\nBousquet will present details of the robotic system this week at IEEE\'s International Conference on Robotics and Automation, in Brisbane, Australia. His collaborators on the project are Jean-Jacques Slotine, professor of mechanical engineering and information sciences and of brain sciences; and Michael Triantafyllou, the Henry L. and Grace Doherty Professor in Ocean Science and Engineering.\nThe physics of speed\nLast year, Bousquet, Slotine, and Triantafyllou published a study on the dynamics of albatross flight, in which they identified the mechanics that enable the tireless traveler to cover vast distances while expending minimal energy. The key to the bird\'s marathon voyages is its ability to ride in and out of high- and low-speed layers of air.\nSpecifically, the researchers found the bird is able to perform a mechanical process called a ""transfer of momentum,"" in which it takes momentum from higher, faster layers of air, and by diving down transfers that momentum to lower, slower layers, propelling itself without having to continuously flap its wings.\nInterestingly, Bousquet observed that the physics of albatross flight is very similar to that of sailboat travel. Both the albatross and the sailboat transfer momentum in order to keep moving. But in the case of the sailboat, that transfer occurs not between layers of air, but between the air and water.\n""Sailboats take momentum from the wind with their sail, and inject it into the water by pushing back with their keel,"" Bousquet explains. ""That\'s how energy is extracted for sailboats.""\nBousquet also realized that the speed at which both an albatross and a sailboat can travel depends upon the same general equation, related to the transfer of momentum. Essentially, both the bird and the boat can travel faster if they can either stay aloft easily or interact with two layers, or mediums, of very different speeds.\nThe albatross does well with the former, as its wings provide natural lift, though it flies between air layers with a relatively small difference in windspeeds. Meanwhile, the sailboat excels at the latter, traveling between two mediums of very different speeds — air versus water — though its hull creates a lot of friction and prevents it from getting much speed. Bousquet wondered: What if a vehicle could be designed to perform well in both metrics, marrying the high-speed qualities of both the albatross and the sailboat?\n""We thought, how could we take the best from both worlds?"" Bousquet says.\nOut on the water\nThe team drafted a design for such a hybrid vehicle, which ultimately resembled an autonomous glider with a 3-meter wingspan, similar to that of a typical albatross. They added a tall, triangular sail, as well as a slender, wing-like keel. They then performed some mathematical modeling to predict how such a design would travel.\nAccording to their calculations, the wind-powered vehicle would only need relatively calm winds of about 5 knots to zip across waters at a velocity of about 20 knots, or 23 miles per hour.\n""We found that in light winds you can travel about three to 10 times faster than a traditional sailboat, and you need about half as much wind as an albatross, to reach 20 knots,"" Bousquet says. ""It\'s very efficient, and you can travel very fast, even if there is not too much wind.""\nThe team built a prototype of their design, using a glider airframe designed by Mark Drela, professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. To the bottom of the glider they added a keel, along with various instruments, such as GPS, inertial measurement sensors, auto-pilot instrumentation, and ultrasound, to track the height of the glider above the water.\n""The goal here was to show we can control very precisely how high we are above the water, and that we can have the robot fly above the water, then down to where the keel can go under the water to generate a force, and the plane can still fly,"" Bousquet says.\nThe researchers decided to test this ""critical maneuver"" — the act of transitioning between flying in the air and dipping the keel down to sail in the water. Accomplishing this move doesn\'t necessarily require a sail, so Bousquet and his colleagues decided not to include one in order to simplify preliminary experiments.\nIn the fall of 2016, the team put its design to the test, launching the robot from the MIT Sailing Pavilion out onto the Charles River. As the robot lacked a sail and any mechanism to get it started, the team hung it from a fishing rod attached to a whaler boat. With this setup, the boat towed the robot along the river until it reached about 20 miles per hour, at which point the robot autonomously ""took off,"" riding the wind on its own.\nOnce it was flying autonomously, Bousquet used a remote control to give the robot a ""down"" command, prompting it to dip low enough to submerge its keel in the river. Next, he adjusted the direction of the keel, and observed that the robot was able to steer away from the boat as expected. He then gave a command for the robot to fly back up, lifting the keel out of the water.\n""We were flying very close to the surface, and there was very little margin for error — everything had to be in place,"" Bousquet says. ""So it was very high stress, but very exciting.""\nThe experiments, he says, prove that the team\'s conceptual device can travel successfully, powered by the wind and the water. Eventually, he envisions fleets of such vehicles autonomously and efficiently monitoring large expanses of the ocean.\n""Imagine you could fly like an albatross when it\'s really windy, and then when there\'s not enough wind, the keel allows you to sail like a sailboat,"" Bousquet says. ""This dramatically expands the kinds of regions where you can go.""\nThis research was supported, in part, by the Link Ocean Instrumentation fellowship.']"	['<urn:uuid:7ec74704-c093-44a4-add2-5d9d84e96266>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	8	36	1207
13	How can workplace safety be improved through monitoring and communication, and what are the legal consequences if these measures fail?	Workplace safety can be improved through good communication and consultation between businesses, workers, and safety representatives to identify hazards before incidents occur. Employers may use security staff or CCTV monitoring as deterrents, though data protection considerations must be taken into account. Regarding legal consequences, employers can be held vicariously liable for employees' wrongful acts if there's a close connection to their employment duties, even without direct control over the employees. They may also face liability under health and safety law if they fail to prevent improper conduct that puts employee safety at risk.	['Slips, trips and falls are the second most common cause of workplace injury, after hazardous manual tasks.\nIndustries which experience the highest proportion of slips and trips are:\n- health and community services\n- retail trade.\nIn particular, slips and trips are a common cause of injury to personal care and nursing assistants, cleaners and sales assistants.\nThese incidents are a significant problem affecting every workplace, from the factory floor to the office and quite often can result in serious injury and lengthy amounts of time off work.\nCommons slip and trip hazards often arise from:\n- the type and stability of the floor or ground surfaces such as uneven or broken concrete and sloping ground\n- slippery floor surfaces caused by water, fluid spillage and oil\n- equipment, boxes and materials blocking walkways\n- stairs or steps\n- carrying things that obscure the view ahead\n- poor lighting\n- inadequate or improper footwear\n- incorrect use of ladders\n- falling or moving objects.\nIn terms of fall hazards, they are often found where work is carried out at heights such as:\n- stacking shelves\n- working on a roof\n- unloading a large truck\n- assessing a silo.\nFalls can also occur at a ground level as a result of a slip or trip.\nA person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU) has a duty of care to provide a safe workplace and systems of work, information, instruction and training. Additionally, they have to give workers an opportunity to consult about work health and safety, whilst being responsible for identifying hazards, assessing risks and managing the hazards also.\nA risk assessment should be undertaken to determine the level of risk and appropriate controls. This gives the PCBU the opportunity to discuss issues and negotiate suitable arrangements for reducing slips, trips and falls.\nAn important part of the risk management process is to have good communication and consultation between PCBUs, workers, health and safety representatives and committees. Doing so will help to identify hazards before any injury, illness or incident can occur. This then leads to developing measures to eliminate or reduce the associated risks.\nAs workers, you have a responsibility to protect your own health and safety along with others affected by the work, whilst also abiding by procedures and policies in relation to workplace safety. It is necessary for all workers to be provided with important information and training to allow them to fulfil this obligation.\nOften, it is the little things that cause slipping, tripping and falling to happen in the first place, so it is important to remember to work together. There are several ways to help minimalize these incidents occurring, such as:\n- maintaining good house-keeping protocols, including rubbish removal\n- storing equipment correctly\n- using ladders and steps correctly\n- reporting damage to floors and surfaces\n- clearly identifying and staying on marked walkways\n- implementing a clean and clear walkway policy\n- affixing mats to the floor surface\n- restricting access to areas that are potentially hazardous\n- providing ramps instead of steps where the height of floor levels change\n- restricting tasks to suitably trained workers\n- providing adequate aisle width and lighting\n- using warning signs.\nOur four-part educational video series will help business operators manage the risk when working at heights and assist them to comply with their work health and safety responsibilities.', 'I have become aware of potentially serious interpersonal conflict between two employees and am concerned that this may escalate into a physical confrontation. How do I handle it?\nEmployers should be aware that liability can attach to a company for wrongful or violent acts perpetrated by employees against work colleagues, even if they have no direct control over them. This is especially the case where an employer is on notice of deteriorating relations between particular employees.\nLiability can arise in two ways – where an employer is deemed vicariously liable for the acts of an employee, and under health and safety law.\nAn employer can be liable for the acts or omissions of its employees, provided it can be shown that they took place in the course of their employment. This will involve an analysis of the facts in a given situation to decide whether there is a close connection on the one hand between the duties which the employee is engaged to perform and which fall within the scope of the employment, and the incident which has occurred. Factors which may be taken into account would include:\n- The nature of the employer’s business;\n- Whether the risk of the type of incident which occurred arose because of the nature of the business, or the nature of the employee’s duties;\n- Whether the incident could be said to be incidental to or a consequence of anything the employee was instructed to do by the employer;\n- Whether at the time of the incident the employee could have been said to be acting, however misguidedly, in the interests of the employer, or was merely pursuing some private end\n- Whether the employee was expected or encouraged to act aggressively in the course of his work;\n- Whether the incident was borne out of resentment, revenge etc.\nLiability may attach to an employer if it can be said that an incident is consistent with the interests of the employer and has a close connection with any actions that fall within the ambit of the employee’s employment. So, in a recent case, a chef who flew into a rage and assaulted a fellow employee was deemed to have been motivated by some personal resentment “which ignited an apparently ungovernable temper.” In turn the Court considered that his actions were not remotely consistent with the interests of his employer and had no close connections with any actions that fell within the ambit of his employment, and as such his employer was not vicariously liable for his assault.\nHealth and Safety\nHealth and safety legislation imposes an obligation on employers to prevent improper conduct likely to put the health and safety of employees at risk, as far as is reasonably practicable. An employer must provide and maintain a safe place of work for employees and provide competent co-workers. The Courts have said that improper conduct includes matters such as bullying, harassment, physical violence, practical joking and racial or other abuse.\nThe onus will be on an employer who has been put on notice of a potential conflict between employees, to implement measures to protect against the risk of a future assault in the workplace. Looking again at the case of the chef who assaulted a colleague, when addressing the employer’s duty to provide a safe place at work the Court took account of the fact that a senior manager had prior knowledge that the individual had been dismissed from his previous job for a similar incident. In turn the employer had failed to exercise reasonable care by failing to implement measures to protect against the risk of future assault in the workplace.\nPractical Steps for Employers\n- Foreseeability: Given that it can be difficult to predict such acts before they occur, employers must ensure they maintain a “zero tolerance” policy towards violence or aggression in the workplace. Where an employer becomes aware of the potential for violent or aggressive behaviour, they must exercise reasonable care by implementing measures to protect against that risk. Employers may wish to consider segregating warring employees, if this is possible from a practical viewpoint, and if it can be carried out in a manner that is fair to the parties concerned.\n- Act immediately: Where an incident occurs in the workplace, an employer should act immediately to deal with incidents of violence or aggression in a robust manner, and in accordance with a disciplinary procedure (see below).\n- Safety Statement: The Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 requires employers to draft a safety statement setting out how the safety, health and welfare at work of employees is to be managed. If physical violence is identified as a risk in the workplace, then the appropriate safeguards put in place to mitigate the risk of same and protect employees should be included in the safety statement.\n- Disciplinary and Grievance Policy: Similarly, employers should ensure that a comprehensive disciplinary policy is in place which sets out the types of conduct which are prohibited in the workplace, the different stages of the disciplinary procedure and the sanctions that will apply where there is a finding of improper conduct. A detailed grievance policy should also be in place, so that employees have a recognised procedure to follow in bringing grievances to the attention of the employer. Employees should be made aware of the content of such policies, ideally at the commencement of employment.\n- Recruitment: Employers may also wish to review pre-employment screening procedures to ensure a full picture of a candidate’s employment history is obtained during the recruitment process.\n- Deterrent Factor: The Courts have referred to the possibility of employing security staff or CCTV monitoring as a deterrent to violent or aggressive behaviour in the workplace. The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has recently published updated guidance on the use of CCTV monitoring, and data protection considerations must be taken into account in any decision to implement CCTV monitoring in the workplace.']	['<urn:uuid:13247fe3-7636-4651-b3c0-36fb651de2d8>', '<urn:uuid:affbec89-b648-479e-825c-73a89e3d602e>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	20	93	1557
14	In my linguistics research, I'm particularly interested in universal speech patterns across languages - what did this study reveal about common patterns in speech articulation, even though it was conducted in English?	Although the study was conducted using English syllables (like bah, dee, goo), the researchers found that the key brain patterns they observed matched what linguists have documented in languages worldwide. According to Dr. Chang, this suggests there may be universal principles for speaking that apply across all cultures. These patterns were discovered by recording electrical activity in the speech-motor cortex as patients read from a list of English syllables, revealing how distinct brain patterning accounts for different vowels and consonants in speech.	['A team of researchers at UC San Francisco has uncovered the neurological basis of speech motor control, the complex coordinated activity of tiny brain regions that controls our lips, jaw, tongue and larynx as we speak.\nDescribed this week in the journal Nature, the work has potential implications for developing computer-brain interfaces for artificial speech communication and for the treatment of speech disorders. It also sheds light on an ability that is unique to humans among living creatures but poorly understood.\n“Speaking is so fundamental to who we are as humans, nearly all of us learn to speak,” said senior author Edward Chang, MD, a neurosurgeon at the UCSF Epilepsy Center and a faculty member in the UCSF Center for Integrative Neuroscience. “But it’s probably the most complex motor activity we do.”\nThe complexity comes from the fact that spoken words require the coordinated efforts of numerous “articulators” in the vocal tract: the lips, tongue, jaw and larynx, but scientists have not understood how the movements of these distinct articulators are precisely coordinated in the brain.\nTo understand how speech articulation works, Chang and his colleagues recorded electrical activity directly from the brains of three people undergoing brain surgery at UCSF, and used this information to determine the spatial organization of the “speech sensorimotor cortex,” which controls the lips, tongue, jaw, larynx as a person speaks. This gave them a map of which parts of the brain control which parts of the vocal tract.\nThey then applied a sophisticated new method called “state-space” analysis to observe the complex spatial and temporal patterns of neural activity in the speech sensorimotor cortex that play out as someone speaks. This revealed a surprising sophistication in how the brain’s speech sensorimotor cortex works.\nThey found that this cortical area has a hierarchical and cyclical structure that exerts a split-second, symphony-like control over the tongue, jaw, larynx and lips.\n“These properties may reflect cortical strategies to greatly simplify the complex coordination of articulators in fluent speech,” said Kristofer Bouchard, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Chang lab who was the first author on the paper.\nIn the same way that a symphony relies upon all the players to coordinate their plucks, beats or blows to make music, speaking demands well-timed action of several various brain regions within the speech sensorimotor cortex.\nBrain Mapping in Epilepsy Surgery\nThe patients involved in the study were all at UCSF undergoing surgery for severe, untreatable epilepsy. Brain surgery is a powerful way to halt epilepsy in its tracks, potentially completely stopping seizures overnight, and its success is directly related to the accuracy with which a medical team can map the brain, identifying the exact pieces of tissue responsible for an individual’s seizures and removing them.\nThe UCSF Comprehensive Epilepsy Center is a leader in the use of advanced intracranial monitoring to map out elusive seizure-causing brain regions. The mapping is done by surgically implanting an electrode array under the skull on the brain’s outer surface or cortex and recording the brain’s activity in order to pinpoint the parts of the brain responsible for disabling seizures. In a second surgery a few weeks later, the electrodes are removed and the unhealthy brain tissue that causes the seizures is removed.\nThis setting also permits a rare opportunity to ask basic questions about how the human brain works, such as how it controls speaking. The neurological basis of speech motor control has remained unknown until now because scientists cannot study speech mechanisms in animals and because non-invasive imaging methods lack the ability to resolve the very rapid time course of articulator movements, which change in hundredths of seconds.\nBut surgical brain mapping can record neural activity directly and faster than other noninvasive methods, showing changes in electrical activity on the order of a few milliseconds.\nPrior to this work, the majority of what scientists knew about this brain region was based on studies from the 1940’s, which used electrical stimulation of single spots on the brain, causing a twitch in muscles of the face or throat. This approach using focal stimulation, however, could never evoke a meaningful speech sound.\nChang and colleagues used an entirely different approach to studying the brain activity during natural speaking brain using the implanted electrodes arrays. The patients read from a list of English syllables, like bah, dee, goo. The researchers recorded the electrical activity within their speech-motor cortex and showed how distinct brain patterning accounts for different vowels and consonants in our speech.\n“Even though we used English, we found the key patterns observed were ones that linguists have observed in languages around the world; perhaps suggesting universal principles for speaking across all cultures,” said Chang.\nNotes about this Neuroscience research\nThe article, “Functional organization of human sensorimotor cortex for speech articulation” is authored by Kristofer E.

15	Were both Dare and Flanagan family businesses affected by fires?	Only Dare Foods was affected by fire - their Kitchener plant was destroyed by fire in 1942, requiring construction of a wartime replacement in 1943. There is no mention of fires affecting Flanagan's business	"['The Flanagan story dates back to 1977 when Joe and Dee Flanagan opened Bob’s Surplus Food Outlet in Waterloo, Ontario. The retail store operated out of 5,200 square feet of space with three employees and 500 products.\nThe enterprise quickly evolved into Bob’s Wholesale where dry grocery products were distributed to bakeries and donut shops in the Kitchener-Waterloo area with all deliveries being shipped in the Flanagan family station wagon. Joe Flanagan recognized a need for a full service distribution and set out to expand geographical coverage and diversify the product line. He renamed the company J. and D. Flanagan Sales and Distribution Ltd., and over the next ten years the company dealt with rapid expansion including new vehicles, a new building in Kitchener (1983), and a new branch in Owen Sound. In 1989, the Kitchener branch was moved again to accommodate the growing demand.\nThe 80s also saw the introduction of Joe’s sons to the family business. Dan, Rick, Jeff and Murray started working at the company in various positions. The company was renamed Flanagan Foodservice Inc. and again, continued to grow. By this time the company viewed the ability to adapt to serve its customer needs as a skill that has been well-developed over the years.\nAlthough many businesses were suffering from a recession in the 90s, the company showed no signs of slowing down. Joe Flanagan told employees that the company “wasn’t taking part in the recession.” A true visionary, he led the company through another decade of growth. Expansions to the Kitchener facility were needed and the Sudbury branch was opened. Fresh seafood, dairy, and new marketing initiatives were introduced that helped propel the company forward.\nWith a strong succession plan in place, Joe appointed his eldest son, Dan, as President in 1998. A gradual hand off of the management responsibilities and consensus among the brothers as to the direction of the business allowed for a seamless transition to the second generation.\nWith the passing of Joe Flanagan in 2000, the company was led by Dan, Rick, Jeff and Murray. Each brother was actively involved in the day-to-day management of the company, maintaining the integrity and service that Flanagan Foodservice was built on. Under their leadership, the next 13 years were another period of growth and advancement for the Flanagan brand.\nThe company acquired Roseland Produce, added another 65,000 square feet to the Kitchener branch and became HACCP certified while helping shape the future of food safety in foodservice distribution. Sustainability initiatives were a focus and the company committed to ensuring they were proactively managing the impact on the environment. Dan, Rick, Jeff and Murray kept the spirit of their father alive while staying true to his core values of service, teamwork and growth.\nIn 2012 the owners embarked on a strategic journey which would shape the future of the company for years to come. Flanagan Foodservice unveiled a new logo to complement innovative changes to the company vision, mission, values, and tagline. The focus remained on the company strengths and the evolving business environment while always keeping its customers as the top priority.\nOne value that didn’t change was the company’s commitment to the communities it serves. Flanagan’s has always supported many worthwhile charities. The company is actively involved in We Care, Habitat for Humanity, Speroway and many other worthwhile causes. The company has donated over $1 million dollars to We Care over the years and contributes hundreds of thousands of dollars of food annually to worthwhile causes. The company also introduced paid volunteerism in 2016, encouraging employees to support their communities through effort that is compensated with pay.\nIn 2014, Rick, Jeff and Murray retired from the active management of the family business, leaving the oldest brother, Dan, to lead the family entrepreneurship into the future. The brothers remain as Shareholders and Board Advisors and continue to collaborate on various company projects and initiatives.\nToday, Flanagan Foodservice employs 520 people in 4 branches across Ontario. The fleet consists of over 80 vehicles delivering foodservice products across Ontario and Southwestern Quebec. As the requirements of customers continue to grow, so does Flanagan’s. Through technical innovation and expansions, foresight and marketing, sales have grown consecutively for 40 years.\nThe future of Flanagan’s continues to be that of a family-owned, independent company that will exhibit the same distinct family values that have defined its identity for 40 years. Flanagan’s is looking to the future with great excitement. The company just completed the largest expansion to date with an 180,000 square foot branch in Whitby, Ontario in. Dan summarizes the strategy for the future: “Our core values of service excellence, teamwork, continuous improvement, inclusive family spirit, and community building through supporting community events, organizations and charities will continue to define what Flanagan’s will stand for in the future.”\nAt the heart of it, the Flanagan story comes down to service.\nProviding exceptional personal service was at the heart of everything Joe and Dee did while establishing and growing the business. In the second generation, the Flanagan brothers embraced that core value while taking the company to the next level. Today, this combined legacy of service provides the core mandate for the future of the company. “Customer service is the cornerstone of our business,” emphasizes Dan. “It really comes down to all of our people understanding how important each and every customer is, and how they can best serve them to meet their unique needs and help contribute to their success in the foodservice market.', ""- Resources for Research\n- About Us\n- Ask a Librarian\n- Help & Instruction\n- Connect from Home\n- Site Index\n- Library Home\nDare Foods Limited.\nDare Foods Limited. - 1892-2003.\n12.1 m of textual records.\nDare Foods Limited is a family-owned business based in Kitchener, Ontario. It manufactures cookies, crackers, candies and fine breads at its seven plants in Ontario, Quebec and South Carolina. Dare candies are made in Toronto and Milton, Ontario.\nIn 1889, Charles H. Doerr opened a grocery store on the corner of Breithaupt and Gzowski (now Weber) Streets in Berlin (now Kitchener, Ontario) that by 1892 had become a biscuit-manufacturing operation.\nIn 1919 a larger bakery was built in Kitchener to replace the original plant and at the same time a line of candies was added. In 1942 the Kitchener plant was destroyed by a fire and in 1943 a smaller wartime replacement was constructed on a former flying field on the outskirts of Kitchener. A new office building was constructed in Kitchener in 1952.\nIn 2003 a new Kitchener office building was constructed to preserve and highlight the original 1952 yellow-brick structure.\nThe company now known as Dare Foods Limited was originally known as the C.H. Doerr Co. When Charles H. Doerr died in 1941 his grandson, Carl M. Doerr, became President of the company and began an expansion program that introduced Dare products in more than 40 countries.\nIn 1945 the company and family name was changed from “Doerr” to “Dare” creating The Dare Company, Limited, later renamed Dare Foods Limited. With the help of his sons Bryan and Graham, Carl Dare continued to guide Dare Foods Ltd. until 2002. In Nov. 2002 Fred Jacques was appointed as President, the first non-family member to head the company in 111 years. Bryan and Graham Dare remain co-chairmen of the company’s Board of Directors.\nThe business history of Dare Foods is complex: it has formed, acquired, merged and dissolved other companies and its own divisions over the years. One of Carl M. Doerr’s first expansion acquisitions was The Howe Candy Company in Hamilton, Ontario. Other acquisitions include Saratoga Products, St. Jacobs Canning Company, Mother Dell’s Bakeries, Dairy Maid Chocolates, Bremner Biscuit Co., Saputo/ Culinar CFS.\nIn 1960 a sales office was opened in Montreal, establishing Les Aliments Dare Limitée, Dare’s selling and distributing organization in the Province of Quebec. The Western Division was established in 1962 with the opening of a bakery and sales office in North Surrey, Vancouver, B.C., serving British Columbia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.\nIn 1954 The Dare Company, Limited was the first Canadian cookie company to use the new recloseable tin tie packages that had been used successfully in the coffee industry and which have become standard packaging in the cookie industry in Canada.\nFonds consists of records generated in the course of business by Dare Foods Limited and its subsidiary companies.

16	Why is it problematic when business owners delegate all financial monitoring to their accountants instead of staying involved themselves?	This represents two mistakes: first, people are selling themselves short since the required number-tracking needs no advanced mathematical training, and second, no one else is as motivated as the business owner to get the numbers working for the business. While accountants can prepare P&L statements and offer advice, quarterly meetings with them are not sufficient for proper company management.	"[""Managing Your Numbers Is Essential for Growth\nDo you want to do everything you possibly can to ensure the survival and growth of your company? Of course you do. Well, one of the most essential skills that you can bring to your company is understanding, tracking, and using certain numbers.\nThis numeracy--thinking in numbers--is a vital, vital skill.\nLet me explain. In my experience, far too many people feel that they aren't good at math, or didn't take accounting, or whatever. Using this as an excuse, they hire someone else to watch the numbers for them. This is two mistakes in one. First, they're selling themselves short. Anybody can work with numbers, and the kind of number-tracking I'm talking about requires no advanced mathematical training or professional degree. Second, there's no substitute for you in this process. Nobody else out there is as motivated as you are to get the numbers working on behalf of your business.\nYes, your accountant can prepare your P&L statements, tax returns, and balance sheet and offer certain kinds of advice based on rules-of-thumb and industry norms. (By the way, an accountant with lots of experience working with companies like yours can be a gold mine of comparative information.) But you simply can't count on quarterly meetings with your accountant. In order to run your company properly, and dramatically reduce your risk of failure, you need to get access to certain numbers quickly, and use those numbers effectively.\nHere are the numbers you should have at your fingertips:\n- a snapshot of the company,\n- cash flow statements that are regularly updated,\n- cost analysis of your product(s),\n- break-even analyses, both for the company overall and for each new product.\nHere I will only discuss the snapshot of the company. My goal is to get you comfortable with these numbers--by which I don't simply mean that you'll be able to generate them, but that you'll understand them and be able to adapt and use them effectively. In general, my prescription is, Know and love these numbers! Note, I am not saying you have to prepare the snapshot yourself. When you're small, you can have your accountant or bookkeeper prepare them for you; and if your company grows to the point that you can afford a chief financial officer, then she will take responsibility for preparing the numbers.\nI call the following chart the Company Snapshot because I want to convey the idea that it's quick to read and absorb. I've done it weekly because that's been the interval that's proven most helpful to me in my businesses. One manufacturing company I've worked with does a similar report daily. Depending on the nature of your business, you might find a bi-weekly report adequate, particularly during slow seasons. In certain situations--for example, where your company is temporarily flush with cash--you may decide that a monthly snapshot is adequate. But you can't make that decision until you understand the snapshot, and how your company performs against that snapshot. So my advice is start weekly, and adjust as necessary.\nThe snapshot is meant to be simple. It's meant to be easy to prepare--your secretary or bookkeeper should be able to do it--and able to be digested by you in no more than five minutes. Depending on the specifics of your business, you may want to add or subtract categories from the following exhibit. You might also want to use comparatives from a prior period. Just remember: Keep it simple.\nCurrent assets: ______________________\nCash, reg: ______________________\nLiquid assets: ______________________\nInventory (if a product company): ______________________\nCurrent liabilities: ______________________\nAccrued commissions: ______________________\nAccrued royalties: ______________________\nFixed monthly expenses: ______________________\nLoans outstanding: ______________________\nMonthly sales to date: ______________________\nYearly sales to date: ______________________\nFuture orders to ship: ______________________\nOpen purchase orders: ______________________\nThe point of this report is to get the quickest possible handle on key aspects of your company's operation, such as:\n- Do I have enough cash to pay my bills? (You may notice that you're cash challenged because your fixed monthly expenses seem to be too high. This should trigger you to start thinking about cutting some expenses or converting some to variable expenses.)\n- Are my receivables running too high? (If so, is it because payments are\nrunning late? Or is it because my credit-checking system has fallen apart, and we're selling more non-credit-worthy customers?)\n- Do I have enough inventory to handle future demand? (A caveat: This report\ncan't tell you if you have the inventory in the right categories; only a detailed inventory report can tell you that.)\n- Have we overcommitted ourselves in terms of inventory? (Most companies hit this stumbling block sooner or later. If your inventory figure is too high, it's a signal that you need to get the kind of detailed report that would let you take the right immediate action--such as canceling existing product orders, heading off the placement of future orders, putting certain items on sale, or closing out certain items.)\n- Are my sales on target as to projections? If not, why and what corrective actions need to be initiated?\nStarting and growing a business can have you in chasing-your-tail mode with not enough time in the day to do everything. While you deal with this syndrome, you must always keep an eye on your numbers. This snapshot is meant to help you do so in a minimum amount of time. It will help you prevent crises by spotting them before they materialize. Most business failures are attributed to running out of cash. Let's avoid that.""]"	['<urn:uuid:3940829a-20ce-4480-94f1-010e221590d0>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	19	59	928
17	I run a shop - which postal services include package tracking?	USPS provides tracking with these services: Collect on Delivery, Certified Mail, USPS Tracking, Registered Mail, Global Express Guaranteed, Priority Mail, and Signature Confirmation.	['Today I’m presenting USPS Tracking Number Examples and USPS Tracking Number Format, so if don’t you know about the tracking ids and have any confusion about them, you’ve landed in the right place.\nA tracking number is known as a unique tracking number that is assigned to each package that is shipped through USPS. With the help of a tracking number, you can easily locate your packages like where your parcel is, what’s the status, when it will arrive, etc.\nTypically, USPS tracking numbers are 20-22 characters long, without any words or letters between them. For Mail Express, however, the tracking identifiers differ slightly.\nMail express tracking numbers consist of 13 characters and start with two letters and end with ‘US.’\nIn which service does USPS provide tracking?\nAs you know, without a tracking number, it’s impossible to track a package, and you’ll be unable to keep track of the latest updates. Below I have listed some USPS services that provide tracking numbers.\nSo Whenever you send a package anywhere, make sure to use one of these services as they provide tracking information, making sure you always know where the package is, when it will arrive, and so on.\n- Collect on Delivery\n- Certified Mail\n- USPS Tracking\n- Registered Mail\n- Global Express Guaranteed\n- Priority Mail\n- Signature Confirmation\nIn order to receive the shipment tracking number, you need to use one of these services with your product. Nevertheless, if you do not have selected one of the postage options mentioned above, then you might not receive the tracking number.\nAlthough in a few cases, you can get the tracking number of shipment by paying an extra fee, but most of the services include the tracking number, so there is no charge.\nUSPS Tracking Number Format and Examples\nUSPS is a courier company that offers tons of services for domestic and international mails. Each shipping services assign a tracking number to each package which shipped with them.\nA tracking id is a unique number that varies on which services you have chosen.\nThe USPS tracking number can be up to 22 characters long, which can vary for each package; however, some services have 15-16 character tracking numbers. All services tracking number examples can be seen below.\nHere are the services and their tracking number examples\n|Services name||Tracking Number Example|\n|USPS Tracking||9400 1000 0000 0000 0000 00|\n|Priority Mail||9205 5000 0000 0000 0000 00|\n|Certified Mail||9407 3000 0000 0000 0000 00|\n|Collect On Delivery Hold For Pickup||9303 3000 0000 0000 0000 00|\n|Global Express Guaranteed||82 000 000 00|\n|Priority Mail Express International||EC 000 000 000 US|\n|Priority Mail Express||9270 1000 0000 0000 0000 00 EA 000 000 000 US|\n|Priority Mail International||CP 000 000 000 US|\n|Registered Mail||9208 8000 0000 0000 0000 00|\n|Signature Confirmation||9202 1000 0000 0000 0000 00|\nNow that you have seen all the examples of USPS tracking numbers, you must be wondering where to find the tracking number on a USPS Receipt. Let’s find out.\nWhere is the tracking number on USPS Receipt\nAfter knowing all the examples of tracking id, may this question must come to your mind how to find the tracking number on the receipt which I received from USPS,\nSee the receipt example with a tracking mark highlighted below, follow the same method on your receipt, and you will find it easily.\nIf you are not able to find the tracking id on the receipt, try to contact customer support, they will surely help you in finding it; Just you have to provide some basic details.\nUSPS Tracking Number Example and format explanation\nYou are aware that USPS offers various services, and they give a different tracking number for each item. The tracking number format is also different depending on the service.\nUSPS tracking id character is up to 20-22, and some of the services tracking id is Upto 13 characters in which you will find some letter and some character.\nTake a look at all types of USPS tracking number formats.\n|Format 1:||9205 5000 0000 0000 0000 00|\nThe first one, tracking id is 22 digits long, and it does not contain any letter or words.\n|Format 2:||EC 000 000 000 US|\nIn the second one, the tracking number starts with two letters and ends with the word ‘US’ with all digits in the middle.\nThird, this is used on some services which contain up to 10 digits.\nHow to Track a USPS package?\nThere is a USPS online tracking service that tracks the status of parcels and other mail items with a tracking or receipt number. USPS package tracking is so simple that anyone can locate the most updated tracking information in no time.\nYou just need to follow the below instructions to track the package further.\n- First, visit the USPS official website, which is USPS.com.\n- From the above menu, select the track package.\n- Please enter the tracking number you received from USPS there and hit the track.\n- That page will show you the latest information about the package like where it is, when it will arrive, etc.\nNote: Shipping with Priority Mail Express entails in-depth information like where the package is, what are facilities it has left, when it will arrive, etc., while other services let you know when a package will be left for delivery.\nIn the event you receive any tracking status that is listed below, you can check it out to know.\nTracking Statuses that confuses us:\n- What Does In Transit To Destination Mean?\n- Showing USPS In Transit To Next Facility For more than a days\n- Held At Post Office, At Customer Request\n- What Does Departed USPS Regional Facility Mean?\n- What does USPS “Arrived at unit” status mean?\n- Item Processed Through Facility ISC New York NY (USPS) – means?\nHow Do I Find My Tracking Number?\nYou can find the tracking number on your mailing receipt, sales receipt, online label if you have purchased through an e-commerce website, and insurance receipt if you have purchased along with the service.\nHow Many Digits Are USPS Tracking Numbers?\nUSPS tracking numbers are usually 20 to 22 characters long, but for the express mail service, they are 13 characters long with two words.\nWhy Is My USPS Tracking Number Not Working?\nIn either case, you will receive a tracking update, or there will be no updates. Verify the tracking number again. Wait 20-48 hours, and it will surely update. Otherwise, you can contact customer support for more information.\nAs you have seen all the tracking details regarding USPS tracking number examples above, I hope you now understand it and can identify it when you see any of these while shipping and tracking.\nIf you are having a problem with the tracking package, you must be entering the tracking information incorrectly or there have been no updates. If you are still unable to track the package, please feel free to contact customer support.\nI hope you liked this post, don’t forget to share it with your friends:']	['<urn:uuid:a9327362-8203-482a-9119-cd7b58aaff6a>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	11	23	1179
18	How do immune cells modify their genetic activity when exposed to microbes?	When immune cells are exposed to microbial stimulation, they undergo transcriptional reprogramming that includes retroelements (REs). Direct microbial stimulation or infection of purified human immune cells causes substantial modulation of RE activity. Some REs show quick induction while others require prolonged stimulation.	['Lastly, human DCs in vitro contaminated with Leishmania major also significantly altered their RE expression pro file, with various aspects, like quite a few HML 2 elements, significantly induced. Induction of some REs appeared quite quick, whereas other REs expected prolonged stimulation. Consequently, direct microbial stimulation or infec tion of purified human immune cells brings about substantial modulation of RE action. Conclusions Industrial microarray platforms contain thousands of RE reporting probes, which may be applied to assess RE transcriptional exercise in the wealth of readily available data sets. Nonetheless, these RE reporting probes often correspond to REs that are close to or inside of hosts genes and appear co regulated with their nearest gene.\nThis kind of co regulation can be due to the capability of REs to influence gene expression patterns inside distinct cell styles and to contribute to establishing PTEN inhibitor price the cell identity. It might also be partly as a consequence of the efforts of microarray manufacturers to focus on host gene transcription. Without a doubt, various microarray platforms detect selected RE families with variable coverage, and, for that reason, the representation of REs in any one platform is incomplete. We even more refined the microarray based mostly system to filter for RE reporting probes identified as intergenic and as belonging to professional besets exactly where the vast majority of constituent probes report RE expression, to show global modulation of RE tran scription at the degree of personal cells or total organs in both humans and mice exposed to microbial stimu lation.\nAs RE representation in this examination will not be total, it’s possible that the impact of microbial expos ure on RE action is much more considerable.

19	parallel play cognitive social skills development	Parallel play, occurring between ages 2.5 and 3.5 years, involves children playing side-by-side with similar toys while mimicking each other. Despite limited direct interaction, this stage is crucial for developing social maturity and cognitive skills. Children learn valuable social skills through observation and imitation, helping them transition to more complex play stages. During this period, children also engage in imitative play and role-playing, acting out daily experiences. This stage represents an important transition between solitary play and more socially interactive forms of play like associative and cooperative play.

New York: Wiley, ISBN 0471090654.', 'Children go through many stages of play in their early years, and each stage helps them to build skills and confidence to move on the next, until eventually they are happy to seek out other children to play together and form friendships.\nThe first stage of play is called Unoccupied Play. This is where the child seems to be not engaged or actively playing with others at all. They may remain still and be engaged in random movements with no objective. This stage of play is mostly seen in new-borns and infants, between birth and one year old. This is an important setting stage for future play exploration and development. Lots of hand and mouth development is learnt at this age, and this can be misinterpreted as teething. At this age, children learn most form their senses and by putting things in their mouth, they are discovering preferences and control and an understanding of the work around them.\nChildren then move on to Solitary Play. During this stage of play, children will often play alone, with toys away from others, and be uninterested or unaware of what others around them are doing. This stage of play is most commonly seen in young toddlers between the ages of six months to two years, but it is important for children of all age groups to participate in from time to time. Solitary play is common at a young age because cognitive, physical and social skills have yet to fully develop. This type of play is important because it teaches children how to entertain themselves. A good thing to do at this age is to offer your child lots of variety in their toys, so they can spend time exploring it by themselves. Treasure Baskets are a great way of doing this without spending lots of money. Messy play is another good thing to provide for them at this age, as they love to explore, and it also helps if you have a with fussy eater, as they can get used to touching different things. Sand, water, Gloop (cornflour and water), playdough, shaving foam, jelly, dry pasta, bubbly sand (sand mixed with washing up liquid) all make fabulous messy play activities.\nThe next stage is Parallel play. This is when children play side-by-side from one another, but there is a lack of group involvement amongst them. They will typically be playing with similar toys and often they will mimic one another. Parallel play is common in toddlers between the ages of 2 ½ and 3 ½ but can take place at any age. Although it looks like there is very little contact between them, these children are learning valuable social skills and actually learn quite a lot from one another. For this reason, parallel play is important as a transitory stage for the development of social maturity, which is key to later stages of play. Children are also starting to enjoy Imitative Play and enjoy role play at this age. Introducing things such as dolls or a ‘shop’ will enable them to act out what they see every day, when they go shopping their parents. It is always very interesting to watch children playing I this way, as you will see a lot of yourself in their play, the things they say are likely to be what you say!\nHelp children to play together and help them to share, by role modelling this even if it is for a short period of time.\nAfter that, Associative play starts – At this stage, children will begin to play together, but not focused towards a common goal. A child will be more interested in playing with other children around them than the individual toys they play with. Associative play is slightly different than parallel play as children may continue to play separately from one another, but they start to become more involved in what others around them are doing. You may find children playing or trading with the same toys or actively talking with or engaging one another, but no rules of play are being set. This type of play typically begins around ages three or four years, extending into the pre-school age. This is an important stage of play because it develops necessary skills such as cooperation, problems solving, and language development.\nBoard games and physical play is great for children of this age, as they can work together, help each other and start to understand team working.\nCooperative play – Cooperative play is where play finally becomes organised into groups and teamwork between children is actually seen. Children are now interested in both the people that they are playing with as well as the activity at hand. The group is more formalised with a leader, as well as other assigned roles, and play organises around accomplishing group goals or specific tasks. Cooperative play begins in the late preschool period, between the ages of four and\nsix years. It is uncommon to see children reach this stage until these later years, as it requires an evolved set of organisational skills and a higher degree of social maturity. Cooperative play brings together all the skills learned across previous stages into action, giving the child the necessary skills for social and group interactions.\nBy this time, children are starting to form friendship groups and seek out other children with the same interests as them to play with.\nSpend some time thinking about how your child plays, what stage of play are they in?']"	['<urn:uuid:4cf48efa-fdea-43d4-b1d0-1c29599db6c0>', '<urn:uuid:3945a9ab-1207-414f-88d4-f879470a1c41>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	6	88	2431
20	lab storage chemicals filter paper differences	Chemical storage and filter paper storage in labs have distinct requirements. Chemicals must be stored in specialized cabinets with proper labeling and secure closures to prevent spills and cross-contamination, often requiring segregation of incompatible substances. In contrast, filter paper, used in chromatography, has simpler storage needs - it comes in standard sizes (like 18.5 cm diameter sheets) and can be stored with other basic lab materials. While chemical storage is crucial for safety and requires specific cabinets, filter paper can be stored in regular lab storage areas without special precautions.	['||Students will use the laboratory separation technique of paper chromatography to separate the different dyes in pen inks.\n||Students encounter many substances in everyday life that are mixtures, even though some might appear to be pure substances at first glance. Techniques like paper chromatography can separate the mixture into its individual components.\nChromatography is a family of techniques for separating mixtures. Paper chromatography utilizes differences in solubility of the various component substances in a mixture to separate the mixture, as well as differences in the ability of the component substances to adhere to a separating medium. The mixture in this case is ink, and the component substances are the component dyes or pigments of the ink. The separating medium is filter paper. The solvent is isopropyl alcohol.\n- pure substance\n- paper chromatography\nPer lab group:\n- Three or four ballpoint or felt-tip pens of different color inks, at least one of which is black\n- One round sheet of filter paper, 18.5 cm in diameter (but see comment under “Notes” below)\n- Isopropyl alcohol\n- 400 mL beaker or an equivalent-volume clear plastic cup\n- Petri dish or plastic wrap\n- Metric ruler\nStudents should wear safety goggles and avoid inhaling alcohol fumes.\nNo special skills are required for this activity, other than reading and following instructions for preparing the chromatography paper.\nOne full class period and overnight to allow the papers to dry. Setup should take 10 minutes and the rest of the class period should be for allowing the solvent to move up the paper. If the solvent has not moved up the paper to the desired mark by the end of the class period, the teacher will have to remove the papers from the solvent whenever separation is complete.\n|Student Ability Level and Grouping\nThis activity may be done by middle school students working individually or in pairs.\nHave enough materials prepared to distribute to the lab groups. Be prepared to walk your students through the procedural steps below, demonstrating on your own filter paper as you go.\nHave student follow the following procedure:\n- Cut out a 5 cm by 16 cm rectangle from the round sheet of filter paper.\n- On the rectangle of filter paper, draw a line in pencil 1 cm from the edge as shown below. Note: It is important to use a pencil for drawing the lines on the paper, because ink from a ballpoint or felt-tip pen will become part of the moving “front” of alcohol and ink once the paper is placed in the alcohol.\n- Using the ballpoint or felt-tip pens, make spots with three or four different colors of ink (one should be black) on the pencil line. Be sure the spots are at least 1.5 cm apart. The ink spots should be small but dense. Add as much ink as possible without tearing the paper. Note: With felt-tip pens, it is better to lay down several spots on the same location, allowing them to dry between applications, than it is to make one big spot the first time. The individual spots will superimpose on each other without spreading out as much as one big spot would.\n- Fold the rectangle of paper in half, as shown in the picture below. It should look like a paper “tent” and the pencil line with the dots should be on the outside of the tent. Note: Students should write their names on the inside of the tent in pencil at this time for easy identification.\n- Pour isopropyl alcohol into the cup or beaker to a depth of 0.5 cm. Note: Some teachers choose to “develop” the chromatography “plates” themselves rather than allowing students to handle isopropyl alcohol. In that case, the teacher carries out steps 610. See comment below under “Notes.”\n- Place the folded sheet of paper in the beaker, with the ink spots toward the bottom, so that it stands up in the beaker like a tent. The paper should be sitting in the alcohol, but the alcohol should be below the pencil line. Note: If the paper sags and won’t stand upright in the beaker, improvise by suspending the filter paper over a pencil and hang that over the beaker. If you do this, you may have to fill the beaker with more alcohol so that the alcohol reaches the paper, but not enough to reach the pencil line.\n- Cover the beaker with a Petri dish or plastic wrap to minimize evaporation of the alcohol. Note: If the paper tent is suspended over a pencil, you will have to use plastic wrap because the support pencil will extend beyond the edges of the beaker, and a Petri dish will not fit.\n- Watch as the paper begins to absorb the isopropyl alcohol and move up the paper. Students should write down their observations on the Investigation Record Sheet for this activity as the watch. As the alcohol rises, it will meet and dissolve the ink spots, which will then travel up the paper with the alcohol (the solvent). The different color inks will travel at different rates. Moreover, the different component dyes of each color ink spot will begin to separate from one another as they travel at different rates up the paper, depending on both their solubility in the solvent and on their ability to adhere to the paper. Students will be able to see that pen inkwhether black, blue, green, or redis a mixture of component dyes or pigments. The component dyes will begin to reveal themselves.\n- When the isopropyl alcohol has risen to a level 0.5 cm from the top of the paper, remove the paper from the beaker.\n- Set the papers aside to dry overnight.\nHave students record their answers to the following on the Investigation Record Sheet.\n- After the papers have dried, have students count and record the number of separate colored stains there are above each original ink spot. Note which ink spot produced the greatest number of separate stains and which ink spot produced the least.\n- Students should compare results: Do all black inks give the same streak (chromatogram)? Does each particular color ink reach the same distance from the start line for each student? How do the streaks from the same ink on different groups’ chromatography sheets compare?\n- The principles behind chromatography might be a bit advanced for middle school students, but this procedure will clearly show the separation of the components of everyday materials.\n- Filter paper is usually sold in round sheets of standard sizes and is available from many science supply companies. You will need to use 18.5 cm diameter sheets in order to cut rectangular sheets of the proper size. Newsprint, heavier matte copy paper, or coffee filters can be used in place of filter paper, although they may sag as they soak up the alcohol. If you are buying from a science supply company, they also sell chromatography paper, in rectangular sheets. It is more expensive, but since it is already a rectangle, there is less waste.\n- If you choose to “develop” the “plates” yourself so students do not have to handle isopropyl alcohol, you may want to use a larger container so that you can develop all the plates at once. Just be sure to cover the container so the alcohol will not evaporate as quickly.\n||See Activity 7A.7, Assessment: A Challenging Separation.', 'Safety First: Ensuring a Secure and Protective Environment\nWhen designing the ultimate chemistry lab, safety should be the primary concern. Creating a secure and protective environment is crucial to safeguarding both personnel and the integrity of experiments conducted. Several essential design considerations must be taken into account. Firstly, proper ventilation systems should be implemented to ensure the removal of toxic fumes or gases that may be released during experiments.\nThis can be achieved through the installation of fume hoods or exhaust fans strategically placed throughout the laboratory. Additionally, sufficient space should be allocated for safe movement within the lab. Adequate aisle widths and clear pathways will prevent accidental collisions and allow for emergency exits to remain accessible at all times. Furthermore, it is imperative to incorporate proper storage facilities for chemicals, ensuring they are stored safely away from incompatible substances.\nCabinets with appropriate labeling and secure closures will minimize the risk of accidental spills or cross-contamination. Another crucial consideration is providing ample eye wash stations, emergency showers, and fire extinguishers in easily accessible locations within the lab. Quick access to these safety devices can significantly reduce injury in case of accidents or chemical spills. Lastly, adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) must always be available for laboratory personnel.\nErgonomics and Efficiency: Designing for Comfort and Productivity\nWhen designing the ultimate chemistry lab, one must prioritize both ergonomics and efficiency to ensure a comfortable and productive work environment for researchers. Ergonomics focuses on the design of equipment, tools, and workspaces to minimize physical strain on individuals, while efficiency aims to optimize workflow and reduce time wastage. By integrating these two considerations into the lab design, researchers can experience enhanced comfort and increased productivity.\nTo begin with, ergonomic considerations involve selecting adjustable furniture such as chairs and desks that can be customized to individual researchers’ needs. Providing proper lumbar support reduces the risk of back pain or discomfort during long hours of experimentation. Additionally, designing workstations at appropriate heights helps maintain a comfortable posture while working with delicate chemicals or equipment. Furthermore, an efficient lab layout is essential for smooth operations.\nConsiderations such as grouping related equipment together in designated zones streamline workflows by reducing unnecessary movement around the lab. Ensuring ample storage space near each workstation allows easy access to frequently used tools and reagents without interrupting experimental processes. Moreover, incorporating advanced technology like automation systems can significantly boost productivity in a chemistry lab. Automated sample handling systems or robotic arms eliminate repetitive tasks while minimizing human error.\nMaximizing Space: Optimal Layout and Storage Solutions\nCreating an efficient and well-organized chemistry lab requires careful consideration of the layout and storage solutions. With limited space, it is essential to maximize every inch to ensure a smooth workflow and safe working environment.\nThe first step in optimizing the lab’s layout is to prioritize functionality. The workstations should be strategically placed, allowing researchers to move freely without any obstruction. It is crucial to have sufficient space between workbenches for easy movement, equipment placement, and collaboration between team members.\nFurthermore, storage solutions play a vital role in maintaining an organized lab. Cabinets with adjustable shelves are ideal for storing glassware, chemicals, and other supplies. By utilizing wall-mounted shelving units or overhead storage racks, valuable floor space can be saved while keeping frequently used items within reach.\nAdditionally, considering the specific needs of the laboratory is crucial when designing storage solutions. Specialized cabinets for hazardous materials or temperature-sensitive substances should be incorporated into the layout accordingly. Moreover, implementing a labeling system on all cabinets and shelves ensures easy identification of materials while promoting safety measures.\nBy carefully planning the layout and implementing efficient storage solutions tailored to the lab’s requirements, researchers can maximize their workspace, streamline operations, enhance productivity while ensuring safety remains a top priority in an ultimate chemistry lab setup.\nVentilation and Air Quality: Creating a Breathable Atmosphere\nIn any chemistry lab, maintaining proper ventilation and air quality is essential for the safety and well-being of both researchers and the surrounding environment. Adequate ventilation not only helps to control chemical fumes and odors but also prevents the accumulation of potentially harmful substances in the air. Here, we delve into the design considerations that can be implemented to create a breathable atmosphere within the ultimate chemistry lab.\nFirstly, an efficient ventilation system should be installed to ensure a continuous flow of fresh air while effectively removing contaminants from the laboratory. This can be achieved through strategically placed vents or exhaust hoods that efficiently capture and remove airborne particles generated during experiments. Additionally, incorporating an air filtration system is crucial for maintaining optimal air quality in the lab. High-quality filters can effectively trap hazardous substances, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or particulate matter, ensuring that only clean air circulates in the workspace.\nMoreover, considering the use of non-toxic materials for furniture, flooring, and paint helps minimize off-gassing of potentially harmful chemicals into the lab’s atmosphere. Opting for low-emission products reduces indoor air pollution and promotes a healthier work environment. Lastly, regular maintenance and monitoring of ventilation systems are imperative to ensure their optimal functionality.\nFuture-Proofing the Lab: Integrating Technology and Flexibility\nIn the ever-evolving field of chemistry, it is crucial for laboratories to stay ahead of the curve by integrating technology and embracing flexibility. By doing so, labs can ensure they are equipped to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. One essential consideration when future-proofing a chemistry lab is the integration of advanced technology. This includes investing in state-of-the-art equipment and software that can enhance productivity, accuracy, and safety.\nFor example, automated systems for sample preparation, data analysis, and experiment execution can significantly improve efficiency while minimizing human errors. Additionally, a future-proof lab must be designed with flexibility in mind. This means creating adaptable spaces that can accommodate changing research needs and evolving technologies. Modular furniture arrangements allow for easy reconfiguration as new equipment or workflows are introduced. Similarly, flexible infrastructure should be implemented to support different power requirements or ventilation systems.\nFurthermore, incorporating digital connectivity throughout the lab is essential for seamless collaboration among researchers. Cloud-based platforms enable real-time data sharing and remote access to experiments from anywhere in the world. Such connectivity also enables integration with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms.']	['<urn:uuid:2aa53e58-7e97-4459-87d3-86182a643b4c>', '<urn:uuid:97a8797e-29dc-41fa-8f98-ec33202cf044>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	6	90	2282
21	Can hand movements and relativity theory both exhibit symmetry?	Yes. Hand movements demonstrate affine symmetry where transformations preserve features like parallel lines and distance ratios, while relativistic frameworks also exhibit symmetry - in Euclidean relativity this appears as rotational symmetry in 4D circular geometry where length contraction and time dilation emerge from geometric projections of 4D properties to 3D space.	"['First Evidence of Affine Symmetry in Hand Movement\nMeasurements reveal powerful symmetries in the way humans move their hands, a result that may have important implications for robotics\n""A fundamental problem in neuroscience is to understand how human movements are planned and executed."" So begins an interesting paper today by Quang-Cuong Pham at the Collège de France and Daniel Bennequin at the Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu, both in Paris.\nEvolution has had many millions of years to refine the process of movement so it\'s easy to imagine that nature must have discovered many useful shortcuts that help in planning and executing.\nIndeed, researchers have found evidence that the human motor system seems to exploit various kinds of symmetries in the way it executes movement.\nFor example, when humans draw the same shape in different sizes, they do it in the same duration. In other words, they take the same time to draw a short line as a long one. This is known as the isochrony principle.\nAccording to Quang-Cuong and Bennequin, this is good evidence that there is some kind of central control over movement planning. So in an effort to better understand this mechanism, they have devised an interesting experiment to directly measure some of its qualities. And today they publish the results.\nThese guys recorded the hand movements of four people as they scribbled onto a sheet of paper slowly and then as they did it again quickly. This experiment recorded not only the shape of the hand movements but the speed as well.\nQuang-Cuong and Bennequin compared the fast and slow scribbles, looking for line segments with similar shapes. They then used a computer to find mathematical functions called affine transformations that changed one line shape into the other.\nAffine transformations are special because although they distort shapes, they preserve features such as parallel lines and the ratio of distances along these lines.\nHaving found the appropriate affine transformation for a pair of line segments, Quang-Cuong and Bennequin then applied the same transformation to the time it took to draw the line, with surprising results.\nTheir main finding is that the same function that transforms the shape of one line segment into another also transforms the temporal structure of the line into the other.\nThat\'s a fascinating result. It shows there is some kind of invariance at work in the control and planning of hand movements in humans.\nWhat it doesn\'t show, however, is how and why this symmetry arises. Is it the result of the way the brain processes movement data (ie a software trick) or linked to the mechanics of body movement (ie a hardware trick)?\nOr perhaps there is some other reason. One intriguing possibility is a link to the Webber-Fechner law, which we\'ve discussed on this blog before. This law describes the relationship between the physical magnitude of a stimulus and its perceived intensity, which follows a power law.\nWhat\'s interesting here is that the law has a formal mathematical correspondence with the theory of communication which describes the way information is transmitted.\nThat may be coincidence or it may be a clue to a deeper link between perception and interaction and the nature of information\nCould it be that the affine symmetry in hand movement is a consequence of the laws that govern the way information is transmitted and received?\nPerhaps. Clearly, there is more work to be done here and the scene is set for an explosion of result sin this area since there are all kinds of new ways to record and study body movement.\nThis kind of work ought to be of huge interest to the robotics community. If powerful symmetries lie behind the way humans move, then there may be huge gains to be had by copying the same trick for robotic movement.', 'Euclidean Relativity (a.k.a. \'proper time physics\' or \'proper time geometry\')\nRelativity theory traditionally uses the Minkowski hyperbolic framework. Euclidean relativity proposes a circular geometry as alternative that uses proper time\nas the fourth spatial dimension. Other common elements in Euclidean relativity are the Euclidean (++++) metric as opposed to the traditional Minkowski (+---) or (-+++) metric, and the\nuniversal velocity c for all objects in 4D space-time.\nThe Euclidean metric is derived from the Minkowski metric by rewriting\ninto the equivalent\nThe roles of time t and proper time have switched so that proper time becomes\nthe coordinate for the 4th spatial dimension. The universal velocity c appears from the regular time derivative\nThe switch impacts all relativistic formulas for displacement, velocity, acceleration and so on in a similar way; invariants are based on t while vector components representing the\n4th dimension are based on . Many Euclidean\ninterpretations introduce time t as a parameter for tracking velocity and change,\nwhile in some articles it is treated as a fifth dimension.\nThe approach differs from ""Wick rotation""\nor complex Euclidean relativity. Wick rotation replaces time t by it, which\nalso yields a positive definite metric but it maintains proper time t as the invariant value whereas in Euclidean relativity\nbecomes a coordinate.\nThe Euclidean geometry is consistent with Minkowski based relativity. The hyperbolic\nMinkowski geometry turns into a rotation in 4D circular geometry where length contraction and time\ndilation result from the geometric projection of 4D properties to our 3D space.\nThe justification for the Euclidean approach is twofold: it makes relativity\naccessible in an intuitive way and it opens new opportunities to further develop\nBelow are a number of references to articles on Euclidean relativity published\nby various authors. Each author approaches the topic in his own way and\nindividual interpretations were often developed independently without knowledge\nof the other authors.

These pieces have been highly valued in the art market, with some examples selling for substantial amounts - one large white marble bodhisattva from the Tang dynasty sold for $740,000 at auction. Notable collections have included major institutions like the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Freer Gallery of Art. The ownership history of these pieces often traces back to prominent collectors - for instance, Charles Lang Freer acquired important pieces in the early 1900s through dealers like Bunkio Matsuki. Many of these sculptures originally adorned important religious sites in China's Tang capital (modern Xi'an) before entering private and museum collections in the West.

Rather than lamenting the left hand which is gone, let us look at the softness of the brow where the hair is artfully caught back under the headpiece, at the fullness of the cheek and neck, and the gracefully draped ropes of jewels. Is it not beautiful!""\nSince the introduction of Buddhism in the first century AD, images of Buddha and bodhisattva were believed to be imbued with the spiritual presence of the deity they depicted, and served as bridges between the deity and devotees. Helmut Brinker in ‘Early Buddhist Art in China’, Return of the Buddha. The Qingzhou Discoveries, Royal Academy of Art, London, 2002, pp. 20-33, discusses the role of Buddhist images and suggests that their making ‘was not primarily an artistic act…it was the realization of a sacred image’ (p. 22). Sacred text and Buddhist images brought back to China by monks who traveled through India and Central Asia, provided strict guidance for the making of these images. Depictions of bodhisattva wearing sumptuous jewelry, such as the present figure, derived from detailed descriptions in religious texts.\nThis figure effortlessly spans the aesthetic of the Sui and Tang dynasty, when a more naturalistic approach to depictions of Buddhist deities was gradually adopted. After a long period of cultural and military disunion, China was first unified under the Sui dynasty in 581, and in 618 the general Li Yuan founded the Tang dynasty. The Tang is considered one of the most prosperous periods in Chinese history, marked by economic and military expansions, successful diplomatic relations and a revolution in the official examination system, which had a profound effect in the creation of a new social elite. Under the Tang, the capital Chang’an became an international metropolis, which boasted some two million inhabitants including a sizeable community of foreign residents.\nFrom the early years of the dynasty, Buddhism was supported by the Imperial court, who actively sponsored major building projects and encouraged monks to travel abroad and bring back sacred scriptures. Emperess Wu Zetian (624-705), in particular, sponsored the building of several important caves and the monumental sculptures of the Fengxian Temple at Longmen. Empress Wu sought to draw parallels between her Imperial court and the Buddhist hierarchy in an effort to impart a spiritual significance to her rule. Sculptures of the period embody the new Tang style, and it is in this stylistic context that this figure stands firmly. A keen observation of human anatomy and the natural world is evident in the depiction of these figures’ facial features, the subtle movement of their bodies and natural sway of their garments. Figures appear imbued with a physicality and sensitivity not present in their Sui counterparts. This new style continued to evolve and by the 8th century, carvers made highly realistic sculptures modeled with sensuous and muscular bodies.\nA bodhisattva displaying a similar treatment of the robe and jewelry, in the Jinan dong cave at Longmen, is illustrated in situin Sekai bijutsu dai zenshei / New History of World Art Series, Tokyo, 1999, vol. 4, pl. 103; and two bodhisattva flanking a seated Buddha in the Wanfo dong cave is illustrated in situ in Zhongguo meishuq quanji. Diaosu bian [Complete collection of Chinese art, sculpture. Longmen stone sculpture], vol. 11, Shanghai, 1988, pl. 140. A head fragment of a bodhisattva reputedly from Longmen, displaying similar features, from the collection of C.K. Chan, is illustrated in Longmen liusan diaoxiang ji [Dispersed Longmen sculptures], Shanghai, 1993, pl. 71.\nUnlike the sculptures at Longmen, the present figure was conceived and carved in the round. Free standing sculptures from this period are rare, and even rarer are those of this exceptional quality and carved from marble. Furthermore, extant examples of Tang free-standing marble sculptures stylistically appear to belong to a later phase of development; a very large marble torso excavated in Xi’an, is illustrated in Zhongguo meishu quanji. Diaosu bian [The complete series on Chinese art. Sculpture], vol. 4, Beijing, 1988, pl. 53; a smaller torso in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansans City, was included in the exhibition Chinese Buddhist Sculpture from the Wei Through the T’ang Dynasties, National Museum of History, Taipei, 1983, cat. no. 28; another in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is published on the museum’s website, acc. no. 07.10; and a fourth from the collection of Evelyn Annenberg Hall, sold at Christie’s New York, 29th March 2006, lot 182. A kneeling marble bodhisattva in the Shanghai Museum, Shanghai, is illustrated in Ancient Chinese Sculpture Gallery, Shanghai, 2000, p. 25, two large marble esoteric figures, part of a group of ten sculptures excavated in 1959 and probably from the Anguo Temple in Chang’an, are illustrated in Angela Falco Howard et. al., Chinese Sculpture, New Haven, 2006, pls 3.121 and 3.122; and another in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, acc. no. 12.63.\nWhile no closely related example appears to have been published, this figure bears some similarities to two wood sculptures of bodhisattva: one in the Todaiji temple complex in Nara, illustrated in Matsubara Saburō, Chūgoku bukkyō chōkoku shiron / The Path of Chinese Buddhist Sculpture, Tokyo, 1995, vol. III, pl. 634, and the other in the Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, illustrated in Hai-wai yi-chen / Chinese Art in Overseas Collections. Buddhist Sculpture, vol. II, Taipei, 1990, pl. 126.\nIt was under the Tang dynasty that Buddhism reached its most flourishing phase. The years of cultural and political division that accompanied dynastic changes from the fall of the Han through the establishment of the Sui and Tang dynasties, gradually led to the rise of Pure Land Buddhism. Centered around the devotion of Amithaba, or a bodhisattva, this doctrine allowed devotees to be reborn in Sukhavati, the Western Paradise. Consequently, images of Amithaba and of bodhisattva proliferated in this period, especially those of Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion and Mercy, who was not prominent in early Indian Buddhism but acquired multiple manifestations already in the 6th century. The present figure appears to depict one of such manifestation, recognizable from the depictions of meditating Amithaba on the crown, and the jar held in the right hand.\nSotheby\'s.

They have a low profile design and require minimal setup to add to an existing audio visual system - it's simply an extension to the frequency response of the existing system.

In this weeks #TechieTuesday we look at Sub Speakers, or 'Subs' as they are more commonly known and find out what part they play in your audio visual solution.\nAV Discipline: Audio\nAV Category: AV Equipment\nAV Jargon: Subs, Doof Doof, Bottom Whackers, Woofer, Thumper or Bass\nWhat is a Sub Speaker?\nA Sub is a speaker specifically designed to reproduce a narrow band of low frequencies ranging from approx 20Hz up to approx 150Hz. Low frequencies require a lot of energy to be heard, and the large round drivers in a sub speaker move huge amounts of air to create low frequency sound waves. Low frequencies are not only heard but also felt, providing that thump or rumble through the body, enhancing the auditory experience for the audience.\nSource: Meyer Sound | USW-1P\nWhat events are Sub Speakers used on?\nSubs are commonly used at concerts, festivals, clubs and cinemas where the full spectrum of sound is required to be reproduced at loud volumes. For corporate events such as meetings and conferences where there is a lot of verbal discussion, there is not much acoustical benefit from using sub speakers due to the human voice not producing many frequencies below 150Hz.\nHowever for events such as gala dinners and product launches, where you want to make an impact on the audience, drawing them in through the play back of music tracks and video clips, then sub speakers should be used to provide that extra experience. Imagine the affect on your audience, who are not only hearing the soundtrack but also feeling it. You are now communicating with your audience on a completely different level!\nWhere are Sub Speakers placed at an event?\nSub speakers have a low profile and are typically positioned on the floor near the stage area where connectivity to power and audio signals are readily available. Very little is required to add sub speakers to an existing audio visual system, technically it is just an extension to the frequency response of the existing system.\nDon't just hear the sound, feel the sound!\nNext time you want to make an impact with your audience and get them feeling your message as well as hearing it, make sure to request sub speakers.\nUp next week...\nNext week we take a look at vision fold back and how it assists key note speakers and presenters with their audience communication.

24	How was the word 'vogelfrei' originally used?	According to Jacob Grimm's explanation, the word 'vogelfrei' originally meant 'free as a bird', but in the context of exiled people and execution victims who were denied burial, its meaning narrowed to 'delivered to the birds'.	['Man and animals live together since the domestication of a number of animals many thousand years ago. Through the ages they often got along quite well, but sometimes man needed the law to deal with the unexpected behaviour of animals. The company and companionship between women, men and animals is not completely harmless or effortless. Relationships ranged and range today from animal worship and sometimes almost human care for pets at one end to harsh treatment as mere objects and outright systematic cruelty, serving mankind in the end as food, provider of skins, cruel entertainment and other goals.\nIn a conference on Das Tier in der Rechtsgeschichte [Animals in legal history] at Heidelberg from April 2 to 4, 2014, legal historians and other scholars will discuss several aspects of animal and human life and the interaction between them. The program of the conference at Heidelberg has been created in cooperation with the commission for the Deutsches Rechtswörterbuch. In this post I will look at some aspects of the interaction between animal history and legal history. This is an occasion, too, to look at the Deutsches Rechtswörterbuch, one of the typical German dictionary projects.\nOf man and beasts\nAnimals are no aliens in legal history. Especially in German legal history animals come into view already early. I invite you to look for example at images from medieval bestiaries in Bestiaire du Moyen Âge, a virtual exhibition of the Bibliothèque nationale de France (interface French, English and Spanish), They are portrayed in various ways in the famous illuminated manuscripts of Eike von Repgow’s Sachsenspiegel. In April Dietlinde Munzel-Everling will discuss the animals in the Sachsenspiegel. Jacob Grimm, one of the pioneers of German academic legal history did not only study and publish versions of the medieval animal epic about the fox Renard in his Reinhart Fuchs (Berlin 1834). In an earlier post here I looked in more depth at the various versions of this much liked medieval story. His explanation of German words in his Deutsche Grammatik (first edition Göttingen 1819) often included historical explanations. The word vogelfrei, meaning literally and originally “free as a bird”, was in the context of exiled people and victims of execution who were denied a funeral narrowed to “delivered to the birds”. No doubt Grimm will figure in the contribution of Michael Frosser-Schell on animals in his edition of the Weisthümer (6 vol., Göttingen 1840-1878).\nAt the conference in Heidelberg a physician and a theologian will help looking at animals and legal history from different academic disciplines. Wolfgang Eckhart will look at relations between humans and animals from a cultural and medieval perspective. Martin Jung will look at animals in early French protestant theology. Apart from a section on animals in some selected legal sources the conference has sections on animals in public and private law, both in towns and rural areas, animals and their roles in criminal law, animals and law in art and language, and finally a section looking at animals in Spanish law (Marita Giménes-Candela) and animals in the German and French Enlightenment (Ulrich Kronauer). In this last contribution the change in views about the maltreatment of animals will be discussed.\nLegal procedure is a subject in the contribution of Inge Kroppenberg about the damnatio ad bestias in Roman law. Peter Dinzelbacher, too, will look at Tierprozesse, criminal procedures against animals. The hanging of dogs is the theme of Stephan Meder’s contribution. Hopefully they pay due respect to the classic study The criminal prosecution and capital punishment of animals by Edward Payson Evans (London 1906; reprint London 1987), but follow also the example of historians such as Esther Cohen to look beyond cases to their context and to patterns of argumentation. For studies about animal behavior and views about animals it is worth looking at the Animal Studies Bibliography created at Michigan State University. The College of Law at this university is home to the Animal Legal & Historical Center where you can conveniently search for specific historical cases and subjects, broader themes and jurisdictions.\nAnimals, law, history and the German language\nIn the second part of this post the Deutsches Rechtswörterbuch (DRW) takes pride of place. German scholars have a fine tradition of creating and editing dictionaries, with without any doubt the Deutsches Wörterbuch started by Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm as one of its major feats. The long time it takes to create such dictionaries is almost proverbial for the tenacity of German scholarship. A second association with these enterprises are the efforts of the various German learned academies. Not only academies with a budget for these projects, but also scholarly teams have the courage to start them, for example the team of 400 scholars behind the second edition of the Handwörterbuch zur deutschen Rechtsgeschichte (HRG). The online version of the HRG gives you free access to the list of entries and keywords, some examples and to excerpts of the other articles. Paid subscription is necessary for full access to the complete online version, but you can buy PDF’s of separate articles.\nThe project for the DRW was started in 1897 by the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Since 1959 the Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften leads and finances the project. This academy supports also the Dictionnaire Étymologique de l’Ancien Français. The idea for a dictionary of the German legal language comes from the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. On the website of the DRW you can view the original printed version, a digital version and a summary of each article. The DRW has now reached the word Schulbuch. The website of the DRW contains an introduction in English and French to facilitate its use. For the DRW a great number of sources from Germany and elsewhere for example from the Netherlands, has been digitized on a separate website, where you can search in specific sources; you can check this overview with a list of the digitized titles. A list with externally digitized relevant sources counts some 1,300 titles. The DRW has a special text archive for full text searches. Thanks to scholars such as Grimm the scope of the DRW is not just the legal language of Germany, the former Holy Roman Empire. Grimm wanted it to cover all languages of the Western Germanic language family. Thus Old English, Anglo-Saxon, Old and Middle Dutch, Old Frisian and even Lombardic, and the several medieval phases of the German language are included.\nAs with any dictionary created over a long time span the early parts of the DRW are not as rich as later volumes. The first volume appeared in 1914. The presence of digitized resources helps you to extend the examples adduced for early and later articles of the DRW. Let’s look for example at the cat (Katze) (DRW VII, col. 563-564). The cat figures gruesomely in a punishment dating from the Early Modern period in which someone was to be put into a sack with some living animals, among them a cat. The Katze was also the nickname of a punishment or a prison. The DRW links directly to other general German dictionaries, and indicated further textual sources, where you can even exclude certain word forms. Interestingly the ten additional textual examples from digitized sources for the cat stem all from Old Frisian law, mainly from the Westerlauwersches Recht, W.J. Buma (ed.) (Góttingen 1977). Here the cat is one of the animals which when they cause damages oblige their owner to pay only a part of the normal sum of money to be paid as a fine. The cat gave its name also to a number of following entries in the DRW which you might look up yourself.\nI owe you here information about the other animals figuring in the title of my post. The mouse (Maus) is only very rarely mentioned in a legal context (DRW IX, col. 380). In fact the evidence from a trial according to canon law Tirol around 1520 given by the DRW has already been printed by Evans (p. 259-260) in Appendix A of his study from a German almanac for 1843. As a Dutchman I can dream of a case of mice invading a room with Dutch cheese! Combining cats and dogs in the title of this post was seducing, but I could have guessed easily that a dog (Hund) would only for its literal sense take very much space in the DRW (VII, col. 53-61). However, the hunting dog (Jagdhund) has an entry for itself (DRW VI, col. 356-357), with additional entries for such subjects as the servant dealing with hunting dogs. I could not help smiling at the wonderful long compound German word for the very brief separate entry concerning the costs of the care for a hunting dog, Jagdhundverpflegungskosten.\nMistaking the scope of dictionaries\nEven if you can detect limits to the range and quality of the Deutsches Rechtswörterbuch you should remember that most languages do not have any kind of legal-historical dictionary worthy of a comparison with the DRW. Many people in my country complain about the largest dictionary – nicknamed the Dikke Van Dale [The Fat Dictionary] – it does not explain everything like an encyclopedia. They would be baffled by the Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal (WNT) which looks very much like an encyclopedia of the Dutch language from 1500 to roughly 1925. Its sheer size makes it the largest existing dictionary of any language. You will forgive me this paragraph when I tell you on this website you can even find words from the Lex Salica using the combined search mode of the WNT with dictionaries for Old Dutch and Middle Dutch. A dictionary of the Frisian language is also present on this website. Verily the DRW is not an encyclopedia, and also not a lexicon of juridical constructions and concepts, for which you can turn to the HRG.\nI would have liked to comment on the image with the chained apes, presumably a wooden sculpture somewhere in Germany, but I have not yet found more information about it. At the end of this post I would like to turn from history to the present, For a dictionary of current legal German you can consult online for example the Rechtswörterbuch, which brings you also to current German laws and legal study books. Animals in contemporary German law are the subject on the website of the foundation Tier im Recht. When I looked at this website with a poodle staring at you Germans will remember Goethe’s words in Faust about the heart of the matter, des Pudels Kern. In my opinion the various ways we looked and look at, dealt and deal with animals can say much about our attitude towards people, life and nature. The story of animals and animal law is not to be detached from human history, because it tells us about both the bright and darker sides of human life, our views of culture and society, its order and limits.']	['<urn:uuid:74bd497d-9dbc-4c57-bdc6-b6cb25aed66f>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	7	36	1822
25	shower water conservation tips save gallons	Showers use 5-10 gallons per minute. To conserve water, take short showers, don't overfill tubs, and place a bucket in the shower to collect water for plants.	"[""Becoming familiar with droughts can help you better understand what kind of risks you are facing. A drought is one weather hazard that is often underestimated, for two reasons. Droughts have a slow rate of onset and have less of a visual impact on us. However, the long term outcome of a drought can be widespread and very devastating. Being aware of water conservation tips can help to minimize some of the damages of drought.\nWHAT IS A DROUGHT? A drought is a water supply shortage for a certain use. A drought situation occurs when water supplies are less than demand. The greater the demand placed on an area's water supply, the more serious the drought. There are several types of drought.\nA meteorological drought is defined as a deviation from normal precipitation conditions over a period of time for a specific region.\nAn agricultural drought occurs after a meteorological drought and is the lack of adequate soil moisture needed for a certain crop to grow and thrive during a particular time.\nA hydrological drought occurs when precipitation has been reduced for an extended period of time, and water supplies found in streams, lakes, rivers, and reservoirs are deficient.\nA socioeconomic drought is a condition when the physical water supplies are so low that they negatively affect the community where the drought is occurring.\nWHAT CAUSES A DROUGHT? A drought situation occurs when water supplies are less than the demands. The greater the demand on an area's water supply, the more serious the drought.\nWHAT ARE DROUGHT EFFECTS? Some of the environmental effects include: lowered reservoir and ground-water levels, low streamflows; exposed shoreline, water quality problems, and impaired fish and wildlife habitats. Extended dry weather also heightens the danger of fire. Water resource quantity and/or quality reductions affect people directly and indirectly. If bacterial or other contaminants affect water supplies, unpleasant taste or odor may result. Other effects may include increased water costs, and water usage restrictions may have to be enforced by public officials.\nWATER CONSERVATION TIPS:Flush toilets less often. They are the largest home water users, as much as 40%.\nTake short showers and do not overfill tubs. Showers use 5-10 gallons per minute.\nPlace a bucket in the shower to collect water for plants.\nDon't let water run while shaving, brushing teeth, or hand-washing clothes and dishes.\nWash clothes and dishes in fully loaded machines only.\nRepair leaky faucets both indoors and outside and turn them off fully.\nUse a garbage disposal sparingly by accumulating waste and then grinding it all at once, flushing with cold water. Alternative: save for composting.\nInstall home water-saving devices, such as faucet heads and aerators, toilet dams, and pressure-regulator valves.\nWater gardens only when needed and between 7:00 and 10:00 a.m. Use an automatic timer and replace leaking sprinklers. (Don't water grass. Brown grass is only dormant, not dead.)\nMulch flower and vegetable gardens, shrubs, and trees to hold more soil moisture and control weeds.\nKeep a container of drinking water in the refrigerator instead of running water in the sink until cold.\nWash cars only when necessary and only at a commercial car wash with recirculating facilities.\nU.S. Drought Assessment (CPC/NOAA)\nU.S. Drought Outlooks (CPC/NOAA)\nLatest Drought Data (Interactive)\nU.S. Drought Portal (NIDIS)\nPalmer Drought Severity Index Map (CPC/NOAA)\nNational Drought Monitor Map (USDA/NOAA)\nNational Drought Forecast Map (NCEP/NOAA)\nUnited States Streamflow Map (USGS)\nWildfire Safety Guide""]"	['<urn:uuid:3086de7b-d7c3-4b62-a0fc-d6750848421a>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	6	27	567
26	password storage browser safety phishing risks	Storing passwords in web browsers should be done with care. While browsers offer to store passwords, this should never be done for important services like financial accounts since computer viruses and spyware can easily retrieve and distribute stored passwords. The only exception is for 'throwaway passwords' - accounts without sensitive information that you rarely use. Additionally, clicking links in unknown sites or emails can lead to phishing schemes where criminals try to steal stored passwords, so it's important to hover over links to verify their true destination and use popup blockers to prevent scareware that could compromise stored credentials.	"['Topics Map > University of Chicago > IT Services > Accounts, Identity, & Security > Security\nChoosing Good Passwords or Passphrases and Keeping Them Secure\nThis article provides tips on how to choose good passwords or passphrases and keep them safe.\nPasswords and passphrases are used to access many online services, such as email, credit card and bank accounts, eCommerce sites like Amazon, and social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. It is important to choose good passwords or passphrases to make sure no one gets access to your private information. Here are some tips on how to create secure passwords and passphrases and how to keep them secure.\nNote that the CNetID passphrase is an alternative to the CNetID password and functions identically to a CNetID password by authenticating you for all the common services you are eligible to use based on your affiliation with the University.\nIf you struggle with creating--and remembering--a complex password, an equally good option is to use a passphrase instead. Passphrases are simple sentences that use length instead of complexity to make them secure. Passphrases at the University of Chicago must be at least nineteen (19) characters. For more on passphrases, see the section contained in this article called ""Choosing Good Passphrases.""\nNote: CNet passwords and passphrases should NEVER be used for any services or applications outside of the University.\nChoosing Good Passwords\nSecure passwords at the University of Chicago must have at least twelve (12) characters and combine letters, numbers, and symbols. Choose passwords that are memorable, but not easily guessed.\nBelow are some tips for choosing good passwords.\nDon’t use dictionary words or names in any form in passwords\nDictionary words are any common words, names, dates, or numbers. Don\'t assume that this is limited to English dictionaries: if you can find it in the dictionary of any language (even fictional ones, such as Klingon), don\'t use it! One standard method for cracking passwords is a brute force attack, in which the attacker tries possible passwords over and over again. They try passwords in all sorts of languages using dictionaries of common words and names.\nDon\'t use common misspellings of dictionary words either\nMany of the dictionaries include both common misspellings and words with letters replaced with similar looking numbers (e.g. replacing “l” with “1”). You should also avoid simply adding a numeral to the beginning or end of a word.\nDon\'t use the name of the computer or your account\nSince these can be found out, these passwords can be very easy to guess.\nDon\'t use sample passwords\nObviously, if the password appears in a document such as this for the whole world to see, don\'t use it.\nA password must be at least 12 characters\nThe longer your password is, the harder it is to crack.\nUse multiple character sets\nUse a mixture of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and punctuation such as !, @, #, etc. Try to use at least three (3) out of the four (4) character sets available on your keyboard (e.g., KK, nn, 123, !@#). However, avoid using characters that don\'t appear on a standard US 101 keyboard, as they may not work correctly in all circumstances.\nUse letters chosen from words in a phrase or song lyric\nThink up a phrase. For example, ""Marx\'s Communist Manifesto has 8196 words in it!"". You can use that as your passphrase, or choose the first letter from each word. ""Marx\'s Communist Manifesto has 8196 words in it!"" You\'ll notice that in this example we\'ve decided to include all the punctuation to improve the quality of the password. So, your password would be M\'sCMh8196wii!. It is a nice, long password with a good mixture of character classes.\nCombine a few pronounceable ""nonsense"" words with punctuation\nFor example nuit+Pog=tWi. Pronouncable nonsense words are easier to remember than random characters.\nSecure passphrases at the University of Chicago must be at least nineteen (19) characters in length, and these characters include punctuation and spaces between words or letters. Note that the criteria for what constitutes a good password and what constitutes a good passphrase may differ. Unlike a password, for example, passphrases obviously need at least some dictionary words to function as they are intended to.\nBelow are some tips for choosing good passphrases.\nSelect something memorable to you\nPart of the reason someone might choose to use a passphrase instead of a password is because he or she finds a passphrase to be more memorable. Examples include a favorite childhood memory, favorite foods, places you\'ve visited, experiences you\'ve had, etc., or some combo of these things. For example, ""space camp MashedPotatoes4!"" (a favorite childhood memory and favorite food) is a particularly strong passphrase. While a hacker may try any of these words individually, only you know all the words and characters in this specific combination that form your passphrase.\nAdd unexpected characters\nConsider adding additional (unexpected) characters that only you know. So, for example ""space camp"" and ""mashed potatoes""--your favorite childhood memory and favorite food--becomes ""space camp MashedPotatoes4!""\nAdding other characters such as symbols, numbers, and capital letters increases the complexity of your passphrase and makes it more difficult for hackers to crack.\nThe longer, the better\nPassphrases must be at least nineteen (19) characters long. Since passphrases rely on length instead of complexity (like passwords do) for security, the longer your passphrase is, the harder it is to crack. Note that creating a longer passphrase--which includes spaces and punctuation--is easier than you might think. As noted earlier, a passphrase of, ""space camp MashedPotatoes4!"" is memorable and hard to crack because it\'s long (29 characters).\nDo not choose famous or well-known lyrics/lines/etc.\nWhile lines taken from the U.S. National Anthem, for example, might seem like a good passphrase, these lines are widely-recognized and famous, so in practice they make bad passphrases that are easy to crack. If you like the idea of basing your passphrases on a favorite book, song, movie or play, etc. consider taking a passphrase from a book, movie, play, etc. that is meaningful to you and not very well-known. Do not use anything that could be easily found in a book of quotations, an online quotation compiler, or can be found easily by Google.\nIf you must choose an (obscure) passphrase from a favorite book, movie, play, etc., you should add unexpected characters like numbers and symbols, and consider abbreviating it or changing it so only you know the ""code"". For example, ""To be or not to be/that is the question"" would become ""tB or not TB/titq7!""\nA good passphrase will, in general, not be a quote but a seemingly nonsensical list of items (like ""space camp MashedPotatoes4!"") memorable, meaningful, and unique only to you.\nSelect something unique or specific only to you.\nFor example, the passphrase:\nDavidHasselhof@RollingStones!could be a list of posters you have hanging on the walls of your office, home, dorm room, etc. This is a good passphrase because it\'s easy to remember (memorable to you) because you know what the category is (""posters I have hanging in my office going from left to right), it\'s long (29 characters), it has unexpected characters (the ""@"" symbol"" and the ""!""), and it\'s unique or specific only to you (""wall posters I have for things I like or am interested in""). To anyone else this list might seem strange and arbitrary, but you are unlikely to forget it (because these are your posters in your office).\nDo not use reuse a word or phrase if your account or passphrase has been compromised\nFor example, if your first passphrase was ""spacecamp MashedPotatoes4!"" do not reuse any of these words in your next passphrase, and never ""create"" a new passphrase by re-using an old passphrase but adding in new words or characters: for example, ""spacecamp MashedPotatoes Hi5!"" Hackers will easily be able to crack this.\nIt takes little effort to come up with a good passphrase if you follow the criteria outlined in this article.\nBelow are some other examples of good passphrases and why they are good passphrases:\n""Zelda Katamari MGS3#""\nThese are all video games. Lists of various categories, such as favorite items (food, games, books, etc.) can make good passphrases, so long as that information is not easily available online (on your Facebook, in your email, or on other social media accounts) or can be easily guessed by someone (everyone knows you love all the Harry Potter books, and there\'s a picture of you on Google images at a Harry Potter convention, for example)\nA list of all your childhood pets\' names is very easy to remember (memorable to you), contains unexpected characters (""&""), long (42 characters), and is unique to you; it\'s something that only you--in this specific order--would know.\n""That time I slipped on a Hot Pink Banana Peel $""\n""Bullriding at a Taxidermy Convention?!""\nBoth phrases are funny and unique, and so easy for you to remember (memorable to you), are long, contain uppercase and lowercase letters, and contain an unexpected character (""$"" and ""?!"").\nThe point of all these examples is that there is flexibility in choosing a passphrase: not all examples will be equally memorable to you, even if they\'re information only you know. For some people, a list of items they love with unexpected characters thrown in will be a perfectly easy passphrase for them to create and remember; other people may need spaces between words or a funny phrase to help them create and remember a passphrase. In other words, you may have trouble remembering ""Zelda Katamari MGS3#"" but not ""Bullriding at a Taxidermy Convention?!"" Allowing for the principles listed in this document, what makes a good passphrase depends partly on you.\nSmart Computing with Passwords and Passphrases\nDon’t use the same password or passphrase for all your accounts\nUsing the same password or passphrase (where applicable) for multiple services is very dangerous because if it is stolen from one service, hackers can use it to access all your other accounts. While having a completely different password/passphrase for each service you use is impractical, you can consider what the password or passphrase is protecting when choosing a password/passphrase. Some services may not require as secure a password or passphrase if they do not contain any private information. If you are unsure, always opt to use a different password or passphrase. Consider using a password or passphrase manager, such as Password Safe or LastPass to help manage multiple passwords/passphrases. However, you should carefully consider whether or not you want to store passwords and passphrases for financial institutions with a password or passphrase manager.\nFor less important passwords or passphrases (where applicable), you can use different iterations of the same basic password. For example, the password above, M\'sCMh8196wii! could become nM\'sCMh8196wii!NYt for a New York Times account “NYt” added after the core and “n” added before for “news” and However, the passwords or passphrases protecting your most sensitive information should always be completely different from other passwords or passphrases.\nNever share your password or passphrase\nNever give out your password or passphrase online or over the phone to others. Email and phone requests for your password or passphrase and other private information are phishing scams. University administrators or reputable companies, such as your bank or credit card company will never request this kind of information through email, fax, or phone.\nDon\'t even share your passwords with friends or family members. Especially do not give them your CNet password or paspshrase to gain access to any UChicago service, such as the VPN (virtual private network) or the wireless networks on campus. This is a violation of the Eligibility Acceptable Use Policy (EAUP). Instead, give your guest a temporary password or passphrase through the UChicago Guest Network.\nYour password/passphrase is like your signature; giving it out to others amounts to giving them the authority to sign your name, which makes you responsible for all activities associated with your account.\nUse non-secure networks with care\nAs a convenience, hotels, restaurants, and businesses often offer public internet access. Please use this access with care, and avoid accessing confidential information, such as financial data using these networks. Hackers often target these networks to obtain confidential information for financial gain. Whenever possible, use the UChicago VPN (cVPN) to carry out University business, as an added layer of protection. Still, hackers may be able to access your username, password or passphrase, and other private information by tracking your keystrokes remotely.\nChange your password or passphrase regularly\nThe longer you’ve used a password or passphrase, the more likely it is that someone has managed to figure it out. Change your passwords or passphrases regularly, such as once a year. Password protecting the most sensitive information should be changed more frequently than others. To change your CNet password or passphrase, visit http://cnet.uchicago.edu.\nDon’t store your password or passphrase within web applications\nMany web browsers and email clients offer to store your password or passphrases (where applicable). This is not the best idea and should only be done with care. Never store passwords or passphrases associated with important services, such as financial accounts. Computer viruses and spyware programs can easily retrieve stored passwords or passphrases from these accounts. They may even be able to distribute your passwords or passphrases before you notice that anything is wrong.\nThe sole exception to this is what we\'ll call ""throwaway passwords."" Throwaway passwords are passwords or passphrases for accounts that you do not care about and which DO NOT contain sensitive information, such as credit card information, medical history, phone records, etc. A throwaway password might be one of several passwords you reuse for services or applications you rarely visit, which you don\'t care about being cracked by hackers and which do not contain sensitive data.\nNever use information in a password or passphrase which can be found online.\nFor example, the names of the street you grew up on, your Harry Potter blog, the states you lived in, your obsession with making homemade canned goods on Pinterest, your likes on Facebook, and relatives\' names can all be easily found online, and some websites are devoted solely to compiling biographical information about you, like MyLife.\nStore written copies of your passwords or passphrase safely\nIf you need to write down your password or passphrase temporarily or access it from a written source, please store it in safe place. Do not write your passwords or passphrases down and place them under your keyboard or an unlocked drawer. If you must write them down, consider leaving out some of the easily remembered characters, and insert them when typing them in. Destroy the paper once you have memorized the passwords or passphrases.\nHere are some tips for safely storing a hard copy of your password:\n- Never write down the name of the service the password is for. E.g., if the password is for an Adobe application, do not write ""Adobe: spacecamp MashedPotatoes4!"" on a sheet of paper--no matter how safe you think that sheet of paper is.\n- Leave some characters out. Instead of writing ""spacecamp MashedPotatoes4!"" write down an abbreviated form that only you\'ll understand. E.g., ""sc MP4!""\nPassword or passphrase escrow service\nDepartments can store a sealed package of passwords or passphrases in a fire safe with IT Security. Only pre-designated parties will be able to retrieve the sealed package. For more information about this free service, see Password Escrow.\n2Factor Authentication (2FA)\nA final note: to strengthen your account security, ITS strongly encourages users to consider opting in to 2Factor Authentication (2FA). 2Factor Authentication (2FA) enhances the security of your CNetID by using your phone, tablet or other device to verify that you are really you when you attempt to access University applications. This prevents anyone but you from using your account to log in to websites like MyUChicago, even if they know your CNetID password or passphrase.\nGeneral safe computing tips\nFor other security tips, visit our Safe Computing site.', 'Do phishing scams have you paranoid about surfing the Web? They should not, as they can be stopped, and this article will tell you how.\nWe previously covered the topic of phishing by giving you a basic definition of what it is. To review, phishing is basically an instance where a potential victim is contacted, usually by email or telephone, by a party posing as a legitimate institution in order to trick the target into handing over sensitive information.\nIn addition to offering a basic overview of what phishing is, we also told you the different ways to detect a phishing scam. In particular, we discussed the telltale signs that are commonly found in phishing emails. Among these characteristics are a sense of urgency, an offer that is too good to be true, randomly generated names, poor grammar and spelling, and malicious links to infected websites.\nWith a basic understanding of phishing scams and how to detect them, now is the time to learn how to stop them or prevent them from creating chaos not only for your computer, but also your personal life. After all, these scams happen for a reason, and many times that reason is to pad the pockets of cybercriminals with your hard-earned money.\nSo, let us now take a look at how you can not only stop phishing scams, but also report them to help keep them from affecting new victims.\nWhether you are an expert Web surfer or a complete newbie, you will come across a phishing scam at one point or another during your online time. Some of these scams are very crafty and well-designed, so they might catch you if you are not paying attention. To help you out, here are tips that you can implement to your everyday surfing activities to avoid these scams.\nUse trusted up-to-date antivirus software and a firewall to provide a barrier between you and cybercriminals.\nUpdates, Updates, Updates\nWhether it is antivirus software, your browser, operating system, or applications, you need to keep everything updated. Vendors send out patches to fix detected vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. It may be annoying, but updating is essential to your online protection against phishing and other cyber crime.\nLeverage the Power of Nifty Toolbars\nMany popular browsers now offer the extended functionality of toolbars that can detect phishing sites. The toolbars check the site you are visiting against a blacklist of known phishing sites to tell you if you are safe.\nCheck Site Security\nWhenever you are entering in personal information, such as a password, banking information, credit card information, and the like, you want to make sure the site is properly secured so your information will not be leaked to others. There are a few things to look for to determine this. First, make sure that the “https” prefix is in the URL. Second, look for a little icon of a closed lock that means your connection is encrypted. Depending on your browser, you can click on the icon to see the site’s security details.\nManage Popups Properly\nPopups are not only irritating, but they can also be dangerous. Some come in the form of scareware that tricks you into thinking your computer is infected. Others offer phony rewards if you fill out phishing forms with your personal information. Use a popup blocker in your browser to keep popups at a minimum. If one does appear, avoid clicking options like “OK” or “Cancel” as these could just lead you into a phishing scheme or infected site. Either close out your browser, or click the X in the top right corner to exit the popup.\nWatch Where You Click\nIt may be tempting to click a lot of links when you surf the Web, but it is not a very good habit to have. Creators of phishing and other scams know what tempts users, and they leverage this knowledge to devise schemes to get you to click links that lead to sites that try to phish your information. Clicking links on a trusted site is fine, but clicking them on an unknown site, in email, or in instant messages could land you in trouble. Remember to always hover over a link to see exactly where it leads you, as some links will be disguised and will actually take you to a different site than promised.\nKeep Your Information to Yourself\nDo you want to make sure phishing attacks never compromise your personal information? If so, keep it to yourself, especially when wandering into unknown territory. If you do not disclose any personal information on the internet, you do not have to worry about anyone getting their hands on it. This goes for telephone calls as well. You never know who is on the other end. It is better off to call an institution directly or visit their official website and do your business from there. Never, ever disclose information via email, instant messaging, etc.\nRead Up on New Phishing Trends\nAs internet security companies and users out certain phishing scams, it becomes time for cybercriminals to change up their game plans. A stale scam has less of a chance to be successful as a new one, so new scams are constantly popping up around the online community. You can keep yourself educated on new phishing scams by doing periodic checks for news on the topic. A simple search in Google News for the term “phishing” should bring up plenty of news articles that detail newly detected scams. By being educated on the subject, you will be able to spot phishing scams easily and stop them from tricking you.\nPerform Account Maintenance\nAccount maintenance means checking your online accounts periodically to look for any unusual behavior. This mostly pertains to financial accounts (banking, credit cards, PayPal, etc.), but you should also do it for email accounts and social networking to make sure they are not compromised and being used to send out spam. A solid maintenance practice is to change your passwords frequently to keep hackers at bay. Do not use the same password on multiple sites, however.\nUse Common Sense\nNobody is going to give you free electronics and lottery prizes just for surfing the Web. Avoid these offers. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Use your instincts when surfing online just as you would in the real world.\nReport Phishing Scams\nIf you come across a phishing scam, report it and do your part to derail these scammers from affecting more victims. Some email services allow you to mark messages as phishing scams, such as Hotmail. You can also report phishing scams to certain websites dedicated to stopping them. Here are two links to do so:\nUnited States Computer Emergency Readiness Team - http://www.us-cert.gov/nav/report_phishing.html\nAnti-Phishing Working Group - http://www.antiphishing.org/report_phishing.html\n| DISCLAIMER: The content provided in this article is not warranted or guaranteed by Developer Shed, Inc.

27	What support resources exist for students learning advanced mathematics?	Several valuable resources are available. The internet, particularly Wikipedia, offers well-written math pages that provide alternative perspectives on statements and proofs. The math department provides problem sessions taught by upperclassmen, which are instructive even when not addressing specific questions, as students can learn from how classmates and tutors think about problems and proofs. Professor Gunning's office hours are also available, where he provides helpful hints that give students insight and intuition without fully explaining problems.	['Description of Course Goals and CurriculumMAT 218 is the second part of the MAT216-218 introductory math sequence. It continues as an introduction to the mathematical discipline of analysis, and as preparation for other higher-level math classes. When compared with MAT216, 218 focuses more on linear algebra topics and multi-variable analysis. Topics include real analytic mappings and series, the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, endomorphisms, inverse mapping theorem, implicit functions, integration over Jordan domains, and Stoke’s Theorem. The course is intended as a continuation of MAT216. Together the courses aim to provide students with a basic experience in a rigorous math class, in a style that will be similar to the style that students will encounter in upper level math classes. By the time students are in MAT 218, they have already had a semester of proof-based mathematics and thus MAT 218 does tend to focus more on foundational concepts in math than MAT 216 does. The class mainly focuses on linear algebra and multivariable calculus. As such, having some experience in both is helpful to contextualize the rigor and the proofs in the class, although no background is assumed (beyond what was covered in MAT 216).\nLearning From Classroom InstructionProfessor Gunning usually covers material quite quickly during class. Especially later in the course, Professor Gunning will often skip small steps within proofs to present the big-picture idea of how a proof is moving along. As such, it is important to follow both Professor Gunning’s speech and his written work, since sometimes he will say important things but not write them down or vice-versa. Professor Gunning does provide lots of examples of the material that he covers, and usually has plenty of time to answer any questions from the class. While Professor Gunning covers the majority of topics deeply in class, there are topics that he skips over during class that are still important for a good understanding of the material presented in class. A solid resource to rely in these cases (or in general if lectures are confusing), is Professor Gunning’s compiled course notes which is essentially the textbook for the class. If something is every confusing in lecture, reading the textbook is usually a helpful and solid start since the lectures and the textbook generally cover identical material (even including notation!). In order to make the best use of Professor Gunning’s deep, but fast lectures, it is important that students have a good understanding of the material already covered. Since lectures usually don’t spend too much (if any) time on review and Gunning does not often connect theorems directly to each other, not understanding what happened previously can lead to a scattered understanding of the material. Understanding methods of proof is also essential, since once a method of proof has been encountered once or twice, the class will generally go over it only briefly, skipping many of the small details. As such, it is important for students to have their own understanding of the proofs and the way they were proved. After all, while MAT 218 does present material that is new for some students, the general purpose of the class is still to provide an introduction to mathematical thinking rather than teach a specific set of material. To this end, students should always remember to try and connect the various ideas that are presented in the class and figure out how they relate to each other. While the material presented is useful, the ability to link and understand mathematical concepts is far more important in a long-term pursuit of mathematics.\nLearning For and From AssignmentsWeekly assignments in MAT 218 are similar to what could be found in MAT 216. The assignments in general are challenging, but teach students how to engage with increasingly theoretical material. In general, students should expect to spend a lot of time on the problem sets, but with the assurance that the problem they encounter are very much within their abilities, and do not require any outside knowledge. Problem sets are almost entire proof-based. When approaching a problem set, it is most helpful to first consider the proofs that have been shown in class and seeing what approaches worked, and why. Then, it is also important, particularly in analysis, to go over definitions and basic concepts to try and get a better grasp of what the problem is saying. Finally, it is usually instructive to try and solve a simpler version of the problem, or to do some numerical examples to see why a particular statement would be true. Exams are generally similar to the problem sets, although shorter and easier due to the three-hour time limit. Although they are open-note, students should have a solid understanding of the material before the exam. Since the exam, like the problem sets, are mostly proofs, looking up definitions or theorems could detract from time spent thinking about the proofs.\nExternal ResourcesSince MAT 218 is still introductory content, the internet can serve as a valuable resource. Wikipedia in particular stands out. The math pages are generally quite well written and seeing statements and proofs from another angle can be illuminating. The math department also offers problem sessions that are taught by upperclassmen. Even when the problem sessions don’t cover a specific question that a student might have, it is usually instructive to listen to classmates and tutors explain how to think about different problems and proofs. Professor Gunning’s office hours are also great. He is very open to questions and generally responds with hints that do not fully explain the problem, but give the student good insight and intuition into it.\nWhat Students Should Know About This Course For Purposes Of Course SelectionMAT218 has a very theoretical bend and requires MAT216 as a pre-requisite. As such, it is mainly intended for those students who are seriously considering studying rigorous math in the future. Although it is usually taken by freshmen looking to concentrate in math, there are also computer science and physics students who take the class to gain a better grasp of rigorous thinking and of underlying mathematical concepts. MAT218, along with MAT216, is definitely one of the most time-intensive and demanding pre-requisite courses at Princeton. It is however, very well-taught and rewarding, and a memorable experience for any student considering the deeper pursuit of mathematics.\nAnalysis in Several Variables']	['<urn:uuid:a6c05c42-d3a8-41c3-b022-4f0f1879d646>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	9	75	1051
28	critical software systems banks telecommunications what happens if requirements not met	In critical software systems used in banks and telecommunications, failure to meet requirements results in at least degraded service provision. More seriously, it can lead to severe failures that may cause irreparable damage. These systems must respect both functional requirements and quantitative requirements (such as specific execution times and energy consumption rates), and their compliance depends on factors like processor speed, bandwidth, battery capacity, and resource availability.	['Modern software systems, such as those found in the Avionics Industry, the Automobile Industry, the Chemical Industry, Telecommunications, Consumer Electronics, Banking, etc. are highly critical from a socioeconomic standpoint both in terms of their use and of their design, maintenance and evolution. These systems share the characteristic of having to respect both functional and quantitative requirements in addition to their intended use. Examples of such requirements include specific execution times and energy consumption rates. Requirements compliance may depend on a number of factors including processor speed, bandwidth, battery capacity, resource availability, etc. Violation of these requirements entails, at the least, degraded service provision. It may also induce serious failures that can produce irreparable damage.\nThe increased complexity of systems where the software component plays a preponderant role, poses numerous technical problems in all cycles of software development: requirements analysis, specification, design, deployment, integration, coding and validation. In this general context, it is becoming increasingly difficult to grasp the global behavior of a system with current tools (languages, models, theories, methodologies, EDI, etc). It is therefore imperative to foster new directions in state-of-the-art tools and models, both in terms of foundations and technologies. Innovative methods and tools should be sought for, that allow a means of addressing the inherent complexity of these systems.\nThere are many factors that contribute towards the complexity of software systems. A non-exhaustive list follows:\n- The large number and heterogeneity of the constituent components. In the process of engineering complex systems there is a need for applying knowledge arising from different areas. As a consequence, the structure, functionality and properties of the tools and models resting on existing theories and industrial practices become increasingly difficult to apply.\n- Complex hardware architectures. The use of complex platforms (distributed, multiprocessor, programmable, wireless, etc.) is motivated by the need for added speed, accessibility, robustness, etc. However, this creates gaps in the development chain since current software analysis, development and optimization techniques are not suited for exploiting these platforms at their maximum capacity.\n- Domain specific, high-level programming and modelling languages. Their appearance responds to the need for higher levels of abstraction in system development, in order to describe them as independently as possible from execution platforms while at the same time harnessing the intrinsic power of the specific domain of application. This is the origin of a vast set of theoretical and practical problems related to the preservation of semantics across different phases of development.\n- Interaction of software subsystems with the environment and physical components with complex, continuous dynamics. In order to grasp the global behavior of the system and its effect on the environment with which it interacts, it is necessary to develop hybrid dynamic models, combining both discrete and continuous event based systems.\nIt is becoming clear that current tools and methods for the rigorous description, design and implementation of software systems fall short in addressing additional emerging requirements such as those discussed above. Putting these tools and methods to work requires a profound understanding of the dynamic behavior of these systems, of their constraints and also their requirements. Indeed, these additional elements must be fully integrated into the model.\nThe use of heavily automated methods that feed on high-level models is one possible response to the correctness and precision requirements without relegating quality in the sense that the automatically generated code can be guaranteed to respect the requirements described in the model. The application of this approach would help minimize ruptures in the development cycle, reducing the time required to obtain market-quality products and hence also their total costs.\nHowever, the production of a faithful model of dynamic behavior for complex systems poses significant scientific and technical challenges. In order to respect execution requirements it is imperative to relate, starting from the design phase, functional behavioral aspects with non-functional ones related to temporal constraints on the execution of components, synchronization of components required for their proper integration, constraints related to communication services, distribution of components dictated by the execution platform, temporal characteristics, data placement in different physical memory banks, temporal and spatial properties of dynamic memory administration and more.\nIn order to tackle these problems, the research activity of LIA focuses on the development of new semantic foundations for programming languages and software models, and new techniques for the specification, modeling, verification and synthesis of implementations. The approach taken by LIA is based on formal, symbolic methods and models allowing the specification of properties of systems, the possibility of automating the verification of these properties either by static or dynamic analysis, and also the use of descriptions that model the run-time environment or execution platform.\nThe research program proposes the development of methodologies and tools which can aid in the automatic synthesis of an implementation which is correct by construction, providing guarantees that the compilation process respects functional and quantitative properties, as required by application software and constraints on execution platforms.']	['<urn:uuid:65aef285-df35-4ead-a4ce-04223ea9cfb6>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	11	67	816
29	how tell if saw blade needs maintenance	For table saws, signs include raggedy cuts, burn marks on material, and motor strain (audible dive during cuts). The blade should be checked for pitch buildup below teeth and any bend/warp. For chainsaws, dull blades are more likely to act as levers causing kickback. Both types of saws require regular blade sharpness checks and proper blade orientation for safe operation.	['In our article what to look for on a table saw, we told you that the table saw is the cornerstone tool of both the jobsite and shop. It makes the big cuts that are either difficult or near-impossible with other tools. It also does this while offering tabletop support and built-in guides to keep material straight. Still, if you don’t know how to calibrate a table saw, your cuts may never be truly straight.\nIf a table saw’s components aren’t properly aligned, your cuts won’t be accurate. That applies to cheap saws as well as expensive cabinet saws. Telltale signs of a misaligned saw are raggedy cuts, burn marks on the side of the material, and even extra wear on the motor (as evidenced by an audible “dive” it takes during the cut).\nThat’s bad enough, but it can also be more dangerous to operate. If the cutting path narrows, the saw is more likely to kickback (send material back at you when it gets launched by the blade). This can happen due to wood getting pinched between the blade and fence. Although ensuring all components are parallel takes a few minutes, it’s well worth the time.\nWe have a saying around here: It’s wise to de-energize. If you take nothing else from this article, unplug your table saw before calibration!\nCalibrate a Table Saw Starting with the Blade\nThe easiest place to start—and a good maintenance habit to develop—is blade inspection. Be sure there’s no pitch buildup below the teeth. Pitch is the general gunk the blade collects over time. It can be sap or built up adhesive from layered material. In another article, we’ll talk about using solvents to clean pitch from an otherwise good blade. Carefully spin the blade to be sure it’s without bend or warp. If it’s not true, it’s time for a new blade!\nNow gently try to wiggle the blade from side to side. Even an acceptable blade won’t cut true if the arbor that holds it through its center is loose or worn. This wobble is called runout, as in, you’ll runout of material before the blade makes a true cut. That’s not really why, but it’ll help you remember! Tighten the bolt holding the blade onto the arbor if possible. If it’s already tight and the wobble persists, you might need new bearings (or even a new saw!).\nSquare the Table Saw Blade to the Table and Adjust Bevel Stops\nPeriodically squaring the blade to the table is another good maintenance habit to develop. Do it at least every time you change the blade. However, since it only takes a moment, consider checking square more often. Use a reliable machinist square or combination square.\nRaise the blade to its highest extreme. Stand the square vertically with the 90° against the blade and table. Be sure it’s against the blade’s body only and not resting on a tooth. Hitting the extended kerf from a carbide tooth will skew your squaring. You’ll be able to tell right away if the blade is out of square. In fact, I found my own table saw to be a full 1° out of square using this method!\nChecking Your Table Saw Bevel\nNext, be sure the bevel gauge registers the proper 0° angle. If not, you want to adjust it as necessary. If you find that the blade simply won’t come into square, adjust the left bevel stop. Consult the owner’s manual for its location.\nNext, move the blade to a 45° bevel. With a combination or rafter square, check the angle for accuracy. Since you just squared the blade to the table and ensured the bevel gauge is accurate, expect it to be accurate here. You may want the right bevel stop to terminate the trunnion movement at 45°, so adjust it as necessary like you did the left one.\nSquare the Blade to the Miter Slot\nIf you’ve spent a few minutes researching the topic, you’ll know there are several methods for assuring the blade is square to the miter slot. The methods range from simple to sophisticated, requiring simple to sophisticated tools for the job.\nNot surprisingly, the more sophisticated the tool, the more accurate the measurement. You can use a precision ruler, calipers, a creative method of your own, or our preference: a dial indicator. Whatever you choose, be sure there is no play in the miter guide as you measure the distance from it to the front and the back of the blade. This reveals how out of square the blade is to the miter slot. The more granular your measurement, the more accurate you can be.\nIf you find the blade isn’t square with the miter gauge, visualize which way the table will have to move to bring it into square. Using that visualization, determine which of the bolts holding the table (from underneath) is the pivot point of the table’s movement. Without loosening that pivot point bolt, loosen the other bolts (likely three of them, but some have more) just slightly.\nThen, using a rubber mallet or dead blow hammer, gently tap the side of the table in the right direction. Tighten one of the loose bolts carefully to avoid moving the table. Measure again and if the blade is square to the miter slot, tighten the remaining bolts.\nSquare the Blade to the Fence\nSquaring the blade to the fence is equally important to cut accuracy and safety. Since our blade is square to the miter slot, squaring the fence to the miter slot will square the fence to the blade. Therefore, using the same measurement method (in our case, the dial indicator), determine if one end of the fence is closer to the blade than the other. Consult the owner’s manual to adjust the ends of the fence.\nAlthough somewhat less critical, put a machinist square against the fence to determine if it’s sitting 90° to the table. Adjust if necessary.\nHow to Calibrate a Table Saw: Extra Credit\nIf you’ve made even small adjustments to this point, the improvements to the finish quality of your work will be noticeable. Even small cut inaccuracies can be seen from a distance. You need to put the odds in your favor using a saw with parallel components. But that’s not all you can do. Here’s some extra credit for the over-achievers (you know who you are).\nThe throat plate (the removable, oblong piece surrounding the blade opening) should be flush with the table. If it’s too high, it will impede the smooth movement of the material over the table. If it’s too low, it might not support the material or it could catch it on the backside of the blade.\nTypically the throat plate can be adjusted with set screws from the top. If your saw didn’t come with a zero clearance throat plate, consider replacing it. With zero clearance, small waste shavings won’t get caught between the blade and plate. Moreover, it provides greater support around the cut, resulting in less tear-out and cleaner cuts.\nThere are several lubrication points on a table saw, including the trunnions which allow the blade to move for bevel cuts. Consult your owner’s manual for location and maintenance schedule to keep moving parts moving!\nFinally, keep the table clean and smoother. Don’t let any wood glue or sawdust collect on it and you’ll enjoy many years of accurate cuts! Hopefully, this gives you some solid tips as you figure out how to calibrate a table saw. If you’re a Pro and you have table saw tips, add them in the comments below.\nWe featured the Skilsaw Heavy-Duty Worm Drive Table Saw in this article. Check out the features and specs below along with the full review here.', 'One of the most common causes of injury when using a chainsaw is kick back. Kickback is when the chainsaw blade will rapidly jerk upwards, usually towards the operators face, and can cause serious, or fatal, injuries. Kickback is a constant concern for chainsaw manufacturers because of it’s inherently dangerous nature. All modern chainsaws come with a variety of technologies that attempt to reduce the potential for kickback, but no technology has managed to remove kick back completely. Reducing kickback is also the responsibility of the operator, and understanding why chainsaws kickback is the first step in reducing the risk of serious injury.\nWhere is the Kickback zone?\nChainsaw blades will face away from the user on the upper half of the saw, and towards the user on the lower half of the saw, where the chainsaw cuts. The region where kickback is most likely is the upper half of the saw at the end of the blade. When the saw is laid flat, the upper 45 degrees is known as the kickback zone. It is this area that is most likely to cause kickback during use.\nWhy does kickback happen\nKickback happens when the blades of the chainsaw get caught in the object being cut. The most likely cause of kickback is when the operator is cutting and the saw enters the object at the kickback zone. In the kickback zone, the least amount of downward force is applied. This means that, as the blades curve over the top of the saw, they get caught in object being cut. The relative lack of cutting force causes the blades to change from cutters into levers. The levers attach to the material being cut and force the blade upwards in a rapid motion. Needless to say this process happens in an instant, is incredibly dangerous and pushes the saw upwards with all the force that is in the motion of the chain.\nHow to reduce kickback\nNow you know why, where and how kickback occurs you are best placed to avoid kickback. Because kick occurs in a specific region of the saw, the first thing to do is to avoid using the saw in the kickback zone. Avoiding the kickback zone will reduce the chances of kickback greatly, although not completely. Another reason for kick back is because the blades are not sharp enough. The less sharp the blade, the more likely they are to act like levers. Maintaining a sharp tool is paramount to reducing the chances of kickback. The final reason as to why kickback occurs and how to reduce it is by making sure the blades are the right way around. If you’re chainsaw chain is fitted the wrong way you will have a dull chainsaw that is very likely to kickback because it will be less sharp. Have your chainsaw checked regularly to make sure it is sharp, correctly fitted and ready to use. Always avoid the kickback area where possible and, most importantly, never stand directly behind the saw when using it.']	['<urn:uuid:44024d9c-1bca-499d-8b76-ad5e30f0dc5a>', '<urn:uuid:2f8a2c65-2a32-4af8-9ac7-f6290d8415da>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	7	60	1802

The entire system, however, is actually much larger and more complex. The exhaust system begins at the engine combustion chambers and runs along the undercarriage of the vehicle, eventually ending with the visible tailpipe.\nThe major components of the exhaust system include the exhaust manifold(s), oxygen sensors, catalytic converter(s), resonator, exhaust pipes, muffler, and tailpipe.\nThe exhaust manifold is connected directly to the engine and has the job of harnessing the combustion gases into the exhaust system. It is possible, depending on the size of the engine, for there to be two exhaust manifolds. The manifold, comprised of smooth curving passages to improve the flow of exhaust, can be made of steel, aluminum, stainless steel, or more commonly, cast iron. Cracking, warping, and leaking due to broken mounting bolts are common manifold ailments.\nAll modern fuel injected cars utilize oxygen (O2) sensors to measure how much oxygen is present in the exhaust. From this information, the computer can add or subtract fuel to obtain the correct mixture for maximum fuel economy and optimal performance. In most cases, there are two O2 sensors in a four-cylinder engine. One is located on the exhaust manifold before the catalytic converter. The other is located after the catalytic converter on the exhaust pipe. In V6 or V8 engines there are four O2 sensors. Two O2 sensors are located before the catalytic converter on each cylinder bank. The other two O2 sensors are located after the catalytic converter on respective banks.\nThe catalytic converter reduces harmful emissions from engine exhaust. The converter, mounted between the exhaust manifold and the muffler, uses a combination of heat and metals that act as catalysts. A catalyst is a metal, or sometimes a chemical, that causes other chemicals to go through a reaction without being affected itself. The inside of the catalytic converter consists of materials such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium. These materials are the catalyst that causes the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons to react and produce water vapor and carbon dioxide which are much less harmful to the atmosphere.\nThe resonator is like a mini muffler with less restriction. It is an empty echo chamber the exhaust travels through where the exhaust energy bounces around, resonates, and some of the noises cancel each other out. A resonator doesn’t just remove sound, it changes it to be more acceptable. The resonator can be either before or after the muffler in the exhaust system.\nExhaust pipes connect all the components of the exhaust system. They are designed to route the exhaust in the most efficient way possible as it travels toward the rear of the vehicle, and to keep the hot exhaust away from heat sensitive components in the engine compartment and along the undercarriage of the vehicle. Exhaust piping is usually made of steel, but can be aluminized steel tubing, or stainless steel, which lasts longer due to its corrosion resistance. Connections are generally made with clamps, gaskets, or welds.\nThe muffler quiets the noise of the engine. There are two kinds of mufflers. One uses baffled chambers to reduce noise. As sound waves move through this type of muffler, they bounce off the baffles and expend their energy inside the muffler, losing force and volume. The other type forces the exhaust straight through a perforated pipe that contains metal, fiberglass, or some other kind of sound-absorbing material. This type of muffler is designed to reduce back pressure, which occurs when exhaust travels back up the pipes toward the engine, and consequently makes more noise.\nThe tailpipe comes out of the muffler, past the rear bumper of the vehicle, and directs exhaust gases away from the vehicle. Some vehicles may have more than one tailpipe. The tailpipe often ends with just a straight or angled cut, but may include a fancy tip. The tailpipe is often larger in diameter than the rest of the exhaust system. This produces a final reduction in exhaust pressure, and is sometimes used to enhance the appearance of the vehicle.\nThe worst enemy of an exhaust system is corrosion, more commonly known as rust. Moisture or water vapor is present in the exhaust as a by-product of combustion and the catalytic converter. Corrosion may also result from outside elements such as rain, snow, and salt. If you live in an area where road salt is used during the winter, make sure to wash the underside of your vehicle with water every few weeks. Salt speeds up the corrosion process and getting it off as soon as possible will help stop the corrosion.\nOther symptoms of exhaust system problems may include decreased power, decreased fuel economy, hissing noises, metallic rattling noises, an overly loud engine, exhaust fumes, the presence of a check engine light, and physical damage due to the system hanging low beneath the vehicle.\nMany factors, such as climate and driving conditions, can affect the life of your exhaust system. The cleaner the engine runs, the cleaner the exhaust traveling through your exhaust system will be, which will help prevent catalytic converter and O2 sensor failures. It is important to have your exhaust system inspected by an ASE certified technician at least annually, or whenever you experience symptoms possibly related to the exhaust system. Each component should be inspected for damage, rust, leaks, broken bolts, cracks, noises, secure mounting, and to make sure all critical components are present.\nIf you are buying a used vehicle, make sure the entire exhaust system has been thoroughly inspected before you make your purchasing decision. Having the exhaust system inspected will ensure the vehicle is operating efficiently, will help keep your passengers safe, and may help you avoid costly repairs.']"	['<urn:uuid:e7b63f2b-263a-470d-8fd8-d59560c75786>', '<urn:uuid:d18ede61-ba1a-41a7-9dee-f8068a61c1d2>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	7	84	2900
31	How deep should you dig a patio base and what utilities depth should you check?	For a patio base, you should dig 9 to 10 inches deep to provide a solid base and put bricks at or slightly above grade level. As for utilities, you need to check for electricity cables at 18-40 inches deep, gas pipes at 15-30 inches deep depending on location, and water/drainage pipes typically at 3-5 feet deep.	['Preparing the Patio Base\nDesign the layout of the patio. Allow adequate room for your family’s activities. Consider what patio furniture you plan to place on the new patio as well as where you intend to set the barbecue grill. If you want to use the house as shade, work that into your design.\nMark the boundary of the brick patio with stakes and string. Allow 6 to 8 inches more than you included in your design. This gives you some room to work with the bricks as you set them. As you set the string on the stakes at the level you intend to lay the bricks, allow for a slope of 1/8- to 1/4-inch per foot away from the house to allow for drainage.\nDig out the patio area with a shovel. If you have a large area, rent a skid steer loader. A depth of 9 to 10 inches provides a solid base and puts the bricks at or slightly above grade level.\nCompact the subsoil with a plate compactor. Cover the soil with 2 to 3 inches of angular gravel. Rake the stones until they create a level surface. Dampen the gravel with a garden hose. Compact it in place with the compactor. Add another 2- to 3-inch layer of gravel, rake it level and compact it. Continue adding gravel until the gravel surface gets to within 3 inches of the string guide you set up in Step 2.\nSet up parallel lines of 1-inch conduit pipes to use as screed guides on the gravel base. Screeding is the process of leveling the base by filling low spots and lowering high spots by rubbing a long, straight board over two parallel pipes. Space these pipes no more than 7 feet, 6 inches apart. Try to arrange them so that you can do the screed work from the edge of the patio. Once you have a pattern established, press the pipes into the gravel base about 3/4 inch. If you set a paver on top of the screed pipes, the paver’s top should extend 1/8 to 1/4 inch above the string line. If it doesn’t, raise or lower the pipes accordingly.\nPlace several shovels of gravel between two screed pipes closest to the house. Set a straight 8-foot length of 2-by-4 on the pipes. Work the board back and forth as you pull it toward you to level the gravel. Keep adding gravel until you complete that section. Add gravel and screed it in the remaining sections of the brick patio.\nRun the plate compactor over each section of the patio. Do not disturb the screed pipes. At this point your base should be solid enough to not leave a hand print.\nPull the screed pipes. Try not to disturb the gravel as you do so. Lay additional gravel in the trenches left by the pipes. Compact it into place.\nLaying the Brick Patio\nSnap a straight line parallel with the wall of the house, using a chalk line. Snap a second line perpendicular to the first. This gives you a right angle to lay all your brick from.\nSet the bricks, starting at the right angle. After you set the first brick, bring the edge of the next brick up to the first and drop it into place as close as possible to the first brick. Avoid scuffing the gravel underneath as you lay bricks in the pattern you selected for the patio. Extend bricks beyond the boundary where the curved edges are to be.\nLay 1/2-inch conduit pipe on top of the set bricks in the shape of the curved edge. Use a sharp metal object, such as a chisel, to score along the line marked by the pipe. Remove the pipe.\nCut along the scored line with a cutoff saw. In most cases you don’t need to remove the brick from the base to make the cut.\nLay a soldier course of bricks along the entire perimeter of the patio. Place the short edge of the bricks firmly against the last row of bricks you laid. If you prefer, lay a sailor course, by placing bricks end to end along the perimeter.\nSet the flanged edge of the paver edge restraint firmly against the soldier course. Drive the pins that come with the edging into the gravel base, using a hammer. Cover the remaining opening between the brick patio and the lawn with topsoil.\nSprinkle sand over the entire patio. Use a push broom to work it into the cracks between bricks. Set a protective pad underneath the plate compactor and go over the entire patio with the compactor to settle the sand. Add more sand and compact the patio again.\nThings You Will Need\n- Skid steer loader\n- Plate compactor\n- Garden hose\n- 1-inch conduit pipe\n- 2-by-4, 8 feet long\n- Chalk line\n- 1/2-inch PVC pipe\n- Cutoff saw\n- Paver edge restraint\n- Push broom\n- Contact the local utility companies before you dig. They can mark the location of any buried lines on your property so you don’t accidentally hit them.', 'Is it Safe and Permissible to Dig a Hole in your Backyard without Consulting Local Authorities?Rules and Regulations for Excavations on your Private Property | Depths of Underground Utility Services\nSo you have a little project that you want to do on your private property, and this project involves trench excavations, but before you proceed with your project, can you legally dig a hole in your backyard without permission from local authorities and utility operators?\nBefore we look at rules and regulations regarding excavations and digging trenches in your backyard, we should look at reasons why you would want to dig a hole in your backyard.\nYou have been talking to a neighbour or friend who has an amazing garden, a beautiful landscaping feature like a water fountain, koi pond, stone/metal sculpture, pathway lamp posts, curb mailbox, tropical plant, palm trees or an outdoor structure like a pergola, gazebo, screen wall, boundary wall, a rustic outdoor shower cubicle, barbeque area or fireplace. Maybe it’s a septic tank, stormwater gulley, manhole or inspection chamber. All these outdoor home improvements, additions and works will require you to dig a hole, trench or excavation of some sort. The width and depth of the excavation will depend on what you are building or what you want to install. If you have building drawings of the structure, the draughtsman, engineer, architectural technician or landscape designer should show you the dimensions of the structure, i.e. the plan view, elevations and cross section details of the foundations that need to be dug. This information is required by local building authorities, so make sure you have the drawings and other information about your site at hand. Local building authorities need to know the depth and width of your excavations, as well as the site conditions before they give you a permit or permission to dig holes and pits on your property.\nPermit To Dig in Your Backyard\nRegardless of where you live in the United States, digging a hole in your home yard comes with risks that may cost you legally or financially. You do not just stand a chance to violate local ordinances and get fined, but digging holes arbitrarily on your private property may pose a hazard to your health and physical well being. Your neighbours as well as the whole community may be affected by your actions. Hazards of digging holes in your backyard without consulting local authorities and utility operators include damaging underground water, sewer and gas pipes. Damaged water and sewer pipes can cause flooding in the surrounding environment. Hitting buried gas pipes can cause fire outbreaks and air poisoning. Broken electricity cables and wires left exposed pose a risk of electrocution and fire outbreaks.\nAccording to CGA (Common Ground Alliance) and city council ordnances in various parts of the United States, you need to call 811 before you dig a hole on your property. There is no legal minimum depth that you can dig before calling 811. This is due to the fact that environmental conditions such as ground settlement, rainfall, floods, surface runoff, soil erosion and deposits can change the depth of topsoil, reducing or increasing the cover for underground services.\nHow to Contact 811 for Backyard Excavations\nTo call 811, simply visit the CGA site, choose your state and submit an online application for permission to dig holes on your property. Your state 811 call centre will create a ticket that allows you to follow up the progress on your application. Alternatively, you can pick up your phone and call 811 directly to speak with the call centre agents. The call centre agents will submit your request and notify you of utility operators who have responded to your application for excavating in your home yard. After submitting your request, you have to wait for responses from utility operators of underground services such as drainage pipes, gas pipelines, water supply lines, telecommunication and electricity cables. They provide feedback through your local 811 call centre, so you will only interface with the call centre.\nIt may take 2 to 3 days for utility operators to respond to your application, but the time varies with each state. Once your request is processed, the utility operators will send out their inspectors to come and mark the positions of underground services in your yard.\nRemember, you cannot start digging until all utility operators have responded to your request and marked the positions of all underground services. Do not remove the paint markings or any flags that are used to locate underground services. If you lose the markings in the course of your construction activities, you will be required to submit another application for re-marking.\nRules and Regulations for Excavations on your Private Property\nAfter you have obtained permission to dig holes inside your residential lot, there are a whole lot of rules and regulations that you have to abide with. Caution and care should be taken when digging near utility markings. OSHA and CGA provide health and safety guidelines for digging trenches, holes and excavations.\nDistance from Utility Line or Service / Tolerance Zone\nState building codes recommend digging 18 to 24 inches (457mm to 610mm) from the utility and its marking to avoid damage to the utility line. The homeowner and the contractor are prohibited from using mechanical equipment when digging within this perimeter, which is known as the tolerance zone.\nYou can only dig within the tolerance zone using hand tools and vacuum excavators which give you a high degree of control and precision. A vacuum excavator is the best option for “soft digging”. It breaks the earth and loosens soil particles by blowing air or water at high pressure. With this method, there is no risk of damage to underground pipes. On the other hand, hand tools can cause damage to buried lines if delicate and proper techniques are not used. While a hand tool will be useful for breaking hard surfaces such as concrete paving and slabs, you must verify that there are no service pipes or conduits embedded inside the concrete or too close to the slab.\nDig Alongside the Service Line, Not on Top\nAs a rule, you must not use a hand tool to dig on top of or over a buried service line. Dig alongside the utility line on both sides parallel to the line, and observe the tolerance zone stated above.\nScan for Underground Services Every 300mm of your Dig\nBefore digging alongside the buried utility line, you must use a CT Scanner to locate the depth of the service line as well as other possible uncharted services which might exist under the spot or working area. This device is also known as a Cable Locator or Cable Detector. However, you are not only going to use this device on your first dig, but you have to repeat the scanning procedure every 300mm (12 inches).\nThere are different types of scanners for detecting specific underground materials. Metal locators can only detect metal pipes and electric cables. They cannot detect non-metallic pipes such as plastic, PVC, clay, fibre cement (asbestos cement), HDPE and cement.\nTo ensure that non-metallic underground services are not missed in the cause of prospecting and scanning, you have to use a GPR device (Ground Penetrating Radar). A ground penetrating radar device can detect all types of buried lines, both metallic and non-metallic.\nHow Deep Can You Dig Without Calling 811?\nHow deep can you legally dig in your backyard? As has been said previously, there is no minimum or maximum legal depth of which you can dig holes in your backyard residential lot without calling 811 or consulting the local building authorities, meaning that you have to call 811 before digging any kind of hole. However, for practical purposes (leaving the legal requirements aside), it is generally safe to dig holes no more than 300mm deep (12 inches) on your property, and it’s much safer and non-risky to dig holes no more than 100mm deep (4 inches). It will be quite safe as long as you are digging within your residential lot, and not outside the lot, for example on street paving etc. Digging holes on your street curb and paving will require a permit in most cases, depending on your state laws.\nEarthwork Support for Deep Trenches\nEarthwork support to prevent the risk of collapse must be installed inside a trench with a minimum depth of 1.5m (5 feet). Timber shoring is a common method of preventing the walls of a trench from collapsing onto the worker. Trench boxes and sloping are other protective measures that can be used. You cannot work inside in a trench that is 1.5m or deeper if there is no earthwork support.\nPermit for Deeper Trenches\nA permit will be required for trenches that are 5 feet (1,520mm) or deeper. Workers may not enter or start working in such trenches unless they have obtained a permit from DOSH which satisfies the requirements for earthwork support and safe access in and out the trench.\nSafe Access and Exit from Excavation\nThe contractor or anybody responsible for digging pits and trenches on your residential lot must provide a safe means of access and exit for workers. This is required for trenches which are 4 feet (1,220mm) or deeper. Safe means of access and exit can be provided by making use of steps, ladders and ramps.\nSafe Load / Traffic Distance from Excavation\nAs a rule, all mobile and static loads should not encroach within 1000mm (3.3 feet) from the excavation or trench. No machinery, vehicles, equipment, materials or people should stand within 1000mm from the excavation. Material excavated from the trench should be stored outside the 1000mm perimeter on both sides of the excavation.\nProtection of Exposed Utility Services\nOnce underground services have been safely exposed, they should be protected from damage by people, machines, tools, vehicles and weather elements. Make sure that the services are supported as required, but you cannot remove them without a permit.\nProtection of People from Exposed and Hazardous Utility Services\nExposed services can be hazardous especially if they are not protected or if they are damaged by workers. In order to prevent hazards and provide a safe environment for both workers and the community, you may be required to disconnect the services temporarily. If your neighbours and the community are going to be affected by this, they should be notified in advance.\nDamaging a gas pipeline with your tools will cause hazardous fumes to escape and ignite fires. Damaged electrical cables pose a risk of electrocution and fire outbreaks. Hitting a water supply pipe or drainage pipe can cause flooding in the yard. State and city authorities impose fines for damage to utility services.\nSafe Backfilling of Trenches and Excavations\nWhen you are done with your work or outdoor project, you have to place and align the services back in their original position. Make sure that the backfill bed on which the pipe is lying is compacted to a suitable AASHTO density to avoid earth settlement. The trench backfilling must be free from organic material, rocks, concrete, bricks, stones, frozen material and other hardcore material. Do not encase, cover up, bury or embed the service pipes in wet concrete because it will be difficult and hazardous to break up the hardened concrete during a utility dig-up.\nBackfill the exposed utility trenches with squeegee or well-graded sand, loam soil, silt sand or any Class D bedding from excavated material.\nDepths of Underground Utility Service Pipes and Cables\nIt’s important to know the depth at which various underground utility services are buried.\nElectricity Conduits / Cables:\nThe minimum depth of underground electricity cables is 450mm (18 inches), and they can be as deep as 1000mm (40 inches) or more depending on the voltage they are carrying. The higher the voltage, the deeper the cables should be, but the depth may vary depending on the method of wiring, type of wire sheathing (conduit) and zoning/land use requirements in a state.\nUnderground gas pipelines are buried at various depths, depending on their location, land use, zoning, as well as the type of pressure they are carrying. Gas pipes on private residential lots are buried at a much lower (shallow) depth than those laid under or near roads, highways and pedestrian walks. On private residential lots and building entrances, gas pipes are laid 375mm (15 inches) under the ground. On pedestrian sidewalks, they are found 600mm (24 inches) under the ground, and on roads and highways, they will be buried much deeper at 750mm (30 inches).\nHigh-pressure gas pipelines are buried much deeper than low-pressure pipes due to the significant damage that they can cause in enclosed and confined spaces in the event of a rupture. The minimum depth of underground high-pressure gas pipes is 900mm (35 inches).\nWater Supply and Drainage Pipes:\nSite water reticulation pipes and waste/rainwater drainage pipes must be laid deep enough to withstand freezing caused by temperature drops at night, in the morning and winter season. As a result, main water pipes, drains and sewerage pipes should be buried 4 to 5 feet under the ground, but a minimum depth of 900mm (3 feet) is the standard. On a private residential lot, the minimum depth can be reduced to 750mm (2.5 feet).\nWater and drainage pipes can be installed at a much shallower depth in regions with warm, sunny and hot climates where the depth of soil freezing is low (closer to the surface). In cold climates, the depth of soil freezing is very high, which means that frost will penetrate deeper into the ground.\nMajor Hazard Pipelines:\nNatural gas pipelines and other pipelines which carry oil, highly explosive gas and liquids are known as major hazard pipelines due to their extremely high risk of causing explosions and fires when the escaping gas is ignited. As a result, they are buried deeper than 900mm (3 feet). Under trafficked areas such as highways and railway lines, the pipes are laid even deeper. The minimum cover for pipes under railway crossings is 5.5 feet (168 metres) for cased pipes, and 10 feet (305 metres) for uncased pipes.\nTelecom cables running under the road and highway are installed 600mm (2 feet) deep under the surface of the ground.\nInternet Optic Fibre Cables:\nUnderground internet cables are buried in a trench with a minimum cover of 450mm (1.5 feet). A much lower minimum cover of 300mm (1 foot) is required when the cables are running under a concrete path or driveway.\nIn cold and freezing climates, the cables are laid deeper, at a minimum depth of 762mm (30 inches) and up to 1067mm (42 inches). The depth is also much higher in conditions where the fibre optic cables are running under roads, highways and railway tracks.']	['<urn:uuid:7a1e7755-96d4-4203-bd1d-6b16e3a3cf8a>', '<urn:uuid:cba7d25c-9b83-4aef-9ef8-4ebeb522bf35>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	15	57	3323
32	who fought 1066 battle england norman saxon	The Battle of Hastings in 1066 was fought between Duke William of Normandy's Norman army (which included heavy cavalry, archers, and foot soldiers) and King Harold II's Saxon army (composed of Housecarls - professional soldiers with battleaxes, and Fyrd - lightly armed men with spears and swords). The battle was fought on Senlac Hill along the London road.	"[""A Resource for Historic Arms and Armour Collectors\nAlbion Armorers Next Generation Senlac Sword\nA hands-on review by Bryan Heff\nIn the year 1066, during the twilight of the Viking Age, a desperate struggle for control of England came to a head. Duke William of Normandy, with claims to the throne of England, landed his Norman army consisting of mixed troops that included a large contingent of heavy cavalry on the Southeastern coast of England. King Harold II of England and his Saxon army, fresh from a hard fought battle and difficult march from the north, had quickly returned south in an effort to stop this Norman challenge to his throne. The Saxon took up a defensive formation with a traditional shield wall, high atop a hill along the London road in an effort to block the Normans' march north and bring them to decisive battle. Several weeks before, this same Saxon army with its Huscarl core of heavy infantry had successfully smashed an invading Viking army at Stamford Bridge. The fate of the island now lay at the feet of these two armies. By the end of battle a victor would emerge and history would be set. The Battle of Hastings was about to unfold and its outcome would help set the stage for European battle tactics for years to come. The battle was fought on a hill called Senlac, and swords similar to the subject of this review would have been used on both sides. Whether being swung from horseback or from behind large shields, these slashing cutting blades designed to oppose mail and textile armour were the order of the day.\nAlbion Armorers Next Generation Senlac is a long bladed single-hand medieval sword best described using Ewart Oakeshott's typology as a Type Xa, a cousin to the broad cutting blades of Type X. Being slightly longer, having a fuller that is not quite as wide and with a more pronounced profile taper is what essentially differentiates the Type Xa subclass. While potentially more suited to a thrust than a Type X, its primary purpose would be in the cut. Albion produces three swords all using the same blade. Those swords are the Senlac, Norman and Knud. The Norman and Senlac are very similar, differing most significantly in the cross-guard only. The riser patterns on the grip are also different between the two but not greatly so. The Senlac is a no-nonsense sword with little adornment. It is a sword that soldiers could have worn at their hip from Hastings all the way to the gates of Jerusalem during the First Crusade. This is a sword a man could rely on with confidence.\nMeasurements and Specifications:\nReplica created by Albion Armorers of Wisconsin.\nThe Senlac is a long-bladed weapon with a fairly short grip intended solely for single-hand use. These combined factors could create a sword that is sluggish. This is not the case here. The handling is really quite nice. No cutting was done with the sword prior to this review, just basic dry handling movements to gauge how it feels; smooth would be the word most adept at describing its overall characteristics. To borrow from boxing terminology, the blade could be described as a middle-weight. The point of balance is not particularly close to the hilt so it displays nice blade presence. It is a weapon that allows quick attacks and recovery but still has enough heft to deliver vicious slashing and hewing cuts as well.\nOften swords like this would have been used as side arms, not necessarily the primary weapon. The handling speaks volumes to this kind of usage. It is a sword agile enough to be used for a long period of time if need be while being light enough to wear on long campaign marches; it has enough punch to get its wielder out of a jam.\nFit and Finish\nOne aspect of the blade that really stands out is the slight convex curvature of the profile the final 1/3 of the blade. Many production swords available today have very straight lines along the blade's profile until the final tip is formed. The ever so slight convex curve of the Senlac's profile really gives it a beautiful blade presence and is one of the subtle details that helps make what seems like a simple sword much more.\nThe pommel is a disc-shaped Oakeshott Type G. It is simple in form, not overly complex, and could be easily described as quite plain. It does however have some rounding of the faces from the center out to the edges which gives it an element of complexity that differs from a flat disc. It is also not a perfectly round circle in shape but comes out of round ever so slightly where the pommel meets the grip. The peen is blended into the pommel so well that you simply cannot see it unless the light hits it in just the right way. The convex sides of the pommel are not perfect in terms of symmetry, but come very close to it and I think provide a good example of the hand work on the sword. This is not a criticism so much as an observation. It adds a warm handmade look and feel.\nThe guard is a straight, very basic Oakeshott Style 1a. The guard slot is expertly cut and fitted to the blade with extremely tight tolerances. The guard is rectangular in cross-section where the blade slot is located and then tapers down to a thinner square as it moves away from the blade. What struck me right away is how thin the cross-guard is compared to heavier/bulkier cross-guards more common on lower-priced swords. It's almost elegant in its utilitarian and lean design. There is not a lot of extra unneeded steel in the guard, just enough to accomplish its purpose.\nThe Senlac is unquestionably a simple and plain sword at first glance. This may be a deterrent to some sword enthusiasts especially at its price point. I think the argument could be made that along with their Bayeux and Hospitaller models, it is the least adorned medieval sword Albion Armorers produces in terms of hilt components. With all that in mind this reviewer has come to the conclusion that the Senlac is simply and clearly a classic medieval cruciform sword. It is perhaps the classic sword type for this post-Viking Age time period and it makes perfect sense that Albion would want such an iconic design as part of its Next Generation line. The straight guard and disc pommel are function over form in its purest sense. There is beauty in that simplicity. Its clean and straight lines are pleasing to the eye. It has an overall balance in both looks as well as handling that hit the mark on stylistic sensibilities that subscribes to the less is more ideal and it delivers on that extremely well. The Senlac is a beautifully understated but classic sword design.\nAbout the Author\nBryan Heff is a Systems Analyst living in the Philadelphia suburbs with his wife and 2 sons. He has always been intrigued by the European sword as a work of art, symbol and weapon of war. His main area of interest is rooted in the 8th to 14th centuries but he has interests in other time periods as well. In addition to adding to his small but growing collection of swords, he enjoys modifying and customizing swords in his compact basement workshop, hiking and exploring historic sites and trying to get his boys to do their homework.\nPhotographer: Bryan Heff"", 'Presentation on theme: ""Why did William win the Battle of Hastings?""— Presentation transcript:\n1Why did William win the Battle of Hastings?

Who do you think had the upper hand? Explain your answer carefully…\n6Why did William win the Battle of Hastings? L/O – To describe what happened at the battle at to identify why William wonStarter – Which side had the better army? William or Harold’s?\n7The Normans arrive!8.30am – William’s army arrives and finds Harold and his army already in place on the Senlac Ridge. Harold and his standard are just behind the English shieldwall.William divides his army into three sections; the Bretons under Alan of Brittany next to some marshy ground; the French and Flemish under Roger of Montgomery; the Normans, whom he commands himself, in the centre.Each section of William’s army has three parts: the archers at the front; the infantry in the middle; the cavalry at the back.\n8The Battle Begins!9.30am – The archers in William’s army are ordered forward to the bottom of the Senlac Ridge. From here they shoot at the English.10.00am – William sends all of his infantry against the English shieldwall.11.00am – The Breton infantry lose heart and retreat back down the hill. Panic spreads among William’s infantry and they believe William has been killed.11.30am – William’s infantry turn and retreat down the hill. William removes his helmet to show he is still alive and to stop his infantry from running away from the battlefield. Some English fyrd soldiers chase the retreating Norman infantry but they are cut down by William’s cavalry.\n9William’s cavalry attack! 12.00 noon – William launches all of his cavalry against the shieldwall but they fail to break through. The cavalry pretend to run away in panic; some English fyrd soldiers fall for the trick and chase after them. The cavalry turns around and slaughters them.\n10The Final Attack!2.00pm – William orders his archers to fire high up in the air so that their arrows drop down on to the heads of the English.2.30pm – William throws all of his remaining cavalry and infantry at the weakened English line.3.00pm – Harold’s brothers, Leofwine and Gyrth, are killed as the English fight desperately to hold the shieldwall together. Even Harold joins the fighting.4.00pm – William’s army finally bursts through the shieldwall and breaks the English up into small groups of exhausted soldiers.\n11The End of the battle!5.00pm – Harold is killed, surrounded by his bodyguard. The English fyrd, seeing their king dead, flee the battlefield.5.30pm – The remaining housecarls retreat from Senlac Ridge, fighting as they go. They stop on the top of Caldbec Hill and make their final stand. They fight to the death.\n12Why did William win the Battle of Hastings? There are a number of reasons why William won the battle.

33	I work in nutritional science and I'm wondering about the role of whey protein in cellular protection. What specific benefits does whey protein offer for maintaining cellular health?	Bioactive whey protein plays a significant role in cellular protection by naturally increasing glutathione levels in the body. It contains high concentrations of the amino acids cysteine, glutamate, and glycine, which are precursors used in glutathione synthesis by the GSH-synthase enzyme. Studies have shown that bioactive whey protein can significantly increase cellular glutathione levels without side effects, leading to a stronger immune system and greater detoxification capacity. Additionally, whey provides anti-aging benefits by protecting against sarcopenia (age-related muscle and strength loss) and supporting weight management through increased thermogenesis and satiety.	['Here is an excellent article on how free radicals – oxidative stress can impact and even shorten telomeres. This is not a good thing.\nCan you imagine entering the doctor’s office one day and obtaining a blood test that measures your biological age, as a better indicator of health than chronological age? That day could arrive soon with tests that measure the length of telomeres.\nEmbryonic and Adult Stem Cells, DNA,Â and Telomeres\nSubstantial evidence has led to findings that premature aging and its core cellular mechanisms are governed by the onset of telomere shortening (1-5). In this article, we hope to help increase understanding of the relationship between chronic oxidative stress and telomere instability.\nThe glutathione (GSH)-dependent antioxidant system is the cell’s primary defense against oxidative stress, and plays a major role in detoxification and bolstering the body’s immune system. Emerging data are helping to explain the role of the GSH-redox cycle for preserving telomeres.\nStructurally, telomeres are formed by non-coding DNA sequences along with specialized proteins that act as protective caps at the physical ends of chromosomes. Human telomeric DNA consists of repeated sequences of TTAGG and extends over several thousand base pairs. Because guanine-rich sequences are more sensitive and less capable of DNA repair, telomeres are more vulnerable to oxidation.\nTelomeres fold back onto themselves in a loop to provide functional stability. The telomeric DNA is synthesized by the enzyme telomerase, the absence of which results in a progressive erosion. Evidence indicates that chronic oxidative stress not only causes progressive damage to cellular membranes, proteins, and molecules, but also induces the slowing down of existing telomerase activity and accelerates telomere shortening (1&2).\nChronic oxidative stress develops into a state of progressive telomere shortening induced by elevated homocysteine levels, and reduced glutathione, or an otherwise compromised GSH-redox cycle.\nLower amounts of reduced glutathione, and diminished activity of the enzymes GSH peroxidase and catalase, cause a failure to protect cell components from damaging peroxides (1-3). The mitochondria become dysfunctional, producing increasing amounts of free radicals and less ATP energy (1-3). Together, these effects lead the cell to cease division or appropriate function, known as replicative senescence.\nGuarding the GSH-antioxidant System\nBecause the GSH-antioxidant system is the predominant guardian against oxidative stress, it is proposed that maintaining its integrity can support against telomere erosion and “stress-induced” premature onset of accelerated aging.\nScientific research suggests that a variety of consistent behaviors in humans in-vivo are available to alter the amount of oxidative stress placed on cells of the body.\nAmong factors thought to adversely affect telomeres are smoking, drinking heavily, obesity, and chronic psychological stress (1-3). On the other hand, meditation, socialization, and regular exercise are associated with longer telomeres (1-3).\nIn addition, studies suggest diet and supplementation habits can be help preserve telomere integrity. Some choices linked with longer telomeres are:\n- consuming higher amounts of omega-3 fatty acids\n- obtaining higher amounts of vitamin D, maintaining a healthy weight, eating a diet higher in dietary fiber (particularly insoluble fiber)\n- drinking green tea regularly\n- and taking a quality multivitamin (containing sufficient amounts of B vitamins, vitamins A, C, and E) daily (4)\nWhey to Glutathione\nAnother method to gain optimal protection against oxidative stress and telomere attrition is by using methods to naturally increase the levels of glutathione in the body by way of regular ingestion of whey protein, according to recent studies (5-7).\n“Bioactive whey protein,” as one study calls it, provides a high concentration of the amino acids cysteine, glutamate, and glycine. These amino acid precursors are used in the synthesis of glutathione by the enzyme GSH-synthase. Several studies have shown that bioactive whey protein can dramatically raise the levels of glutathione in the cells of the body without side effects (5 & 6). Increases in levels of circulating glutathione from whey are associated with a stronger immune system and greater capacity of detoxification.\nWhey also offers other anti-aging benefits such as protection against sarcopenia (the loss of muscle and strength with age) and by supporting weight management through increases of thermogenesis and satiety.\nSupplementing to Optimize Telomere Protection\nSupplementing with antioxidant vitamins and minerals supports activity of antioxidant enzymes that can assist in protecting cells and their components, including telomeres, against oxidative stress.\nGSH peroxidase plays a major role using GSH as its reducing agent in detoxification of peroxides (types of reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide), which can inflict harm to cell membranes, proteins, and telomeric DNA.\nThe oxidized GSH is then recycled by another enzyme, GSH reductase, which uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as its coenzyme and reducing agent. Catalase is also an enzyme that acts as an efficient detoxifier of hydrogen peroxide, while superoxide dismutases (SOD) are a class of enzymes that act to quench superoxide, a highly reactive form of oxygen, and convert it to hydrogen peroxide or stabilized oxygen.\nIt’s notable that selenium, niacin, zinc, and copper are important dietary factors because these enzymes rely on them to function.\nInterestingly, data are emerging that particular dietary factors and supplements could act to promote antioxidant enzyme activity further and thereby further support telomere integrity. These supplements will be subject of future blog posts.']	['<urn:uuid:bdb72ea1-92ab-43ef-9959-0a625ea6266f>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	28	90	864
34	What features does Google Data Studio offer for collaborative data sharing, and how is user data protection maintained through its cookie management system?	Google Data Studio enables collaborative data sharing through shareable links, allowing users to control who can edit or view reports. The platform requires an active Google account and can be managed alongside other Google products. For user data protection, the system implements a structured cookie management approach. It uses necessary session cookies for basic functionality, preferences cookies for storing user choices, and analytics cookies that collect only anonymized data. The collected data is processed in aggregate form and anonymized to the last octet, preventing personal identification. Users can control their cookie preferences, though blocking certain cookies may affect website functionality.	['Google Data Studio is a new data visualization tool allowing you to transform your clear and dry data into visually appealing and understandable reports and to be shared then with your colleagues and clients. Using the bar graphs, geographical maps, charts, line charts, etc. you can represent your data and - the most important - make sense of it. It’s free, and you can create and share as many reports as you want. If you think that reporting isn’t fun and exciting, read this 10 minutes tutorial and learn how to easily create informative and dynamic reports with Google Data Studio. We will create a report about traffic fatalities that will look like this:\nThe original report can be found here.\nBut let’s go step-by-step and see how we got there.\nAll you need to start working in Google Data Studio is an active Google account. Moreover, you can manage Data Studio with other Google product like Google Analytics or Adwords, and quickly connect to any Google data source.\nNow let’s take a look at the homepage. You can see some sample reports that will get you acquainted with the basic visualizations that you can incorporate in your report. You can sort the reports in a way that is the most convenient for you, and there is also a search bar helping to find a specific report. Finally, you can check out an interactive tutorial called “Welcome to Data Studio! (Start here)”.\nNow it’s time to create a new report! You can start by either clicking on the plus (+) icon at the bottom right corner or the blank plus page and after that accept the terms and conditions.\nYou may see some already existing data sources, or you can click the button at the bottom right corner and create a new data source.\nThere are multiple options for you to obtain the data: AdWords, Google Analytics, Google Sheets, YouTube Analytics, etc. For this example, we picked the BigQuery public data set on traffic fatalities. Once you’ve chosen the dataset, table, and billing project, click “Connect”.\nNow, there’s a table helping you to prepare your data. Let’s take a closer look.\nThe fields in blue are metrics - fields that can be counted, and in green are dimensions - usually text fields. Field type allows you to select the type of your metrics. There are numeric, text, date & time, boolean and geo types. Be careful to select the correct formats! Then you can choose the aggregation for your metric: sum, average, minimum, maximum and of course none if you don’t need any. Finally, you can create a calculated field that calculates new metrics by using a formula transforming some existing metrics. If you have prepared your data, click “Add to report” and let’s get moving and start visualizing!\nAt the top of the page you can see a toolbar where you can find different options for creating a report.\nFirst of all, your report needs a title. You can simply name it at the top left corner and the changes will be automatically saved.\nThen you can add multiple pages to the report which you can also name and easily switch between them.\nThe next part of the toolbar is the data visualization tools. Let’s quickly look through them.\nThe first one is Time series. If your data includes date&time metrics to choose as a dimension you can build time series with different metrics. The time series properties menu allows you to choose dimension, metric, filter, and style for your graph. Note that if you need to, it is possible to add additional metrics.\nBar and combo charts display your data in a convenient way and the last one allows you to compare different metrics on the same chart.\nRemember that you can edit data source in the data tab and work with multiple datasets in the same report.\nAnother important visualization is a geo map. You can experiment with zoom area and choose world map, continents or specific countries.\nData filtering helps you to organize reporting. You can do this by selecting date range or using filter control. Make sure to check the properties of these tools as they give you some additional opportunities.\nLayout and theme give you the possibility to play with the style of your report. You can change the background, colors, text styles, and display options and create a unique style that can represent the style of your company.\nFinally, styling and controlling menu is a great help in the process of creating a report. You can select the chart type, experiment with metrics and dimensions, change data sources, apply a filter, etc.\nNow let’s switch between view and edit mode to see how our sample report looks like:\nYou can get a shareable link and enter the email addresses of people to share the report with and, moreover, you can choose who can edit your report and who can just view it.\nIn this step-by-step tutorial, we have demonstrated how to work with Google Data Studio and how to create some basic visualizations. This is a great tool for creating data reports, as it allows you to mix data from different sources, play with multiple charts, work with metrics and add calculated fields, create excellent and easy to read reports and share them quickly and easily.\nNow it’s your turn!

37	Working in compliance, I'm wondering about the timeline restrictions - how do the lookback periods for mortgage professional background checks under S.A.F.E. Act differ from standard employment background checks?	The lookback periods differ significantly. Under the S.A.F.E. Act, mortgage professionals face a permanent ban for past fraud-related felonies and license revocations, and a 7-year restriction for any other felony convictions. In comparison, standard employment background checks are typically limited by the Fair Credit Reporting Act and state laws to a 7-10 year lookback period in most states, though some states allow employers to see lifetime records. Additionally, certain types of employment background checks, like FBI checks for sensitive positions, have no time limits and can access complete historical records.	"[""S.A.F.E. Mortgage Act, which is known as the S.A.F.E. Act, stands for the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act, which was signed into law in July, 2008 as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA). HERA is designed to help communities across America recover from the housing market downturn that started in 2007. The S.A.F.E. Mortgage Act is one of the key components of HERA.\nThe S.A.F.E Act creates a set of standards that mortgage professionals must meet in order to work in the mortgage industry. The act's requirements must be met by mortgage brokers, mortgage originators and loan processors who deal with consumers in originating and processing residential mortgage applications. Before a mortgage professional can obtain his license, he must adhere to the rules. The act also implements a system for making mortgage professionals accountable by requiring them to supply records and information for their mortgage transactions.\nPart of the downfall of the lending and housing industry that began in 2007 was thought to be associated with predatory lending practices by mortgage brokers, lenders and other mortgage professionals. Some of the economic turmoil stems from mortgage lenders' putting borrowers into adjustable rate mortgages that they wouldn't be able to afford after the adjustment period, and finessing records and documents to approve borrowers for mortgages that they couldn't afford to take on. While many laws exist to help protect consumers, the volume of lending problems that arose in 2007 led to further regulations being enacted to protect consumers.\nThe main purpose of the S.A.F.E. Act is to further protect consumers and reduce mortgage fraud. The S.A.F.E. Act encourages each state in the country to set standards by which mortgage professionals can obtain their license. The act also requires mortgage professionals to register with the national mortgage licensing system so that mortgage professionals can be tracked across state lines.\nOne of the primary objectives of the S.A.F.E. Act is to set training and education requirements for mortgage professionals. First, it requires mortgage professionals to pass a state and federal exam in order to obtain their license. The mortgage professional must also pass a national S.A.F.E. Mortgage Loan Originator test and each state must impose a licensing process that meets the national mortgage licensing standards.\nIn order for a mortgage professional to obtain a mortgage license, she must undergo a background check. Second, the mortgage license applicant cannot have had a mortgage license revoked previously or be a felon convicted of a crime involving fraud, dishonesty, breach of trust or money laundering. The license applicant also cannot have been convicted of any felony for the past seven years. Before taking the license exam, the applicant must complete a 20-hour pre-licensing education course and subsequently must pass the national licensing exam. Each year after obtaining his license, the licensee must attend at least eight hours of continuing education (CE) credits to remain up-to-date on the mortgage laws and regulations.\nThe main benefit of the S.A.F.E Act is to increase the integrity of the mortgage and lending industry. The new standards create a uniform set of guidelines that mortgage professionals must adhere to regardless of which area of the country they practice in. The S.A.F.E Act also requires states to have a system in place for licensing mortgage professionals.\n- Photo Credit home sweet home image by David Dorner from Fotolia.com\nHow to Place a Jack Stand Under a Porsche\nSometimes you need to set your Porsche on a jack stand.

Felonies are serious offenses that carry a minimum sentence of one year in jail, whereas a misdemeanor is punishable by a fine or jail time of less than one year.\nFurthermore, pending arrests and criminal cases will also appear on the criminal history background check (depending on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission12 rules, some background checks do not include pending prosecutions or arrest records).1\nDepending on the specific state in which the background check is being conducted, criminal checks will go 7 or 10 years in the past, and show essentially any contact with law enforcement…except for a few situations.\nWhat Shows Up On A Background Check: Criminal Records\nWhat shows up on a criminal background check?\nThe following list examines some of the most common items and outlines them in detail below:\n|Criminal History Record||Does a Criminal Background Check Show It?|\n|#1. Past Convictions (Lifetime) State Only||Yes and No [See below for complete answer]|\n|#2. Past Convictions (Last 7-10 Years) State Only||Yes|\n|#3. Pending Charges (State Only)||Yes and No|\n|#4. Pending Charges (Federal Only)||No|\n|#5. Pending Arrests (State Only)||Yes and No|\n|#6. Pending Arrests (Federal Only)||No|\n|#7. Warrants (Local)||Yes and No|\n|#8. Warrants (State)||Yes and No|\n|#9. Warrants (Federal)||Yes and No|\n|#10. Warrants (Pending)||No|\n|#11. Old Arrests (State, 7-10 Years)||Yes and No|\n|#12. Old Arrests Nationwide (Last 7-10 Years)||Yes and No|\n|#13. Old Arrests (Lifetime)||Yes|\n|#14. Dismissed Charges||Yes|\n|#15. Past Convictions (International)||Yes|\n|#16. Judgements Against You||Yes|\n|#17. Harassment Order||Yes and No|\n|#18. 72 Hour Hold||Yes and No|\n|#19. Warnings (Driving)||Yes and No|\n|#20. Getting Fired||Yes and No|\n|#21. Being Detained||Yes and No|\n|#22. Dropped and dismissed charges||Yes and No|\n|#23. Parking tickets||No|\n|#24. Evictions||Yes and No|\n- Do past convictions show on state-based checks? State-based checks will only show lifetime records when used for certain positions, such as a government job. However, some states allow background checks to search lifetime criminal records, so if a person has a felony in a state that doesn’t limit how far back a background check can go, then the felony (or other criminal activity) will appear.\n- Do past convictions from the last 7-10 years appear on state-based checks? If an individual was arrested but found not to be guilty, the charges will be dropped. However, if they are arrested and convicted of a crime, this will appear on their record since they were deemed guilty of the crime. The only exception of notifying an employer of a conviction is if the records were expunged or sealed when the background check was conducted.\n- Do pending charges show up on a background check, state-based screening? Each state differs regarding public information with pending court cases. Some background checks in states show pending cases, whereas others do not. Many states limit employers or others in terms of conducting a background check regarding the pending charges. In some states, employers cannot ask job applicants about pending arrests or charges that did not leave to conviction.\n- Do pending charges show up on federal checks? All states must follow federal regulations regarding pending cases. The Fair Credit Reporting Act13 helps protect a person’s criminal history, whereas other federal laws prohibit employees from disqualifying a person for an arrest based on race.\n- Do pending arrests show up on a state-based check: Every state approaches arrests without convictions differently. Most states include legal information on arrest records, making these records a part of public records. Some states allow employers to view arrest records, even those with no conviction. However, other states do not allow employers to see arrest records.\n- Do pending arrests show up on a federal background check: The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires employers to obtain written permission if they want to do a background screening on an individual during the hiring process. There is federal legal protection regarding pending charges and pending arrests during the hiring process.\n- Do warrants appear on local background checks? Certain states make it possible to request public information maintained by local and state government agencies, including arrest warrants. In this case, since the information is not available for public consumption online, it only MAY or may not appear on a background check. It depends on the type of warrant (civil, bench, search, for arrest) and the specific state.\n- Do warrants appear on state-based checks: There are certain scenarios in which warrants may appear on background checks in specific states. For example, in Florida, warrants would appear on background checks using state resources, such as the Public Access System. Due to the Freedom of Information Act, 14 law enforcement agencies cannot deny information when asked.\n- Do federal warrant checks appear on background checks? A FBI check reveals arrests, convictions, felonies, and misdemeanors. This type of check is done by a fingerprint submission to the FBI, which can connect the person in question to an arrest or charge, but not necessarily a warrant. An FBI background search usually does not reveal pending warrants for individuals, not in the system. Therefore, FBI background checks are usually only used for jobs concerning sensitive and classified information and will not include a warrant that has not been executed.\n- Do pending warrants appear on a background check: The process depends on the specific state. In some states, a background check cannot include any records that did not result in a conviction more than 7+ years ago.2 Finding old arrest records is typically done through an online or in-person request via the county clerk. If a person cannot find the old arrest records through the clerk, they may have to search via the federal arrest records, as they are easier to use than state or county resources in terms of charges 7-10 years ago.\n- Do old arrests show on a state-based check: A felony charge and conviction can vary depending on the specific charge. For a drug violation, the felony will show on the background check for seven years. For aggravated assault, the felony will stay on a person’s record indefinitely.\n- Do felony charges appear on a background check after 10 years? Individuals who have been charged with a felony may wonder if it shows up after ten years. In short, yes. However, the check can influence what will appear. Since most felony convictions last indefinitely, the employer’s time frame of the search and the specific state law will influence if the felony appears on the background check.\n- Do dismissed charges appear on a background check? If charges are dismissed, they will still appear on a criminal record. A dismissed criminal charge will stay on a record permanently if the person does not do anything to erase it. Even if the person does not have any other criminal convictions, they will still have a permanent record. In some cases, the individual can have the dismissed charges removed by sealing the record or expunging records.\nHowever, this is not always possible, depending on the charge. Individuals who can remove a dismissed charge can do so by expunging a dismissed charge after not having a felony conviction within the past five years or not being convicted of a crime other than a misdemeanor.\nThe other option is to seal a dismissed charge after three years have passed from the crime and the person is not being prosecuted for another crime, they haven’t been arrested in the last three years, they haven’t been convicted of a crime in 10 years, and they don’t have any other records that were sealed within the last ten years.\n- Do international convictions and charges appear on a background check? Convictions and criminal charges internationally will appear on a person’s record. The Global Verification (international background check) screening includes reference checks, education, employment verification, criminal records, warrants, and derogatory records.\n- Do judgements against you show up on a criminal check? It depends on whether the judgement was civil or criminal and whether the case was sealed (such as with family court cases).\n- Do harassment orders show on a background check? Harassment orders are usually considered public records, meaning they will show on a level 2 background check. Many states have passed legislation influencing who can look up protection orders — however, protection orders differ on a state-by-state basis. Furthermore, harassment orders can be sealed or expunged through the court process.\n- Does a 72 hour hold show up on your record in a criminal background check? No. Not unless the hold was the result of a criminal action. If criminal acts were done that resulted in the hold, then the criminal record would show the arrest or police report.\n- Do driving warnings show on a background check? A police action dictates whether a warning goes on the record depending on the state’s legal driving codes and statutes. Some Officers will let individuals go without any warning, whereas others will not — in this case, moving violations will show up on a person’s background check.\n- Does getting fired go on your record? Getting fired will only go on a person’s permanent record if the fire-able offense was related to criminal activity.\n- Does getting detained show up on a background check? States have different laws regarding detainment records and public records, meaning it depends on where the person was detained to influence what will show on the background check. Technically, detention prevents free movement, but law enforcement can keep someone in custody if there is insufficient evidence. Detention will go on a person’s record depending on whether a charge or conviction accompanies the detention.3\n- Will dropped charges appear on a background check: It depends on the level of search performed by the employer. Every state has a limit regarding the Ban the Box laws and when an employer can use the background check for hiring purposes. Will evictions appear on a background check: Evictions do not show on a background check for a landlord. Evictions are considered civil matters, whereas background checks will contain criminal matters. However, certain background checks can include credit reports, which may include an eviction after it has been recorded as a court judgment.\n- Do parking tickets go on your record? No, a parking ticket will not go on the record because technically it occurs while the vehicle is not in motion. However, if parking tickets pile up to the point of having a licenses suspended and then a person is caught driving with a suspended license, then that incident will show up.\n- Does an eviction go on your record? If the eviction proceeded through the courts, yes, it will show up.\nWhat Shows Up On A Criminal Background Check For Employment\nA criminal background check for employment is impacted by various federal and state laws that dictate how far a level 2 background check can go and the retroactive period for an FBI background check.\nIn general, most background check companies cannot use anything on a person’s record more than seven years ago in most states. The Fair Credit Reporting Act limits employers from searching for certain information but leaves the specific time frame up to the individual states.\nThe information included on the level one background check for employment includes the following:\nIn addition, certain professionals use specific background checks to protect themselves from liability, protect their staff, and safeguard their customers. These job-specific background checks run a fingerprint-based level 2 background check:\n- Healthcare jobs\n- Jobs involving vulnerable groups (elderly or children)\n- Financial jobs\n- Jobs that deal with sensitive information\n- Jobs that require certain education or certifications\n- Jobs with heavy machinery\n- Salaries greater than $75,000 (sometimes)\nWhat Shows Up On A County Criminal Background Check\nA county criminal background check includes all felony and misdemeanor crimes tried at local jurisdictions and filed in county courthouses.\nA county criminal check provides criminal history about the person in question, including felony records, misdemeanor records, pending cases, convictions, adjudication withheld, and active warrants.\nIf a person’s record is found, the county criminal background check can also include:\n- Offense level (ex: Class A Felony)\n- Identifiers to match the person to the criminal record\nThe county criminal record check does not include driving offenses (ex: traffic violations), petty crimes, dismissed charges, or expunged records.\nWhat Shows Up On A Criminal Background Check For Apartment\nA landlord can conduct a rental background check to determine if the potential tenant is reliable, trustworthy, and responsible with their money.\nThis background check includes the person’s details, criminal background report, eviction records, credit history, and credit score. The credit history contains bankruptcies, foreclosures, current repayment schemes, and any debt notices.\nThe applicant’s credit score determines the person’s creditworthiness based on numerous factors, such as debt owed, credit card lines, and credit payment history.4\nWhat Shows Up On A FBI Criminal Background Check\nThere are differences between a level 1 background check and an FBI fingerprint background check. The typical background check is a name-based search that gathers supplemental and basic information, with some of the more detailed information including criminal records, employment history, and driving records. The criminal history record is limited to one jurisdiction.\nOn the other hand, an FBI criminal background check is a search based on the individual’s fingerprints that can provide federal (national) and sometimes international history.\nThe FBI criminal background check will include personal information (address and family) and criminal records based on the fingerprint submission, with information related to arrests, employment, military service, and naturalization.\nKnowing what shows up on a criminal background check is a good way to eliminate disqualifying offenses before the background check is run.']"	['<urn:uuid:e533e385-9eee-44b4-b8bd-444ab4deabe1>', '<urn:uuid:19d79b29-7559-4992-87de-bc7de4d01522>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	29	90	3090
38	describe situations employer allowed reject accommodation disabled staff	Employers can reject accommodation for disabled employees when it would cause undue hardship. The point of undue hardship can be determined by various factors, including financial cost of accommodations, disruption of operations, and health and safety concerns.	['The Supreme Court of Canada has established a three-step test for determining that what seems like a discriminatory standard is instead a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR). In order to prove that the standard is indeed a BFOR, the employer must demonstrate:\n- that the employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job;\n- that the employer adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and\n- that the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose.\nThis approach is based on the need to develop standards that accommodate the potential contributions of all employees without imposing undue hardship on the employer. This is known as the employer’s “duty to accommodate.” Unless no accommodation is possible without imposing undue hardship, the standard at question may not meet the BFOR threshold. Each step of this test is explored in further detail below.\nSTEP ONE – RATIONAL CONNECTION\nThe first step is intended to identify the general purpose of the standard at question and determine whether it is rationally connected to the performance of the job. The initial task is to determine what the standard is generally designed to achieve. For example, the ability to work safely and efficiently is a typical purpose at this stage, though there are many possible reasons that you might seek to impose a certain standard on your employees.\nEssentially, at this stage in the test, you must ask yourself, “Why have I introduced this standard?” and, “What am I trying to achieve through the use of this standard?” The answer to these questions will illustrate the general purpose of the standard. Next, you must ask, “Is this purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job in question?”\nSTEP TWO - HONEST AND GOOD FAITH BELIEF\nThe employer must demonstrate that you honestly believed that adopting the particular standard was necessary to achieve your purpose. Furthermore, you must prove that you adopted the standard with no intention of discriminating against the claimant.\nSTEP THREE – REASONABLY NECESSARY\nThe third and final hurdle is to demonstrate that the standard is reasonably necessary for you to accomplish your purpose. In order to do so, you must establish that you cannot accommodate the claimant and others negatively affected by the standard without experiencing undue hardship. Employers have a duty to accommodate a disabled employee to the point of undue hardship. A variety of factors may be considered in assessing when the point of undue hardship has been met, including, but not limited to, the financial cost of such accommodations, the disruption of operations, and any health and safety concerns.

It strengthens the immune system and helps resist diseases. For weight loss, yogurt's calcium content aids in burning fat, especially around the belly, and makes you feel full to resist cravings. Additionally, low-fat yogurt helps lower cholesterol and plain yogurt can be a healthy substitute for higher-calorie foods like sour cream.	['Yogurt: What’s Healthy & What’s Not\nYogurt often tops the list as a natural food that packs a lot of nutritional value. When produced in its simplest form, which is fermenting good bacteria with milk, yogurt is a great source of protein, B vitamins, calcium, and probiotics (mostly Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, which are both required to make a true yogurt product). The catch: yogurt’s really only good for you when the ingredients are natural, pure, and kept simple. Unfortunately, many of the conventional yogurts fall into the unhealthy category because they contain unnecessary ingredients.\nWhy Is Conventional Yogurt So Unhealthy?\nMany yogurts contain high amounts of added sugar, especially the flavored varieties with granola clusters and the ones with fruit on the bottom. A 6-ounce serving of regular flavored yogurt may contain as much as 35 grams of sugar. That’s more than the recommended daily intake of sugar, which should be less than 30 grams of sugar a day. Consider, too, the drinks and processed foods that are often consumed: juice, soda, dessert, and other foods that are deceptively “healthy” because they too contain a lot of added sugar. At the end of the day, most Americans consume on average 17 teaspoons of sugar or roughly 71 grams of sugar!\nIt’s important to note that lactose, the naturally occurring milk sugar in yogurt, makes up part of the total sugar content (total sugar includes both natural and added sugar). Most 8-ounce regular yogurts have about 12–15 grams of lactose (natural sugar). An 8-ounce serving of Greek yogurt has less natural sugar (roughly 9 grams) because liquid is strained during production, resulting in some sugar removal, thicker yogurt, and more protein. Skyr, an Icelandic yogurt, is produced with a similar straining process. It’s made with more milk than regular yogurt, has a high protein content, and is low in natural sugar (6 grams per 8-ounce serving).\nOn top of the high-fructose syrups that are often added, many conventional yogurts also contain artificial colors and sweeteners, preservatives, thickening agents, and milk protein concentrate to increase protein. Some yogurts may be heat-treated after culturing to extend their shelf life, but this process kills off any bacteria and diminishes the point of eating a healthful food filled with live and active cultures. Other yogurts may not even use real fruit at all.\nWhat’s In Healthy Yogurt?\nThe best yogurt for you is the one that has the least amount of ingredients but also the most natural ingredients. Ideally, the healthiest yogurts contain whole milk and live active cultures (L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus) and do not list sugar in the top ingredients. Look for yogurt made with USDA-certified organic whole milk that comes from 100% grass-fed or pasture-raised cows. Remember, whole milk has more of the healthy beneficial saturated fat that we need versus skim and low-fat milk. (See our WFP YouTube experience at Stryk Jersey Farm to learn more about the health benefits of grass-fed Raw Milk.) Many healthy yogurts also provide the Live and Active Cultures seal to indicate the yogurt contains a high amount of yogurt cultures (e.g., 100 million cultures per gram at the time of production); however, there are also healthy organic options that contain very high amounts of live and active cultures but do not provide the seal. (The seal isn’t mandatory and is provided voluntarily by a company.)\nWFP’s Take-Home Advice\n- Use the Cornucopia Institute’s yogurt scorecard as a guide when buying healthy yogurts: https://www.cornucopia.org/yogurt-scorecard/. The scorecard includes comprehensive information about yogurt ingredients and rates yogurts so that you know which ones are the healthiest vs. unhealthiest. Many of their top yogurts are found at both natural and conventional grocery stores. WFP recommends:\n- Maple Hill Creamery Plain Greek 100% Grass-Fed Organic Whole Milk Yogurt (Whole Foods and other natural health food stores)\n- Stonyfield Plain 100% Grass-Fed Organic Whole Milk Yogurt (Whole Foods and other natural health food stores)\n- Organic Valley Plain Grassmilk 100% Grass-Fed, No Grain Whole Milk Yogurt (Whole Foods and other natural health food stores)\n- Straus Family Creamery Non-GMO Certified Plain Greek Organic Whole Milk Yogurt (Sprouts and other natural health food stores)\n- Stonyfield Organic Plain Greek Pasture-Raised Whole Milk Yogurt (HEB and other natural health food stores)\n- White Mountain Organic Whole Milk Bulgarian Yogurt (HEB, Randalls, Sprouts, Whole Foods)\n- Green Valley Organics Certified-Humane Plain *Lactose-Free Yogurt (HEB and other natural health food stores) *For lactose-intolerant consumers\n- Choose yogurts made with organic whole milk and that say, “100% grass-fed or pasture-raised” so that you know the dairy cows are living their lives on grass pastures, not in factory-farm conditions. Grass-fed cows typically eat native grasses and are not fed GMO grains.\n- We also recommend choosing plain, unflavored yogurt rather than those that are flavored or have added fruit. Plain yogurts typically do not have added sugar. Add your own toppings of fresh fruit and natural added sugar, such as ½–1 teaspoon of honey or maple syrup. Plain yogurt is also a great substitute for sour cream.\n- Avoid store-bought yogurt parfaits; they pack a lot of additional ingredients on top of flavored yogurt, which ultimately drives up the added sugar content.\n- Companies must disclose whether they heat-treat their yogurt after the probiotics have been added. Look for labels that state, “heat-treated after culturing,” and avoid these products as the process kills off the beneficial live cultures. Choose the ones that say, “contains active yogurt cultures” or “live active cultures/acidophilus.” Probiotics are good for your digestive system and also help maintain a healthy immune system. Yogurt is a great way to incorporate beneficial bacteria into your diet as is taking a daily probiotic. Our WFP Probiotic Complete is a comprehensive multi-strain formula that includes Saccharomyces boulardii (SB), Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium.\nFollow these guidelines and remember to always read the nutrition labels carefully to help you choose the healthiest yogurt for you and your family!\nEditor’s Note: This article was originally published on May 8, 2017 and has since been updated.\nSources and References:\nCornucopia Institute: Cornucopia Yogurt Buyer’s Guide.

Yogurt is prepared by the fermentation of milk by the lactobacillus genus of bacteria. It is easy and inexpensive to prepare at home, and thus a great addition to your daily diet. The amazing fact about yogurt is the variety of ways in which it can be used. Yogurt can accompany meals in the form of salad dressing. When mixed with your choice of fruits, yogurt can make an excellent and healthy dessert.\nFor the calorie-conscious, yogurt can easily replace cream or mayonnaise in dips for snacks. Apart from these, yogurt is used in curries to add a tangy taste. It can also serve as a marinade for meat and chicken. Last but not the least, plain yogurt is a filling and nutritious food with unmatched benefits. So, lets have a look at the numerous health benefits of yogurt.\nBeing a dairy product, yogurt is rich in protein and calcium. It is also a good source of vitamins (B2, B6 and B12) and minerals (sodium, potassium, magnesium and phosphorous). Yogurt also contains fat depending on the milk used to prepare it.\nHealth Benefits of Yogurt – Yogurt for lactose intolerant\nPeople who are unable to digest lactose, a constituent of milk, should not feel deprived of the health benefits of milk. Yogurt is an excellent alternative to milk for the lactose intolerant. It has been seen that most people with lactose intolerance do not suffer from its ill effects like pain, flatulence and diarrhea after consuming yogurt. This is because most of the lactose content of milk is converted to lactic acid in yogurt during fermentation. Yogurt is easily digestible and offers more nutritional benefits than milk.\nYogurt Benefits – Yogurt for Stomach\nYogurt is popular as a source of probiotics. Probiotics are micro-organisms which are beneficial to the body. In simple words, yogurt contains good bacteria which ensure a healthy stomach and digestive tract. Probiotics are extremely helpful in various gastrointestinal conditions like constipation, diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease and Helicobacter pylori infection. H. Pylori infection leads to peptic ulcers. The inclusion of yogurt in daily meals prevents the onset of these conditions and helps in maintaining\na healthy digestive system. The bacteria present in yogurt are also good for colon health. Yogurt’s high calcium content prevents colon cancer.\nYogurt is also known to cure antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Antibiotic treatment lowers the presence of bacteria which aids digestion thereby leading to diarrhea. Probiotics present in yogurt have been found to be effective against this condition.\nThus, yogurt is a wonder food for the healthy functioning of the digestive system.\nHealth Benefits of Yogurt – Yogurt for Weight Loss\nBecause of its calcium content, yogurt helps in weight loss. Studies have shown that people who include low-fat yogurt in their daily diet lose weight more easily than those who don’t. This is because calcium in the body aids in burning fat, thereby promoting weight loss. Also, consuming yogurt makes you feel full and resists craving and hunger pangs. Yogurt especially cuts down the fat around the belly. Due to these reasons low-fat yogurt is highly recommended for people watching their weight. It can be easily prepared at home using skimmed milk and can replace unhealthy snacks like fries and burgers. Buttermilk prepared from yogurt can be a nutritious alternative to sugar beverages.\nOther Health Benefits of Yogurt\n- Yogurt benefits for women: Yogurt is especially recommended for women because of its high calcium content. It improves bone health and prevents osteoporosis. The active culture in yogurt also helps in preventing vaginal infections.\n- Low fat yogurt is also known to lower cholesterol.\n- Health benefits of yogurt also includes strengthening the immune system. Yogurt helps resist diseases.\n- Research shows that yogurt is effective against arthritis.']	['<urn:uuid:ef7051e7-f56c-429b-a63b-24d7b4523872>', '<urn:uuid:c42ad218-500b-4e59-8db3-62bae159b6d8>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	11	86	1718
40	I'd like to know about injury compensation - what's the difference between how permanent disabilities are handled under workers' comp versus general liability insurance when it comes to getting paid?	Under workers' compensation insurance, permanent disability compensation is a specific benefit provided directly to injured employees, along with medical care and wage replacement benefits. In contrast, under Commercial General Liability insurance, compensation for injuries (including permanent disabilities) is only paid when the insured business becomes legally liable for causing bodily injury to others, covering their pain, suffering, sickness, disease or death. Workers' comp payments are typically not taxable, while liability payments are handled as legal claims.	"['Commercial General Liability Insurance provides protection against Bodily Injury and Property Damage claims for which a business operation is legally liable. Having Commercial General Liability Insurance is one of the most import things a Contractor can have, so it\'s best to take a closer look and understand its components.\nWho Is Covered?\nThe ""Named Insured"" is the one who’s considered the policy holder. It\'s found on the ""Declarations Page,"" which is the document by which the insurance company communicates the parties of the insurance contract. In cases where the Named Insured operates the business as an individual, he or she is covered as is their spouse, while acting on behalf of the business. If the Named Insured is a partnership or joint venture, coverage will extend to partners and members, along with their spouses while acting on behalf of the business. If the Named Insured operates a Limited Liability company, the company and its members and managers are covered while they are acting on behalf of the business. If the Named Insured operates as a corporation or association, the organization itself along with its executive officers and directors are covered by the policy.\nGeneral Liability insurance coverage will apply if a claim is filed due to an event where the insured becomes legally liable. It can\'t be stressed enough however, that coverage does not apply to all situations where the insured is legally liable for damages. Coverage will be however, limited to those obligations listed in the Insuring Agreement of the policy and not otherwise excluded from the policy.\nBodily Injury or Property Damage\nSince construction sites are a rough place, accidents and injuries can happen no matter how careful you are. Often Contractors work in close proximity to pedestrian walkways. Construction material, tools, debris, all can be considered hazards to people nearby. Construction sites are an attractive nuisance to children, who may want to play in or around the area.\nIn the event an insured becomes legally liable for the “Bodily Injury” of another, including pain and suffering, sickness, disease or death, the Bodily Injury portion of the Commercial General Liability insurance policy offers protection.\nThis coverage applies when an insured damages tangible property and includes Loss of use coverage.\nProducts and Completed Operations\nCovers liability arising out of the insured\'s products or business operations conducted away from the insured\'s premises, once those operations have been completed or abandoned.\nPersonal and Advertising Injury\nPersonal and advertising injury protects the “Named Insured” for injuries which he or she become legally liable. These include, but are not limited to, malicious prosecution, false arrest, detention or imprisonment, oral or written publication of material which libels or slanders a person or organization, or copyright infringement.\nDamage to Premises Rented to You\nThis coverage protects the insured in the event of a claim, for damage resulting from causes other than fire, on a premise which they have rented.\nFire Legal Liability\nThis coverage offers protection when the “Named Insured” becomes liable for fire damage to a premise which he or she is renting or temporarily occupying with the owner’s consent.\nThe General Liability Insurance cost will vary due to the type of work you do, the coverage amount you’re seeking, your experience, prior losses and other factors. For example, Roofers’ General Liability Insurance cost is much higher than Drywall General Liability Insurance cost.\nAsk your Broker about the details of your particular General Liability insurance policy. Remember, not all situations where the Named Insured becomes legally liable will be covered, so it’s important that you read your policy and ask your Broker to explain the coverages to you as well.', 'If you are an employee who has been injured on the job, you are most likely eligible to collect workers’ compensation benefits. The following questions and answers provide some basic information about the workers’ comp claims process, and the benefits you may be entitled to receive. Our friendly agent is also happy to help.\nWhat Types of Injuries Are Covered By Workers’ Comp\nWorkers’ compensation insurance covers only work-related injuries. The injury or illness must have been sustained in the course of your employment. If you have clocked out for the day and you are involved in a traffic accident on your way home, workers’ comp will not cover your injuries. If you trip and fall in the workplace, break your arm, or sustain another injury while performing the duties of your employment, you should be entitled to workers’ compensation benefits.\nWhat If I’m At Fault for the Accident that Caused My Injuries?\nWorkers’ comp is a no-fault system. Even if your injuries resulted in part from your own failure to take the necessary safety precautions, you are still entitled to benefits in most cases. In return, you are precluded from suing your employer for injuries covered by workers’ comp insurance.\nWhat Benefits Are Provided By Workers’ Comp?\nAfter an on-the-job injury or illness, workers’ comp will pay for your medical care related to the injury and replace a portion of the wages lost as a result of your injury. Typically, wage replacement amounts to approximately two-thirds of the worker’s average wages, up to a specific fixed limit. Benefits may also include:\nCompensation for any permanent disability\nOccupational rehabilitation or retraining if your injuries prevent you from returning to your previous position\nSurvivor benefits for families of workers killed on the job\nHow Do I Apply for Workers’ Compensation Benefits?\nThe workers’ compensation claims process may vary somewhat from state to state. Generally, to collect workers’ comp benefits, you must notify your employer and the workers’ comp insurance carrier of your illness or injuries.\nEnsure you have the necessary medical treatment right away. Then notify your employer in writing, complete an official claim form, and keep detailed records of your treatment. Make sure to notify your employer and file your claim within the required time frame, which can vary from state to state.\nAre My Workers’ Compensation Payments Taxable Income?\nIn most cases, workers’ comp payments for wage replacement or permanent disability are not subject to state or federal taxes. However, a portion of this money may be taxable if you are also receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).\nWhat If My Workers’ Comp Claim is Denied?\nIf you file a claim for workers’ compensation benefits and your claim is denied, you still have recourse. The reason for denial should be explained in the denial letter. If you feel your claim was incorrectly denied, you may appeal the decision through your state’s workers’ compensation board. Common reasons given for denial include:\nInsufficient evidence that the injury is work-related\nEmployer is disputing the claim\nNo medical treatment was received\nInjury was not reported to the employer within the specified time limit\nClaim for benefits was not filed before the deadline']"	['<urn:uuid:b215ddd3-144d-4160-a304-3f45d87082d1>', '<urn:uuid:c8383194-c3aa-4df9-8d17-9b0e5e7b0947>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	30	76	1140
41	What helps prevent mental decline in elderly people?	Several factors help prevent mental decline in elderly people. Education plays a protective role, as older women with more education experience fewer depression symptoms, even when facing high cerebrovascular burden. Additionally, participating in intellectually stimulating activities is particularly beneficial for maintaining cognitive function and reducing dementia risk, even if individuals don't follow other healthy lifestyle practices. Having low cerebrovascular burden, robust cognitive functioning, and few depression symptoms is also associated with better outcomes and greater longevity.	"['Open Access Dissertation\nDate of Award\nPeter A. Lichtenberg\nWomen over the age of 80 represent a rapidly growing demographic group. While older women live longer than men, they do so with more years of disability and frailty. The emergence of geriatric disorders such as vascular disease, depression, frailty and cognitive decline in the aging US population place additional strain and expense on the already over-burdened public health care system. Meanwhile, integrated models of care are associated with preserved functional independence, reduced medical costs, and greater satisfaction for both health care providers and patients. Implementation of integrated care demands process-models of disease that contextualize symptoms within broader patterns of decline. This dissertation proposes a model representing a hypothesized late-life clinical trajectory following from high cerebrovascular burden. The hypothesized trajectory includes higher rates of depression (of vascular origin), cognitive decline, frailty and shortened remaining lifespan. Different facets of this model are tested in the four studies that comprise this dissertation.\nThe sample was drawn from the Health and Retirement Study; a longitudinal, demographically-representative data sample of older adults in the United States. The sub-sample used in this dissertation included 1,368 stroke-free women over the age of 80 at baseline (1998). This sub-sample was followed for 10 years.\nThe first study tested the hypotheses that high CVB predicts greater depression symptoms, and that brain reserve (i.e.: education) protects elders from developing depression symptoms. A latent growth curve was used to identify differences in depression at baseline and over time based on CVB, cognitive functioning, education and age. Results indicate that at any level of CVB, older women with more education experienced fewer depression symptoms. Results support brain reserve theory and the vascular depression hypothesis. These results suggest that having greater education may postpone development of clinically-significant depressive symptoms resulting from high CVB, thereby preserving mood in late life.\nThe second study tested the hypothesis that variables representing the three domains of Rowe and Kahn\'s Healthy Aging framework predict longevity in this sample of stroke-free women over the age of 80. The ""avoidance of disease"" domain was characterized in this paper as CVB - chronic comorbidites that slowly erode adaptive functioning over many years. The ""sustained engagement"" criteria was conceptualized as depression, and deficits in the ""preservation of cognitive and physical functioning "" domain were identified as rapid cognitive decline. We found that at most waves (2002, 2004, 2006) mortality was predicted by CVB, depressive symptoms and cognitive drop measured 2 years prior. CVB and depressive symptoms at the 2000 wave predicted mortality at 6 and 8-years. Older women with the greatest longevity had low CVB, robust cognitive functioning and few depression symptoms, supporting successful aging theory and terminal cognitive drop.\nThe third study tested the hypothesis that vascular depression is a prodrome for frailty. At baseline, the prevalence of frailty was 31.5%. Over a 4-years the incidence of frailty was 31.8%. After controlling for age, education, ADL and IADL functioning, arthritis, pulmonary disorders, cancer, and self-rated health, vascular depression significantly predicted new cases of frailty. These findings suggest that vascular depression is a prodrome for frailty.\nThe fourth study tested the proposed model using structural modeling. The model demonstrated good overall fit and a significant indirect pathway from vascular depression to mortality through frailty was identified. Results support the proposed theoretical framework and suggest that vascular depression symptoms are associated with a clinical trajectory including more frailty symptoms and shorted remaining lifespan. This finding supports integrated care for geriatric patients and suggests specific targets for intervention with older patients experiencing vascular depression symptoms.\nPaulson, Daniel Lee, ""Vascular Depression: An Early Indicator Of Decline"" (2013). Wayne State University Dissertations. 737.', 'As we age, our bodies stop functioning at the same level they used to. We experience aches and pains where there were none before and may notice a significant decrease in energy and stamina.\nThe effects of aging can also take a toll on our brain health. For many, this means simply forgetting where we’ve left things or the ages of our grandchildren. What is of more concern is when cognitive decline becomes more than just forgetfulness. With rates of dementia on the rise worldwide, maintaining cognitive function in the later years of life is becoming more challenging.\nWhile it has been shown in previous research that participating in mentally stimulating activities is beneficial for maintaining cognitive function, research has not been specific on this topic. What has been discovered in the past is that elderly people who participate in more cognitive activities are also more likely to live a healthier lifestyle overall and, therefore, have lower rates of dementia.\nThis has left researchers asking which part of the healthy lifestyle these people lead is the most beneficial for preventing or delaying the onset of dementia. Is it actually the mental activities that are preventing the disease or is it something else?\nSo, a new study was performed to determine exactly how beneficial intellectually stimulating activities are. The researchers also wanted to determine exactly which part of intellectual activities contributes the most to cognitive health, be it the cognitive training, social engagement, or positive recreational experience.\nThe study consisted of 15,582 elderly community-living Chinese participants who were free of dementia or signs of cognitive decline at the start of the experiment. The follow-up period for the study was an average of five years. Participants were 65 years or older when the study began.\nUsing a combination of both questionnaires and examinations with a general practitioner, the researchers gathered information on participants’ leisure activities, overall lifestyle, and demographics.\nMore Women than Men are Diagnosed with Dementia\nAt the end of the study, 8.7 percent of the participants had developed dementia. This population was characterized as being older than the average participant and mainly female. These patients had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, visual and hearing impairments, poor mobility, and depression. The participants who developed dementia also had a lower tendency to adhere to a healthy lifestyle.\nThe researchers also noted that their results showed that participants who participated in intellectually stimulating activities, but did not adhere to a healthy lifestyle, retained the decreased risk for dementia as those who did follow a healthy lifestyle.\nThis shows that intellectually stimulating activities are one of the main ways patients can prevent or delay the development of dementia in elderly years. These results should be taken into serious consideration, especially for patients already suffering from physical limitations. Remaining cognitively active is one of the most important methods of lowering risk of dementia later in life.\n- Caffeine consumption may lower dementia risk in older women by 36 percent: Study\n- 8 factors that increase your risk of dementia']"	['<urn:uuid:ef3ca91b-54d6-4b23-9cd4-45fd7afce0c1>', '<urn:uuid:992ba35d-8e6b-4c99-8494-f037a8b749bf>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	8	76	1116

Knowing What to Expect When a loss of life takes place, you could experience a wide range of emotions, even though the fatality is anticipated.\nMany people report sense an initial stage of numbness after initial learning of a death, yet there is no genuine order to the grieving method. Some thoughts you may experience include: These feelings are normal and common reactions to damage. You may not be equipped for the power and duration of your emotions or how swiftly your moods may alter. You may even start to doubt the soundness of your mental health.\nNevertheless be assured that these kinds of feelings will be healthy and appropriate and definitely will help you fully understand your reduction. * Mourning A Loved One It is not easy to cope after having a loved one dead. You will mourn and cry. Mourning is the natural procedure you go right through to accept a major loss.\nMourning may include religious traditions honoring the dead or gathering with friends and family to share your reduction. Mourning can be personal and may last several weeks or years. Grieving may be the outward phrase of your loss. Your tremendous grief is likely to be stated physically, psychologically, and psychologically. For instance, crying and moping is a physical expression, although depression is a psychological manifestation.\nIt is very important to permit yourself to express these emotions. Often , fatality is a subject that is averted, ignored or denied. Initially it may seem helpful to separate yourself from the pain, but you cannot avoid grieving forever. Sooner or later those thoughts will need to be resolved or they might cause physical or emotional illness. Many people survey physical symptoms that accompany grief.\nStomach discomfort, loss of cravings, intestinal upsets, sleep disturbances and loss of energy are typical common symptoms of acute tremendous grief. Of all life’s stresses, mourning can critically test your organic defense devices. Existing ailments may worsen or new conditions may well develop.\nDeep emotional reactions may happen. These reactions include anxiety attacks, chronic exhaustion, depression and thoughts of suicide. An obsession with all the deceased is also a common a reaction to death.\n5. Dealing with a Key Loss The death of your loved one is usually difficult. Your reactions are influenced by circumstances of a death, particularly when it is abrupt or unintended. Your reactions are also influenced by your relationship with the individual who died.\nA child’s death arouses an overwhelming sense of injustice — for shed potential, unfulfilled dreams and senseless struggling. Parents may well feel in charge of the child’s death, regardless of irrational which may seem. Father and mother may also believe that they have dropped a vital part of their own identity. A spouse’s fatality is very upsetting. In addition to the extreme emotional impact, the death may cause a potential financial crisis in case the spouse was your family’s primary income source.\nThe death might need major cultural adjustments requiring the surviving spouse to parent by itself, adjust to one life and perhaps even go back to work. Seniors may be specifically vulnerable after they lose a spouse as it means burning off a lifetime of shared activities. At this time, emotions of solitude may be compounded by the loss of life of buddies. A damage due to suicide can be one of the most difficult loss to bear. They might leave the survivors using a tremendous burden of guilt, anger and shame.\nSurvivors can even feel responsible for the fatality. Seeking therapies during the first weeks after the suicide is particularly useful and advisable. Living with Tremendous grief Coping with fatality is vital to your mental well being.\nIt is only natural to experience grief each time a loved one dead. The best thing you can do is allow yourself to grieve. There are many strategies to cope efficiently with your discomfort. * Search for caring people.\nFind family and good friends who can appreciate your feelings of loss. Become a member of support groups with others whom are suffering from similar failures. * Share your feelings. Notify others how you are sense; it will help one to work through the grieving process. * Manage your health. Preserve regular contact with your family medical doctor and be sure to eat well and get plenty of relax.\nBe aware of the risk of designing a dependence on medication or alcohol to deal with the grief. 2. Accept that life is pertaining to the living. It takes hard work to begin to have again in the present and not place the past. 5. Postpone key life alterations. Try to hold off on producing any significant changes, just like moving, remarrying, changing careers or having another child.\nYou should offer yourself time to adjust to the loss. 5. Be patient. Usually it takes months or perhaps years to absorb a major reduction and agree to your improved life.\n5. Seek outside the house help when necessary. If your sadness seems like it really is too much to bear, seek specialist assistance to help work through your grief. It’s a sign of strength, certainly not weakness, to find help.Get your custom Essay']	['<urn:uuid:a3a00f85-414d-4731-98f4-c457340f77dc>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	14	69	2255
43	orbital frontal cortex amygdala function comparison	The orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and amygdala serve different but complementary functions in emotional and motivational processing. The OFC is involved in emotion-related learning, processing rewards and punishments, with its lateral part associated with aversive outcomes and medial part with rewards. It's essential for changing previously learned behaviors in response to new experiences. The amygdala, on the other hand, is particularly involved in processing fear, anxiety, and negative emotions, and plays a crucial role in conditioned learning. Damage to the amygdala causes impairments in both positive and negative reinforcement learning as well as emotional processing dysfunctions.	['What affective neuroscience means for science of consciousness by Leonardo Almada, Alfredo Pereira & Claudia Carrara-Augustenbourg, Universities of Uberlandia, Sao Paolo and Copenhagen,\nMens Sana Monographs, 2013 Jan-Dec. 11 (1) 253-273, doi: 10.4103/0973-1229.100409\nSummary and review of the above paper\nINTRODUCTION: The field of affective neuroscience, initiated by Panksepp and Ledoux, embraces the concept that emotional processes are based on brain structures that operate in parallel with cognitive processes, and can thus influence behaviour independently of cognition.\nA 20th century failure\nEmotional and Cognitive Processing: The authors envisage two interacting brain circuits, the first involving cognitive processes, and the second feelings about cognition. Most of 20th century thinking on cognition was hampered by its lack of emphasis on emotion-related brain functions, and its over-emphasis on computational operations, learning and memory.\nA new approach\nThe new approach to emotions posits the activity of particular interacting brain structures. The authors refer to this as ‘core affect’; This is defined as neural changes determined by the detecting and processing of internal and external stimuli. Feelings are defined as the subjective outcome of these stimuli, notably in the form of experienced pleasure and pain, with affective states defined as experienced happiness and sadness.\nFeelings are viewed as fundamental values for the modulation of both cognition and behaviour, and are thus seen as playing a key role in the causal chain of events. Internal feelings allow categorisation of signals from the external environment, which is subsequently adaptative for guiding behaviour in this environment. The authors have developed what they call the Endogneous Feedback Network (EFN) to account for the processing of emotions and cognition.\nAllocation of attention towards specific segments of the brain’s information flow is suggested to be related to such conscious feelings. Feelings are viewed as mental short cuts linking the assessment of stimuli to particular responses or meanings, prior to the more time consuming process of cognitive assessments. Emotions also effect the attentional resources given to particular stimuli, with the subjective experience of the stimuli suggested to play a role in the selection of stimuli for attention.\nTwo brain routes\nLe Doux outlined the concept of two routes in the brain. A quick route from the thalamus to the amygdala, by-passing the processing of the cortex, and striking straight at the amygdala, to generate a rapid response. The amygdala is particularly involved in the processing of fear, anxiety and negative emotion. The second route goes via the cortex and can take advantage of the analysis of the stimuli. An initial negative response may thus arise in the amygdala without involving conscious perception of particular external stimuli. However, the subsequent arrival of such conscious perception via the slower cortical route may disperse the initial negative or fear response.\nFrontal brain structure\nThe induction of emotional states has been shown to correlate with activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex (Braver, Cohen and Barch, 2002), while other studies have shown the shown the role of the orbitofrontal cortex in emotion-related learning. The lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortex are involved with reward and punishment. The lateral orbitofrontal is associated with aversive outcomes, and the medial orbitofrontal is associated with reward (O’Doherty et al, 2001). The orbitofrontal in particular is seen to be essential to changing what has been previously learnt, in response to new experience.\nEmotion and cognition\nBeer et al (2006) argues that the orbitofrontal has a significant role in the interaction between emotion and cognition. Some emotions are seen as having selective effects on cognition, and on subsequent goal-directed behaviour (Gray 2001). Empathy, belief, moral reasoning and decision making are seen as based on a melding of affective and cognitive processing. Emotions and conscious feelings are viewed as playing a role in stimuli-response integration.Tags: affext, cognitive processing, consciousness, emotional processing, feelings Posted by', 'What motivates people to do the things that they do? Or fail to do? Why do some people make the same bad decisions repeatedly? These are complex, baffling questions, and the answers are often elusive.\nWalk into a bookstore and stand in the self-help section. Every published self-help topic somehow touches on the theme of motivating people to make better decisions, avoid dysfunctional behaviors, and create thinking patterns that lead to more productive, healthier lives.\nClasses outside of psychology and philosophy even focus on the processes involved with better decision making. Business students, for example, take a class called Decision Sciences. The Business School at Columbia University in New York has an entire center devoted to decisions called “The Center for Decision Sciences.” It states as its core purpose “to help students understand consumer behaviors, the implications of decision making on public policy, and the neurological underpinnings of judgment and decision making.”\nBut what exactly are the neurological underpinnings associated with decisions? Are there neurons connected in networks that directly affect motivation? In other words, how do the brain and its neuronal networks and anatomical structures combine to form motivations and ensuing behaviors?\nThese questions form the core of what neuroscientists and neuropsychologists specializing in the study of motivation desire to know, empirically examining, analyzing, and probing how the “mind” facilitates motivation - and its close relatives called emotions. For more information see human emotions and the brain.\nBut investigating the human mind for clues to motivation has only recently taken significant strides in areas of scientific study. Those strides came along with the introduction of neuroimaging technologies that give researchers real-time, live images of the working brain. Using these neuroimaging devices in combination with motivational tests and tasks, researchers now study motivation in ways unheard of only a decade ago.\nStudying motivation and behavior\nUp until recently, researchers used animals exclusively to study motivation. Setting up a system of rewards, punishments, and reinforcers, psychologists used animals to motivate behaviors in terms of reaching for rewards or avoiding punishments.\nPavlov’s dogs are the classic example for conditioned learning. Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, the Russian physiologist, psychologist, and physician, studied how dogs salivated when shown food they knew to be appetizing. Hence, they had to previously taste the food, find it likable, and when presented with the food again, they would salivate. Dogs could also be conditioned to salivate with a light or tone. If Pavlov presented a light or tone each time he gave the dogs the tasty food, they would soon begin salivating simply at the sight or sound of the stimulus. He called the stimulus a “reinforcer.”\nIn Pavlov’s example, the food is the primary or unconditioned reinforcer, and the tone or light is the secondary or conditioned reinforcer. Primary reinforcers motivate behavior without any learning while secondary reinforcers only motivate after learning – or conditioning - takes place.\nScientists furthered Pavlov’s findings by training animals such as rats to perform a certain action to receive a reward or punishment. They trained rats to press a lever to obtain food pellets, for example. This is called instrumental learning.\nFrom these animal experiments, neuroscientists have extrapolated primary and secondary reinforcers of human behaviors. Humans learn cues that lead to positive and negative outcomes, becoming motivated by actions and behaviors that produce positive results. Individuals also quickly learn what elicits negative outcomes, and try to decrease or avoid behaviors leading to adverse results.\nHowever, research studies using humans have remained obscure mainly as a result of ethical consequences. For example, keeping food from humans, or punishing them with options such as electric shock to teach them to avoid certain behaviors are not viable options.\nThe social context also plays a part in human learning. For instance, in some experimental situations, humans will make choices to avoid looking stupid. However, neuropsychologists now use effective tools to measure human motivation.\nThe Iowa Gambling Task is one such example, now the most widely used tool for understanding how humans use rewards and punishments to alter behavior.\nThe Iowa Gambling Task\nIn the Iowa Gambling Task, researchers use four decks of cards and play money. Test participants select cards from the decks, which, unknown to them, are marked accordingly: two decks are high risk; two decks are low risk.\nResearchers tell participants that each time they select a card that they will win game money, but occasionally selecting a card will cause them to lose some money.\nThe high-risk decks offer the highest money rewards but also the greatest penalties. The object is to earn as much money as possible, and participants quickly learn that by selecting from the high-risk decks they earn large amounts of money, but can lose the largest amounts as well. Over the course of the game, participants will earn the most and have the lowest amount of penalties by selecting from the low-risk decks.\nNormal participants selecting cards from each deck learn after about 40 or 50 selections which decks have the steadiest income with the least penalties. However, test participants with damage or lesions to the brain’s prefrontal cortex region in the frontal lobes, also called the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) because it’s above the eye’ orbits, continue to select from the bad decks.\nSome neuroscientists credit these results to the fact that those with OFC dysfunction don’t connect behaviors to future consequences – also apparent in their daily lives. However, these results are still being debated in the scientific community, with many still not convinced in a direct causal link between OFC dysfunction and consequence planning.\nA number of neuropsychological researchers use the Iowa Gambling Task in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, to observe the brain regions as they complete the Iowa Gambling Task using different research paradigms. For instance, some observe only normal volunteers while others observe those with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nA Scientific Workaround\nHowever, using fMRI to test participants in terms of primary reinforcers such as food or drink presents some difficulties for scientists because the fMRI machines require participants to lay as still as possible.\nThey have found a way around this limitation by devising studies that activate taste and smell senses. Scientists know that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) contains taste and smell receptors, so they devise experiments that test “sensory-specific satiety” using these receptors.\nFor example, eating one cookie makes you desire another, and another, until after a certain number of cookies they are no longer appealing. One study gave participants a large meal, and afterwards used the smells of foods eaten during the meal during an fMRI study. The response of the OFC during the presence of the smells became increasingly reduced, pointing to evidence that the OFC is involved in the motivation to keep doing something.\nOther researchers have moved away from using food as a primary reinforcer in studies, turning instead to the use of financial rewards. Money is not a primary reinforcer because it does not meet a physiological need; however, it is a strong motivator of behavior.\nSince the late 1990s, a series of experiments using money as a reward has shown activation in the following brain areas: the midbrain, thalamus, dorsal and ventral striatum, and OFC. For more information on the anatomy of the brain, see the basics of brain structure.\nAmygdala Damage, Emotions and Motivation\nAs noted in the following article on Emotions, studies done on those with brain injuries to the amygdala, a sub cortical structure of the limbic system, exhibit dysfunctional emotional processing.\nSimilarly, studies on motivation – specifically conditioned learning – show that some patients with damage to the amygdala have impairments in conditioned learning concerning both positive and negative reinforcers. Researchers today are investigating this link between the amygdala and motivation – and how damage to this deep brain structure simultaneously causes emotional impairments.\nMotivated to Study Motivations\nIf you are interested in why and how people become motivated, and you wish to work in the fields of either Neuropsychology or Neuroscience, you should consider an undergraduate or graduate degree in psychology. Advancements in technology have made the study of human motivation and the brain some of the most timely and needed research for today’s complex and changing society.\nMost careers investigating motivation focus on research and require at least a Ph.D. Public and private laboratories hire those with advanced degrees in the neurosciences.\nContact schools offering degrees in psychology for more information about a career in this field.\nRewards, Motivation and Learning\nRewards motivate learning, according to the 2006 Neuron article “Remembrance of Rewards.” Or, at the very least, an area of brain circuitry might help turn motivations into memory, said Cognitive Neuroscientist Alison Adcock and colleagues in the journal article.\nIn this study, these researchers revealed specific reward-related regions of the brain that alert other regions, aiding learning and memory formation.\nAdcock, now an assistant professor at the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences in North Carolina, used fMRI to scan the brains of volunteers as they participated in two types of reward-related tasks.\nThe first task tried identifying the brain area responsible for anticipating rewards. The researchers showed participants circles or squares that contained an amount of money the subjects could win or lose. The amounts ranged from no money to $5, and to earn the money participants had to press a button immediately when shown a target. Neuroimaging during this task showed increased activity in the mesolimbic brain region as participants anticipated rewards - an area also associated with emotional processing.\nThe second task attempted to measure how this mesolimbic region also facilitated memory processing. The scientists showed participants “value” symbols associated with differing scenes. One symbol might be worth $5 while another was only worth ten cents, and the participants had to try and remember the symbols and the corresponding scenes. The next day the participants returned to pick out scenes from groupings of scenes, and not surprisingly, the high-value scenes were remembered more than the low-value scenes. But what the researchers did find remarkable was that the recall of the symbols activated areas of the mesolimbic region as well as the hippocampus. The hippocampus located in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), is known for higher-order processes such as learning and memory.\nParticipants who showed the greatest activity in the mesolimbic and MTL regions exhibited the best memory recall. The study summarized the findings as demonstrating that organisms’ “expectations and motivation interact with events in the physical world to influence learning.” The researchers concluded that anticipatory activation of the mesolimbic circuitry may help translate motivation into memory.']	['<urn:uuid:af32330b-47a9-4e05-bf6e-523469f00622>', '<urn:uuid:3ed687a5-cae9-4a0d-a122-320da9fe60a0>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	6	96	2395
44	asthma medication types symptoms quick relief long term	Asthma medications fall into two main categories: Quick-relief medications (like short-acting beta-agonists and anticholinergics) that relieve acute symptoms during attacks, and controller/long-term medications (like inhaled corticosteroids) that are used daily to prevent asthma attacks. Symptoms that these medications target include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness.	"['Guidelines for Parents of Children with Asthma\nThe Peel District School Board recognizes that there are students within the school system who have asthma. Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory condition that occurs in the airways of lungs and makes it difficult to breathe. This is a disease whose symptoms may be mild to severe, and intermittent to chronic. According to the Asthma Society of Canada (Asthma.ca) asthma is the most chronic childhood disease affecting approximately 12.5 % of children. Untreated or under treated, asthma can lead to severe respiratory distress and in rare cases can cause sudden death. There is no cure for asthma, but it can be controlled by minimizing exposure to allergens and irritants, and by the proper use of asthma medication. Ryan’s law legislation (2015) is an important step to support the well-being of students with asthma in all Peel schools.\nAsthma triggers can be anything in the environment that provokes or causes asthma symptoms. Triggers and the degree of symptoms differ for each person with asthma. A trigger causes the airways to become inflamed and then cause the airway muscles to tighten, making it difficult to breathe. Triggers are everywhere. Allergic triggers can include dust mites, pollen, molds, pet dander. Non-allergic triggers can include exercise, viral infections (common colds), extreme temperatures, smoke etc.. While it is impossible to create a trigger-free environment, we can take important steps to minimize the risks for students with asthma. School staff and parents are responsible for creating safe and healthy environments for all students.\nSymptoms of asthma can be reduced with medication and by decreasing the exposure to environmental triggers. Symptoms may vary and not every person will experience all the symptoms listed. Asthma Symptoms may include difficulty breathing; shortness of breath; coughing; wheezing; and chest tightness.\nAsthma medications work to relieve the symptoms of asthma. There are two types of medication used to control and prevent the symptoms. Controller Medications are used daily, before or after school at home, to prevent asthma attacks. Reliever Medications are used to relieve the acute symptoms of asthma. These are also called the ""rescue"" inhalers and should be readily available at all times. They provide quick relief, often within minutes. They are taken only when needed.\nResponsibilities of parents/guardians of students with asthma\n- Arrange a meeting with the school prior to the student attending school\n- Inform the school administration of your child\'s asthma and provide information regarding current treatment\n- Provide the school with physician’s instructions for administering medication by completing (Appendix A) and Asthma Alert Emergency Plan (Appendix B) annually, including parent\'s consent\n- Provide the school with up-to-date inhalers with your child’s name on them\n- Provide the school with any updated information including emergency contacts and telephone numbers and changes in medical conditions\n- Provide additional medical information if requested\n- Provide your child with a Medic Alert identification bracelet\n- For excursions, consider participating on field trips\n- Teach your child:\n- to recognize the first symptoms of asthma and to alert an adult;\n- to properly self-administer their inhaler\n- to communicate clearly when they feel asthma symptoms starting;\n- to carry their own inhaler (e.g., fanny pack or outside compartment of their knapsack;\n- to assume as much responsibility as possible for their own safety\nAllergy and Asthma Information Association (AAIA) maintains a phone line for those who have questions or concerns around asthma and allergies.\nOntario Ministry of Education - Ryan\'s Law', ""There's no cure for asthma, a chronic lung disease marked by inflammation of the bronchial tubes (airways) of the lungs.\nBut a number of treatments for asthma are available — both to help prevent symptoms and to treat them when they do occur.\nWithout proper treatment, asthma may get worse as you get older, with asthma attacks increasing in their frequency and severity.\n- Quickly improve symptoms when they occur\n- Prevent symptoms and attacks\n- Improve your sleep and activity level\nThe treatment your doctor prescribes for your asthma will likely depend on your age, type of asthma, severity of your condition, and how your body responds to various treatment options. Finding the right treatment to control your asthma symptoms may require trying various methods, and what works for you can change over time.\nAsthma Inhalers Help Deliver Medicine to the Airways\nThere Are 2 Main Types of Inhalers\nInhalers can deliver medicines to the airways that help prevent asthma attacks, relieve symptoms during an asthma attack, or do both. There are two main types of inhaler devices.\nMetered-dose inhaler (MDI) This is the most commonly used type of inhaler. It has a boot-shaped mouthpiece into which a pressurized, medicine-containing canister is inserted. This design has been in use since 1956.\nYou deliver a measured dose of the medicine to your lungs by inserting the mouthpiece into your mouth and pushing down on the canister while inhaling.\nYour MDI may have a counter that tells you how many doses are left in the canister.\nIt may be difficult to coordinate your inhalation with the release of medicine from your inhaler. But this step is essential to ensuring that the medicine reaches your lungs (the main goal of inhaled therapy).\nTo decrease the chance that the medicine stays in your mouth, you can attach a holding chamber called a spacer to your MDI. (Some MDIs have built-in spacers.)\nSpacers temporarily hold the released medicine, allowing you to inhale slowly, deeply, and at your own pace to get the full dose into your lungs.\nSome MDIs, called breath-actuated inhalers, automatically release a puff of medicine when you inhale.\nBe sure you know how to use whichever type of inhaler your doctor prescribes to you; and double-check that you are using it correctly (more on how to use an inhaler below). If you have questions about usage or any instructions are unclear, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or healthcare provider.\nWhile MDIs originally used chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as their propellant, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) phased out all CFC-based albuterol inhalers in 2008 owing to the environmental damage caused by CFCs.\nDry-powder inhaler This type of device doesn’t use a chemical propellant to launch medicine into your lungs. Instead, it contains a powdered formula that you draw into your lungs with a deep, fast inhalation.\nAnyone Having Difficulty Using an Inhaler Can Try a Nebulizer\nWhile not technically an inhaler, there’s yet another option for inhaling medicine.\nNebulizer If you have severe asthma and are unable to use a regular inhaler, a nebulizer may be a better option.\nThis machine turns liquid medicine into a fine mist that you inhale through a mouthpiece, a mask that fits over your nose and mouth, or into your mouth alone.\nHere’s How to Use an Inhaler\n- Remove the cap from the mouthpiece and inspect it for residue or blockages.\n- Shake the inhaler vigorously for a few seconds.\n- Take a deep breath and then exhale completely.\n- While standing or sitting upright, begin to breathe in slowly with the inhaler in place and press the button. Continue breathing in after pressing it.\n- Hold your breath for 5 to 10 seconds, then breathe out slowly through your mouth.\nMedication to Control Asthma Includes Both Quick-Relief and Long-Term Drugs\nAsthma medication falls into two general categories: drugs for quick relief and those for long-term control.\nQuick-Relief Medication for Asthma\nQuick-relief medication, which includes short-acting beta-agonists and anticholinergics, is inhaled (with the devices describe above) to relieve flare-ups of asthma symptoms.\nShort-acting beta-agonists Medications such as albuterol, levalbuterol, and terbutaline are the first choice for quick relief of attacks. These drugs relax the smooth muscles around the airways and reduce swelling in the lining of the airways.\nAnticholinergics Medications such as tiotropium also relax the smooth muscles around the airways and reduce mucus production, but they work more slowly than short-acting beta-agonists.\nLong-Term Control Medication for Asthma\nInhaled corticosteroids Corticosteroids are the standard treatment, and widely considered the most effective type of medicine to prevent attacks. They work by reducing the body’s inflammatory responses.\nInhaled long-acting beta-agonists These drugs prevent the narrowing of the airways by relaxing the smooth muscles there; they should always be taken in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.\nLeukotriene modifiers Taken by mouth, these drugs block either the production or the effect of leukotrienes, chemicals that can lead to asthma attacks.\nCromolyn sodium Cromolyn sodium is an inhaled nonsteroidal drug that prevents cells from releasing inflammation-causing chemicals. (This medication is rarely used now.)\nMethylxanthines Taken by mouth, these drugs help relax and open the airways.\nCombination Single Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (SMART)\nThe guidelines were published in December in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and on the NHLBI website.\nThe combination medication has been found to be more effective for helping you avoid unexpected trips to the emergency room or your doctor’s office, and can also help you avoid larger corticosteroid doses — which with long-term use raise the risk of side effects such as osteoporosis, high blood pressure, cataracts, and glaucoma.\nKnowing Your Asthma Action Plan Is Step One\nFor most people with asthma, managing the chronic condition involves a multi-pronged approach tailored to your symptoms and lifestyle.\nStep one for everyone, however, is having a firm grasp of your asthma action plan.\nWork with your doctor to create an asthma action plan that covers how to:\n- Take your medication properly\n- Avoid asthma triggers unrelated to physical activity, such as allergens and airborne irritants\n- Track your asthma control\n- Respond to worsening symptoms\n- Seek emergency care when needed\n- Quit smoking, if you do\nIn addition, monitor your symptoms carefully. Keep track of what they are, when they occur, and their severity.\n- In cold, dry air\n- Shortly after you get a cold or have an asthma attack\n- During high pollen conditions\n- In environments with airborne irritants, such as cigarette smoke\nTreating Severe Asthma Typically Requires a Combination Approach\nCan You Treat Severe Asthma With Natural Remedies?

45	Can QGIS process multiple raster files simultaneously?	Yes, QGIS has built-in batch processing capability that can process entire directories of raster files at once, including virtual rasters (catalogs), and supports multithreaded processing mode.	['Raster data is quite different from vector data. Vector data has discrete features constructed out of vertices, and perhaps connected with lines and/or areas. Raster data, however, is like any image. Although it may portray various properties of objects in the real world, these objects don’t exist as separate objects; rather, they are represented using pixels of various different color values.\nDuring this module you’re going to use raster data to supplement your existing GIS analysis.\nThe goal for this lesson: To learn how to work with raster data in the QGIS environment.\nOpen your analysis.qgs map (which you should have created and saved during the previous module).\nDeactivate all the layers except the solution and important_roads layers.\nClick on the Load Raster Layer button:\nThe Load Raster Layer dialog will open. The data for this project is in exercise_data/raster.\nThe first thing you’ll notice is that nothing seems to be happening in your map. Are the rasters not loading? Well, there they are in the Layers list, so obviously they did load. The problem is that they’re not in the same projection. Luckily, we’ve already seen what to do in this situation.\nThe rasters should fit nicely:\nThere we have it - four aerial photographs covering our whole study area.\nNow as you can see from this, your solution layer lies across all four photographs. What this means is that you’re going to have to work with four rasters all the time. That’s not ideal; it would be better to have one file for one (composite) image, right?\nLuckily, QGIS allows you to do exactly this, and without needing to actually create a new raster file, which could take up a lot of space. Instead, you can create a Virtual Raster. This is also often called a Catalog, which explains its function. It’s not really a new raster. Rather, it’s a way to organize your existing rasters into one catalog: one file for easy access.\nTo make a catalog:\nNotice the text field below. What this dialog is actually doing is that it’s writing that text for you. It’s a long command that QGIS is going to run.\nKeep in mind that the command text is editable, so you can customize the command further if preferred. Search online for the initial command (in this case, gdalbuildvrt) for help on the syntax.\nIt may take a while to complete. When it’s done, it will tell you so with a message box.\nThe above methods allow you to virtually merge datasets using a catalog, and to reproject them “on the fly”. However, if you are setting up data that you’ll be using for quite a while, it may be more efficient to create new rasters that are already merged and reprojected. This improves performance while using the rasters in a map, but it may take some time to set up initially.\nNote that this tool features a handy batch option for reprojecting the contents of whole directories. You can also reproject virtual rasters (catalogs), as well as enabling a multithreaded processing mode.\nYou can choose to process entire directories instead of single files, giving you a very useful built-in batch processing capability. You can specify a virtual raster as input file, too, and all of the rasters that it consists of will be processed.\nYou can also add your own command line options using the Creation Options checkbox and list. This only applies if you have knowledge of the GDAL library’s operation.\nQGIS makes it easy to include raster data into your existing projects.\nNext, we’ll use raster data that isn’t aerial imagery, and see how symbolization is useful in the case of rasters as well.']	['<urn:uuid:1b58010b-d8ad-4e37-99c8-c4f82c5d0c94>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	7	26	615
46	Can I change how my character looks after creating them?	Yes, you can fully customize your character throughout the game. You can purchase clothes from shops and craft or acquire accessories. Many clothing items can be bought with gols (the main in-game currency), while some items require trading with materials like Flexible Fiber. Some accessories like sunglasses and pendants are visible when worn. Later in the game, you can also transfer stats from better outfits onto your preferred clothing, allowing you to maintain your desired appearance while keeping good stats.	"['- Main article: Player character category\nThe default name for the player character is Marco if male or Linda if female. There are no non-binary gender options, but in voice acted dialogue, the player is often referred to as ""Builder,"" and sometimes a reference to their name or gender is omitted altogether. The player\'s selected gender does not restrict them from wearing any clothing or determine who they are allowed to romance, though some clothing will automatically change appearance based on the player\'s selected gender (such as the Elegant Dress Bottom being pants for male characters and a skirt for female characters and the Swimsuit Top being completely different items based on gender).\nCustomization[edit | edit source]\n- Main article: Character customization\nThe player can fully customize their character to fit their liking. The player can choose between a male or a female base character, choose hairstyles and adjust their color and length, and adjust facial features.\nThroughout the game, the player can customize their character\'s attire by purchasing clothes from shops and crafting or acquiring accessories. Many clothing items can be purchased with the primary in-game currency, gols, but some items can be traded for with items such as Flexible Fiber.

47	acoustic emission vs vibration welding stress monitoring	Acoustic Emission (AE) technique and vibration treatment are both methods for managing welding stresses, but they serve different purposes. AE is used as a screening mechanism for monitoring and predicting residual stresses, with AE energy being directly proportional to the locked-in residual stresses. Vibration treatment, on the other hand, is an active method for lowering residual stresses and increasing dimensional stability of structures, while also improving mechanical properties and weldability of steel.	"['Prognosis of Residual Stresses in Steel T-Beams Using Acoustic Emission Method\nConference: Publication Date: 16 March 2015Testing Method:\nPoor welding technique is considered to be one of the most common causes of residual stresses during the fabrication of metallic structures. The severe thermal gradient in the welding process and uneven cooling that follows, results in residual stresses and distortion. The aim of this paper is to predict experimentally the formation of residual stresses in T-section beams using Acoustic Emission (AE) technique. Series of laboratory bending tests were carried out on four welded T-section beams with four different welding sequences and different values of residual stresses were evaluated and characterized. The AE energy measured was directly proportional to the amount of the residual stresses locked into the structure. The testing showed promising results, which indicate that AE technique could be used as a screening mechanism for monitoring residual stresses.

E-mail: email@example.com\nAnalysis of technological capabilities of postweld vibration treatment and vibration treatment during welding was performed on the basis of available publications. It is shown that the technology of postweld vibration treatment is an effective means of lowering residual stresses and increasing dimensional stability of beam, frame and casing structures (machine-tool construction, mechanical engineering, shipbuilding, etc.) made of steel, titanium and aluminium alloys. Compared to high tempering, power consumption is reduced tens of times and productivity is increased. Vibration treatment during welding and surfacing is an effective means of lowering residual stresses, increasing mechanical properties and performance of structures, and improving weldability of a number of steel grades. However, experience of industrial application of this technology is so far insufficient for formulating clear recommendations on specific fields of its application. 41 Ref., 3 Figures.\nwelded structures, residual stresses, vibration treatment, dimensional instability, increased fatigue resistance, weldability\n- (1993) Welded building structures.

48	What are the structural considerations when building a pergola near a house, and what are the different design approaches for integrating it with the surrounding landscape?	When building a pergola near a house, key structural considerations include keeping the center of posts at least 7 inches further from the house than the eave projection, and maintaining about 4 inches distance from the eaves to avoid moving gutters or dealing with frost footings. Posts should be set in concrete at least 24 inches deep, with 12-inch diameter holes. For clay soil areas, digging to frost depth is recommended to prevent frost heave. As for landscape integration, pergolas can be designed to work naturally with existing features - they can be built around trees, incorporate privacy walls with decorative windows, or be combined with other outdoor amenities like fireplaces and built-in benches. They can serve as transitions between different outdoor spaces, define traffic zones, and can be enhanced with trellises or fabric panels for additional privacy. The structure can either stand alone in the garden or be positioned near the house, with options for various flooring materials including wood chips, gravel, or concrete slabs underneath.	"[""1 of 1\nA beautiful addition to your yard\nBuilding the pergola over an existing patio (instead of building a new one) saves you a lot of time, money and work.\nHere’s a summer project designed to keep you cooler on even the hottest of days. The classical columns support an overhead wooden lattice that works like a big shade tree, letting only a portion of the sun’s radiance shine through.\nWhat looks like the toughest part of this project is actually the easiest—the graceful, solid-looking columns. They’re not wood at all but a hollow-core composite material with amazing structural strength and durability. We’ve designed the project so you simply slip these columns over treated 4x4 posts embedded in concrete. When screwed to the wooden posts, these columns provide a stable, solid base for the overhead lattice framework.\nThese paintable precast columns are available by special order at home centers. They come in a wide variety of diameters and heights and architectural styles.\nPressure-treated dimensional 2x8s and 2x10s make up the majority of the upper framework, and the decorative end pieces are cut with a jigsaw from our pattern. The whole project can be built in a couple of weekends, with another weekend for staining and painting.\nWe built our pergola over an existing stone patio; that saved a lot of patio work. If you’re planning to install a patio as part of your overall project, you’ll need to allow extra time.\nChoosing the Right Location\nBecause this project is made to stand independent of the house, you can either locate it right near your house as we did or let it stand alone in the garden. You can also consider using wood chips or gravel as a floor or even pour a concrete slab underneath. By keeping it unattached (about 4 in. from the eaves), you don’t have to deal with moving existing gutters or matching eaves. You also don’t have to mess with frost footings (in colder climates). However, if you have clay soil, it’s best to dig to frost depth (if greater than 24 in.) for your footings to prevent frost heave.\nOur existing patio was built over a sand and compacted gravel base, so we removed only the stones necessary to dig the 12-in. diameter holes to secure the posts. You’ll most likely have a different situation.\nIf you’ll be adding a patio later, be sure to pour all the footings at the finished patio height. Keep in mind any slope you’ll include in the patio. Most patios slope about 1/8 in. per foot to drain.\nPlan the post location to clear the eaves\n1 of 1\nPhoto 1: Measure your soffits to determine the pergola column centers\nMeasure the projection of your soffits and add 7 in. to accurately position the column centers near but not too close to the house. Drive remote stakes an equal distance from the house, attaching a string to help mark and align the outer post locations.\nIf you plan to build your pergola close to the house, first measure the projection of your eaves as shown in (Photo 1). Keep the center of the posts nearest the house at least 7 in. farther from the house than this measurement.\nTo keep the posts in alignment, stake your post locations using remote stakes with a string. With the stakes driven beyond the work area (Photo 2), you’ll be able to undo the string while you dig and then reattach it later to check for alignment. To check for left-to-right placement parallel to the house, just measure the distance from one of the remote stakes and write this measurement on a note pad. To make sure the layout is square, adjust the diagonal measurements of the postholes so they’re equal.\nAs you dig your holes, put the soil in a wheelbarrow and find a place to relocate it away from your site. Save any gravel or sand to reinstall pavers. Note: You may need to move a post slightly. We shifted one post near the house to create an entry along the steps.\nThis illustration shows how the pergola is\nFigure A: Pergola Details\nUse this illustration when building the pergola. It provides some dimensions and shows how each part is labeled.\nNote: To print out this illustration, go to Additional Information at the end of this story.\nHave your concrete delivered\n1 of 1\nPhoto 2: Set the posts in concrete\nDig the postholes a minimum of 2 ft. deep and 12 in. in diameter. Dig 24-in. tubes into the holes, add your 60-in. posts and pour concrete around them. Plumb your posts and align them with your outer string line. Allow the concrete to harden for a couple of days, then trim the posts to 32 in.\nBefore you dig any holes, call your local utilities or 411 to mark any buried cable or gas lines. Once you’re sure there are no buried utilities in the area, dig your holes with a hand-held posthole digger or rent a power auger. You’ll also need a shovel to widen the hole. Dig until it’s at least 24 in. deep.\nReconnect your layout string to make sure the holes are aligned. Cut your forming tubes (Photo 2) and insert them into the holes. Level the tops of the forming tubes until they’re flush with the patio surface. If you mix the concrete on site, you’ll need about five bags of Quikrete or Sakrete concrete mix per hole, for a total of 30 bags. (That’s enough to have your home center or lumberyard deliver it to the site. If you call for a ready-mixed delivery, ask for 1/2 cubic yard.)\nAs you set your posts, reposition your string line about 1-3/4 in. to allow for the post thickness and then align the posts with your string line (Photo 2) as you pour in the concrete.\nNote: If you have a post that’s 1/2 in. out of whack, don’t sweat it. You’ll be able to align the tops of the columns later when you install the overhead beam. Once the posts are embedded in concrete, let the concrete harden for a minimum of two days.\nCut the columns to length and fasten them to the posts\n1 of 6\nPhoto 3: Set the columns upside down on the posts\nLift the columns (upside down) over the 4x4 posts to mark the bottoms for trimming. Attach a story pole to the house to establish a reference point.\n2 of 6\nPhoto 4: Mark the posts for cutting.\nAttach a level to a straight 2x4 and mark the bottom of each post level with your height mark against the house. Remember, there's still 10-1/4 in. additional height going onto the tops of the posts.\n3 of 6\nPhoto 5: Cut the posts with a jigsaw\nTransfer your mark completely around the post using a combination square. Cut the post with a 10-teeth-per-inch wood blade in your jigsaw. You'll need a fresh blade for every post you cut.\n4 of 6\nPhoto 6: Install wood plugs in the columns\nCut 5-1/2 in. round treated wood plugs to fit the inside of your columns. Glue and screw together a pair for each column top, then glue the plugs flush into the top of each column. Secure the plugs to the columns with 2-in. deck screws. Note: Drive a screw into the top of each plug to use as a handle to position the plug.\n5 of 6\nPhoto 7: Attach 1x4 shims to the posts\nScrew 1x4 treated pine to the side of each 4x4. This will beef up the post so it meets the inside edge of the hollow column.\n6 of 6\nPhoto 8: Attach the columns to the posts\nPredrill and countersink eight screw holes in the sides of the columns: four 6 in. from the bottom and four 30 in. from the bottom. Use 3-in. No. 12 exterior wood screws to anchor the columns to the wood posts. Plumb the column as you screw it to the post. You’ll notice some play between the post and column. Opposing screws will tighten the entire assembly.\nWe wanted the roof of the pergola to align with the fascia of the house for a custom, fluid look. To keep the roof of the pergola even and level across the whole topside, you’ll need to cut each post exactly. Just clamp or nail a board temporarily to the fascia as shown in (Photo 4). Measure down 10-1/2 in. from the top of your fascia board for the cutoff height of your columns (95 in. for ours).\nTo make sure we cut the bottom only (we didn’t want to have to wait another two weeks for a new column), we flipped the columns end for end, slipped them over the posts and marked the bottoms of each column—and numbered them as well.\nNote: To make cutting the columns easier, lay them on sand bags or mulch bags to keep them from rolling or vibrating as you cut. Transfer your length mark completely around the column base with a combination square that’s set from the bottom of the post.\nI found the jigsaw a lot safer, quieter and less dusty than a circular saw. This composite polymer is only about 1/2 in. thick but pretty hard, so expect to eat up a new blade on each column.\nOnce you’ve cut each column, fatten the posts with 1x4s as shown in (Photo 7). Predrill each column with a combination pilot and countersink bit (three holes 6 in. from the bottom and another three 30 in. from the bottom). Also drill four evenly spaced holes 1-1/4 in. from the top of each column to secure the plugs (Photo 6). Now slip each column over its post. Strap a level near the base of each column (the column begins to taper slightly after 32 in. from the bottom) and screw into the wood beneath. Tighten or loosen opposing pairs to “plumb up” each column. Next, slip the molded base over the top of the column and then slip the capital on as well. It’s best not to fasten these in place until the project is nearly completed.\nFasten the beams to the top of the columns\n1 of 2\nPhoto 9: Set the beam over the columns\nSlide the column bases and capitals over the column shafts. Measure and cut the outer 2x10 beam and walk it up the ladders.\n2 of 2\nPhoto 10: Secure the beam in place with angle brackets\nScrew the beam (E) to the wood plug so it's flush with the front outside edge of the column. Use angle brackets as shown with 1-1/4 in. Simpson bracket screws. Screw the other beam in place and then the other three intermediate beams, F1 and F2.\nMeasure the length of the front and back 2x10 beams (E), making them 3 in. less than the outside of the column tops, and cut them to length.\nNote: If you have a column that won’t quite straighten up, you can have someone push it straight up and down and then fasten it in place with the steel brackets from above.\nNext, measure and cut the side beams (F1) and screw them to the ends of the front beams. Now cut the center beam (F2) 3 in. shorter than the side beams and fasten it to the posts and the front and back beams (E) with 3-in. deck screws.\nSlip the flat rafters onto ledgers\n1 of 4\nPhoto 11: Attach ledger strips to the beams\nScrew a treated wood 1x2 7-1/4 in. down from the top of each of the 2x10 beams running out from the house. These will act as ledgers for the 2x8 flat rafters.\n2 of 4\nPhoto 12: Place the rafters on the ledgers\nSet the 2x8 flat rafters onto the ledgers (hold them perfectly vertical) and screw each end to the 2x10 beams with three 3-in. deck screws.\n3 of 4\nPhoto 13: Fasten the rafters in place\nDrive screws at an angle to fasten opposing 2x8 flat rafters. Use three 3-in. screws per end.\n4 of 4\nPhoto 14: Attach the capitals\nPush the resin-cast capitals flush with the bottom of the 2x10 beams and screw them into place with 2-1/2 in. deck screws.\nOnce all the 2x10 beams are in place, cut your 1x2 ledgers and screw them 1/2 in. up from the bottom of each beam F1 and F2 with 2-in. deck screws every 8 in. Now measure each 2x8 flat rafter (referred to as “flat” because they have no pitch) and cut it to length. Ideally these should all be the same length, but if you had problems with your post positioning earlier, you may have to adjust them.\nMark 16-in. centers along the beams F1 and F2. Rest each rafter on the ledgers (Photo 12) and screw them in place one at a time from the backside of each beam, aligning them with your marks. Where the rafters meet the center beam (F2), angle the 3-in. deck screws through the beam and into the rafter (Photo 13). When you’ve finished the rafters, secure each capital to the underside of the beams with 2-1/2 in. deck screws (Photo 14). Predrill the capitals.\nPreassemble the rafter tails\n1 of 3\nPhoto 15: Mark and cut the rafter tails\nCut the decorative rafter tails from treated 2x10 pine. To avoid cupping, choose knot-free boards and keep them out of the sun until you paint or stain them.\n2 of 3\nPhoto 16: Attach the rafter tails\nRip strips of 5/4 treated decking to 3-in. widths to make parts J. Align and screw them to K and to the top of each 2x8 flat rafter. Then screw K in place from the backside of F1.\n3 of 3\nPhoto 17: Make the lattice strips\nRip 5/4 decking 3 in. wide and rout a 1/4-in. round-over on each edge to make the lattice strips.\nCut the decorative rafter tails (J) using the grid template shown in (Fig. A). For consistency, mark your first one as the pattern and trace this piece each time. Sand the gentle curves with a belt sander or portable drum sander.\nNow cut the tail tops (K) from 5/4 decking. Round over the cut ends with a hand plane or a router (Photo 17). Ease the edges of the tails and the tops with 100-grit sandpaper and then apply a solid-color stain. Make sure the treated wood pieces are dry to the touch before you prestain them. If they feel cool, let them dry in a shady spot for two days before applying the solid-color stain. Rushing the process could cause the stain to blister or roll off.\nOnce the stain is dry, screw the tops to the tails with 2-1/2 in. deck screws (allow the top to overhang 3/4 in.) and fasten them over the tops of each flat rafter and beam end as shown in (Photo 16) and (Fig. A).\nYou’ll need to cut the tail top short on the assemblies that project from the corners and screw them in place from the backside of the front beam.\nThe last details\n1 of 3\nPhoto18: Install PVC pieces to vent the columns\nDrill 3/4-in. holes and insert 6-in. long 1/2-in. PVC pieces with 90-degree fittings attached. These little pipes act as ventilators to help slough off any excess moisture that may get into the columns.\n2 of 3\nPhoto 19: Install PVC pieces to vent the columns. Fill holes with putty.\nFill the pilot holes and screwheads on each column with auto body fiberglass filler. Let the filler harden, then sand the areas flush. Now you’re ready to paint.\n3 of 3\nPhoto 20: Attach the lattice to finish the construction\nScrew the 5/4 lattice strips to the tops of the rafters. Evenly space them across each section. Add more if you'd like to increase the shade below.\nCut and nail (8d galvanized finish nails) the 1x4 fascia strips (M) flush to the top of the beams and in between each pair of tails (Photo 20). Next, screw the lattice strips across the rafter tops, letting them project 3 in. past the fascia.\nNow cut the sub-base pieces from treated 2x4. Screw the corners together with 3-in. deck screws. If you haven’t already done so, fit the patio stones back against the footings and glue the subbase to the patio surface. Then screw the molded base to the sub-base and caulk the seams with acrylic caulk.\nBefore you paint the columns, mix auto body filler and spread it over the screw holes along the column (Photo 19). Let the filler dry and then sand it flush. Prime the columns, and then paint them with a good-quality exterior trim paint. Don’t use paint on the rest of the pergola; instead roll and brush the wood portions with solid-color stain."", 'Pretty, Inspiring Pergola Ideas\nFrom shade to structure, pergolas are a great way to add beauty and function to your yard. These pergola ideas and yard solutions offer helpful tips and tricks for you to find your own pergola designs, pergola plans, and inspiration and bring character to your outdoor room.\nEverything In This Slideshow\n1 of 22\nWorking with the Landscape\nOftentimes there\'s a natural spot for a pergola, but there are landscape elements that are essential, too. Luckily, the flexibility of pergola designs allow tweaks to best fit needs and wishes. Here, a tree supplies shade, so the pergola\'s roof was built around it. A solid back wall -- with a cute oval window accent -- offers privacy, too.\n2 of 22\nPergolas as Transitions\nSome pergola designs are more decorative than they are functional. This seaside home -- which mixes a little bit of Cape Cod and a little bit of Shaker styles -- offers a pretty lesson in how to use a pergola to accent a home. Textural materials on the exterior repeat in the pergola, and the structure offers a welcoming, softening transition between home and deck areas.\nFast & Simple Outdoor Tips\nTry these done-in-minutes outdoor decorating tips for a stylish space beneath your pergola.\n4 of 22\nIntegrate with a Patio or Deck\nA pergola can stand on its own, but it can also work well with another outdoor structure such as a patio or deck. Its placement can help delineate traffic or use zones, such as a seating area. This pergola design designates a lounge area and incorporates a built-in bench.\n5 of 22\nPergolas are a natural fit in expansive landscapes, particularly when integrated well with other outdoor living amenities. Here, the massive beams on this pergola fit in with the bulky structure of the stucco fireplace. A casual bench serves as both a defining edge for the pergola and extra seating spot, too.\n6 of 22\nOpen and Shut Sides\nAlthough many pergolas have four open sides, there are options to increase seclusion on one or multiple sides. This pergola uses three trellises on one side, detailing which maintains the pergola’s connection and openness to the landscape.\nEasy Patio Landscaping Ideas\nAdd greenery around your patio and pergola design with these gorgeous landscaping ideas.\n8 of 22\nPergolas are a good way to ease transition from house to other hardscape amenities -- here, both pool and outdoor kitchen (in the background) received a shading structure. Space the pergola\'s roof boards as needed to shield the sun (this one relies on closeness to offer more shade).\n9 of 22\nPergolas as Accents\nSpace constraints may limit how much of a pergola you can include in an exterior space. But even a smaller pergola design such as this can help to accent a home\'s patio, providing an interesting backdrop to an otherwise boring exterior facade. Here, a trellis offers a pretty and secluded backdrop for the seating space.\nGlam-up Outdoor Rooms\nGive your outdoor spaces and pergola a bit of luxe style with these tips.\n11 of 22\nFabric can be a useful accessory in pergola designs, especially to shield the space from sunlight or unwanted views. To provide flexibility in the enclosures, consider fabric -- here, with pull backs -- that\'s outdoor safe.\n12 of 22\nPergola + Roof\nWhile most pergolas are designed to be at least semi open to the sky, they can be integrated into the roof structure of the house. Here, the shingles on the pergola offers shade to the narrower porch structure, while colors pick up on detailing in the pretty home’s windows.\n13 of 22\nPergola Meets Arbor\nA little bit pergola, a little bit trellis, a little bit arbor, this charming structure blends in the best of those three hardscape items to create a lovely entrance to this cottage garden\'s side space. Narrow seating nooks offer restful spots, while the pergola-arbor\'s overhead spacing offers room enough for a flowering vine.\n14 of 22\nPergola as a Focal Point\nA pergola is adaptable enough that it can be used in a range of structures -- for example, this charming and cheerful seating structure. Used in this way, a pergola adds a focal point to a garden. A few containers help to soften and disguise the structure\'s base.\n15 of 22\nContrast in Colors\nDifferent hues can be a good way to use a pergola for visual impact. Here, the vertical columns establish a bright and light boundary for a seating area, while the stained wood roof offers a more naturalistic complement to the landscape.\n16 of 22\nArchitecture at Play\nSpace and budget are two possible constraints with a pergola, but in general, the ""rules"" of pergola design are flexible. Here, multiple heights of the pergola\'s ceiling add visual interest, while columns lend formality that\'s in tune with the detailing on the rails of the patio space.\n17 of 22\nA Contemporary Pergola\nThe outlines of this contemporary pergola idea offer structure and boundary between the paved exterior space and the rest of the landscape. Using a pergola in this way offers a simple way to define large landscapes in particular. Here, additional elements such as the fire pit accent the clean detailing of the pergola design.\n18 of 22\nVarying Roof Structures\nThere’s no set width for the ceiling elements in pergola designs. In fact, landscaping may help determine final detailing. Here, full-grown shade trees offer shelter from the sun, so the pergola roof beams are space further apart.\n19 of 22\nA Deck-Ready Pergola\nA pergola can offer shade to a large gathering space, even if it\'s not next to a house. Here, gently arched beams topped with 2x2s form the roof over this freestanding 8x8-foot deck. Lattice offers a partial enclosure and increases the sense of intimacy.\n20 of 22\nPergolas as a Passage\nAlthough pergolas are often stopping points in a landscape, they can also be used as transitions. Here, a tall structure offers a waypoint between front and backyard. Vines that ramble up the pergola repeat in the trellis accents against the home’s exterior wall.\n21 of 22']"	['<urn:uuid:ebf4049b-f79a-47d8-8412-082892ef98c3>', '<urn:uuid:fb95b42b-3fd7-4868-840b-846fd5f7a1ee>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	26	167	3854
49	How do vision screening programs work and maintain patient privacy?	Vision screening programs like Helen Keller International ChildSight provide free in-school vision screenings and eyeglasses to children in low-income communities across multiple states. These programs must follow HIPAA requirements to protect patient information, including implementing safeguards for access control, audit controls, and authentication. All patient records must be stored securely, whether physical or digital, with encryption and password protection when stored online, and access limited to authorized personnel only.	['Section 3: Examples of Vision and Eye Health Interventions\nThe 2016 report Making Eye Health a Population Health Imperative: Vision for Tomorrowexternal icon notes that population health strategies can improve vision and eye health in the United States and globally.4 Public health agencies can implement a range of strategies to promote vision and eye health. For example, strategies can be implemented to:\n- Promote public awareness of the importance of vision and eye health.\n- Expand access to appropriate clinical care.\n- Build public health capacity to support vision-related activities.\n- Promote community actions that enhance vision and eye health.\nThe remainder of this section of the toolkit describes interventions that have been used in the public health sector to promote vision and eye health.\nInterventions to Promote Awareness of Vision and Eye Health Issues\nAwareness of vision and eye health and associated health risks can help motivate people to take the necessary steps to protect their vision and eye health. Examples of interventions designed to promote awareness of vision and eye health issues include the following:\nRead about how staff in the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) used CDC’s PPOD program to bring together pharmacists, podiatrists, optometrists, and dentists in a team-based intervention.\n- The Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) Initiative is a CDC program that provides health care providers with strategies and tools to help them implement fall prevention interventions. Vision health is integrated into this intervention because vision plays an important role in fall prevention among older adults.\n- Pharmacy, Podiatry, Optometry, and Dentistry (PPOD) was a program in CDC’s National Diabetes Education Program. It was designed to engage providers from these four disciplines to work together to actively identify and treat patients with diabetes. This team-based approach can significantly reduce patients’ risk of developing diabetes complications, including blindness.\n- The Lions Eye Health Programpdf iconexternal icon is a community education program that helps Lions Clubs, community organizations, and individuals promote healthy vision and raise awareness of the causes of preventable vision loss. The program works to empower communities to save sight through early detection and timely treatment of diabetic eye disease, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration.\n- The Oklahoma Healthy Aging Initiativeexternal icon offers a class for older adults called “Eye Ball 101” that provides a comprehensive overview of eye health and medical conditions that affect eyesight.\n- The National Eye Health Education Programexternal icon was established by the National Eye Institute. It provides a variety of resources to increase awareness of eye health. Program resources are designed to help reach populations at high-risk of eye disease and vision loss and to promote the use of vision rehabilitation services.\nInterventions to Promote Access to Vision and Eye Care for Populations at Risk\nVision impairment and eye disorders can often be prevented if people have access to vision and eye care services. Access to preventive services is especially important for people at higher risk of vision impairment and those who have difficulty accessing health care services due to geographic or financial constraints.\nSeveral reputable and accredited organizations have used evidence collected from scientific research to develop evidence-based recommendations and guidelines related to vision and eye health. Examples of these recommendations include the following:\n- Regular eye exams for adults aged 60 or older, which is supported by the American Optometric Association (AOA), American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), American Academy of Family Physicians, and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n- Annual comprehensive eye exams for people with diabetes to allow for early detection and management of diabetic eye diseases, which is supported by the American Diabetes Association, AOA, and AAO.\n- Regular comprehensive medical eye evaluations for adults at risk of developing glaucoma, which is supported by AOA and AAO.\n- Vision screening at least once for all children aged 3 to 5 years to detect amblyopia (also called lazy eye) or its risk factors, which is supported by the US Preventive Services Task Force.\nExamples of interventions designed to promote access to and use of vision and eye care services include the following:\n- The Kirby Puckett Eye Mobileexternal icon is a mobile eye clinic that provides free vision screenings to people of all ages in communities across Minnesota. It also provides comprehensive eye exams, eye health information, and referrals to vision and eye care resources.\n- Vision To Learnexternal icon is a nonprofit organization that partners with school districts throughout the United States. It uses mobile eye clinics to provide free eye exams and glasses to children in low-income communities.\n- Alabama Lions Sightexternal icon is a mobile eye clinic that provides vision and eye care services, including vision screenings, at several sites in the most rural areas of Alabama.\n- Prevent Blindness North Carolinaexternal icon found that low-income, older, African American women were less likely than other population groups to receive vision and eye care services. They partnered with CDC’s WISEWOMAN program to include vision screening as part of preventive health screenings offered to low-income women in rural parts of the state.\n- Prevent Blindness Wisconsinexternal icon conducts training throughout the state to ensure that public health practitioners can educate the public about the importance of vision and eye care and the eye conditions that can affect older adults. The program, called Healthy Eyes, teaches participants about age-related macular degeneration, cataract, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy.\n- Prevent Blindness Ohioexternal icon partners with the Ohio Department of Health on the Wise About Eyes Programexternal icon. This program provides vision screening certification and equipment to primary medical clinics, school nurses, Head Start staff, and other providers to ensure that children aged 3 years or older receive evidence-based vision screenings.\n- Enterprise-Wide Initiativesexternal icon are telehealth interventions under the Office of Rural Health in the US Department of Veterans Affairs. They place ophthalmology technicians in rural Veterans Affairs (VA) clinics that lack vision and eye screening services. The technicians transmit patient eye information to VA ophthalmologists for diagnosis and follow-up.\n- The University of Virginia Health Systemexternal icon is expanding its use of telemedicine to help patients across Virginia better prevent or manage chronic conditions. Through its Center for Telehealth, the system is piloting an intervention to use telehealth technologies to screen patients for diabetic retinal disease.\n- The Children’s Vision Screening Initiativeexternal icon is offered through the Northern Plains Eye Foundation in South Dakota. It provides free annual vision screening to children in preschool and elementary school. It also provides sight-saving surgeries to help people regain their vision, mobility, and quality of life.\n- Project BEST: Better Eye-Health Services and Treatmentexternal icon is provided through the Commission for the Blind and Visually Impaired in the New Jersey Department of Human Services. It offers vision screening services to children, adults, and migrant workers. It also focuses on helping historically underserved populations, including people who are low-income, elderly, are members of minority groups, or have diabetes.\n- Friends for Sightexternal icon is a nonprofit organization in Utah that provides vision screenings for children, glaucoma screenings for adults, free eye exams and glasses to low-income children, and education about eye safety and eye health.\n- Helen Keller International ChildSightexternal icon is a nonprofit organization that provides free in-school vision screenings, prescription eyeglasses, and referrals to local community vision and eye care providers to children in low-income communities. It currently operates in California, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Wisconsin.\n- The Wills Eye Glaucoma Research Centerexternal icon in Philadelphia developed and evaluated a community vision and eye care delivery modelexternal icon that provides eye exams and educational workshops in an urban area to detect, treat, and manage glaucoma in people at high-risk of developing this condition. The evaluation showed the value of using community strategies to reach people with glaucoma or suspected glaucoma in a metropolitan area.\n- Eye Care Quality and Accessibility Improvement in the Community (EQUALITY)external icon is a telemedicine program focused on glaucoma detection and management. It was established by the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The program is used in retail-based primary care practices that serve communities with a high percentage of people at risk of glaucoma. An evaluation of the project found that when people know more about glaucoma and plan to get vision and eye care services, it may result in early detection of disease and lower risk of vision loss.\nInterventions to Promote Rehabilitation and Improve Quality of Life for People With Vision Impairment and Eye Disorders\nRehabilitation interventions seek to improve the quality of life for people with vision impairment by helping them make the most of their remaining vision. These interventions give rehabilitation professionals and organizations the tools they need to improve the functional abilities of people with vision impairment or eye disorders. These tools can help people with vision impairment by increasing their mobility, access to information, number of social contacts, and ability to get and keep a job.\nExamples of interventions designed to promote rehabilitation and improve quality of life for people with vision impairment and eye disorders include the following:\n- The Community Services for Vision Rehabilitationexternal icon is a nonprofit community organization that uses a mobile eye clinic to provide accessible and comprehensive vision and eye care services to people with low vision and blindness.\n- The Minnesota Aging Eyes Initiativeexternal icon was developed by the Minnesota State Services for the Blind. It helps older adults adjust to vision loss by providing low vision aids and devices at no charge. It also provides information about eye conditions common to older adults (e.g., macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy) and referrals to other necessary health care services.\n- The Ohio Department of Agingexternal icon is a state agency responsible for coordinating programs and services under the federal Older Americans Act. It delivers practical, person-centered interventions and services in a variety of areas, including vision and eye health, to strengthen and support Ohio’s older adults and their communities.\n- A literature review to assess the effectiveness of providing reading aids to adults with low vision found insufficient evidence to support the use of a specific type of electronic or optical device. The review found some evidence that stand-mounted electronic devices may improve reading speed better than optical devices.5\n- A randomized controlled trial of a low vision rehabilitation intervention that used home visits to improve visual function found preliminary evidence that such programs can have a positive influence on vision-related function.6\nA comprehensive and thoughtful intervention can improve vision and eye health in your state or community. As you plan and implement your intervention, consider the extent to which your intervention is based on best practices or scientific evidence, can be used in different settings, and engages the community. You will also need to evaluate your efforts.', 'RESOURCES - ARTICLE LIBRARY\nStaying HIPAA Compliant with Online Data Storage\nKeeping patient records secure and private is the concern of every hospital and health care provider, but they are often overwhelmed with years and years of patient information and the lack of adequate storage space. Destroying these health records in order to make room for more storage is often not an option. Patients want access to all of their health care records, and physicians need them in order to better diagnose patients. Online data storage is a way to satisfy all of these issues. Using online storage for these records allows easier access for patients, and offers easier sharing of patient information from hospital to physician, as well as from physician to physician. Storing health records online isn’t, however, without security concerns. Patients, hospitals, and physicians want assurance that these confidential records will remain safe, private, and secure, and will only be accessed by those authorized to do so.\nWhat is HIPAA?\nHIPAA or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 was created in order to protect health information and give patients certain rights regarding their private health information. It also allows for disclosure of health information necessary for patient care. This act specifies safeguards necessary for administrative, and physical and technical handling of patient health information.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS.gov) HIPAA has many requirements and restrictions. It requires safeguards for:\n- Access Control\n- Audit Controls\n- Person or Entity Authentication\nAccess control is defined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule as “the ability or the means necessary to read, write, modify, or communicate data/information or otherwise use any system resource.” It should allow authorized users to only access the minimum amount of information necessary to complete job functions. The Access Control specification also requires the implementation of an exclusive user identification or user ID, and immediate access in case of an emergency.\nWhat Type of Security is Necessary?\nWhen dealing with patient records in an office, maintaining privacy and security usually involves storing patient files in locked cabinets where the files can be physically secured and visibly monitored at all times. When you are storing patient information online, certain precautions must be met in order to maintain the same security and privacy guaranteed each patient.\nWhile HIPAA permits patient records to be transmitted over the Internet, businesses will want a service that offers file encryption, authentication and password protection in order to secure the information. Although HIPAA does not require online data storage services to have encryption, it does require that patient information be adequately protected and accessible only to authorized persons. Encryption is the best way to protect that information and ensure authorized access to those records. It is also important to offer backup services in case of a virus attack, flood, or fire. Finally, the service must offer a method of tracking any security breach, as well as the ability to lock out former employees after they have left or been terminated.\nWhen storing patient information, it is important to stay HIPAA compliant, as the fines for not doing so are expensive. While online storage for health care businesses guarantee less worry, work, and expense for health care providers, the service is only as good as the security offered. Remaining HIPAA compliant is vital in order to continue a good business relationship with the health care industry.\nContent by Managed Services Provider University']	['<urn:uuid:c07f9f2e-9b24-44db-8434-6d5d87221a1a>', '<urn:uuid:53c1e085-512d-454f-869c-1a294b08602e>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	10	69	2367
50	folk literature documentation classification preservation methods	Folk literature is documented and preserved through various classification systems and catalogues. The most significant is the ATU system (formerly AT system), developed by Aarne, Thompson, and Uther, which assigns numbers to different tale types and motifs. This helps researchers identify tales, track variants, and compare stories across different cultures. The documentation process reveals how folk literature varies by region - for instance, some areas emphasize folk songs used for magic effects or communal purposes, while others focus on narrative traditions. Major collections and archives exist in various countries, such as Ireland's national archive of folktales, and comprehensive catalogues like The Types of International Folktales provide detailed classification and bibliographic information for preserving these cultural materials.	"['In The Types of International Folktales, the ""ATU Catalogue"" edited by Hans-Jörg Uther (2004), ATU numbers replace AT numbers. And ATU (from the surname initials of Aarne, Thompson, and Uther) allows ""the type numbers that have been in use for nearly one hundred years [to] remain unchanged,"" says Uther. To allow that and to accomplish that are two different things, though, for at least one Norwegian folktale that is well over a hundred years, is missing completely in the new ATU system. Its old AT number (211*) has disappeared.\nAnother side to the revision is that the overall content of various types of tales has been changed, in both small ways and more comprehensively. And such changes mean that old ""AT umbrellas"" (numbers) for the types of tales, do not serve as well as before as classification devices in every case, for example in many Norwegian folktales I have checked and commented on in Norwegian. [Link]\nHowever, the new ATU-types are now the classification devices in force. And the overall, most recent and detailed survey of types looks like this (and you also get a former one below to compare with):\nWe use this scheme to survey and compare folk tales.\nThe AT Divisions of Tales\nIn the AT catalogue the tales (AT-number entries) are divided into these categories:\nMost folk tales or fairy tales are classified under ""ordinary tales"". They comprise about half of the catalogue. The next section goes deeper into those catalogue numbers.\nThe A in \'AT\' stands for Aarne, and the T for Thompson. More specifically: ""The Finnish folklorist Antti Aarne and the American folklorist Stith Thompson."" AT-numbers are practical tools of folklore: If you collect folktales they are of benefit. If you would like to have summaries of folktales, the catalogue numbers can give great help too. They help greatly those who intend to compare tales for different countries and cultures - mainly European ones, that is.\nAarne and Thompson devised a catalogue (classification system) of the types of international folktales. The initial catalogue was developed and published in 1910 by Aarne under the title ""Index of Types of Folktale"" in German. Aarne\'s system was devised to organize and index Scandinavian collections. Aarne\'s system was translated and enlarged by the American folklorist Stith Thompson in 1928, and revised in 1961.\nIn 2004 Hans-Jörg Uther published a novel edition in three volumes, called The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography Based on the System of Antti Aarne and Stith Thompson. The types of folktales are given ATU-numbers in it, after the surname initials of Aarne, Thompson, and Uther. The AT classification system is expanded to the Aarne-Thompson-Uther or ATU system which is far better than the older AT system and covers more ground. [Ti] [LINK]\nThe indexed AT motifs are limited mainly to European and European-derived tales that are known to have been told by mouth at the time they were published. The AT index yields a single classification system, and with its help different variants may be grouped or banded together under the headings of AT-number, which serve as their common reference. AT-numbers may be used to (1) identify tale types, (2) isolate motifs, (3) locate cultural variants. If there are variants that include other motifs, (more AT-numbers), the motif numbers are given too.\nIn the hog tale example given, there are two Norwegian variants of the folktale, and a comprehensive catalogue will give the information needed to find them if necessary, and there will be bibliographic information (not shown above).\nThough this you can infer how a catalogue entry is generally designed.\nVarious Catalogues Are at Hand\nThe Types of the Folktale constitutes the most important reference work and research tool for comparative folktale analysis. The basic idea is still that in the AT catalogue tales are organized according to type and assigned a title and number and/or letter. In the highlighted example above, the tale ""The hog who was so tired of his daily food"" is given the index number AT 211*. But if we look for that particular tale in in D. L. Ashliman\'s Guide to Folktales in the English Language: Based on the Aarne-Thompson Classification System (1987), we will not find it [Agha]. This is because that Guide is a much abbreviated catalogue. For all that, Ashliman has followed the Aarne-Thompson classification system where he is not omitting entries or elements. Ashliman\'s Guide is fairly useful, and easier to use than the larger set devised by Stith-Thompson.\nA search in Ørnulf Hodne\'s catalogue of Norwegian fairytale types [Tyno] for AT 211* would yield the result that is highlighted above. His catalogue follows the model of Norsk Eventyrbibliotek (below), and its folktales have been registered according to the international type system of Aarne and Thompson.\nIn the catalogue there is room for well known folktales, such as the ones collected, edited and published by Asbjørnsen and Moe, and the Household Märchen of the Grimm brothers. Most of these well-known folktales have been given one AT-number each, as a general rule. There are other tales that incorporate some of the elements (parts, episodes, motifs) of such tales, and still other tales that contain other elements. A comprehensive catalogue has to deal with these things. Hodne deals very much according to this:\nMore to know:\nDespite the rich material that has been preserved in Scandinavia, much traditional material was never recorded.\nMain sources: Tyno 5-15; Agha.\nThere are significant updates and much more to learn in Uther\'s recent The Types of International Folktales (2004).\nTHERE are about 4200 Norwegian folktale types today [Tyno 10]. Folktales may serve inspiration. And folktales are arranged in international folktale cataloges by their allotted numbers with titles added and summaries of the types of tales (descriptions).\nAntti Aarne and Stith Thompson worked out the numbers that refer to folktale types. An AT-number may cover a whole folktale, or a sequence (an episode) of a folktale. There is more on the subject further down the page.\nFOLKTALES are arranged in international catalogues according to the motifs (themes) in them. A motif is given a number, a title, and a description where main traits or features of the tale are shown by way of a capsule. Example:\nIn case there is a chain of AT-numbers in an entry - for example AT 302+400+461+613 = AT 302 nr. 28 - it means the tale is classified as a variant of one or more tales. In this case the tale is classified as a variant of AT 613, which is called The two travellers, and tells how one traveller blinds the other, who in turn learns valuable secrets, and next becomes a mighty, rich man after his sight is restored again.\nAlso, many AT-numbers connected with a tale shows that the classification system is convoluted. Futher, both folktales and folktale variants may be classified in this way, by more than one AT-number. It shows that the tale/variant is made up of several motifs, one after another, in a ""string of events"" - the folktale plot or ""chain of action"".\nIn the survey that follows, most AT-numbers and titles in English are given, at least for the time being.\nIn this list some AT-numbers are left out, and many composite AT-numbers too, and descriptions of AT-numbers and titles. Also, listings of variants and of biographical data are omitted below.\nThe new ATU numbers do not correspond to all types of tales below; some of the more recently catalogised ones may have other ATU numbers.\nThe excellent, annotated series Norsk eventyrbibliotek (Norwegian Folk Tale Collection) edited by B. Alver (et. al) was published by Det norske Samlaget in Oslo 1967-1981, and contains 12 volumes. They are:\nAgha: Ashliman, D.: A Guide to Folktales in the English Language. Greenwood.

[Email] ᴥ Disclaimer: [Link]', '- Origins and development\n- Characteristics of folk literature\n- Techniques of folk literature\n- Regional and ethnic manifestations\n- Major forms of folk literature\n- Study, collection, and preservation\nRegional and ethnic manifestations\nIn many particulars of form and substance there will be found great variations in the ways folk literature is manifested. The interests of people in one culture may differ profoundly from those of people in another. One group may enjoy singing folk songs, another listening to romantic folktales, and a neighbouring group may even be concerned only with legends and traditions. This difference is often geographic, so that the student of folk literature in the Pacific Islands who may later investigate a Central African tribe will find a completely different emphasis in the two areas. These differences may well depend upon the varieties of religious concepts held by the group or its natural environment, whether islands or jungle or cultivated farm lands, or its stability or mobility. These characteristics are likely to become especially deep-seated in groups that have been settled in one place over a long period of history. Frequently they may correspond to national frontiers, but more often they are aspects of the general culture of an area and may well be quite independent of political or linguistic boundaries.\nThe Russian epic songs are found only in Russia, but the wonder story such as Cinderella or Snow White is a part of the folk literature of a good portion of the world. The Navaho Indians of the Southwestern United States place great emphasis on their remarkable chants and lengthy folktales. Their neighbours throughout the Great Plains tell many well-constructed unified stories but confine their rituals largely to the dance. In Europe the Irish excel in storytelling, both of legends and fictional tales, so that even today it has been possible to record a prodigious number for their national archive. But in England and Wales the folktale is little cultivated, preference having been given to legends and ballads. As expected, there is a contrast between the abundance of oral saints’ legends in Spain and Italy and their rarity in Scandinavia. Finland, meeting place of Eastern and Western tradition, shows an abundance of nearly every kind of folklore. From eastern Europe to Central Asia the folk epic flourishes.\nTales and origin legends have been collected in great numbers from various parts of Oceania, where there is a common mythological background extending over enormous distances. Except for probable early contact by way of Indonesia, these folktales seem to show little Eurasian influence. In many parts of South America the merging of Iberian, Indian, and African materials seems almost complete.\nThe folk literature of the African Americans is in a state of continual change, reflecting their history. Much certainly goes back to Africa, usually by way of the West Indies, and much was borrowed long ago. But African Americans have themselves in a truly oral fashion developed songs and stories, and particular music styles. Of very special character is the folklore of modern Israel. Jews from various lands have brought together folk literature from all these countries. Assimilation of this is a long task, and, since divergent language backgrounds are unimportant for folktales, the problem is to absorb the great variety of forms.\nTaken the world over, folk literature is found everywhere, though the emphasis differs from place to place.\nMajor forms of folk literature\nSinging of some kind is almost universal, and it is probable that where there are no reports of it the information is simply missing. Folk song implies the use of music, and the musical tradition varies greatly from one area to another. In some places the words of songs are of little importance and seem to be used primarily as support for the music. Frequently there are meaningless monosyllables and much repetition to accompany the voice or the musical instrument. In much of the world, drums and rattles, beating time by hands or feet, or the stroking of a harp give a strong rhythmic effect to folksinging. In other parts of the world, flutelike wind instruments or bowed fiddles of one kind or another affect the nature of folk song texts. In many places folk songs are of great importance, serving as excitement to war or love or as a part of religious or secular ritual. Through them the group expresses its common emotions or lightens the burden of communal labour. In certain preliterate groups and sometimes elsewhere, folk songs are used for magic effects, to defeat enemies, to attract lovers, to invoke the favour of the supernatural powers. Sometimes the magic effect of these songs is so greatly valued that actual ownership of songs is maintained and their use carefully guarded. They may come to the owner in a dream or as the result of fasting or other austerities.\nEven when folk songs are not used for such practical purposes but only for the pleasure of singing or listening, the greater part of the world uses them for the expression of ideas or emotions held in common by the group. Only in societies used to the songs of composers or poets does purely personal expression enter into the folk song. This is not frequent, and songs of this type are hardly to be distinguished from some of the simple lyrics of poets such as Robert Burns. Folk songs, essentially expressions of commonly shared ideas or feelings, are often trivial but sometimes they may be profoundly moving.\nThe lyric folk song in one form or another is found almost everywhere, but this is not true of narrative singing. Unless the reporting of the activities of preliterate cultures has been very faulty, it would seem that the combination of song and story among these peoples has been rare, in spite of a wealth of prose narrative. On the other hand, in major Western and Asian civilizations the narrative song has been important for a long time and has been cultivated by the most skillful singers. In the course of time these songs of warfare, of adventure, or of domestic life have formed local cycles, such as the byliny of Russia or the heroic songs of many of the Balkan States and Finland or the ballad tradition of western Europe and elsewhere. Each of these cycles has its own characteristics, with its distinctive metrical forms, and its formulas both of events and expression. Any reader of the Homeric poems will be aware of their essentially oral and musical nature, and all the early literary narratives of Sumer and the Middle East suggest a long previous development of narrative singing.']"	['<urn:uuid:1cf7a6f8-42a3-4d89-9772-2eb2e50aa92d>', '<urn:uuid:11846f5d-fd2a-4a95-a606-34590ecfdd64>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	6	116	2487
51	prevent window bird collisions techniques	"To prevent bird collisions, feeders can be placed within three feet of windows. Additional prevention methods include: attaching netting or screens a few inches from windows to soften impact, applying CollidEscape® film that appears opaque to birds, installing outdoor shades or awnings, using decals with spaces no larger than 4"" x 2"", and hanging wind chimes. Birds can also be protected by keeping indoor plants away from windows and closing blinds when lights are on at night. Approximately one billion birds die annually in the United States from window collisions."	['1) Locate bird feeders at different levels\nSparrows, juncos, and towhees usually feed on the ground, while finches and cardinals feed in shrubs, and chickadees, titmice, and woodpeckers feed in trees. To avoid crowding and to attract the greatest variety of species, provide table-like feeders for ground-feeding birds, hopper or tube feeders for shrub and treetop feeders, and suet feeders well off the ground for woodpeckers, nuthatches, and chickadees.\n2) Offer a variety of seeds in separate feeders\nA diverse mix of seeds will attract the greatest variety of birds. To avoid waste, offer different seeds in different feeders. Black oil sunflower seed appeals to the greatest number of birds. Offer sunflower seeds, nyjer (thistle) seeds, and peanuts in separate feeders. When using blends, choose mixtures containing sunflower seeds, millet, and cracked corn—the three most popular types of birdseed. Birds that are sunflower specialists will readily eat the sunflower seed and toss the millet and corn to the ground, to be eaten by ground-feeding birds such as sparrows and juncos. Mixtures of peanuts, nuts, and dried fruit attract woodpeckers, nuthatches, and titmice. A relatively few species prefer milo, wheat, and oats, which are featured in less expensive blends.\n3) Provide suet during cool weather only\nSuet (beef fat) attracts insect-eating birds such as woodpeckers, wrens, chickadees, nuthatches, and titmice. Place the suet in special feeders or net onion bags at least five feet from the ground to keep it out of the reach of dogs. Do not put out suet during hot weather as it can turn rancid; also, dripping fat can damage natural waterproofing on bird feathers.\n4) Mix peanut butter and corn meal\nPeanut butter is a good substitute for suet in the summer. Mix one part peanut butter with five parts corn meal and stuff the mixture into holes drilled in a hanging log or into the crevices of a large pinecone. This all-season mixture attracts woodpeckers, chickadees, titmice, and occasionally warblers.\n5) Provide fruit for berry-eating birds\nFruit specialists such as robins, waxwings, bluebirds, and mockingbirds rarely eat birdseed. To attract these birds, soak raisins and currants in water overnight, then place them on a table feeder, or purchase blends with a dried fruit mixture. To attract orioles and tanagers, skewer halved oranges onto a spike near other feeders, or supply nectar feeders.\n6) Provide nectar for hummingbirds\nMake a sugar solution of one part white sugar to four parts water. Boil briefly to sterilize and dissolve sugar crystals; no need to add red food coloring. Feeders must be washed every few days with very hot water and kept scrupulously clean to prevent the growth of mold.\n7) Store seed in secure metal containers\nStore seed in metal garbage cans with secure lids to protect it from squirrels and mice. Keep the cans in a cool, dry location; avoid storing in the heat. Damp seeds may grow mold that can be fatal to birds. Overheating can destroy the nutrition and taste of sunflower seeds. For these reasons, it’s best not to keep seed from one winter to the next.\n8) Discourage squirrels from consuming feeder foods\nSquirrels are best excluded by placing feeders on a pole in an open area. Pole-mounted feeders should be about five feet off the ground and protected by a cone-shaped baffle (at least 17 inches diameter) or similar obstacle below the feeder. Locate pole-mounted feeders at least 10 feet from the nearest shrub, tree, or other tall structure. Squirrel feeders stocked with blends that are especially attractive to squirrels and chipmunks can reduce competition for high-priced foods offered at bird feeders. Place squirrel feeders far from bird feeders to further reduce competition.\n9) Locate feeders to reduce window collisions\nIn the United States, approximately one billion birds die each year from flying into windows. Protect birds from collisions by placing feeders within three feet of windows, if possible. Mobiles and opaque decorations hanging outside windows also help to prevent bird strikes. Or attach fruit tree netting outside windows to deflect birds from the glass.\n10) Keep cats indoors\nCats kill hundreds of millions of birds annually in the United States, often pouncing on ground-feeding birds and those dazed by window collisions. Responsible and caring cat owners keep their cats indoors, where they are also safer from traffic, disease, and fights with other animals. Outdoor cats are especially dangerous to birds in the spring when fledglings are on the ground. Bells on cat collars are usually ineffective for deterring predation.\n11) Clean feeders and rake up spilled grain and hulls\nUneaten seed can become soggy and grow deadly mold. Empty and clean feeders twice a year (spring and fall), or more often if feeders are used during humid summers. Using a long-handled bottlebrush, scrub with dish detergent and rinse with a powerful hose; then soak in a bucket of 10 percent non-chlorine bleach solution, rinse well, and dry in the sun. In early spring, rake up spilled grain and sunflower hulls.', 'You’re right to want to prevent the sad occurrence of birds flying into windows. That sudden “thump” you hear when a bird mistakenly flies into the glass is not just a sad situation for that one bird. In fact, that startling “bird hitting window” sound is heard in homes and buildings everywhere, and these collisions are taking a terrible toll on birds. Daniel Klem, a researcher who has been studying the problem of birds hitting windows for decades, estimates 1-10 birds for every building in the U.S. die each year from such collisions. As you might imagine, that adds up to a huge number of bird deaths per year—from 100 million to 1 billion. Birds of over 220 different species are known to have been victims, including some that are already at risk. Please read on—you’ll learn about many options for making sure your home’s windows are less likely to be part of this problem.\nLook at it from a bird’s perspective…\nFor birds, a transparent window looks like a clear path to fly through, and a reflective window simply looks like the sky and trees it reflects. Their eyes simply do not “read” glass as an obstacle the way our eyes do. What to do? You can alter the transparency or reflectiveness of your windows. You can also make adjustments to things inside and outside your home. And, you can make design changes to existing windows or opt for bird-friendly window designs when building a new home.\nAdjusting things outside…\nNot all of these solutions will be appropriate for every window, but among them, you will likely find options that will work for the variety of circumstances that you have:\n- Move birdfeeders and birdbaths either closer to your house or farther away. If they are closer than 3 feet to your house, birds won’t be flying as fast, and are less likely to get seriously hurt if they do hit the window. If they are more than 30 feet from your home, birds will have a clearer sense of your windows being a part of your home and will avoid them.\n- Apply CollidEscape® film to the outside of your windows—you’ll be able to see from the inside out, but birds will see the window as opaque from the outside.\n- Attach window screening or light netting a few inches from the windows. This layer will soften the impact if a bird accidentally flies into the window.\n- Add outdoor shades or awnings to minimize reflections.\n- Apply decals to the outside of the windows, leaving spaces between them no larger than 4” wide by 2” high.\n- Apply soap or tempera paint (which can be washed off with a sponge, but won’t come off in the rain) to create stenciled patterns on windows.\n- Hang wind chimes in front of windows.\n- Attach tape strips to the outside of windows. Place them four inches apart if vertical and white, or one inch apart if horizontal and black.\n- Basement, shed, or other outbuilding windows can be whitewashed with a mixture of pickling lime and water.\nAdjusting things inside…\n- If you don’t need light in certain rooms, keep the shades or curtains closed.\n- Keep vertical blinds turned halfway, or close them if you don’t need the light.\n- At night, close blinds or window shades if you have lights on in a room.\n- Move indoor plants and trees back from windows, so birds won’t perceive them as an extension of the outdoor habitat.\nChoosing bird-friendly window designs…\nWhether you’re planning to replace windows in your current home or planning to build a new home, there are several window design approaches that are beautiful and functional for you, while also safe for birds.\n- Windows can be installed at a 20-degree angle, so they do not create the reflections of sky and trees that confuse birds.\n- Glass can be made to reflect UV light. Ornilux® is an example of this type of glass.\n- Glass can be fritted, meaning opaque glass dots are fused to its surface, making it visible to birds, while not interfering with your ability to see out.\n- Glass can be etched or sand blasted with a pattern that leaves no spaces larger than 4” wide by 2” high.\nHelping a bird who has hit a window…\nWhen you hear that sudden “thump” against your window and know you have a bird hitting window situation, check on the bird as soon as possible. The bird’s injuries from the impact may clearly have been fatal. But sometimes, the bird may simply be stunned from the impact. If there is no obvious injury but the bird is motionless, you want to protect her from potential predators until she recovers.\n- Find a small box or bag and make some air holes in it.\n- Get a soft, smooth cloth (not terrycloth) and gently pick the bird up and place her into the box or bag.\n- Put the box or bag somewhere quiet, warm, and dark while you wait for the bird to recover. Carefully check on the bird every 30 minutes, without touching her.\n- If the bird recovers, bring the box or bag outside and open it so she can fly free.\n- If the bird doesn’t recover within 2 hours (or recovers but seems unable to fly), bring her to a licensed wildlife rehabilitator for examination and care.']	['<urn:uuid:e826e9b7-1f1c-42c3-93fc-eb46fa1388b7>', '<urn:uuid:31c81120-b740-4922-a594-ac6d1e068ae8>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	5	90	1737
52	compare how copyright laws affected music industry and 3d printing industry development	In both the music industry and 3D printing industry, copyright laws have created similar challenges but with different implications. In the music industry, the issue was primarily about peer-to-peer sharing sites like Napster. With 3D printing, the copyright challenge is more complex because it involves not only the sharing of digital files but also the additional step of physically printing potentially copyrighted designs, creating multiple layers of possible copyright infringement. The 3D printing industry faces additional patent-related challenges, with over 13,000 patent applications filed in the past decade, making it increasingly difficult for new startups to enter the industry. Unlike the music industry where copyright mainly concerns the creative work itself, 3D printing involves both copyright issues for designs and patent issues for the printing technology, making the intellectual property landscape more complicated.	['3D printing: Patents could make it difficult for start-ups to enter the industry\nThe more people get involved in 3D printing, the faster this technology can become as common as 2D printers. But as always, IP law cannot keep pace with these new technologies. To help companies tackle this challenge, Christopher Higgins, Managing Associate at the global law firm Orrick, has developed a special expertise in in 3D printing and additive manufacturing technologies.\nIt seems as though every week a new 3D startup company is formed or a new project on Kickstarter has been launched. The more people get involved in 3D printing, the faster this technology can become as common as 2D printers. But as always, IP law cannot keep pace with these new technologies. To help companies tackle this challenge, Christopher Higgins, Managing Associate at the global law firm Orrick, has developed a special expertise in in 3D printing and additive manufacturing technologies.\nWhen and why did you realize 3D printing was an interesting area to focus on?\nIn late 2012, I read several articles on patents in 3D printing and realized that these articles were giving people incorrect advice on expiring 3D printing patents. I had been closely following 3D printing technology, but when I saw the chance to incorporate 3D printing into my legal work I jumped at the opportunity. Much of the presentations I give on 3D printing are focused on educating the public, potential investors, and those already in the 3D printing industry of how patents affect 3D printing. For example, simply because one patent expires related to a specific type of 3D printing technology, does not mean that everyone can then go out and build their own 3D printer.\nHow does your background in law and engineering prepare you for the challenges in this new field?\nI have an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering, which allows me to understand 3D printing technology at a very in-depth level. Coupled with my law degree, I am able to recognize and anticipate where patents and 3D printing technology may intersect. This allows me to counsel clients on best strategies to both grow a 3D printing patent portfolio and lessen the risk of being sued for patent infringement.\nWhere do you see the biggest challenges regarding 3D printing and IP law?\nIP laws have typically lagged behind new technologies, leaving the courts to fashion old laws to situations that were not envisioned when they were created. For example, the repair and reconstruction doctrine of patent law clearly did not contemplate that consumers would be able to cheaply and easily 3D print replacement parts for a variety of components. In copyright law, many internet 3D printing companies permit a consumer to upload a 3D printing make file and have it printed. Without proper safeguards on the end of the printers, they could run into copyright infringement issues if the design is subject to a copyright.\nHow do these challenges compare to past and current IP issues such as we have seen in the music industry?\nThe copyright issue is quite similar to Napster and the fight between the music industry and peer to peer sharing sites. However, 3D printing adds an additional twist. Not only are 3D printing make files widely available for download, but there is the additional step of actually printing the potentially copyrighted design. Thus, there could be multiple layers of copyright infringement if consumers and companies are not vigilant.\nWhat do companies have to do to meet these challenges? Where do you currently see potentially dangerous blind spots?\nAny technology company should be aware of changes to IP laws and changes in technology that could implicate old laws. 3D printing is no different. A typical 3D printer could be covered by hundreds of patents, from the filament, to the printer heads, platform, and circuitry. In addition to the hardware, the associated software could also be covered by many patents. We often see newer technologies run into issues with patents directed to software that have nothing to do with the newer technology at issue. This typically arises in cases brought by non-practicing entities (“patent trolls”). These entities buy patents that are broad in coverage and then attempt to read the claims on a multitude of technologies that were not even within the scope of the invention. It is rather difficult to predict if and when patent trolls will enter the 3D printing landscape, but we think as the industry grows we will begin to see suits against some of the larger companies.\nSome people argue that the attempts to reduce counterfeit goods have not been very successful so far and that 3D printing will make this practice virtually impossible to eliminate. What do you think?\nBecause of the high cost to 3D print an object, I do not think counterfeiting is an area of concern. There are still much cheaper ways to produce counterfeit goods than with a 3D printer.\nAre legislators also required to make changes to adjust to the new realities (regarding patents, for example)?\nThe legislature constantly proposes reforms to US patent laws, but rarely does anything come to fruition. When it does, however, such as with the America Invents Act in 2011, it is not typically directed to a specific technology area. The patent laws are meant to have broad applications and it is the courts that are in the best position to address nuances that arise due to new technology. A great example of this is the recent decision by the US Supreme Court in the Aereo case. Aereo had a novel idea of distributing television stations to consumers by rebroadcasting televisions shows over the internet and was sued by cable companies for copyright infringement. Aereo argued that because it distributed the program over an individual antenna for each customer, it had the right to do so. The Supreme Court found that Aereo’s system was still a public performance and its arrangement did not skirt the copyright laws.\nHow will the regional differences between Europe, the US and Asia regarding IP law affect the future of commercial 3D printing?\nThe differences between the US, European, and Asian patent regimes are not new to 3D printing. Global companies should be informed of key differences in patent and copyright laws before selling 3D printers or 3D printed end products in multiple countries. This typically begins with an opinion by competent counsel in the respective country to evaluate the proposed product or service under the applicable law.\nWhat are the greatest misunderstandings about 3D printing and expiring patents or other issues in IP law?\nExpiring 3D printing patents are typically the topic of a majority of questions I get asked. Many articles have posited that because a seminal patent in a particular 3D printing technology (e.g., selective laser sintering) the field is open for all to enter. But that could not be further from the truth. These expiring patents cover technology that is at least 20 years old. In the past 20 years, thousands of patents have issued that cover “improvements” on the basis technology. Therefore, unless one wanted to use only the 20-year old technology in the original expired patents, there is a significant chance that one or more patents cover basic improvements to the original technology.\nWhat fascinates you most about the field?\nThe staggering rate at which the field is growing and expected to grow is most fascinating. It seems as though every week a new startup company is formed or a new project on Kickstarter has been launched. The more people get involved in 3D printing, the faster this technology can become mainstream and as common as 2D printers.\nHow do you think the 3D printing and IP law will evolve in the future?\nAccording to the US Patent Office, the number of patent applications related to 3D printing has continued to rise each year. There have been over 13,000 patent applications filed in the past decade that attempt to capture some aspect of 3D printing. This number will continue to grow in the next few years and the technology will get more crowded. While I do not think it will reach the high level of patents in the smartphone industry, the number of issued 3D printing patents will be quite robust and make it more difficult for new startups to enter the industry down the road.', 'Copyleft and copyright\nTime to examine the debates about the ownership of intellectual property\nDesigners increasingly see the question of copyright and intellectual property as an important issue. More and more, they are concerned about being ‘ripped off’, and are told that establishing copyright is essential. But there is little understanding of what copyright is, how it works, whom it benefits or what alternatives there are. This Agenda hopes to raise awareness of the issues surrounding copyright and to empower the designer to make informed choices about how to use copyright and its alternative: copyleft.\nA new book, Free Culture by Lawrence Lessig, a professor of law, raises important questions about the ownership of ideas and expressions. These draw on the example of open-source software, e.g. Linux, a free and freely available computer operating system that is now challenging Microsoft Windows. A diverse range of thinkers, designers, musicians, artists and activists have been questioning the way in which copyright is being transformed into a tool that benefits corporations rather than the artists and authors for whom it was originally intended. These discussions have also led to exciting changes in the way that some creators are allowing others to use and re-use their work. This sharing of ideas, knowledge and designs can be revolutionary for designers who, often without realising it, are drawing on the inspiration of those that have gone before. By allowing others to use their work, collaborations, critique and collective projects that were previously difficult to achieve can now take place.\nIt is crucial that designers within the creative industries equip themselves with the necessary knowledge to participate in discussions about free culture. Some of the arguments may appear technical, dull, irrelevant and even trivial, but, if we do not develop an understanding of the issues involved, how can we be part of a public debate that is important for our profession?\nThe right to copy\nPrinting was one of the most significant technical advances in history, transforming the spread of knowledge. Gutenberg’s development of movable type revolutionised the process of book production. Up until this point, the method of copying a work (e.g. scribed by hand) was only possible through a large investment of materials and physical labour. With the ability to reproduce large quantities of texts, but with no control over who did it, publishers soon began to worry about others reprinting their books. The British Statute of Anne in 1710 was the first modern concept of copyright that accorded exclusive rights to authors and their publishers. The duration was limited to 28 years – once that period ended, the work would pass into the public domain. Previously, governments in Europe had granted monopoly rights to publishers mainly to be able to censor books by licensing who had the right to print books. It was also assumed that the publishers owned printed works in perpetuity – a source of constant complaint by Enlightenment philosophers concerned about the restrictions on the flow of knowledge and the temptation of book publishers to set their prices as high as possible.\nEssentially, copyright is a monopoly, a bundle of rights that applies to the ‘expression’ of an idea. It establishes the author as the creator of an intellectual work and creates exclusive legal rights for the author to control duplication, performance, or distribution of their creative works. So, for example, the writer of a book who transforms an idea of a novel into a written manuscript will find that copyright protects his manuscript but not his ‘idea’ or plot. Similarly, for a designer, the actual artwork itself would be protected under copyright and he would have the rights over its use. Copyright is one of a number of intellectual property rights, such as patents, trademarks and design rights, that allow the creator to exploit the work by licensing others to use it. The moment a work is created, it automatically becomes copyrighted. Examples of works include literary pieces, drawings, paintings, photographs, film, music and sound recordings and, more recently, computer software programs.\nMany people confuse copyright with physical property. Although it is referred to as an intellectual property right, it is not actually property in the same sense as the ownership of a house or car. This is because essentially copyright is a right to copy the expression of an idea rather than an unlimited property right – a copy-right. The reason for the distinction between copyright and property rights in general is that after the initial effort has been put into producing a piece of artwork or a manuscript it can be infinitely reproduced at little or no extra cost. This is very different to physical property, which will slowly wear out. Additionally, if, say, I give you a copy of the artwork, it does not diminish my own use of it – we can all have a copy without anybody losing out. Again, contrasted with physical property, if I own a car, only I can drive it, since only one person at a time can use that car.\nWhen copyright expires\nOnce the period of copyright ends, the work enters the public domain and becomes freely available for anyone to use and draw ideas from. The public domain is an increasingly valuable, but little appreciated, source of inspiration and material. Folk music and blues are perhaps the most obvious sources of creativity that unashamedly reuse old songs in new ways. The musicians in these fields seldom gave much thought to ‘locking up’ their works and restricting their reproduction. Today, however, things have changed. And as music has become a vast industry, so the values of the ownership of songs and recordings themselves have changed. This change in mentality has occurred wherever creativity has taken place in capitalist society; art, music and design are seen more and more in terms of their monetary value alone. Consequently, lobbyists have fought to extend copyright terms upwards from the initial 28 years.\nThe current term for copyright in the UK and the US is now 70 years after the death of the owner. Copyright can only be extended by changes in the law, often to abide by an international agreement, such as those developed through the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) – for example the WIPO Copyright Treaty 1996 which extended copyright to computer programs.\nNew technologies and new ways of using information are continually being developed, and these serve to question our assumptions about copyright and creativity. The current criminalisation of piracy, data ‘theft’ and hacking are the latest salvos from industries trying to restrict the flow and use of their creative work. It is interesting to note that the owners of these creative works are seldom the creators, and pressure for the extension and strengthening of copyright comes almost exclusively from the multinational corporations.\nThe origins of open-source and copyleft licenses can be traced back to the 1970s. An American software developer, Richard M. Stallman – who felt strongly that the sharing of source-code, development ideas and algorithms was fundamental to the software-development process – developed a ‘free’ version of the widely used Unix operating system. The Gnu(Gnu’s Not Unix) software was released under a specially created General Public License (GPL). This was designed to ensure that the source-code would remain open and freely available to facilitate the sharing of ideas and improvements. It was not intended to prevent commercial usage or distribution. This has led to the development of probably the most successful copyleft project, Linux, which is now considered by many to be superior to Microsoft Windows. Another example is Wikipedia, an online collective encyclopaedia that is created by the activities of millions of writers and editors freely contributing their time and energy to the project. This is licensed under the Gnu GPL and allows the free reuse, copying or distribution of text in the project, providing that the reuse is also similarly licensed.\nThese projects have inspired the US-based Creative Commons, an organisation that is putting into practice some of the ideas generated by Lawrence Lessig and others. Creative Commons provides an ecology of copy licenses, from public domain licenses to sampling licenses, all intended to encourage creative freedom. Lawrence Lessig writes widely on what he believes to be a headlong rush into privatising the public domain and thereby reducing the stock of raw materials that we all use in our creative projects. Clearly, if using a work becomes more difficult or, more likely, more expensive, then it will be increasingly difficult for those outside the corporations to create new and innovative work. However, releasing work under a Creative Commons license is not the same as giving it away. Instead it licenses ‘reuse’ under terms that you, as the creator, specify in your selection of a license.\nThe notion of scarcity\nScarcity is critical to the operation of markets, and property law has been shaped by, and indeed can function only due to, the fact that exclusive use is a hallmark of physical property. This allows markets to base their operations on the exchange of limited amounts of goods and price accordingly. However, as we move into the so-called Information Society, it becomes apparent that intellectual property does not operate in the same way as physical property. In fact the idea of scarcity, or the fact that information can have only one owner, does not apply. A design on a computer may be copied infinitely – many of us may work on the design separately or together, with no loss to anyone. Without scarcity or ‘wearing out’, it becomes impossible for the market to function.\nConsequently, the companies who wish to sell us information see copyright as a means for constricting the flow and thereby increasing the scarcity. But it is an artificial scarcity and is only held in place through the operation of copyright law. And copyright law was never intended to operate as a restriction on the flow of knowledge indefinitely. Copyright was a bargain between the creators or authors of a work and the public, not only to provide some limited recompense to the creator, but also to increase the amount of knowledge, music and art in our society for the benefit of all. It is therefore clear that copyright is being misdirected from its original intention to that of meeting the needs of corporations desperate to safeguard existing profits and create new markets artificially. If this continues, to the detriment of our ability to find and use knowledge and information and to debate and deliberate over it, there could be dire consequences for both democracy and creativity.\nThe potential for collaboration\nCopyleft allows you to license a design in such a way that its use results in a transformation in the way others can use it. It opens up a space of freedom and creativity for others to draw and build on your work, and for you to do likewise with theirs. This could have the potential to produce far-reaching consequences for collaboration and creativity. Some examples include SchNEWS, BBC Creative Archive, Archive.org, Loca Records, Wikipedia, Indymedia and many others across the Internet. If, as designers, we form a genuinely imaginative and creative industry, we should engage this potential and use our collective knowledge and skills to produce work that has real social benefits. Using the opportunity to use Creative Commons or copyleft licensing is about working with others, sharing ideas and knowledge and contributing to the pool of culture and creativity.\nMany of us have already used things from the public domain, maybe it is about time we put something back.']	['<urn:uuid:b6efde69-6bca-49a2-abd7-b24d978c169b>', '<urn:uuid:4b818780-e7fe-4765-a920-1e49ad340840>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	12	133	3327
53	I've heard that living together makes it harder to break up - why would that be a problem before getting married?	This concept is known as the inertia effect - sharing a residence makes it harder to end a relationship, regardless of the level of dedication to a future together. This can be problematic because couples may find themselves 'sliding' into marriage due to the constraints of living together, rather than making a clear decision about their commitment first. Research shows that couples who only started living together after being committed to marriage (such as after engagement) tend to do better in marriage than those who may have prematurely made it harder to break up by living together before agreeing on marriage.	['Living Together Before Marriage May Raise Risk of Divorce\nIs living together before marriage associated with risk in marriage or not?\nPosted Nov 03, 2018\nby Scott M. Stanley and Galena K. Rhoades\nOne of the most perplexing findings in the history of the study of marriage is that living together beforehand is associated with greater, not lesser, odds of struggling in marriage. This association had been clear in study after study up to around 2007, and then a number of studies and social scientists declared that the association between living together before marriage and difficulties in marriage had disappeared.\nTo be clear, we never thought the association had disappeared. While we believe the association got weaker, we have long believed that the understanding of it mostly became better understood. For example, we predicted and found — repeatedly, and in numerous samples — that an important part of the story had to do with whether or not a couple started living together before or after having come to a clear commitment to marry. Those who cohabited only after engagement (or marriage, of course) have an edge in odds for doing well in marriage compared to those who started living together before clarifying the big question about the future. We will explain that more below.\nAmong some scholars in family science, the belief had been settled that there simply is no risk for worse outcomes in marriage associated with living together beforehand. Well, that no-risk story just received a jolt. A new study published in the Journal of Marriage and Family finds that the “premarital cohabitation effect” lives on, despite earlier claims to the contrary. The premarital cohabitation effect is what this is all about: the finding (over many studies, over decades of time) that those who live together prior to marriage are more likely, not less, to struggle in marriage. Here, we are going to take you through a fairly deep dive into what the hubbub is all about.\nThe new study is by Michael Rosenfeld and Katharina Roesler. Their findings suggest that there remains an increased risk for divorce for those living together prior to marriage and that prior studies suggesting the effect went away had a bias toward analyzing shorter versus longer-term effects. They found that living together before marriage was associated with lower odds of divorce in the first year of marriage, but increased odds of divorce in all other years tested, and this finding held across decades of data.\nNumerous Recent Studies Reported No Impact of Premarital Cohabitation\nA number of relatively recent studies suggested that the premarital cohabitation effect had gone away for those marrying in the past 10 or 15 years. Rosenfeld and Roesler pay particular attention to a report from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) by Copen, Daniels, Vespa, and Mosher in 2012, which suggested there was no increased risk associated with premarital cohabitation in the most recent (at the time) cohort of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG; 2006-2010). The NSFG is a large, ongoing sampling of those living in the U.S. with regard to many aspects of family formation, cohabitation, and marriage. Other researchers, such as Manning and Cohen, reached the same conclusion as the authors of the NCHS in 2012, incorporating data from as late as the 2006 to 2008 cohort of the NSFG.[i]\nWhile all of these studies used the same large sampling effort, Rosenfeld and Roesler had longer-term data for the most recent cohort they studied (up to 2015). Contrary to these prior conclusions, they found that there remains a clear link between premarital cohabitation and increased odds of divorce regardless of the year or cohort studied. (In all these studies, the focus is on first marriages.)\nMany experts believed that the cohabitation effect, well understood since the 1980s, would go away as living together became more the thing to do — that it would no longer be associated with negative outcomes in marriage. This hypothesis is based on the idea that the prior stigma among friends and family about living together before marriage was a cause of the increased risk. And, clearly, there is not much, if any, stigma now. (We wrote about trends in cohabitation in the U.S. in great detail here earlier this year.) The other reason for expecting the cohabitation effect to go away is a little more arcane, having to do with the fact that as it became common (at least 70 percent of couples live together before marriage now), those who chose to do so are no longer more select for being at greater risk than others.\nBased on a different line of reasoning than the other studies suggesting no risk, another prominent study had also concluded that there was no longer an added risk for divorce associated with premarital cohabitation. However, in that study, Kuperberg (2014) concluded the risk was more about moving in together at a young age (before the middle 20s) than moving in together before marriage, per se. That’s one among many potentially important nuances in this complex literature.[ii]\nPumping the Brakes on the Conclusions of No Added Risk\nCohabitation is the gift that keeps on giving to family science, providing generations of scholars with the opportunity to say, “Look here, wow, this is strange.” And people remain interested. We have seen major stories on cohabitation break across the media for over 20 years because it’s interesting. In fact, here is a recent story in The Atlantic about this very thing, and it includes numerous quotes from the second author here, Galena Rhoades, based on our work. We think this subject keeps getting lots of ink because the findings have tended to be so counterintuitive. Most people believe that living together before marriage should improve the odds of doing well in marriage. However, whatever else is true, there is very scant evidence to support this belief in a positive effect (more on that can be found in this piece).\nBy the way, we’re not trying to change your views of whether or not a couple should live together before marriage. Our own views are complex and nuanced. However, we may convince you that there is something to learn from the research that bears on what pathways may be wiser than others for the average person. So, let’s get back to the new study that is getting a lot of buzz.\nRosenfeld and Roesler’s study is quite complex statistically, but their insight boils down to two things easily explained. First, they believe studies that suggested that the premarital cohabitation effect has disappeared simply did not have outcomes for divorce far enough out for those who had married in the recent cohorts that they examined. Second, they show that premarital cohabitation is associated with a lower risk for divorce, but only very early in marriage (in the first year); in contrast, the finding flips, with premarital cohabitation being associated with higher risks for divorce in years after that first year. That’s what earlier studies could not address.\nIn particular, Rosenfeld and Roesler suggest that those who live together before marriage have an advantage in the first year because they are already used to all the changes that come with living together. Those who go straight into marriage without living together have a bigger immediate shock to negotiate after marriage, and as a result, have a short-term increased risk that’s greater than those already living together. But that’s the short term, and the risk remains long term.\nHere is a quote from the new paper (Figure 2 below is included here with permission):\nFigure 2 shows that, for the years in which the NSFG has substantial numbers of marriages and breakups, there was no apparent trend over time in the raw or adjusted odds ratios of breakup for premarital cohabitation. Given the enormous changes over time in the prevalence of premarital cohabitation (see Figure 1), Figure 2 shows a surprising stability in the association between premarital cohabitation and marital dissolution over time. (Pgs 7-8)\nTheories of Increased Risk\nThere are three main theories for how living together before marriage could be causally associated with worse outcomes (on average) in marriage. Rosenfeld and Roesler address the first two but did not say anything about the third.[iii]\n1. Selection — This theory is simply that there are many factors associated with who cohabits when and why, and with whom, and that those factors are also associated with how marriages will turn out regardless of cohabiting experience. For example, it’s well known that those who are more economically disadvantaged are more likely: to live together outside of marriage, to live together with more than one partner, to have a child with a cohabiting partner prior to marrying, and to struggle in marriage. Other factors are religiousness, traditionality, and family history (parental divorce, etc.). The selection explanation is that those who cohabit in riskier ways (e.g., before marriage, before engagement, with more than one partner) were already at greater risk. In the strongest view of selection, living together does not add to the risk at all, because it’s all already baked in. There is a lot of evidence for selection playing an important role in this literature, and scholars in this area note this and address it in various ways.\n2. The Experience of Cohabiting Changes Things — In an older line of research that was clever, but needs to be tested again with those marrying in more recent years, Axinn and Barber (1997) showed that cohabiting changes attitudes about marriage and divorce, lowering esteem for marriage and increasing acceptance of divorce. This is consistent with scores of studies in psychology showing that attitudes will cohere to behavior. In other words, you will bring your beliefs around to fit your behavior. Earlier, Thornton, Axinn, and Hill (1992) showed that cohabiting led to people becoming less religious. Rosenfeld and Roesler included a lot on the theory of experience but mostly use it to emphasize the short-term benefit of already experiencing living together when transitioning into marriage.\n3. Inertia — We have argued since the early 2000s for another causal theory in this line of research. Drawing on theories of commitment, we suggested that what nearly everyone misses in understanding the risk associated with cohabitation is pretty simple: Moving in together makes it harder to break up, net of everything else. The added risk is due to how cohabitation substantially increases constraints to remain together prior to a dedication to a future together maturing between two partners. Two key papers on this perspective are here and here.[iv]\nOne primary prediction from the inertia hypothesis is that those who only started living together after being already committed to marriage (e.g., by engagement or actual marriage) should, on average, do better in marriage than those who may have prematurely made it harder to break up by living together before agreeing on marriage. The inertia hypothesis completely embraces selection, suggesting that relationships already at greater risk become harder to exit because of cohabitation. Various predictions from the inertia hypothesis have been supported in ten or more studies, seven of which include tests of the prediction about pre-cohabitation level of commitment to marriage (aka plans for marriage prior to living together) — and this latter finding exists in at least six different samples across a range of outcomes.[v]\nThere is no particular reason to expect that the inertia risk will dissipate with increased acceptance of cohabitation, because the mechanism is about the timing of the development of aspects of commitment, not about societal views and personal attitudes. For living together to lower risk in marriage, the benefit of learning something disqualifying about a partner has to exceed the costs of making it harder to break up that come with sharing a single address. Hence, inertia is another possibility, along with experience, that could explain the persistence of a cohabitation effect, such as that found by Rosenfeld and Roesler.[vi]\nOther Possibilities — Other factors that may be associated with differential outcomes include pacing (Sassler et al.), age at the time of moving in together (Kuperberg), and having children before marriage (Tach & Halpern-Meekin). All such theories suggest that the risks of living together before marriage are greater for some people than others. Rosenfeld and Roesler are not really addressing this issue. However, they did find that the risks associated with premarital cohabitation were lower for African Americans. While that’s a subject far beyond our focus here, it does not surprise us. For most groups, cohabitation is no particular indicator of higher commitment. However, it may well signal higher levels of commitment among groups where marriage has declined a great deal, like African Americans.\nRosenfeld and Roesler also note that the risks of living together before marriage were even greater among those who had lived with more than just their mate prior to marriage. That finding is consistent with many other studies: for example, Teachman (2003).\nThe Effect and the Controversy Lives\nResearch on premarital cohabitation has long been mired in arguments about causality, with the dominant view being that what we describe about selection explains most, if not all, of the added risk when found. However, many studies in the history of this field have controlled for all sorts of variables associated with selection and still found an additional risk. In fairness, it is not possible to control for all aspects of selection in such studies. Without randomly assigning people to walk different pathways before marriage, causality can never be proven. And we think it’s going to be a long time before researchers are allowed to flip a coin about who does what in their love lives so that we can study the phenomena better. Oh, how great that would be, though, for figuring things out. Since we have to live with studying what people end up doing on their own, arguments ensue. Besides, since when does evidence stop arguing anyway when people are passionate about their view on something?\nRosenfeld and Roesler’s new study breathed life into a finding many concluded was dead. Perhaps it was just mostly dead.\nScott M. Stanley and Galena K. Rhoades are research professors in the department of psychology at the University of Denver. A different version of this article appeared on the blog for the Institute of Family Studies on October 17, 2018.\n[i] We are mystified why the new paper does not cite or address the findings by Manning and Cohen. That study seems like it is the most recent major study directly addressing the question Rosenfeld and Roesler examine.\n[ii] Scott wrote about the Kuperberg study at that time, taking far more issue with the media stories about it than the actual study, suggesting there are many ways people could misconstrue to whom those, and other findings of differential risk, applied. Those articles are here and here.\n[iii] This omission does not seem as striking to us as the omission of Manning and Cohen’s paper, since their paper is already complex and they are intent on addressing one moderator of the cohabitation effect: how long after marriage the effect is measured. They do not address at all the growing literature on moderators of the cohabitation effect. Still, inertia is one of the major theories of increased risk, and only selection itself has more publications addressing it.\n[iv] An accessible, word document version of the major theory paper can be found here. A full run down of our theoretical and empirical work in this line is available here. That includes citations and links, mostly to accessible versions of the articles in the literature.\n[v] We have found evidence for inertia whether or not someone has cohabited only with their mate, and in numerous samples of people marrying after 2000 and later.\n[vi] As an interesting side point on the subject of the inertia hypothesis, the commitment to marriage/timing effect exists in the NSFG. It was mentioned in passing in a working paper leading up to the 2010 publication by Reinhold, and it is mentioned prominently in the abstract (and paper) in Manning and Cohen’s 2012 publication.']	['<urn:uuid:3c8c01ef-e512-45c5-b048-5f176511ced3>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	21	101	2685

The German police attempted to stop the terrorists through an ambush with sniper fire, but the crisis ended in a massacre with both terrorists and hostages being killed. This devastating event highlighted Germany's unpreparedness for terrorism threats, leading to the creation of GSG-9, a counter-terrorism unit commanded by Colonel Ulrich Wegener. The Olympics had originally been intended to showcase the New Germany and replace memories of the Third Reich, but these hopes were shattered by the attack that claimed 11 Israeli team members' lives.	"['Browse Results For:\nA Russian Jewish Writer at the Eastern Front\nS. An-sky was by the time of the First World War a well-known writer, a longtime revolutionary, and an ethnographer who pioneered the collection of Jewish folklore in Russia\'s Pale of Settlement. In 1915, An-sky took on the assignment of providing aid and relief to Jewish civilians trapped under Russian military occupation in Galicia. As he made his way through the shtetls there, close to the Austrian frontlines, he kept a diary of his encounters and impressions, written in Russian. His diary entries present a detailed reflection of his daily experiences. He describes conversations with wounded soldiers in hospitals, fellow Russian and Jewish aid workers, Russian military and civilian authorities, and Jewish civilians in Galicia and parts of the Pale. Although most of his diaries were lost, two fragments survived and are preserved in the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art. Translated and annotated here by Polly Zavadivker, these fragments convey An-sky\'s vivid firsthand descriptions of civilian and military life in wartime. He recorded the brutality and violence against the civilian population, the complexities of interethnic relations, the practices and limitations of philanthropy and medical care, Russification policies, and antisemitism. In the late 1910s, An-sky used his diaries as raw material for a lengthy memoir in Yiddish published under the title The Destruction of Galicia.\nA compelling and entertaining account of the year that represents the apex of 1920s American culture. Shatters the stereotype of the Roaring Twenties as a time of frivolity and excess and reveals instead a society torn between holding on to its glorious past while trying to navigate a brave new world.\nJohnny Salo and the Great Footrace Across America\nOn March 31, 1929, seventy-seven men began an epic 3,554-mile footrace across America that pushed their bodies to the breaking point. Nicknamed the “Bunion Derby” by the press, this was the second and last of two trans-America footraces held in the late 1920s. The men averaged forty-six gut-busting miles a day during seventy-eight days of nonstop racing that took them from New York City to Los Angeles. Among this group, two brilliant runners, Johnny Salo of Passaic, New Jersey, and Pete Gavuzzi of England, emerged to battle for the $25,000 first prize along the mostly unpaved roads of 1929 America, with each man pushing the other to go faster as the lead switched back and forth between them. To pay the prize money, race director Charley Pyle cobbled together a traveling vaudeville company, complete with dancing debutantes, an all-girl band wearing pilot outfits, and blackface comedians, all housed under the massive show tent that Pyle hoped would pack in audiences. Kastner’s engrossing account, often told from the perspective of the participants, evokes the remarkable physical challenge the runners experienced and clearly bolsters the argument that the last Bunion Derby was the greatest long-distance footrace of all time.\nA Century of Progress\nChicago\'s 1933 world\'s fair set a new direction for international expositions. Earlier fairs had exhibited technological advances, but Chicago\'s fair organizers used the very idea of progress to buoy national optimism during the Depression\'s darkest years. Orchestrated by business leaders and engineers, almost all former military men, the fair reflected a business-military-engineering model that envisioned a promising future through science and technology\'s application to everyday life. But not everyone at Chicago\'s 1933 exposition had abandoned notions of progress that entailed social justice and equality, recognition of ethnicity and gender, and personal freedom and expression. The fair\'s motto, ""Science Finds, Industry Applies, Man Conforms,"" was challenged by iconoclasts such as Sally Rand, whose provocative fan dance became a persistent symbol of the fair, as well as a handful of others, including African Americans, ethnic populations and foreign nationals, groups of working women, and even well-heeled socialites. Cheryl R. Ganz offers the stories of fair planners and participants who showcased education, industry, and entertainment to sell optimism during the depths of the Great Depression. This engaging history also features eighty-six photographs--nearly half of which are full color--of key locations, exhibits, and people, as well as authentic ticket stubs, postcards, pamphlets, posters, and other items.\nHungarian and Canadian Perspectives\nIn October 1956, a spontaneous uprising took Hungarian Communist authorities by surprise, prompting Soviet authorities to invade the country. After a few days of violent fighting, the revolt was crushed. In the wake of the event, some 200,000 refugees left Hungary, 35,000 of whom made their way to Canada. This would be the first time Canada would accept so many refugees of a single origin, setting a precedent for later refugee initiatives. More than fifty years later, this collection focuses on the impact of the revolution in Hungary, in Canada, and around the world.\nChoice or Betrayal\nThe United Nations-organised plebiscite on 11 February 1961 was one of the most significant events in the history of the southern and northern parts of the British-administered trust territory in Cameroon. John Percival was sent by the then Colonial Office as part of the team to oversee the process. This book captures the story of the plebiscite in all its dimensions and intricacies and celebrates the author\'s admiration for things African through a series of reminiscences of what life was like in the 1960s, both for the Africans themselves and for John Percival as a very young man. The complex story is also a series of reflections about the effect of the modern world on Africa. It is a thorough, insightful, rich and enlightening first-hand source on a political landmark that has never been told before in this way. In a vivid style with a great sense of humour, Percival\'s witty, cogent, eyewitness and active-participant account deconstructs the rumours and misrepresentations about the February 1961 Plebiscite which was a prelude to reunification and to the present day politics of \'belonging\' in Cameroon. ""One of the major merits of this book is to provide us with a deeper insight into the role of those actors who have never been the subject of plebiscite studies, namely the Plebiscite Supervisory Officers."" - Piet Konings, African Studies Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands John Percival-Anthropologist, Writer, Television Broadcaster of many innovative BBC series on the environment, history and anthropology. As a young graduate he was recruited and sent to serve in the Southern Cameroons as a Plesbiscite Supervisory Officer in 1961. He died in 2005 after a recent return visit to Cameroon with Nigel Wenban-Smith who writes an epilogue. This posthumous memoir has been edited by his wife, Lalage Neal.\nA New Global History from Civil Rights to Economic Inequality\nThe 1970s looks at an iconic decade when the cultural left and economic right came to the fore in American society and the world at large. While many have seen the 1970s as simply a period of failures epitomized by Watergate, inflation, the oil crisis, global unrest, and disillusionment with military efforts in Vietnam, Thomas Borstelmann creates a new framework for understanding the period and its legacy. He demonstrates how the 1970s increased social inclusiveness and, at the same time, encouraged commitments to the free market and wariness of government. As a result, American culture and much of the rest of the world became more--and less--equal.\nBorstelmann explores how the 1970s forged the contours of contemporary America. Military, political, and economic crises undercut citizens\' confidence in government. Free market enthusiasm led to lower taxes, a volunteer army, individual 401(k) retirement plans, free agency in sports, deregulated airlines, and expansions in gambling and pornography. At the same time, the movement for civil rights grew, promoting changes for women, gays, immigrants, and the disabled. And developments were not limited to the United States. Many countries gave up colonial and racial hierarchies to develop a new formal commitment to human rights, while economic deregulation spread to other parts of the world, from Chile and the United Kingdom to China.\nPlacing a tempestuous political culture within a global perspective, The 1970s shows that the decade wrought irrevocable transformations upon American society and the broader world that continue to resonate today.\nSome images inside the book are unavailable due to digital copyright restrictions.\nThe 1972 Munich Olympics—remembered almost exclusively for the devastating terrorist attack on the Israeli team—were intended to showcase the New Germany and replace lingering memories of the Third Reich. That hope was all but obliterated in the early hours of September 5, when gun-wielding Palestinians murdered 11 members of the Israeli team. In the first cultural and political history of the Munich Olympics, Kay Schiller and Christopher Young set these Games into both the context of 1972 and the history of the modern Olympiad. Delving into newly available documents, Schiller and Young chronicle the impact of the Munich Games on West German society.\nThe Struggle to Create Post-Cold War Europe\n1989 explores the momentous events following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the effects they have had on our world ever since. Based on documents, interviews, and television broadcasts from Washington, London, Paris, Bonn, Berlin, Warsaw, Moscow, and a dozen other locations, 1989 describes how Germany unified, NATO expansion began, and Russia got left on the periphery of the new Europe.\nThis updated edition contains a new afterword with the most recent evidence on the 1990 origins of NATO’s post-Cold War expansion.', 'As the Cold War matured, the mission of Det A evolved, shifting gears to face a new threat that the Western World was unprepared for. In the early 1970’s there had been a rash of aircraft hijackings, many perpetrated by the Palestinian nationalists belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PLFP). The slowly escalating threat turned into a crucible for German authorities in 1972 when Palestinian terrorists belonging to a group calling themselves Black September took Israeli athletes hostage during the summer olympics in Munich. The German police attempted to bait the terrorists into an ambush, where they could be taken out by sniper fire without hurting the hostages, but the crisis ended in a massacre, with both terrorists and hostages slain.\nThe specter of international terrorism had reared its ugly head. The German federal police, wholly unprepared to deal with the threat, were tasked to create a counter-terrorism unit called GSG-9, commanded by Colonel Ulrich Wegener.\nThe Americans took a while longer to catch up but a few years later Detachment A was tasked with a new mission under OPLAN 0300: counter-terrorism. In addition to their stay behind mission, the Det A members now had to be prepared to carry out counter-terrorism operations. The main concern for the unit, was the hijacking of American Pan Am flights into and out of Berlin but Det A was also charged with protecting and capturing any other hijacked American aircraft in Europe. The Baader Meinhof gang also posed a threat in Det A’s area of operations, and one team from the unit was assigned the task of countering the communist terrorist organization, especially after they kidnapped the mayor of Berlin.\nDet A began cross training with GSG-9 in case they had to conduct joint operations, and had a friendly relationship that allowed them to share tactics, techniques, and procedures. Six members were sent to Quantico to attend the FBI’s air crimes course. The Special Forces soldiers also received additional weapons for their new mission such as scoped Model 70 Winchesters to use as sniper rifles and Walther MPK sub-machine guns. A military transport plane was placed on standby to ferry the Det A members within striking distance of targets they may be called upon to assault in the future.\nSince the main concern was a Pan Am aircraft being hijacked, the airliner allowed the Det A teams to practice taking down their aircraft but at various times they also trained to assault buses, trains, and buildings. Det A, “practiced techniques on entry into the airplane from any angle you can imagine,” Charest said. “We practiced on that plane day and night.” The unit’s newfound counter-terrorism capability would be put to the test years later, not in Europe, but in Iran during Operation Eagle Claw.\nAt 10:30AM on November 4th 1979, nearly 3,000 armed “university students” stormed the American embassy in Tehran, taking over 90 American hostages at the behest of the Ayatollah Khomeini. The students demanded that Iran’s disposed Shah be returned to Iran from the United States to face trial. Some hostages were released, leaving 66 remaining, with six Americans who had escaped to the Swedish and Canadian embassies evacuated under Canadian passports in a well orchestrated CIA operation.\nWhile most of the hostages were held on the embassy grounds, three were kept at the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) building located 16 blocks away from the embassy grounds, including the acting ambassador and two embassy staff who had been there on official business when the embassy was taken over.\nThe US Army counter-terrorism unit, Delta Force, had just recently been validated following a training mission at Camp Mackall and the unit’s commander, Colonel Charlie Beckwith, immediately went into mission planning in case a political solution could not be found and President Carter authorized a hostage rescue. With two Delta Squadrons, Beckwith simply did not have enough operators to cover the 27 acre embassy compound while simultaneously assaulting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building. Beckwith, “did not want another ground force brought into play. He resisted the need for a long time but eventually had to accept the reality of two rescue locations” (Lenahan, 34).\nThe commander of Det A, Lieutenant Colonel Stan Oleshevic, was tasked with assembling an eight-man assault element that could infiltrate into Iran with Delta Force and rescue the hostages held in the MFA. Their portion of the mission would be dubbed, “Storm Cloud.” They then developed a tactical plan and initiated mission rehearsals. A two-man element from Det A was identified who could infiltrate Iran undercover and get eyes on the MFA building, gathering critical intelligence for the assault.\nThe two recon men would then exfiltrate out of Iran, and join up with five team mates from their unit at the Delta Force staging ground, making for eight man assault element. The initial recce mission was a success, one of the Det A members having himself photographed alongside a Iranian soldier, with the MFA building prominently displayed in the background. Colonel Ulrich Wegener of GSG-9 was prepared to send a German TV crew into Tehran and offered to take some Delta operators with them so they could recce the embassy grounds, but the idea died in the Pentagon (Beckwith, 223).\nOne of the two Det A members in Tehran had even, “gained access to the interior of the MFA building where the three American diplomats were detained” and discovered that there was a much larger security presence than they expected. For this reason, the Det A assault force had to be increased to 10-14 men. Under the leadership of Colonel Oleshevic, this was accomplished and a new Concept of the Operation was drafted (Lenahan, 98).\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon has identified a suitable staging area for the rescue mission inside Iran, which became known as Desert One. However, planners needed someone to walk the terrain, needing someone, “knowledgeable, experienced, and competent” in the skills of “taking soil core samples, calibrating penetrometer readings, navigating, and taking measurements at night” as well as “installing landing instrumentation devices” (Lenahan, 72).\nOn March 30th, “the field survey team of Desert One was conducted by Major John Carney, a USAF Special Operations Combat Controller Team (CCT) leader. He was delivered to the site in a small civilian STOL-type aircraft operated by the CIA” (Lenahan, 95).\nWith the air reconnaissance and soil sample missions complete, Delta Force wrapped up their mission rehearsals in the United States was flown to Wadi Kena and then to Masirah on April 20th in conjunction with the eight man team from Detachment A that would take down the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building. Before departing to Desert One, Major Lewis “Bucky” Burruss, Delta’s B-Squadron commander, led the men as they sung “God Bless America” just before boarding their aircraft.\nDelta Force and Det A landed at Desert One, located in the Dasht-e-Kavir salt desert of central Iran, on the night of April 24th with the last of six aircraft setting down at midnight. Now they had to wait for their helicopters to arrive from the USS Nimitz on station in the Gulf of Oman to take them on the next leg of their journey en route to the US embassy and MFA. Rangers tasked to pull security at Desert One came from Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment and rode dirt bikes to help them get around the large staging area, where one soon shot a tanker truck driving down a nearby road with a LAW rocket launcher.\nThe helicopters were delayed several hours because of a sandstorm and a few of them were seriously damaged during the flight. Due to time delays and mechanical malfunctions, Colonel Beckwith made the difficult decision to scrub the mission. Around 2:40AM the men were preparing to abort and pull out of desert one when Major Schaefer’s helicopter crashed into one of the EC-130 airplanes. “A blue fireball ballooned into the night,” the ground force commander wrote (Beckwith, 279).\nOne of the Det A sergeants was out pulling security on the outer perimeter with Delta’s intelligence officer, approximately a mile away from where the airplanes were parked when he witnessed the explosion off in the distance. Jumping on the back of a dirt bike with a Ranger driving, the Det A member linked up with one of his team mates from Berlin back at the crash site. He then told the Ranger to take the dirt bike back to get Delta intel officer, but for some reason that didn’t happen. Using IV bags that the Det A men took with them on the mission for medical emergencies, they began treating members of the air crew who had been critically injured.\nLooking up, one of the Green Beret’s assigned to Det A suddenly realized that one of the C-130’s was turning around and about to take off without any passengers onboard. He jumped out in front of the nose of the aircraft, holding his Walther MPK sub-machine gun, and waving to get the pilot’s attention. “I was ready to shoot those motherfuckers,” he said, not relishing the idea of being left behind. The plane ended up having 70 or 80 soldiers on board when it finally took off.\nAfter the failure of Operation Eagle Claw and Storm Cloud, the task force went right into planning a follow up mission to rescue the hostages. It was widely believed that President Ronald Reagan would authorize the mission as soon as he was inaugurated and President Carter stepped down. The second attempt would be called Operation Snow Bird.\nDetachment A soldiers were still tasked with taking down the MFA building in Tehran. This time mission rehearsals were carried out by Det A at Camp Rudder where the Florida Phase of Ranger School takes place. With new helicopters assigned to the mission, there could only be one pilot. The co-pilot would be too heavy a load for the helicopter to bear along with the assaulters due to fuel consumption issues. Just in case the pilot ended up getting shot, the Det A members were trained to fly the helicopter safely to the ground. “We all got some stick time,” Sergeant Major Jeff Raker recalled with a smile.\nJust hours after Reagan was inaugurated, Iran released the remaining American hostages held in Iran, ending the standoff. Back in Berlin, Detachment A continued to conduct their unconventional warfare and counter-terrorism missions, however the later was beginning to have a detrimental effect on the unit’s operational security. The disaster at Desert One had put a spotlight on America’s counter-terrorism units and an article appearing in Newsweek exposed Detachment A’s existence. For this reason, Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) made the decision to disband the unit and start fresh with a new one.\nThis was the dire impact of the counter-terrorism mission, particularly when mixed with clandestine espionage activities. The kinetic aspects of counter-terrorism raised the profile of Det A, leading to its exposure in the press. For a unit like Delta Force this wasn’t as big a deal since they were a Direct Action focused unit at Fort Bragg but for a clandestine unit in Berlin, the press exposure was a disaster.\nComing up in part 4, Det A gets disbanded but is replaced by another clandestine Special Forces unit in Berlin!']"	['<urn:uuid:875b2205-af3e-4c76-afad-e7866f11bb37>', '<urn:uuid:1b027cca-0fed-4b82-9897-378b40c59478>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	11	99	3432
55	What are the recommended pruning practices for different types of hydrangeas, including both climbing and standard varieties?	Mophead, climbing, and oakleaf hydrangeas should be pruned immediately after flowering since they develop next year's flowers in late summer to early fall. Panicle and smooth hydrangeas can be pruned in fall or late winter as they develop new buds in spring. When pruning, remove no more than one-third of the plant's total height. For climbing hydrangeas specifically, pruning should be done after flowering in summer (usually August), focusing on removing dead wood, crossed branches, and excessive growth while being careful not to over-prune as it can reduce next year's blooming.	"[""How to Transplant Hydrangeas. One of summer's most recognizable flowers, hydrangeas (Hydrangea spp.) feature large clusters of tiny flowers. Hydrangeas do best in an area with full sun and some late afternoon shade, and they might require transplanting from their original location to provide the best environment. Grown in U.S. Department of...\nOne of summer's most recognizable flowers, hydrangeas (Hydrangea spp.) feature large clusters of tiny flowers. Hydrangeas do best in an area with full sun and some late afternoon shade, and they might require transplanting from their original location to provide the best environment. Grown in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 3 through 9, common hydrangea species include the pink or blue mophead variety (Hydrangea macrophylla), grown in USDA zones 6 through 9, and climbing hydrangea and oakleaf hydrangea, both hardy in USDA zones 5 through 9.\nHydrangeas should be transplanted when they are dormant for winter so the energy needed for transplant recovery doesn't steal energy needed for growth and flower production. This also ensures plenty of time to recover -- all spring and summer -- as they enter the next dormant period. Technically, transplanting can be done any time between the first frost in late fall to the last frost in early spring, but the best time is in late winter to early spring. At this time, the ground begins to soften to make digging easier, and the hydrangeas don't have to contend with harsh winter weather.\nLittle preparation is needed if the hydrangea was planted within the last year and isn't completely established in its site. For more established hydrangeas with vast root systems, root pruning in fall forces the plant to develop a dense network of short roots that reduces transplant shock. Cut a wide circle at least 24 inches in diameter with a sharp spade to sever roots. You can also cut back hydrangeas to make them more manageable. Prune mophead, climbing and oakleaf hydrangeas immediately after flowering because they develop the next year's flowers in late summer to early fall. Prune panicle hydrangeas (Hydrangea paniculata) and smooth hydrangeas (Hydrangea arborescens), hardy in USDA zones 4 through 8 and 4 through 9 respectively, in fall or late winter because they develop new buds in spring. Cut back no more than one-third of a hydrangea's total height.\nAdvanced site preparation increases the chance of transplant success. Dig the hole and have it ready before you ever dig up the hydrangea plant. Loosen the soil in an area as wide and deep as possible so the roots can easily pass through the loose soil. The hole itself should be as deep as the rootball height, usually about 24 inches, and two to three times the diameter of the rootball. If you root-prune a rootball that's 24 inches in diameter, the planting hole should measure 4 to 6 feet across. Hydrangeas need soil with adequate drainage to avoid root rot, so work in some organic matter and coarse sand, if needed, to build soil structure. Add sphagnum peat moss to increase acidity or agricultural lime to increase alkalinity if the soil pH falls outside the range of about 5.2 to 7.5.\nMoving and Planting\nSpades work well for cutting the soil around the hydrangea plant, while a round-point shovel pulled backward provides leverage to break the bottom roots free from the soil. Remove the plant from its hole and set it on a piece of burlap. Wrap the rootball in the burlap to protect the roots. A large bush with large rootball can weigh hundreds of pounds, so recruit helpers to move it to its new site. Use a garden cart or truck to transport the hydrangea. Alternatively, set the plant on a canvas drop cloth and pull it across the lawn to its new site. Set the plant in its hole so the top of the rootball rests evenly with the surrounding soil grade. Backfill the hole with soil up to the rootball level.\nOne deep watering at the time of transplanting is usually enough until spring growth begins. The hydrangea is still dormant and doesn't require much water. Leave a soaker hose on in the area for several hours to ensure slow, steady watering that makes the soil in the hole and surrounding area evenly moist. The soil in the hole settles as the water fills in air pockets, so add more soil to bring the level back up to grade. Add fertilizer at transplanting time or wait until new growth begins in spring. Use a water-soluble, all-purpose, complete fertilizer mixed at a rate of 1 tablespoon fertilizer to 1 gallon of water. Add the fertilizer as part of the regular watering routine. Expect to use 1 gallon of fertilizer for every 10 square feet.\nCheck out these related posts"", 'How to Grow and Care for Climbing Hydrangea: A Guide\nIf you’re looking for a stunning and low-maintenance plant to transform your garden, look no further than climbing hydrangeas.

These vines thrive in partial shade with moist, well-draining soil. However, they are also adaptable and can tolerate a range of conditions.\nIf you’re considering container gardening, choose a pot that is at least 18 inches wide with good drainage. Fill it with high-quality potting soil and ensure it’s situated in a location where it will receive partial sun.\nIt’s important to note that while climbing hydrangeas are hardy plants, they may struggle in extremely hot or dry conditions. To ensure optimal growth and blooming, provide your plant with consistent moisture and protection from harsh sunlight.\nPlanting Climbing Hydrangea\nProper planting is essential for ensuring your climbing hydrangea has a solid foundation to thrive. Start by selecting a location that provides the best conditions for climbing hydrangea growth. Look for a spot that has well-draining soil and morning sun exposure with afternoon shade. Climbing hydrangeas can also be grown in containers if you have limited space or want to add some variety to your patio or balcony.\nWhen planting your climbing hydrangea, make sure to prepare the soil properly. Dig a hole that is twice the width of the plant’s root ball and equal in depth. Mix in some organic matter, such as compost or peat moss, to improve the soil’s nutrient content and promote root growth.\nSpace multiple climbing hydrangeas at least 8 to 10 feet apart to give them room to spread. Water the plant thoroughly after planting and for the first few weeks until it establishes itself in its new location.\nHow to Grow and Care for Climbing Hydrangea: Watering and Moisture Needs\nClimbing hydrangeas are relatively adaptable to different moisture conditions, but it’s critical to keep their soil consistently moist, especially during the growing season.\nWhen they are young, climbing hydrangeas require more frequent watering than mature ones. Water thoroughly and deeply in intervals of two to three days, especially during hot and dry weather conditions. Watering early in the day gives the plants ample time to dry out, reducing susceptibility to disease and pests.\nExcessive watering can lead to root rot and stunted growth, so watch for signs such as yellowing leaves or wilting flowers, which are symptoms of overwatering.\nOnce established, climbing hydrangeas require less frequent watering, but it’s still essential to ensure that the soil remains moist. Avoid watering late in the day, as this can lead to prolonged wetness that can encourage disease, particularly if the foliage is wet overnight.\nRegular monitoring of your climbing hydrangeas’ watering needs is necessary to ensure that they are receiving the appropriate amount of water.\nFertilizing and Nutrient Requirements\nProper fertilization is vital to the growth and blooming of your climbing hydrangea. These plants need regular feeding to ensure they are receiving the necessary nutrients.\nWhen it comes to climbing hydrangea plant care, you’ll want to use a slow-release fertilizer in the spring. This will provide your plant with the nutrients it needs for the entire growing season. Choose a balanced fertilizer with equal amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\nIn addition to slow-release fertilizer, you can also use a water-soluble fertilizer for regular feedings every two to four weeks during the growing season.\nIt’s important to note that too much fertilizer can actually harm your climbing hydrangea. Be sure to follow the instructions on the fertilizer package carefully, and avoid overfeeding.\nPruning Climbing Hydrangea\nClimbing hydrangeas require regular pruning to maintain their shape, encourage healthy growth, and keep them looking beautiful. Pruning also helps to prevent the plant from becoming too large and unruly.\nWhen to Prune\nThe best time to prune climbing hydrangeas is after they have finished flowering in the summer, usually in August. Avoid pruning in the fall or winter, as this can damage the plant and reduce its chances of blooming the following year.\nHow to Prune\nWhen pruning climbing hydrangeas, start by removing any dead or damaged wood. Then, remove any shoots that are growing in the wrong direction or are crossing over other branches. Trim back any excessively long shoots to maintain the desired shape of the plant.\nIt is important to be cautious when pruning climbing hydrangeas, as cutting too much can reduce blooming the following year. If in doubt, it’s best to err on the side of caution and prune lightly.\nTools for Pruning\nWhen pruning a climbing hydrangea, use sharp and clean pruning shears or loppers to make clean cuts. Avoid using dull or dirty tools, as they can damage the plant and increase the risk of disease.\nPruning climbing hydrangeas can seem intimidating at first, but with these tips and techniques, you can confidently maintain your plant’s health and beauty. Remember to prune after flowering, avoid cutting too much, and use clean, sharp tools for best results.\nSupporting Your Climbing Hydrangea\nAs your climbing hydrangea grows taller and wider, it will need additional support to avoid sagging or breaking. The type of support you should choose will depend on your plant’s position and your personal preferences. Some options include trellises, arbors, and wires.\nHow to prune climbing hydrangea for proper support\nPruning is an essential part of supporting your climbing hydrangea. Regularly trimming back your plant will help it grow thicker and stronger, which in turn will ensure it can handle the weight of its own foliage and flowers. When pruning, focus on removing any dead or weak branches, as well as any old flowers or clusters of seeds. This will free up resources for new growth and help your plant stay healthy.\n|Trellises||These structures are made up of criss-crossing wooden slats or metal wires, providing your climbing hydrangea with a surface to climb up. They can be freestanding or attached to a wall or fence.|\n|Arbors||These arches provide a grand entrance to your garden and a framework for your climbing hydrangea to climb onto. They’re perfect for creating a focal point or dividing up different parts of your garden.|\n|Wires||Attaching wires to walls or fences can be a subtle way to give your climbing hydrangea something to climb up. You can stretch wires between anchors to create horizontal lines for your plant to climb along.|\nWhen attaching your climbing hydrangea to its support structure, be careful not to damage the plant’s delicate stems and branches. Tie them gently with twine or soft string, avoiding tight knots that could cut into the plant’s tissue. As the plant grows, loosen the ties to avoid constricting its growth.\nBy following these tips and properly supporting your climbing hydrangea, you’ll be able to maintain its beauty and health for years to come. Remember to prune regularly and choose a support structure that complements your garden’s overall design.\nDealing with Pests and Diseases\nClimbing hydrangeas are known for their resilience to pests and diseases, but they can still fall victim to some common ailments. Here are some of the most common pests and diseases and how to address them:\n- Aphids: These small insects suck the sap from the leaves and stems of your climbing hydrangea, causing stunted growth and distorted leaves. Use insecticidal soap or neem oil to eliminate these pests.\n- Mites: Mites are tiny spider-like insects that can leave webs on your plant and cause yellowing leaves. Use a miticide to eradicate mites.\n- Scale Insects: Scale insects are tiny insects that form white or brown bumps on leaves and stems. They secrete honeydew, which attracts ants and can lead to fungal growth. Use an insecticidal soap to treat scale insects.\n- Powdery Mildew: This fungal disease appears as a white powdery substance on the leaves of your climbing hydrangea. It is caused by high humidity and poor air circulation. Use a fungicide to treat powdery mildew.\n- Bacterial Blight: This bacterial disease presents as brown spots on the leaves and stems of your plant. It can cause leaf drop and eventually death. Remove and destroy any infected plant material and use a copper-based fungicide to prevent the spread of bacteria.\n- Root Rot: Overwatering and poor drainage can lead to root rot, which causes wilting and yellowing leaves. To prevent this disease, make sure your climbing hydrangea is planted in well-draining soil and avoid overwatering.\nBy staying vigilant and taking preventative measures, you can keep your climbing hydrangeas healthy and free of pests and diseases.\nWinter Care and Protection\nCaring for climbing hydrangea plants during winter is crucial to ensure their survival and healthy growth in the upcoming seasons. Here are some tips that will help you to properly protect your climbing hydrangea during the cold months.\nWinter is the best time to prune your climbing hydrangea. Prune any unhealthy or damaged branches and remove any dead flowers and foliage. This will not only keep the plant looking tidy but will also enhance its growth and flowering in the upcoming year.\nDuring the winter months, it’s important to keep your climbing hydrangea hydrated but not over-watered. Make sure to water the plant only when the soil is dry to avoid waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.\nProtection against Frost\nProtect your climbing hydrangea from frost by wrapping it in burlap or a frost cloth. This will help to insulate the plant and prevent it from getting damaged due to extreme weather conditions. Make sure to remove the covering during the day to allow enough sunlight to reach the plant.\nShield Against Salt Damage\nIf you live in an area that uses salt on the roads during the winter, make sure to shield your climbing hydrangea from salt damage. Salt can cause damage to the foliage and roots of the plant. You can protect your plant by using a barrier around it that is high enough to prevent salt from splashing onto the plant.\nBy following these winter care and protection tips for your climbing hydrangea, you’ll be able to keep it healthy and thriving throughout the cold season.\nClimbing hydrangeas are relatively easy to propagate from cuttings, making it a great way to expand your collection. Here are some simple propagation techniques:\n- Softwood cuttings: Take cuttings from new growth shoots in late spring or early summer before they have hardened. Trim leaves from the bottom two-thirds of the stem and dip it in rooting hormone. Plant the cutting in a well-draining soil mix and water it thoroughly. Cover it loosely with a plastic bag to retain moisture and place it in indirect light. Check the soil moisture regularly and mist the cutting occasionally to keep it moist, but not waterlogged. After a few weeks, gently tug the cutting to see if it has rooted.\n- Hardwood cuttings: Take cuttings from mature wood in late fall or winter when the plants are dormant. Cut a stem that is approximately pencil-thick and trim it to 10-12 inches long. Remove all leaves except for the top two pairs. Dip the bottom end of the stem in rooting hormone and plant it in a well-draining soil mix, burying about two-thirds of the cutting. Water the cutting thoroughly and place it in indirect light. Keep the soil moist but not overly wet. Check for rooting in the spring.\n- Layering: Layering involves bending a stem to the ground and covering a segment of it with soil or compost. The buried segment will produce roots, allowing you to separate it from the parent plant and transplant it. In the spring, choose a supple stem and bend it to the ground, covering a segment with soil or compost. Weigh down the layered stem with a rock or brick and water it regularly. After several months, gently tug on the stem to see if it has rooted. Once it has, separate it from the parent plant and transplant it to a new location.\nWhichever propagation method you choose, be patient with your new cuttings. It can take several months for them to root and establish themselves.\nTroubleshooting Common Issues\nDespite your best efforts, climbing hydrangeas may experience some common issues. Below are some of the most common problems and how to address them:\nIf your climbing hydrangea’s leaves are turning yellow, it may be due to overwatering or poor drainage. Check to make sure your plant is not sitting in standing water and adjust your watering schedule accordingly.\nIf your climbing hydrangea’s flowers are wilting, it may be due to lack of water or too much sun exposure. Make sure your plant is getting enough water and is not being subjected to too much direct sunlight.\nIf your climbing hydrangea is not producing blooms, it may be due to improper pruning or lack of nutrients. Make sure to prune your plant at the right time and feed it with the appropriate fertilizer.\nIf your climbing hydrangea is not growing as expected, it may be due to poor soil quality or lack of sunlight. Make sure your plant is receiving enough nutrients and is planted in a location with adequate sunlight.\nBy addressing these common issues promptly, you can help your climbing hydrangeas thrive and continue to dazzle with their stunning blooms and lush foliage.\nNow that you have learned how to grow and care for climbing hydrangeas, it’s time to put your knowledge into practice. With the right location, planting techniques, watering and nutrient requirements, pruning, support structures, pest and disease prevention, winter care, propagation, and troubleshooting methods, you can enjoy the beauty of this stunning plant for years to come.\nRemember to choose the best location for your climbing hydrangea, provide it with adequate moisture and nutrients, prune it regularly, and protect it from pests and harsh weather conditions.

While these devices are growing in popularity — and have legitimate uses — consumers don\'t always understand the extent to which their information could be available to or intercepted by third parties. This is especially important because people can\'t simply change their DNA sequencing or heart rhythms as they could a credit card or bank account number.\n""Once the toothpaste is out of the tube, you can\'t get it back,"" said Steve Grobman, senior vice president and chief technology officer of computer security company McAfee.\nThe holiday season is a popular time to purchase consumer health devices. Here\'s what you should know about the security risks tied to fitness trackers and personal health data.\nStick to a name brand, even though they are hacked\nFitness devices can be expensive, even without taking inflation into account, but don\'t be tempted to skimp on security to save a few dollars. While a less-known company may offer more bells and whistles at a better price, a well-established provider that is breached is more likely to care about its reputation and do things to help consumers, said Kevin Roundy, senior technical director at cybersecurity company Gen Digital.\nTo be sure, data compromise issues, from criminal hacks to unintended sharing of sensitive user information, can — and have — hit well-known players, including Fitbit, which Google bought in 2021, and Strava. But even so, security professionals say it\'s better to buy from a reputable manufacturer that knows how to design secure devices and has a reputation to upkeep.\n""A smaller company might just go bankrupt,"" Roundy said.\nFitness app data is not protected like health information\nThere can be other concerns beyond having a person\'s sensitive information exposed in a data breach. For example, fitness trackers generally connect to a user\'s phone via Bluetooth, leaving personal data susceptible to hacking.\nWhat\'s more, the information that fitness trackers collect isn\'t considered ""health information"" under the federal HIPAA standard or state laws like California\'s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. This means that personally revealing data can potentially be used in ways a consumer might never expect. For instance, the personal information could be shared with or sold to third parties such as data brokers or law enforcement, said Emory Roane, policy counsel at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer privacy, advocacy and education organization.\nSome fitness trackers may use consumers\' health and wellness data to derive revenue from ads, so if that\'s a concern, you\'ll want to make sure there\'s a way to opt out. Review the provider\'s terms of service to understand the its policies before you buy the fitness tracker, Roundy said.\nDefault social, location settings may need to be changed\nA fitness tracker\'s default settings may not offer the most stringent security controls. To boost protection, look at what settings can be adjusted, such as those related to social networking, location and other sharable information, said Dan Demeter, security researcher at cybersecurity provider Kaspersky Lab.\nDepending on the state, consumers can also opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information to third parties, and in some cases, these rights are being expanded, according to Roane.\nCertainly, device users should be careful about what they post publicly about their location and activities, or what they allow to become public by default. This data could be searchable online and used by bad actors. Even if they aren\'t acting maliciously, third parties such as insurers and employers could get access to this type of public information.\n""Users expect their data to be their data and use it how they want it to be used,"" Roane said, but that\'s not necessarily the case.\n""It\'s not only about present data, but also about past data,"" Demeter said. For instance, a bad actor could see all the times the person goes running — what days and hours — and where, and use it to their advantage.\nThere are also a number of digital scams where criminals can use information about your location to make an opportunity seem more plausible. They can claim things like, ""I know you lost your wallet at so and so place, which lends credibility to the scammer\'s story,"" Grobman said.\nLocation data can prove problematic in other ways as well. Roane offers the example of a women seeking reproductive health care in a state where abortion is illegal. A fitness tracker with geolocation services enabled could collect information that could be subpoenaed by law enforcement or be purchased by data brokers and sold to law enforcement, he said.\nUse strong password, two-factor authentication, and never share credentials\nBe sure to secure your account by using a strong password that you don\'t use with another account and enabling two-factor authentication for the associated app. And don\'t share credentials. That\'s never a good idea, but it can have especially devastating consequences in certain circumstances. For example, a domestic violence victim could be tracked by her abuser, assuming he had access to her account credentials, Roane said.\nAlso be sure to keep the device and the app up-to-date with security fixes.\nWhile nothing is foolproof, the goal is to be as secure as possible. ""If somebody tries to profit from our personal information, we just make their lives harder so it\'s not that easy to hack us,"" Demeter said.']"	['<urn:uuid:5f3fc291-d3e9-450d-95cd-78ab9e936b67>', '<urn:uuid:760aa365-b7f3-4b99-94d6-4a27433898e1>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	13	109	2349
57	How can technology help monitor water quality and what health risks does bad water cause?	CSIRO is developing AquaWatch, a world-first system that provides near real-time water quality monitoring and forecasting using satellites and ground sensors. Regarding health risks, contaminated water can cause diseases like diarrhea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and polio, with contaminated drinking water estimated to cause 485,000 diarrheal deaths each year.	"['Australia creating world-first ‘weather service’ for water quality\nAustralia’s national science agency, CSIRO, has launched a mission to deliver a world first ground-to-space water quality monitoring system.\nThe United Nations estimates three billion people could be at risk from unsafe water. Through AquaWatch Australia, CSIRO is working with partners internationally to help safeguard freshwater and coastal resources.\nAquaWatch will provide near real-time updates and predictive forecasting – a weather service for water quality – once fully operational. It will support better water quality management and can be used to monitor water quality for drinking, sanitation, aquaculture, environmental assessment and a wide range of other applications to help meet the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.\nCSIRO, with foundation partner SmartSat Cooperative Research Centre, is bringing together research, government and industry with an initial co-investment of AU$83 million to design and develop AquaWatch.\nData collected using an extensive network of Earth observation satellites and ground-based water sensors will be integrated at a central data hub where CSIRO’s capability in data analysis and artificial intelligence can provide forecasts a few days ahead.\nCSIRO Chief Executive, Dr Larry Marshall said water is one of the world’s most important and vital resources. “In places where people still face the risk of unsafe water for basic needs like drinking and sanitation, a service such as AquaWatch could be a game-changer.\n“The ingenuity behind AquaWatch is it integrates Earth observation with other science capabilities like in-situ sensing, ecosystem modelling, engineering, data science and artificial intelligence. “It is the latest example of CSIRO’s Missions Program, which are large-scale scientific and collaborative research initiatives aimed at accelerating the pace and scale at which we can solve the greatest challenges.”\nCSIRO and its international partners are already working together on pilot projects in:\n- California, USA in partnership with the University of California, Davis and University of California, Merced, focusing on turbidity in a major water storage\n- Sarawak, Malaysia in partnership with Swinburne University Sarawak, focusing on carbon losses from mangrove forests\n- Chile, focusing on salmon aquaculture and desalination\n- Colombia, focusing on coastal wetlands\n- Vietnam, in partnership with Vietnam’s National Center for Water Resources and Investigation (NAWAPI) and Hanoi University of Mining and Geology (HUMG), focusing on drinking water supplies and hydroelectricity needs.\nDr Alex Held, AquaWatch Mission Lead, CSIRO: “Water quality can be degraded by agricultural runoff, development of coastal areas, or events like cyclones, floods and bushfires. With AquaWatch, we’re aiming to provide forecasts of water quality two-three days into the future. It will be a sort of weather forecast for water, like a weather app on your phone. CSIRO is working with international partners in Vietnam, Malaysia, Chile, Colombia, the United States and elsewhere on pilot projects outside Australia. These sites will inform the development of AquaWatch, increasing its suitability for global applications.”\nDr Susan Ustin, Distinguished Professor Emeritus, UC Davis Institute of the Environment: “The AquaWatch pilot project provides a great opportunity for researchers at UC Davis and UC Merced to collaborate with their counterparts at CSIRO, sharing data, personnel, and equipment, that enable them to better address water quality concerns of significant interest to both California and Australia.”\nContact: For interviews and more information phone +61 1300 555 005 or email email@example.com\nAquaWatch Australia Mission: More about CSIRO’s AquaWatch Australia Mission.', ""Water quality serves as the foundation for almost all development. Contaminated, unsafe water threatens human health, diminishes food production, reduces ecosystem functions, and limits economic growth. Unfortunately, new water quality challenges due to emerging pollutants like pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial and household chemicals exacerbate historical water quality threats, particularly in light of changing climate patterns and their impacts on human health and ecosystems.\nA UNESCO fact sheet notes that lack of safely managed sanitation, including sewage treatment (for piped sewers) and fecal sludge management (for on-site sanitation like latrines and septic systems), contributes significantly to water pollution.

58	expert hiker seeking highest elevation points machu picchu trek salkantay pass quishuarani	There are two notable high elevation points on these treks: the Ipsayccasa Pass at 4500m on the Lares Valley trek from Quishuarani, and the Salkantay Pass which reaches 15,200 feet (approximately 4630m) on the lodge-to-lodge trek route.	"['Lares Valley (Quishuarani) to Machu Picchu (4 days)\nLares (Quishuarani) to Machu Picchu Trek (4 days) Route Option 2\nDuration: 4 days\nWhen to go: Best from April to December although can be done year round.\nAltitude: 2700m to 4500m\nTrek fees: None although you have to pay to enter Machu Picchu on the final day of the trek\nSee our Introduction to the Lares Valley to Machu Picchu Trek which includes information about the region, trek prices and responsible tourism and also describes the various trek options on offer.\nTypical Trek Itinerary Route 02\n(the actual trek itinerary may change slightly from company to company)\nDay 1: Cusco - Calca - Quishuarani (Lares) - Cuncani\nOur bus leaves Cusco at around 06:00. Its a scenic drive through the Sacred Valley, passing through Pisac and stopping for breakfast for about 40 minutes in the provincial town of Calca. In Calca you will also have the opportunity to use the bathroom and buy any last minute snacks, water, etc. Departing Calca around 08:00 we head off for the 2 hour drive to Quishuarani (3700m) which is the starting point for the trek. Along the way you will be able to observe small Andean communities, spectacular mountain landscapes, herds of llamas and alpacas.\nHeading west up a small valley we’ll arrive at a lake at the head of the valley and start a steep zig-zag climb up a narrow trail to the top of the first pass known as Abra Huillquijasa (4200m), about 3˝ hours from Quishuarani village. Below you lies a series of stunning turquoise lakes. We’ll drop down and have lunch beside the lakes before continuing on for the short trek to the next village of Cuncani (3750m) in the bottom of the valley (2 hour from the pass). Arriving in the village around 4pm we’ll set up camp. Walking distance approx 12km (5-6 hours)\nDay 2: Cuncani - Huacawasi - Ipsaycocha Lake\nAfter breakfast we\'ll get back on the trail around 07:00. We will walk slightly downhill for the first 2 hours to the Chancachaca Valley (3600m) and then up for about 1˝ hours to the small village of Huacawasi (3700m). Many of the houses that we see are built from stone and have thatched roofs. The people of this village produce beautiful colourful textiles. Here we will learn about the weaving techniques and be able to admire some of their high quality ponchos, chullos (wool hats) and other garments. We will rest and have lunch. We will then continue to climb for approximately 2 hours to the top of Ipsayccasa Pass which, at 4500m, is the highest pass along the trek. From here we get stunning views of the surrounding mountains. We will descend gently for about 1 hour until we reach the site of our second night\'s camp beside the beautiful Ipsaycocha Lake. We may be lucky enough to see Andean Geese, Ouna Ibis and other wetland birds. Walking distance approx 15km (6-7 hours)\nDay 3: Ipsaycoccha Lake - Patacancha - Willoq - Ollantaytambo - Aguas Calientes\nToday is a much easier day. After an early breakfast we\'ll walk gently downhill through a wide-open valley for about 2˝ hours until we arrive at the village of Patacancha. The people from this area are known locally as ""Huayruros"" - the name of a red and black seed reminiscent of the colour of their ponchos. We\'ll have a chance to view some textiles made by the people of this community - the high quality weavings are famous for their intricate designs reflecting aspects of their everyday lives and culture. We\'ll walk slowly down the valley to Willoq, another Quechua village where the locals still wear their traditional dress and are proud to maintain their cultural identity. Our transport will be waiting for us to take us further down the valley to Inca town of Ollantaytambo where we will rest and have lunch. In the early afternoon we will catch a train to Aguas Calientes. This is a spectacular journey that starts in the Quechua highlands and slowly descends to lush tropical vegetation as we near Aguas Calientes. Total journey time about 1˝ hours. We\'ll spend the night in a hostal in Aguas Calientes where you\'ll no doubt enjoy the opportunity to soak under the hot showers!! Early night.\nWalking distance approx 12km (5-6 hours).\nDay 4: Aguas Calientes - Machu Picchu - Aguas Calientes - Cusco\nRise early around about 04:45 !! to take one of the first buses up to Machu Picchu. I\'m sure you\'ll agree that, although it\'s tough getting up, it\'s well worth the effort to see the ""Lost City of the Incas"" at its quietest in the early morning light. You\'ll have plenty of opportunity to take photos and have some peaceful time alone to enjoy the sun rising from behind the mountains. Our guide will give you a tour of Machu Picchu telling you about Inca history and significance of the major sites of interest. The tour takes about 2 hours after which you will have free time to explore the ruins on your own or climb Wayna Picchu - the mountain that overlooks the ancient Inca city (allow a minimum of 1˝ hours). By 11:00 Machu Picchu quickly fills up with tourists arriving by train and appears crowded by comparison with the early morning. Most people are ready to take the bus back to Aguas Calientes around 1pm where you can have lunch in one of the many restaurants. Late afternoon train back to Ollantaytambo where a bus will be waiting to bring you back to Cusco.\n(trek itinerary used with permission from Peru Treks)\nCompanies offering this version of the Lares trek include:\nAndean Travel Web Guide to Peru.

Hoecker, M.D.\nThere\'s no evidence that special diets are an effective autism treatment.\nSome people believe that diets that are free of a protein found in dairy products (casein) and a protein found in many grains (gluten) affect the brain development and behavior that causes autism in children. However, there\'s little evidence that diet triggers autism or that restricting gluten and casein improves autism symptoms. And for growing children, restrictive diets can lead to nutritional deficiencies.

For this reason, many frustrated parents turn to unproven alternative treatments — such as restrictive diets that eliminate gluten and casein — in an attempt to help their children.\nIf you\'re considering an alternative autism treatment, talk to your child\'s doctor.

60	What makes employee feedback systems successful?	Successful performance appraisal systems are based on five key principles: job relevance, clear communication of standards, documentation of performance, consistency in evaluation, and proper training of evaluators. Additionally, they require process integration, system flexibility, centralized monitoring, compliance enablement, and a strong culture of quality supported by top management commitment.	"['Few things in business today are as misused as, and perceived similarly to, the snake oil of the Wild West in the 1800\'s. Typical thoughts associated with performance appraisal systems include: useless, a pain-in-the-neck, too cumbersome, critical for improved performance but they are ineffective, and as the latest fad version emerges, fantastic. . . for the moment. Most organizations have tried many different versions including Management By Objectives (MBO), Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (BARs), Mutual Problem Solving (MPS), Forced Distribution, etc.\nOften within the same organization large variances exist with regard to understanding the purpose or use of the performance appraisal, the frequency with which it is completed, and the quality of the information it contains. Why is it that something that has been around so long (probably since the Chan Dynasty, when a scribe for the city was told not to return to work the following day after misspelling Chan\'s nephew\'s name), and has the potential for being highly valuable to the organization, is in such disarray?\nOne significant contributor to the disarray is that the performance appraisal can be, and often is, used for many different purposes:\nUnfortunately no single instrument or process has evolved that can efficiently and simply be responsive to all of those applications. As an organization\'s primary use of a performance appraisal system changes, they find their current (latest and greatest) process must also be changed. This accounts for the frequency of new processes managers often experience. Further, each new process usually requires the learning of a new type of rating scale (e.g., ranking, forced distribution, BARs) which often contributes to the ineffectiveness of the new process.\nBecause performance appraisal process outcomes qualify as ""employment decisions,"" they are covered by current equal employment legislation and guidelines. Detail concerning performance appraisals and their legality is beyond the scope of this paper, suffice it to say that all of the provisions of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (1978) relating to adverse impact, fairness, and job-relatedness apply to performance appraisals.\nNow that we have highlighted all of the fun parts related to performance appraisal systems, where do we go from here? The purpose of this paper is to put these issues in perspective by outlining a straightforward strategy for understanding, developing, and administering fair and valid performance appraisal systems.\nDeveloping a Performance Appraisal Process\nAny performance appraisal process should be directed at accurately and fairly assessing the accomplishments of employees in terms of job-relevant outputs (i.e., production information, timeliness of report production, etc.), and behavior (i.e., judgments of oral communication and leadership skills, etc.). Accuracy refers to the processes\' ability to consistently identify and rate \'good performance\' as good performance. Fairly refers to the processes\' ability to focus on and respond to only job-related output and behavior.\nIn developing or refining a performance appraisal process, your organization must answer the following questions:\nUsually performance appraisal processes fail because they have not thought through and answered each of these questions.\nBefore we briefly discuss these questions, one other complexity of performance appraisal processes needs to be reviewed. Virtually all performance appraisals in use are dependent on some person or persons having observed the employee\'s performance. As obvious as this sounds, and as necessary as it is, it presents some real limitations on the usefulness of the final performance appraisal. As the above figure shows, while much of what is done on a job is typically observable, little is normally observed by the evaluators. Even less of what is observed is usually documented for reference in preparing the performance appraisal. Unfortunately what often happens is the performance appraisal is written based on some poorly documented recollections.\nLet\'s quickly review each question raised earlier:\nManagement must identify the one or two uses it wants to be responsive to before answering any of the other questions. If compensation is already pretty well determined by contractually agreed to scales, or there is typically very little money available to create a realistic difference between the highest paid ""best"" performer and the lowest paid ""poor"" performer, then don\'t tie the process to pay. Similarly, if promotion is a time-in-position triggered process, don\'t link it with the appraisal.\nOnce the purpose is agreed upon and understood by management, then the remaining questions can be appropriately answered. In essence many performance appraisal systems fail because there is no true relationship between them and anything that is meaningful to the employees, or, because even if there is a relationship it is either not well understood or not trusted.\nOnce the purpose is defined it should be formally communicated to both management and employees. This action will help build trust, understanding and buy-in to the new process.\nWhile it is most desirable to use direct outputs (i.e., widgets produced, sales volume, collections made, etc.) as job performance criteria, it is usually necessary to assess other observable job-related activities and behavior to accurately and comprehensively assess individuals\' performance. This becomes more the case as the position being evaluated moves from a technical or production based one to a managerial job. These types of behavior are typically labeled as oral communication, problem solving, leadership and coaching, etc.\nBeyond answering this question, your organization must determine what standards will be applied to any job outputs (i.e., widgets produced) assessed, and what criteria will be applied to \'operationalize\' any job-relevant activities and behavior (i.e., leadership skills) assessed.\nIn answering this question, your organization must consider the use of managers, supervisors, subordinate(s), peers, work teams, or some combination of the above as appropriate groups in the development and assessment of performance standards. Traditionally, performance appraisals have been conducted in a ""top-down"" fashion, with managers and supervisors both setting and appraising work goals.\nWith the movement to flatter organizational structures and increased reliance on pushing job responsibilities to lower levels of the organization (i.e., self-directed work teams), top-down performance appraisal systems are being replaced or supplemented with peer assessments, upward appraisals, and ""360o"" feedback processes.\nActually with some of the processes such as 360o appraisals, not only do subordinates and peers contribute to the evaluation, but often so do external (to the department as well as the organization) clients who interact with the manager. This approach is particularly valuable when a primary purpose of the process is development. Of course, no matter who sets and appraises work standards, employees should clearly understand what is expected of them and why.\nEqually important is deciding on a procedure for noting performance throughout the performance appraisal cycle. Some organizations require a ""drop file"" where a brief note is completed monthly on performance during that month. These notes become the basis for completing the formal performance instrument. If no procedure is agreed upon, most managers will wait until the performance appraisal is due and attempt to complete it from memory. The obvious problem with this default approach is that one tends to recall the more recent and the more negative performance rather than representative performance.\nThere are many types of appraisal formats including: checklists, graphic rating scales, and behaviorally anchored rating scales. The choice to a large degree is determined by the intended use and your organization\'s culture. For example, concise behavioral descriptions based on the employee\'s performance are much more valuable to the employee for developmental purposes than any check list or graphic rating scale. On the other hand, checklist or forced rankings are often fully adequate if the primary application is for compensation purposes.\nIn developing an appropriate rating format, your organization must strike a balance between an overly burdensome instrument (i.e., too long, overly complex, etc.) and one that will be relatively painless to complete, without compromising accuracy.\nThis includes decisions regarding frequency (i.e., annually, semiannually, etc.), and location for conducting the performance review process. The most important factor is to ensure that the performance appraisal process is conducted in a consistent manner under standardized conditions.\nIt is always prudent to make sure that the performance review process is documented in writing. It is also a good idea to implement an employee appeal procedure. Employee appeals provide for checks-and-balances in the process, and help to ensure that the process continues to be fair and valid. In addition, formalized appeal procedures are helpful in defending the process when legal challenge is brought based on negative action (i.e., discipline, termination, etc.) resulting from the performance appraisal process.\nAs mentioned previously, performance appraisal systems can be developed to help in the decision making process for: pay increases, promotions and/or demotions, disciplinary action, career counseling, and future performance goals. Since these types of ""employment decisions"" can directly result from the performance appraisal process, it is important that the process is valid, and that it does not discriminate based on race, gender, age, and other employee characteristics that are protect by law.\nAdditional Areas of Importance\nTo be effective a performance appraisal process is dependent on two additional supporting areas: the job analysis system and the performance appraisal training program.\nWhile this paper is not intended to provide a discussion on how to do a job analysis, it is important that organizations understand why it is essential to conduct a job analysis to develop a valid and fair performance appraisal process. Job analysis is the primary means by which organizations objectively gather and synthesize information about jobs and job families. This information includes the delineation of job competencies (i.e., knowledges, skills, abilities, and other attributes required to perform the job), essential job functions (for ADA requirements), linkages between jobs (for career pathing), and job outputs, just to name a few.\nPerhaps the most important information obtained from a job analysis in terms of developing a performance appraisal process is the determination of the dimensions of job performance that should be assessed, and what the corresponding performance standards should be. The importance of this linkage cannot be overly stressed. It is typically either impossible or impractical to observe all behavior of the employee on the job; the job analysis can help focus the process on what should be observed.\nYou may be wondering why should you have a training program to support your performance appraisal system (especially if you have succeeded in coming up with a simple, easy-to-use one). The training program ""signals"" a commitment to the use of the new process. It will emphasize the proper way to complete the forms, when to complete the forms and how to effectively provide feedback. Training programs also provide an opportunity to raise questions about the process and allow the users to try it out in a ""safe"" environment before actually using it. Finally the training program provides a good time to revisit common evaluation errors such as ""halo, leniency or strictness, use of irrelevant information,"" etc .\nMaybe We Should Just Drop Performance Appraisals\nAfter all of this some of you may be asking yourselves if it isn\'t better to just not have an appraisal process. Today this is not a logical option. Beyond the demonstrated value of providing feedback so employees can improve their performance and grow, there is another very important application. In recent years performance appraisal programs have taken on the added dimension of helping defend decisions of corrective action and termination. A well designed and followed performance process should provide the necessary documentation for job related decisions resulting in corrective action and/or termination. As we have outlined here, they will be based on five principles:\n""OK"" What Works?\nBasically any system that is built on the above five principles. One type of performance appraisal process that we have found particularly useful for a number of our clients is based on a straight forward rating scale, anchoring each point on the scale with position specific behavioral examples, and finally requiring the rater to support their ratings with a brief behavioral statement reflecting the employee\'s performance over the rating period.\nThe following is an example of one area, Interpersonal Skills, from a performance appraisal based on this approach:\n|INTERPERSONAL SKILLS Ability to effectively and fairly guide, assist, and assess performance of employees, and provide insight on how to complete tasks.|\n|1||Not Ready. Fails to provide employees insight on how to complete tasks; unable to motivate employees to finish tasks; fails to notice when employees need help.|\n|2||Acceptable. Consistently shows new employees how to complete tasks; usually notices if employees need assistance; when asked, provides constructive feedback.|\n|3||Very Strong. Willingly provides guidance to all employees; always available to answer questions; willingly provides very effective feedback to employees.|\nNotice the area being evaluated is operationally defined and anchors are provided for each rating scale point. The rating is to be supported by behaviorally based examples which are representative. Any one reviewing it should easily be able to see the relationship between the narrative and the actual rating.\nThe area was identified through a job analysis which also produced specific examples of representative observable behavior. These were used in the design of the performance evaluation form and the supportive training program. By focusing on examples of behavior, the instrument enhances feedback.\nThis paper briefly described the issues and questions that must be addressed to develop and implement a fair and valid performance appraisal process. The effective execution of the procedures described in this paper reinforce a win-win situation for both your organization and your employees. Remember it is a process, not just a static instrument. As your business strategies change, it should be reviewed to see if modifications are necessary to keep it viable.', '5 Pillars of Modern Enterprise Quality Management Systems\nAfter decades spent helping companies develop and implement enterprise quality management systems, a consistent pattern has emerged in all effective system implementations. Regardless of industry, a few very important quality system elements are consistent in building effective quality management systems.\nThis blog focuses on these elements, or “pillars.” Each of the pillars connect to help a company deliver quality products and services to customers and clients. These five attributes are not only powerful building blocks of effective enterprise quality management systems, but they are also industry agnostic.\nPillar 1: Process Integration\nWhile most companies execute on these functions, the degree of integration and automation varies greatly from company to company. The concern of the first pillar is how well these processes are integrated together. For example, if the Customer Complaint process is completely separated from the Corrective Action process, then there is room for improvement.\nThe graphic below is a live workflow diagram. Note that the Customer Complaint Event is linked to the Corrective Action process. The workflow is configured such that if the Customer Event meets certain criteria (such as an identified design problem) a Corrective Action is automatically launched.\nBy clicking on the Customer Complaint ID number, the record opens. The form indicates a problem with Product A1. The Event Description notes that one of five products that were shipped to the customer does not work. Because this is due to a Design Problem, a Corrective Action will be assigned with pre-populated information from the Complaint. See below.\nThis example illustrates the benefits of integrating processes. Integration improves cross-department visibility, increases efficiency and improves accuracy.\nPillar 2: System Flexibility and Extensibility\nUnfortunately, no one can predict what the future holds. Being able to adapt and continuously innovate is extremely important. In summary, the second pillar is all about connectivity, expandability, and configurability. Look for three main attributes when evaluating the adaptability of a quality management system:\n- How easily can it be connected to other systems?\n- How easy is it to automate new processes?\n- For each of those processes what is the effort required to configure that system?\nConnectivity is the ability to connect with other processes or systems across the enterprise and outside of the enterprise. Referring to the figure below (Diagram E3), the MRP system and Quality Management Systems are separated by the corporate cloud.\nIt would be desirable if both systems had a web services interface to connect these processes together in a reliable and secure manner. Alternatively, we may want to connect the MRP system with the MES system. It would be advantageous if each had a programming interface that would allow data to be passed between the two systems. Without these types of connectivity capabilities systems are destined to remain islands.\nExpandability enables you to add unlimited workflows. The beauty of an expandable system with pre-built templates is you don’t have to turn them on unless you need them. If you are evaluating software, look to see how much room for expansion there is. Ensure you can add an unlimited number of additional workflows beyond those delivered to accommodate unforeseen future needs.\nConfigurability eliminates the time and expense of changing low-level source code, reconfiguring databases and building workflows from scratch. Look for systems that have tools including drag-and-drop configuration.\nPillar 3: Centralized Monitoring and Management\nA best of breed enterprise quality management system should provide the following capabilities:\n- Alerts & Notifications: The system should remind users when tasks are due and go late. This helps ensure that projects are completed on schedule which reduces response times and increases customer satisfaction. In addition, alerts should be automatically triggered to let users know of trending problems and performance dips.\n- Reporting: Reports are essential for the monitoring and management of a quality system. Most systems come with canned reports. However, it is important to fully evaluate the reporting capabilities in detail. Enterprise quality management systems should allow you to easily modify existing reports and create new reports without changing source code or database settings. Reports should display real-time data and allow you to drill down into the report details.\n- Measurements & KPIs: Measurement or KPIs are goal-based reports. For example, you have a goal to respond to customer issues within 24 hours. Therefore, you would set up a measurement that tracks responses to that 24-hour goal. Ensure your system allows you to configure these types of reports and automatically notify you when goal thresholds are crossed.\n- Management Dashboards: A good management dashboard allows you to display a user’s work in one easy to read screen. Management dashboards display tasks, reports, and measurement. It helps manage progress, identify trends, monitor goals and be alerted to pending and late tasks.\nPillar 4: Compliance Enablement\nAlmost all industries have regulatory standards and requirements. A modern enterprise quality management system should have compliance built into the system. Compliance should not be an afterthought. For example, your industry may have regulatory requirements for how electronic signatures are handled or how security is controlled. Confirm that the software system you are using provides built-in compliance to these standards.\nAdditionally, it is important to configure enterprise quality management systems to guide users through collecting information required to comply with regulations and standards. In the image shown above, the audit form displays all of the questions required for a specific type of audit. This prompts the user through the correct set of steps for conducting the audit and managing any findings where audit criteria is not met.\nPillar 5: Culture of Quality & Compliance\nEstablishing a culture of quality and compliance, perhaps the most important quality management pillar, shows a commitment from the top that flows down throughout the rest of the organization. A quality system, no matter who well designed, cannot work if there is no visible management buy-in. The attributes of this pillar include:\n- Top-down commitment to quality and compliance\n- Active engagement and communication from management\n- Accountability by executive staff and management\nTop-down commitment means that adequate resources and budgets are committed for quality functions to be effectively performed. When employees see a lack of funding or emphasis on quality functions and systems, it sends a message that quality is not important. Alternatively, active engagement by management can drive a company’s commitment to quality. For example, recognition of quality initiatives and achievements help to build a culture of compliance. Visibility into quality improvements result in a stronger drive for continuous improvement within the company as well as for its customers and clients. Accountability means that company leaders are making decisions that are in the best interest of the customer as not strictly bottom-line driven.\nRegardless of industry or organizational complexity, these five pillars allow companies to form a solid foundation for any quality management system. These pillars are as important to a life science company as they are to an energy company. They apply equally to companies in aerospace, general manufacturing, automotive, or high tech industries.\nWhile establishing these five pillars does require investment, in the long run a company will grow faster and be more profitable when there is an effective enterprise quality management system in place.\nWant to dive deeper?

61	help protect home electric system from lightning and storms what steps needed safety first time homeowner	A comprehensive approach to protect your home's electrical system from lightning involves multiple steps. First, you should have a proper lightning protection system installed, which includes strike termination devices (lightning rods), conductors, and through-structure assemblies. This system must be installed by certified professionals and comply with NFPA, LPI, and UL standards. Additionally, you should install surge protectors and new circuits and breakers in your system to prevent damage from electrical surges that can occur when lightning strikes in your neighborhood. The system should be regularly inspected and maintained, especially checking for moisture, loose connections, and proper insulation. It's crucial to have all installation and maintenance work performed by qualified professionals to ensure safety and system effectiveness.	['Most components of a lightning protection system can last the life of a structure with little maintenance. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of typical roofing systems and rooftop equipment; they need routine servicing, occasional repairs, and, all too frequently, replacement. When this happens, consideration must be given to the existing lightning protection equipment on the roof to ensure that the building remains safe from the ravages of lightning.1\nBefore reroofing can be performed, rooftop elements of the lightning protection system must be removed. Then, after the reroofing, the lightning protection components have to be reinstalled or replaced to restore the integrity of the building’s lightning protection system.\nLightning Protection Components\nA lightning protection system provides multiple paths over which the powerful current of lightning can safely pass through a structure and into the ground. In addition to parts of the system located beneath a roof, the following three types of components are typically found on rooftops:\n- Strike Termination Devices: These rise above the roof and rooftop equipment to intercept lightning strikes before they reach the building. The most frequently used strike termination devices are air terminals, informally called lightning rods.\n- Conductors: These interconnect the strike termination devices with down conductors leading from the top of a structure to the ground. The most frequently used conductors are large-diameter, multi-strand cables.\n- Through-Structure Assemblies: These are used where lightning conductors pass through roofing, insulation, and the roof deck to connect the rooftop network to down conductors and the lightning protection grounding system. (Figure 1)\nThese components must be UL-listed for use in lightning protection systems. They are located in accordance with ANSI-approved standards including National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 780—Installation of Lightning Protection Systems and related standards from the Lightning Protection Institute (LPI) and UL. An assortment of fittings, fasteners, and bases are also required to assemble these components; they are typically fixed to roofing and equipment with exterior-grade construction adhesives or mechanical fasteners.\nThe National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA) cautions, “The installation, evaluation and maintenance of [lightning protection systems] are beyond the expertise of most roofing contractors…” and recommends that the lightning protection work be performed by someone certified by LPI.2 LPI certification require passing multiple rigorous examinations to demonstrate mastery of lightning protection standards and construction methods.3\nQualifications are crucial. Figure 2 shows problems that are representative of lightning protection work performed by unqualified contractors. While some roofers, to be sure, show better craftsmanship, they do not have the in-depth knowledge required to do the job correctly. Further, a roofer that tampers with a lightning protection system is likely to void the system’s certification and become liable for lightning-related problems.\nFigure 2. These examples illustrate the types of defects that occur when a lightning protection system is reinstalled by unqualified individuals. Cables have kinks resulting in bends that are too sharp for lightning to navigate. Other cables are strewn haphazardly across the roof and are not secured or connected as required by lightning protection standards.\nRight: Photo courtesy of Guardian Lightning Protection.\nLeft: Photo courtesy of Smokestack Lightning, Inc.\nThe lightning protection professionals should be on the roof before roofing is torn off to measure and mark the locations of thru-roof assemblies so they can be found after they are covered by new roofing.\nAt the same time, the lightning protection professional will determine whether it makes sense to salvage and reuse existing components. It requires extra labor to remove parts without damaging them, the old parts may not fit exactly into their original locations nor be compatible with new materials, and it is difficult to determine if the old products still comply with current standards. In most cases, new components will be used; the old components will be recycled for the value of the high-grade copper, brass and aluminum they contain.\nWhile existing components can be salvaged and reused if they are in good condition, using new materials it is generally less labor intensive and provides a better looking result. Photo courtesy of Dominion Lightning Rod Co., LTD.\nIf a building is to remain occupied during reroofing, it may be prudent to install temporary lightning protection measures. especially if the building contains highly combustible or explosive materials or is used for mission-critical operations. If there will be a hiatus in the lightning protection, the building owner and tenants should be notified in advance so they can take actions they may deem necessary. And an eye should be kept on the weather report so disruptions to the lightning protection can be postponed when thunderstorms are forecast.\nThe lightning protection installer and the roofer must determine whether the roofing manufacturer has special requirements for the lightning protection system as conditions for getting a roof warranty. The parties should determine, for example, if the proposed adhesives are acceptable to the roofing manufacturer. Some roofing manufactures require application of an extra layer of roofing membrane between lightning protection equipment and the roof membrane. The project specifications should include requirements for documenting that the parties accept each other’s requirements. On large or complex projects, requiring a pre-construction meeting is also advisable.4\nRestoring Lightning Protection\nNRCA suggests roofers and lightning protection contractors coordinate project schedules and work sequencing to ensure efficient installation of their respective activities and minimize return trips to the job site. Coordination will also be required with other trades as the lightning protection system will have to be installed on high points on the building that are not within a zone of protection.5 Examples can include: parapet copings, ladders, access hatches, railings, signs, antenna, drains, plumbing vents, flues, mechanical equipment, and other rooftop appurtenances. Metal fabrications, such as gutters and flashings, may have to be bonded to the lightning protection system to create electrical equipotential throughout the building and prevent lightning from arcing from a lightning conductor onto another metallic path to ground with lower resistance.\nWhile the lightning protection contractor is on the roof, the building owner should have the contractor check the condition of all parts of the lightning protection system that can be accessed from the roof, even parts that are not directly affected by the reroofing. While components are durable, they can be damaged or become detached due to abuse or harsh conditions. Reroofing provides an excellent opportunity to repair such damage.\nItems such as these are primary sites of concern:\n- Chimneys can be damaged by corrosion due to exhaust fumes and their heightened exposure to the elements.\n- HVAC equipment on the roof can be damaged if mishandled during maintenance. For example, air terminals and conductors mounted on an exhaust hood can be damaged if the hood is carelessly removed to service a fan. (Figure 3)\n- Items that have been added to the roof may require surmounting by lightning protection components. This happens, for example, when a building owner or supplier installs a light fixture, security camera, or antenna without the assistance of a lightning protection installer. (Figure 4)\nThe integrity of a lightning protection system rests on specifying a three-pronged approach:\n- System is designed in accordance with recognized standards from NFPA, LPI, and UL.\n- Work is performed by certified installers and contractors. And,\n- Acceptance of the completed project is dependent upon the work being inspected and certified (or recertified) for compliance with the standards.\nThe most widely used certification program is the Lightning Protection Institute – Inspection Program (LPI-IP). If the building is already certified, the reroofed building can apply for LPI-IP’s\nReconditioned Master Certificate to signify that the building’s complete lightning protection system is up to standards. If the existing building is not certified, LPI-IP can issue a Limited Scope Report addressing only work performed in the current Project; alternatively, the building owner should consider getting the entire building certified by bringing both the rooftop and below-roof lightning protection system up to standards. The lightning protection installer is likely to be one of the last trades on a project since the inspection cannot be performed until all the work on a structure is completed.6\nRoofers and lightning protection professionals face common hazards such as working at heights and exposed to weather. It is imperative that they take shelter when a thunderstorm threatens. As the National Weather Service advises, “When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors.”\n1.

There are several types of problems that can occur and impact the way your system operates. For example, your home may suffer from loose connectors that cause sparks. Without proper electrical preventive maintenance, your structure may burn down.\nAs a result, electrical preventive maintenance should be taken very seriously. Thankfully, there are several steps that you can take to ensure that your structure is not damaged. The following electrical preventive maintenance steps will also include the type of problem that it will fix. It will then give you a few steps to take to manage it.\nElectrical Preventive Maintenance Checklist for 2017\nThese simple steps have been tested and confirmed by multiple electricians. They will showcase the best way to maintain your electrical system without causing it any damage. Remember to contact a professional to perform the actual steps for you. Your role in this job is to check for these problems, make sure that they are what you think, and then get a professional to help you.\nStep One: Checking Loose Connections\nOne of the most common problems that plague electrical systems is loose connection. This situation occurs when wires are not connected properly to a system. Typically, about 30 percent of all electrical problems are caused by this situation. As a result, a good electrical preventive maintenance process should start by looking at all of your connections.\nDo you notice any sparks popping up in your system? If you do, it is crucial to turn off your electricity right away and call a professional. Even if you don’t notice sparks, you may see that some connectors aren’t touching correctly or aren’t screwed down all the way. Calling a professional makes sure that these connections get fully repaired as soon as possible.\nStep Two: Moisture in Your System\nObviously, electricity and water are a bad combination. When they are in each other’s company in your home, there’s a chance that your system could burn down very quickly. In fact, about 18 percent of all electrical problems occur because of too much moisture. That’s why it is essential to move to the next step in the electrical preventive maintenance procedure and check for water buildup.\nThis condensation typically occurs on the outside of a unit and should be pretty obvious. If you see any extra water on an electrical item, turn off your electricity and call a professional. There is probably some condition in your building that is letting in water. For example, excessive interior humidity may cause this moisture to build up and create severe damage to your electrical unit.\nStep Three: Gauging Insulation Effectiveness\nNext, it is important to check how well your electrical lines are insulated. This step in the electrical preventive maintenance process requires checking all of your lines and testing their insulation level. Any insulation that is frayed or falling apart must be replaced right away. Again, it is essential to contact a professional to do this step for you.\nHowever, you may also be able to add some electrical tape on frayed insulation to help slow down the need for emergency electrical preventive maintenance. Never add electrical tape to wire if you see sparks or if it is completely frayed. Only add tape if you have turned off the electricity to the area. This way, no flashes will occur.\nStep Four: Avoiding Overloading\nAnother important step in the electrical preventive maintenance process is checking your lines for an overload. Overloads occur if you are using too many of your electrical system at once. For example, running multiple outdoor lights (such as during Christmas) can strain your system and make it operate more poorly. Even worse, it can cause actual damage.\nIf your home suffers from multiple flipped or burned out circuit breakers, you have an overload somewhere. Check your wiring layout to see what area of the house the problem breaker manages. Then, you need to check all your plugins to see if you are running too many systems at once. It may then be necessary to get a better system installed in your home to match your electrical needs.\nStep Five: Dirt in the System\nOne of the most essential, yet least understood, steps in the electrical preventive process is cleaning the system of dirt and other types of stains. This step requires inspecting all of the interior areas of your electrical system and ensuring that no dirt or stains are building up inside. Often, this requires vacuuming or cleaning the area with a rag.\nMake sure to call professionals if the dirt gets too heavy. Excessive dust in the electrical system can cause the wires to overheat. When they overheat, they may ignite and allow a fire to spread. By cleaning out a system thoroughly, you can avoid this danger and also help your system run more efficiently.\nStep Six: Protecting It from Lightning\nLast, but not least, in our electrical preventive maintenance checklist is keeping your home safe from lightning. Lightning strikes are problematic because they can blow out a system or catch it on fire. Installing a lightning rod on top of your home can help keep this dangerous electricity away from your system.\nYou should also install new circuits and breakers in your system to avoid the danger of surges. These surges can happen when an area of your neighborhood gets struck by lightning. Surge protectors are also crucial because they will prevent damage caused by this excess electricity.\nBy now, you should have a pretty good idea of the steps you need to take in the electrical preventative maintenance process. Most of these procedures should be done by a professional. Calling a professional makes sure that you don’t cause any more damage.\nDon’t hesitate to ask a professional for help in this situation. These pros can assess your needs and perform the electrical preventive measures mentioned here. More importantly, they can even take care of additional issues not discussed here to protect your home or business.']	['<urn:uuid:89643eb2-0dbe-4187-9391-2f4cc0b08e23>', '<urn:uuid:8f771feb-3055-4920-ad61-17562121f481>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	16	116	2464
62	How does South Korea's GDP per capita in 2019 compare to Japan's, considering they were close economic competitors in Asia?	In 2019, South Korea's GDP per capita was $31,762, while Japan's was $43,349, showing Japan still maintained a higher GDP per capita despite decades of economic stagnation that had previously brought the two countries to more equivalent levels.	"['To outsiders, it may seem like the deepening rift between Japan and South Korea has blown up out of a clear blue sky.\nFor all the wrangling over the legacy of Japan’s 35-year colonization of the Korean Peninsula, which ended in 1945, there’s far more on paper to join than to separate them. Both are Northeast Asian democracies that have close military and economic ties to the US; potent exports of electronics, cars and cultural products; and a love of seafood and beef.\nAfter decades when postwar growth gave Japan the far wealthier population, its stagnation in recent decades has even put the two countries at roughly equivalent levels of gross domestic product per capita: $40,479 for Korea versus $43,349 in Japan.\nFor all that, though, there’s no strong web of ties binding these two nations. Disputes over restitution for Koreans forced into slavery under Japanese occupation are now hurting Korean sales of Fast Retailing clothing. In turn, the government in Tokyo has moved to curb exports of specialty materials to Korea’s technology giants.\nCompare the Japan-Korea relationship to those between European countries, or the members of the North American Free Trade Association, or even stereotypically unfriendly neighbors like Argentina and Brazil, and you could be mistaken for thinking the two countries were locked in a cold war already.\nJust 7.5 percent of Korea’s $1.07 trillion in bilateral trade is with Japan, making the European Union, the US and China more important partners. The picture is even more dramatic in the other direction. Japan’s $80 billion in bilateral trade with Korea amounts to just 5.8 percent of its $1.38 trillion total.\nThat would seem to go against economic theory. The gravity model of trade predicts that commerce between two countries is largely a result of their respective outputs and the physical distance between them. Two large and adjacent economies ought to be quite closely integrated. That’s not what’s happened: Japan’s exports to Korea are far less than the gravity model would predict, and the same is true in the opposite direction.\nForeign direct investment statistics paint a similar picture. The stock of Korean assets in Japan in 2012 was about 1.8 percent of its outbound stock and a smaller sum than could be found in Canada, Vietnam, India or Germany -- not to mention the US, China and Hong Kong, which together account for almost half the total. Japanese investments in Korea, similarly, come to about 2.5 percent of its total, well behind Brazil, Thailand, Singapore or Australia.\nThe cold war even shows up in foreign exchange markets. Trading between the Korean won and the Japanese yen is so slight that the Bank for International Settlements doesn’t even list turnover on the currency pair, although it does have data for the yen against the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars, the Turkish lira, the South African rand and the Brazilian real.\nHuman factors underline the chilly relationship. More Japanese migrate to the UK, Australia and Brunei than to Korea. While Koreans represent the largest migrant group in Japan (Softbank Group Corp. founder Masoyoshi Son is of Korean-Japanese heritage, as is Lotte Shopping Co. Chairman Shin Dong-bin and former Korean President Lee Myung-bak), they face prejudice even after generations of residency.\nTokyo’s longtime Gov. Shintaro Ishihara was reelected multiple times after making notorious derogatory remarks against people hailing from Japan’s former colonies in a 2000 speech. A 2011 protest by right-wing groups against Korean pop culture in the city reportedly attracted more than 2,000 demonstrators. For its part, Korea banned Japanese cultural products outright until 1998.\nTies aren’t improving much. More Japanese vacationed in Korea in 2009 than in 2018; Japanese have fallen from about two-fifths of total visitors there a decade ago to around a fifth last year, despite a modest recovery in the past couple of years.\nIn one sense, such links shouldn’t matter. The Golden Arches doctrine -- that globalization inevitably begets peace, and no two countries with a McDonald’s have ever gone to war -- has never really held true.\nNonetheless, a more limited version of that view has merit. Close links in finance, migration and culture may not prevent war, but they can at least provide a countervailing force when tensions flare -- something that seems to have kept relations between Singapore and Malaysia, China and Taiwan, and even the US and China far more stable than one might have predicted.\nThe alternative of cold peace pursued by India and Pakistan offers a more fraught path. Japan and Korea, both dwarfed in their neighborhood by an increasingly confident China, ought to work harder to deepen their mutual ties. It’s better to stand together than to fall apart.David Fickling\nDavid Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

63	spinal cord nerve roots intestine muscles compare function	Both the spinal cord and intestine have important muscular functions. The spinal cord's nerve roots control movement and muscle function throughout the body, with different regions controlling specific areas - cervical for arms/hands, thoracic for chest/stomach, and lumbar for legs/bowel. The intestine has its own muscular layers, specifically the muscularis mucosa and muscularis externa, which help with peristalsis (movement of digested material through the gut). Both systems are essential for proper body function - the spinal cord for overall movement control and the intestinal muscles for digestion.	"['Anatomy of the Spinal Cord\nThe spinal cord is part of the central nervous system. This helps control the sense of feeling, movement, and functioning of the body\'s internal organs. Made up of bundles of nerves, the spinal cord carries signals from your body to your brain, and vice versa.\nThe spinal cord is tube-shaped and extends from the brain all the way down to the lumbar, or lower, region of the spine. Branching off from the spinal cord are small nerves, called nerve roots. These roots emerge from small spaces between the vertebrae (the bones that surround the spinal cord) and run to various parts of the body.\nThe entire spinal cord is surrounded by a liquid called cerebrospinal fluid (commonly referred to as CSF). The fluid protects the spinal cord from injury. The spinal cord is also protected by 3 layers of coverings called the meninges—the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater.\nThe spinal cord and spine are divided into 4 regions. Damage to the nerves in the spinal cord can result in various medical conditions, depending on the region that is affected.\n|Click to Enlarge\nThis portion of the spinal cord contains nerve roots that connect to the upper body, arms, and hands. Between the vertebrae in the spine are spongy cushions called intervertebral disks. If the disks collapse, they may ""pinch"" the nerves in the cervical spine, leading to a condition called cervical radiculopathy. This condition can cause pain, weakness, or numbness in the arms. If the cervical region of the spinal cord is severely injured, as from a fall, it can cause quadriplegia, a condition in which most of the body is paralyzed.\nThe nerve roots in the thoracic spine run to the chest and stomach and control movement in those portions of the body. Serious injuries to the thoracic region of the spinal cord can lead to paraplegia, a paralyzation of the lower portion of the body.\nThe lumbar spine is the lower region of the back. Nerve roots coming from the spinal cord in the lumbar spine control the legs, bladder, and bowel. The lumbar region is where the spinal cord ends. It continues as a bundle of nerve roots in the lower back, known as the cauda equina. If an intervertebral disk in the lumbar spine herniates or moves into the space containing a nerve root, lower back pain, or lower extremity pain can result. This is known as lumbar radiculopathy. In severe cases, it can cause cauda equina syndrome, a serious condition that compresses the nerve roots and results in urinary retention, loss of sensation in the groin (saddle anesthesia), and weakness or paralysis of the legs and/or feet.\nThe lowest part of the spine contains 5 pairs of nerves, which control the thighs, lower legs, and the genital and anal areas. Sacral nerve injury can happen when the bones in the sacral region become fractured. This can lead to lower back pain, urinary incontinence or retention, loss of feeling in the foot, and even sexual dysfunction.\nMaintaining a healthy spinal cord\nAlthough some spinal cord injuries, like those from car accidents, can\'t always be avoided, you can take many steps to preserve the health of your spine and the spinal cord nerves within it. Injuries as the result of a car accident may be reduced with the proper use of seat belts and air bags. Maintaining or attaining a healthy weight is suggested because excess pounds can put unnecessary stress on your back. It is also important to maintain good posture and participate in physical activities that strengthen your back muscles. To strengthen the bones of your spine, a calcium-rich diet is also essential. Finally, know your limits and avoid picking up items that are too heavy for you to lift safely.', 'To use all functions of this page, please activate cookies in your browser.\nWith an accout for my.bionity.com you can always see everything at a glance – and you can configure your own website and individual newsletter.\n- My watch list\n- My saved searches\n- My saved topics\n- My newsletter\nIn anatomy, the intestine is the segment of the alimentary canal extending from the stomach to the anus and, in humans and other mammals, consists of two segments, the small intestine and the large intestine. In humans, the small intestine is further subdivided into the duodenum, jejunum and ileum while the large intestine is subdivided into the cecum and colon.\nAdditional recommended knowledge\nStructure and Function\nThe intestinal tract can be broadly divided into two different parts, the small and large intestine. Grayish-purple in color and about 35 mm (1.5 inches) in diameter, the small intestine is the first and longest, measuring 6 meters (20 feet) long average in an adult man. Shorter and relatively stockier, the large intestine is a dark reddish color, measuring roughly 1.5 meters (5 feet) long on average. Both intestines share a general structure with the whole gut, and are composed of several layers. The lumen is the cavity where digested material passes through and from where nutrients are absorbed. Along the whole length of the gut in the glandular epithelium are goblet cells. These secrete mucus which lubricates the passage of food along and protects it from digestive enzymes. Villi are vaginations of the mucosa and increase the overall surface area of the intestine while also containing a lacteal, which is connected to the lymph system and aids in the removal of lipids and tissue fluid from the blood supply. Microvilli are present on the epithelium of a villus and further increase the surface area over which absorption can take place.\nThe next layer is the muscularis mucosa which is a layer of smooth muscle that aids in the action of continued peristalsis along the gut. The submucosa contains nerves, blood vessels and elastic fibre with collagen that stretches with increased capacity but maintains the shape of the intestine. Surrounding this is the muscularis externa which comprises longitudinal and smooth muscle that again helps with continued peristalsis and the movement of digested material out of and along the gut.\nLastly there is the serosa which is made up of loose connective tissue and coated in mucus so as to prevent friction damage from the intestine rubbing against other tissue. Holding all this in place are the mesenteries which suspend the intestine in the abdominal cavity and stop it being disturbed when a person is physically active.\nThe large intestine hosts several kinds of bacteria that deal with molecules the human body is not able to breakdown itself. This is an example of symbiosis. These bacteria also account for the production of gases inside our intestine (this gas is released as flatulence when removed through the anus). However the large intestine is mainly concerned with the absorption of water from digested material (which is regulated by the hypothalamus), the reabsorption of sodium, as well as any nutrients that may have escaped primary digestion in the ileum.\n|This article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.

If your employer does not carry workers' compensation insurance, you may be able to sue your employer in civil court or collect money from a state fund.	['Office Injury: When You Can Sue Beyond Employees’ Compensation in Paulden AZ\nIf you’ve been wounded in the office, you have actually possibly been informed that the only settlement you can receive will certainly originate from your employer’s workers’ compensation insurance. This is the basic regulation, there are several exemptions– situations in which you may be able to take legal action against for damages caused by your injuries. :\nIf you were harmed by a faulty item, you may be able to bring a products liability activity versus the maker of the product.\nIf you were injured by a hazardous compound, you could be able to bring a harmful tort lawsuit against the maker of that compound.\nIf you were injured as a result of your company’s willful or egregious conduct, you may be able to bring an injury suit against your employer.\nIf your employer does not carry employees’ payment insurance coverage, you might be able to sue your employer in civil court or collect cash from a state fund.\nIf a third party triggered your injury, you may be able to bring an injury suit against that person.\nWorkers’ payment can provide cash and also advantages to an injured employee, temporary impairment as well as permanent impairment payments are generally fairly low and don’t compensate the worker for points like pain as well as suffering. Workers’ payment additionally does not provide punitive damages to penalize an employer for inadequate safety and security controls or unsafe conditions. That’s why it is necessary for damaged employees to comprehend their legal rights to bring an instance outside of the employees’ settlement system.\nIn addition to the claims defined in this write-up, you could acquire additional cash from federal government advantages such as Social Safety impairment insurance (SSDI or SSI) if your injury is disabling as well as stops you from functioning.\nIf You Were Harmed by a Faulty Item\nWhen a worker is wounded by an equipment or piece of equipment that is malfunctioning, cannot function appropriately, or is naturally dangerous, the supplier of the machine or devices can be held responsible for the injury if it knew of the threat and/or didn’t appropriately warn the business or workers of the danger. In such a circumstance, the manufacturer would need to make up the employee for points like clinical bills, shed incomes, and pain and also suffering. Example:\nCosts functions in a manufacturing facility that produces office items. Expense could collect employees’ settlement from his company, as well as he likewise has a feasible items obligation instance versus the supplier of the malfunctioning press.\nIf you have been injured by a harmful device or other tools in your work environment, think about talking to an attorney concerning your rights. You could likewise file a problem with the Department of Labor’s Occupational Health and wellness Management if there have been risky conditions, in addition to filing a workers’ compensation claim. This is a particularly important step to take if your employer is still needing you or various other workers to make use of the tools.\nIf You Were Wounded by a Hazardous Substance\nSometimes the chemicals and also other compounds that workers utilize are hazardous and create extreme injuries and diseases. These materials could include such things as asbestos, benzene, chromium compounds, silica, and radium, however any kind of compound that hurts you could possibly be the topic of a legal action for a “poisonous tort.”\nTypically talking, there are 2 kinds of hazardous injuries: intense injuries are obvious promptly, while unrealized injuries could take years to show up. Workers have been effective in claims brought years after their exposure to the poisonous material. When a worker is harmed by a poisonous material, the employee can typically sue the maker of the harmful compound as well as any manufacturers of security equipment that proved to be ineffective in the handling of the hazardous compound.[Top]']	['<urn:uuid:a4f1c3b3-9033-4fb1-ac51-0cccca6bb1f6>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	10	27	652
65	As an art collector focusing on Canadian art, when did both Odjig's print shop open and IAS president Mike Foor-Pessin start collecting?	Daphne Odjig's print shop on Donald Street opened in 1972, while Mike Foor-Pessin began his interest in Inuit and Northern art in 1974 during a trip to Stratford, Ontario.	"['Winnipeg Free Press - PRINT EDITION\nPosted: 08/28/2014 1:00 AM | Comments: 0\nLast Modified: 08/28/2014 1:59 PM | Updates\n\'I don\'t want to see young artists of native ancestry paint themselves into a box in search for authenticity,"" Daphne Odjig writes in the catalogue for 7: Professional Native Indian Artists Inc. ""It is within you.""\nSound advice from an artist who\'s lived by example.\nOdjig, 95 next month, and the six other like-minded artists who first convened at her Donald Street print shop in 1972 stand as models of inventiveness, integrity and self-determination. Supporting one another\'s work in an openly hostile climate, they rejected limiting ideas about what ""Indian art"" could be, asserting their place as equal players on the national cultural stage. With their work, they forged powerful new esthetic traditions that built on history while embracing contemporary indigenous experience and diverse artistic influences.\nDubbed ""the Indian Group of Seven"" (a moniker that stuck), PNIAI members would eventually join the Order of Canada and win Governor General\'s Awards, but 40 years ago, their accomplishments were more often met with indifference or worse. Closing at the WAG Monday after a four-month run, 7 assembles 84 works from the 1970s, a vital early period when ideas and styles were still in flux and many members were at their creative peak.\nNorval Morrisseau is justifiably well-represented. In the 1950s and \'60s, the painter worked in relative isolation to synthesize traditional Anishinaabe forms, crafting a distinctive style that mirrored the liberated flatness of modernists like Picasso and Matisse (both of whom drew on indigenous art for inspiration). A self-described ""shaman-artist,"" Morrisseau worked across artistic and spiritual traditions to explore cultural memory, religious conviction, personal history and inner conflict.\nIn the show, we see Carl Ray and Jackson Beardy adapt and refine Morrisseau\'s Woodlands Style, whose supple linework, bold colour and cutaway perspectives remain hallmarks of Anishinaabe painting and design. Beardy in particular exploited the ""x-ray style"" to vivid effect: snaking outlines weave together imagery and themes of nature, society, transformation and rebirth.\nTrained in the late \'50s at what is now the Alberta College of Art and Design, Alex Janvier pursued abstraction more single-mindedly than any of his peers. Drawing on centuries of Dene abstract design, including quillwork and beading, he crafts serpentine mosaics of colour that unfurl across the canvas with the graphic lyricism of a Mesoamerican codex or Kandinsky painting. Occasionally flirting with representation (a motif from a beaded medallion, the suggestion of a winding river system), the paintings seamlessly fuse disparate esthetic lineages, while Janvier\'s titles and statements about the work locate the within a principled, politicized worldview.\nThough best known for her swirling, flatly graphic take on Woodlands painting, Daphne Odjig\'s work from the \'70s reflected a wider range of influences (but was no less distinctive), marrying sinuous contours and traditional subjects with fragmentary form and shading inspired by early cubism. Dreamlike compositions explore ceremonial, mythological, and personal themes, their gestural handling strongly evocative of abstract expressionism\'s surrealistic early days. Also inspired by surrealism, Joseph Sanchez\'s drawings and prints have a distinct apocalyptic tenor, interweaving messianic visions of the Ghost Dance and Biblical Revelation with harrowing scenes of sexuality and violence.\nThings have improved in 40 years, but even today, indigenous artists risk having their work dismissed as irrelevant on the one hand and inauthentic on the other. It\'s an impossible standard, and 7 triumphantly demonstrates that we\'re all better off when artists ignore it.\nSteven Leyden Cochrane is a Winnipeg-based artist, writer and educator.\nRepublished from the Winnipeg Free Press print edition August 28, 2014 C7\nUpdated on Thursday, August 28, 2014 at 1:59 PM CDT: Replaces image, removes images, adds slideshow\nHaving problems with the form?Contact Us Directly\nOur inconvenience, their way of life\nCollie case dangerous for CFL and player\nIs it Hutch\'s time?\nFacing the unthinkable\nMen, women divided by faith\nBritish series examines dark side of life above the Arctic Circle\nA Happy Light just isn\'t enough\nWorkplace harassment still a work in progress\nPeriod taboo busted\nYou are a balance beam, she needs a pommel horse', 'Current IAS Board Members\nMike Foor-Pessin, President\nMy passion for Inuit and Northern art began on a trip with my wife to the Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario in the summer of 1974. While having lunch in a gallery/tea room, I noticed a display of Inuit stone-cut print reproductions, and I was immediately fascinated by the primitive/archetypal nature of the Inuit’s work. I left Ontario, Canada with one print reproduction entitled, ”Sea Goddess Feeding Her Young.“ After years of study and research into Inuit art, I was fortunate to locate and purchase from a private collection one of the original prints of ”Sea Goddess.“\nSince the mid-seventies, my interest in fine arts has continued to flourish. As a high school and college English teacher, I have integrated the art and literature of Inuit and Northern cultures into my curriculum and developed several classes that joined fine arts with English. For one project, high school students wrote their own myths, and using stone brought south from Canada, carved and displayed their own sculptures. Another project entitled, ”Listening with The Heart“ encouraged students to create original paintings that used the artistic technique of ”X ray vision,“ made famous by the First Peoples’ artist Norval Morriseau. I also gave a talk to fellow teachers on ”The Teacher as Shaman: Mythological Thinking in the Classroom.” By the time I was in the middle of my second decade of teaching, I finally realized that what most fueled my passion for Northern art was how the peoples of the North have relied upon and continue to use the powers of the imagination to survive in one of the most inhospitable places on the earth.\nAlthough my collection of Inuit art runs the gambit of prints, drawings, sculpture, and artifacts, my area of greatest concentration is on the older, more primitive works done by the first generation of artists who made the transition from hunting to art when they left their nomadic lifestyles for settlements. In the art of these ”old masters,“ the mythological and spiritual realms are often depicted.\nI am beginning my fourth year as a member of the IAS as a newly elected board member, and I am looking forward to contributing to an expanding appreciation for this valuable and remarkable culture and the role that its art can play in keeping our imaginations alive, especially in our current world, where reason and technology are the dominate purveyors of our existence.\nLou Jungheim, Treasurer\nMy interest in Inuit art was kindled in 1983 while attending a chemistry conference in Waterloo, Ontario. The university there had a small gallery and I fell in love with a whale sculpture on display. Later that week the plenary lecturers at the conference presented the organizer with this same sculpture so I know it has a good home! In 1991 I married Thalia, a Canadian citizen, thus my trips to Canada became frequent and my exposure to Inuit art much broader. I learned many Canadian homes have a soapstone carving.\nWe started small but after a couple of years another whale sculpture ”spoke to me“ and over the years our Inuit collection has grown to more than sixty mostly large carvings and several prints. These are juxtaposed to a somewhat smaller collection of Northwest Coast Indian art, and an eclectic collection of oil paintings as well as motorsports images which include two Inuit race car carvings.\nThe IAS has been a wonderful find for us as we have been able to learn so much more about the culture and the art than we had been doing on our own. Meeting the artists who have presented at the annual meetings has been especially enriching.\nInuit artists in our collection include: Nuna Parr, Kenojuak Ashevak, Ashevak Tunillie, Pitseolak Niviaqsi, Ohito Ashoona, Kellypalik Qimirpik, Lucassie Ikkidluak, Jaco Ishulutaq, Peter Sevoga, Lucy Tasseor, Tim Pitseolak, Noah Jaw, Eyeetsiak Peter, Jonasie Faber, David and Abraham Ruben, and Floyd Kuptana. The pieces were all selected for their ability to communicate with us and stir our emotions. They also do a wonderful job of helping Thalia feel connected to her homeland.\nWe look forward to traveling to the arctic and experiencing the culture firsthand.\nFred Sparling, Secretary\nJoyce and I started collecting Inuit art in the 1980s with one small piece, two birds pegged to a base. I learned that when they faced each other, all was well, but when facing different directions, we needed to communicate better.\nLove of the art started a quest to see the land and meet the people. Over a decade we visited Baker Lake, Arviat, and Igloolik multiple times, and many other communities at least once. The trips included two Adventure Canada cruises, four canoe trips on some of the great Barren Grounds rivers of the central Inuit, and visits with families in their hamlet homes and in their tundra camps. We became friends with many Inuit, including some well-known artists.\nI am delighted to be able to share with like-minded people, and as a newer member of the Board, to working with the IAS to promote appreciation of the art, and the culture. As a North Carolinian, I hope to help represent the many fans of Inuit art who live outside of the upper Midwest base of the society.\nLaurence Jacobs, Vice President\nLike so many Inuit art collectors and aficionados, Kate and I began more or less by chance, in 1973. We were at a biomedical research meeting at Mont Tremblant; it was August, and the base area gift shop was open. We bought a cute little gray soapstone (it was around $ 10, and though cute, was really quite ordinary and undistinguished). But we were hooked!\nNow, 42 years later, our collection amounts to around 220 pieces of sculpture, nearly 100 prints, a weaving with skin inlays, and a rare hand-sewn sealskin intaglio depicting everyday events (igloo, dogsled, hunter, polar bear). We are traditionalists in our tastes, preferring “classic” period stonecut and stencil prints. Some of our favorite pieces are by Latcholassie, Miki, Tudlik, George Arluk, John Kavik, Jonas Faber, and Henry Evaluardjuk; and among our cherished prints are Sheouaks, Niviaksiaks, Parrs, and Kenojuaks.\nWe’ve been regular Waddington’s auction bidders for many years, and vividly remember being approached by Harry Klamer after an auction at which he regularly outbid us – he said, by way of introduction, “We seem to have similar tastes.” We were later privileged to visit the Klamers at their home near Toronto, and see their remarkable Inuit\nWe now split our time between the NY State Finger Lakes (summers) and Santa Fe, NM (winters), and our collection is split roughly in proportion to the size of the 2 houses – ~ 1/3 in NY, and ~ 2/3 in NM. We strive to rotate the pieces on display at our Santa Fe house, but we’re lacking in discipline, so our favorites tend to stay out, while other pieces and prints are in storage mode.\nI’m delighted to be a part of the IAS and its Board, and I hope to help promote knowledge of, and appreciation for, the remarkable output ofthe talented artists of Nunavut.\nHeather Beecroft, Board Member\nDan Joyce, Board Member\nMarie McCosh, Board Member\nI have been collecting Inuit art since 1972 when a move to Maine gave me a chance to visit an Inuit art gallery in St. Andrews, New Brunswick. We have collected sculpture and prints and make regular trips to Sivertson Gallery’s Inuit art premieres in northern Minnesota. There my daughter and I had the opportunity to take a sculpture call from Ohito Ashoona. Our family’s interest [in Inuit art] is multi-generational – my father passed on some smaller sculptures to the family and several of my children share our interest. I work in the Minneapolis School District in a middle school and have a bachelor’s degree in anthropology with a focus on folklore.\nSheila Romalis, Board Member\nI am an addict. Yes, I have an affliction, but I come by it honestly. I love rocks !!!\nWhen I was 7 years old, in 2nd grade, we were given a project of producing a diorama, on any subject, in a shoe box. I had just seen a National Geographic magazine with an article about Canadian Inuit building igloos near Frobisher Bay. This fascinated me, so I produced my diorama of an Inuit village using eggshells for igloos, cotton batting for snow, toothpicks for a ‘komatik’ (sled), plastic toy dogs for the sled team and brown wool for the leather dog leads. I received ‘A+’\nIt seems that I have always been attracted to our North, to the Inuit people and their Art and I purchased my first sculpture in 1959, from the Vancouver Hudson’s Bay Co. using my own money saved up from baby sitting. That small seal from Belcher Island, now Sanikiluaq, is the cornerstone of my entire collection, because I still love the movement in the grain of the stone. I kept adding to my collection all through High School and University, but only with pieces that whispered to me. When People asked Gary and me what we wanted as a wedding gift, we said, “money toward an Inuit sculpture, please”. 3 sculptures were added after Feb. 3, 1969, as soon as we returned from our honeymoon.\nAfter we came back from living in Israel for 2 years, we had our 3 daughters in 3 years, and then I decided that I needed to change professions and pursue what I had always wanted to do. So, I went back to University and received a Masters in Arctic Anthropology specializing in material culture of Arctic Cultures, and cultural art. I did my fieldwork in East Greenland and Copenhagen. It is what people create within their cultural boundaries that I find beautiful, fascinating and thoroughly absorbing……this art talks to me and tells me stories and I become enriched by it.\nIt was wonderful to finally become connected to the IAS, to meet the interesting people who are members, and to be able to see some of the fantastic collections that being a member of the society affords its members. It opens our eyes, our minds and our imaginations to see the incredible sculptures, prints and creations of the ‘old Masters’ and the newer ‘young artists’ – such creativity is seen nowhere else in such a small population yet is produced by so many as with the Inuit. It is so much fun to ‘talk shop’ with another individual who shares your passion and understanding, and I am sure that is why I enjoy the IAS meetings so thoroughly…….like people with like minds on like subjects !!!\nI do have a major collection of Greenland Tupilaq Figures, many from my late brother, Lorne Balshine’s collection, including 7 Aron Kleist, 2 Cecelia Kleist, 3 Axel Nuko, 3 Rassmus Singertat and 6 Gedeon Qeqe. My Canadian collection includes my favourites that are a Pauta Polar bear and a seal, a Barnabus musk ox, a Joe Talirunilli owl, a Lucy Tasseor Sedna, a Pootoogook Qiatsuq drummer, an Andy Miki animal, an Abe Anghik Ruben multi animals, a George Arluk drummer, a Jonas Faber owl, a Pitsiolak Niviaqsi mother and child, a Judas Ulullaq man with bow and arrow, and an owl, an unknown 1959 seal, an unknown 1968 Arctic hare, a Johnnie Inukpuk Arctic hare, an unknown 1961 owl and a Nelson Taqiraq girl with dog.\nI do have countless more sculptures, but I have only ever bought a sculpture because the stone was magnificent or the subject ’spoke to me’, or the carving was exquisitely executed. Inuit Art actually steals into my heart and my soul and I am captivated……I am addicted to it.\nHopefully, I will be able to be of some help to the society, and I will bring my knowledge and service to the society to the best of my ability. I look forward to the next year.\nJanet Beylin, Board Member\nBoard Members Emeritus\nMy introduction to Inuit culture began in 1976 and was a total accident. I had taken my children to Toronto for the weekend and the science museum was on the agenda. They had a live demonstration of an Inuit camp with men and women working on projects and throat singing. We left with two small soapstone carvings and the seed of an interest that world come to be an important part of my life. I found other soapstone pieces as I sailed (my other passion) the North Channel of Georgian Bay and other Canadian waters. This was followed by my discovery of the Dennos Museum in Traverse City. Now I had a regular source of Inuit sculpture. As fate would have it, my brother settled in Traverse City and the water there is dependably deep for my boat. What good reasons beyond a good source of Inuit art to retire to that community. So that is where I can be found.\nThe next big event was reading about a meeting in Dearborn, MI of people interested in Inuit art. I was able to attend and the rest is history. I am a member of the Inuit Art Society and happy to have found like-minded souls who are touched by this art form.\nClaude M. Weil\nMy first introduction to Inuit (then Eskimo) art occurred in 1971 when I was Director of the Center for Continuing Education at the University of Chicago. A gentleman named Earl Wadjyk, who owned an Eskimo Art Gallery in Madison, Wisconsin called The Great White Bear, approached me and asked whether he might rent some of our space to exhibit and sell some of his wares. Not knowing anything about Eskimo art, I found the idea intriguing and approved his request. A few months later he came for his first show and I was smitten, though I made only a couple small and rather tentative purchases: a head by Ovilu from Eskimo Point and a mother and child by Tuksweetok, also from Eskimo Point. Earl returned to our Center twice annually until 1981 and I started making more substantial purchases, both sculptures and prints. Additionally, my brother had moved to Saskatoon, Canada and my visits there exposed me to further temptation. I also found that the Department of Interior in Washington had a very nice shop where Inuit art could be bought – primarily from Alaska.\nWith the founding of the Inuit Art Society, I became a more regular purchaser and have built a substantial collection of sculptures, prints and other Inuit artifacts. I’ve visited the IAF festival in Ottawa and recently visited Iqaluit. What is it that draws me to Inuit Art. It is part of my interest in folk art acquired while traveling in many parts of the world. I find that Inuit pieces particularly speak to me very directly. They create an intimacy which few other art forms do. I hope that the endearing quality of naiveté will not be lost as Inuk artists are exposed to more sophisticated forms of art.']"	['<urn:uuid:268d0f8c-e9a7-4568-9ba1-3aaab7d7ea96>', '<urn:uuid:dfdd2d8f-894e-4869-be4d-c1349ec3d981>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	22	29	3190

['Infection Prevention Orientation Manual\nSection 9: Environmental Services\nDavid R. Woodard, MSc, CLS, CIC\nDownload a printable PDF Version of this section.\nAt the completion of this section the Infection Preventionist (IP) will:\n- List the considerations for choosing cleaning products\n- List the hierarchy for cleaning and disinfection of equipment (Spaulding classification)\n- List methods to evaluate the cleaning process in the healthcare environment\nNumber of hours\n- Key Concepts – 6 hours\n- Methods – 4 hours\n- Wyoming Infection Prevention Orientation Manual, Section #8 Medical Instrument and Device Reprocessing\nEnvironmental cleaning in the healthcare setting is one of the most often overlooked but key elements in infection prevention. The discipline is generally unseen unless there are problems. The current versions of the regulatory standards for healthcare facilities, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Joint Commission and the Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program do not have specific standards for environmental cleaning and hygiene; they are scored in the infection prevention and leadership standards. Therefore IP must be intimately involved with the development and monitoring of the environmental services (EVS) department’s activities. The entire process of cleaning should be monitored by a multi-disciplinary team of administration, infection prevention, and the EVS personnel.\nDr. E. H. Spaulding classified the cleaning of medical equipment into three general levels: non-critical, semi-critical, and critical. Each of these levels in the classification system is based on the relative risk of the transmission of an infection in the healthcare setting. The plan for cleaning the healthcare environment should evolve from an assessment of the relative risk of infection based on the Spaulding classification, and then scheduled accordingly. For more information on the specifics of cleaning and disinfecting medical devices and equipment, please read the Medical Instrument and Device Reprocessing section (Section #8) of the Wyoming Infection Prevention Orientation Manual.\nProper cleaning and disinfection of the environment requires the right combination of:\n- Equipment (wipes, mops, automated washers, etc.)\n- Supplies (soaps, detergents, disinfectants, etc. at the correct dilutions and for the correct duration of contact time)\n- Personnel (environmental services staff)\n- Training (of those staff on the proper use of said equipment and supplies and compliance with facility policies)\n- Monitoring (of policies and procedures related to cleaning, as well as the overall effectiveness and efficiency of cleaning).\nIndividuals responsible for the cleaning and disinfection of equipment and healthcare environment must receive adequate and appropriate training. Training should be conducted as part of general orientation, remediation (if there are issues or concerns identified), and re-training as products or methods change. Documentation of training should be available to the IP. There should be agreement in the policies as to what constitutes “clean” and how the process is monitored and maintained.\nCheck lists are invaluable in guiding and tracking the effectiveness and efficiency of cleaning and disinfection processes and procedures. The selection and methods of cleaning and disinfection are essential to a successful program.\nThe IP and/or EVS director are responsible for developing a cleaning matrix that includes: the frequency, the product, the responsible individual and any essential comments. The IP meets with the department heads to develop this matrix.\nPrepare a matrix that lists equipment, the type of detergent/disinfectant that should be used, the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting, the responsible party, and any pertinent comments related to the process. Use Table 1 to get started (Please download the printable PDF version of this section, linked at the top of the page, to view Table 1).\nWheelchairs should be assigned “owners” by department to assure their cleanliness. All “rolling stock” should be itemized in this matrix.\nDocumentation and Reporting\nDocumentation of the cleaning/disinfection process helps assure compliance. Additionally, documentation allows EVS managers and the IP to be informed when remediation is needed and to recognize EVS staff when goals are exceeded. Documentation also provides evidence for remediation and reward of met/exceeded goals. It is also used to evaluate the availability of cleaning equipment and the competency of the staff to use and clean the equipment properly. A variety of commercial methods that can be utilized to verify a particular environment is clean. These methods include fluorescent markers (Dazo®) and adenosine triphosphate biolumeninescence assay.\nThe use of environmental culturing as an option for cleaning evaluation has serious limitations and should only be undertaken with the assistance and support of the IP, the hospital or associated microbiology laboratory, administration, and EVS.\nPrepare and complete a list of equipment, an evaluation of the cleaning, and any pertinent comments related to the process in Table 2 (Please download the printable PDF version of this section, linked at the top of the page, to view Table 2).

67	space rock minimum size dangerous earth	Objects above 30 meters in diameter could cause a real problem on Earth. Anything less than that would likely not survive through Earth's atmosphere and would just be a compressive fireball.	['The subtitle of your book – Finding Them Before They Find Us – refers to this role that asteroids play in the destruction of life. How worried should we be that one of these things is going to come hurtling toward us any time soon?\nI don’t think anyone should lose any sleep over this. But as we noted earlier, until the 1990s people just weren’t looking. It’s not as if these things weren’t zipping by every two weeks – they were – we just never saw them. So we were oblivious to the possible danger. Now NASA has been tasked by Congress to actually find and track them. The first goal was to find 90% of the near-Earth asteroids larger than a kilometer and track them, and we’ve done that. The kilometer was selected because the first step was to find the objects that could cause global problems. We’ve found almost 95% of that population so far, and none of them present a threat. Then Congress said, “NASA, good job, now find 90 percent of near-Earth objects 140 meters and larger.” After a few years, we’re 40 percent to reaching that goal. [The diameter] 140 meters was selected because that’s roughly the size of an object hitting the ocean that would cause a tsunami, or hitting land that would cause widespread regional devastation. We’re already starting to move onto the smaller ones, [because] anything above about 30 meters could cause a real problem; anything less than that, it wouldn’t likely survive through Earth’s atmosphere, it would just be a compressive fireball.\nHow do you make that calculation? If you’ve found approximately 40% of the near-Earth asteroids 140 meters and bigger, how do you know what the total number is in order to get a percentage?\nIt’s all done statistically. If our NASA-supported telescopes are searching every night for new near-Earth objects, let’s say over a ten-year period they find 900 objects larger than a kilometer. At the end of that ten-year period, it turns out that for every 10 objects they find, nine of them have already been discovered. Then you would say, alright, we’re at a point where we’ve found 90 percent of the population already, and if we’ve found 900 of them, the total population is likely to be 1000.\nWhat is the best way to find near-Earth asteroids?\nThe ground-based optical observations are finding a lot of these objects. On the other hand, if you’re asking what way would be most efficient, then you would need a near-infrared telescope in space. Because these asteroids are dark, they absorb sunlight and radiate heat, mostly in the infrared, so they’re much easier to see in the infrared than in the optical. Ideally you’d like to have an infrared detector at the back end of a good-sized telescope, in either Earth orbit or one that’s not too dissimilar to the orbit of Venus. That’s the [B612 Foundation] Sentinel approach, and that would be the ideal technique for finding these objects.\nA newly discovered object, Comet ISON, has been in the news lately, and it sounds like we’ll be able to see it bright in the sky this fall.\nIt was found by a couple of Russians at an observatory, International Scientific Optical Network, that’s what the name ISON stands for. This comet is already fairly bright and its out near Jupiter, so if we extrapolate its brightness as it comes in very close to the sun on Thanksgiving Day of this year, it has the potential to be very bright in the morning sky, or actually in the evening sky after sunset. Having said that, I’m old enough to remember Comet Kohoutek back in 1973; we predicted that would be the comet of the century and it turned out to be a bit of a fizzle. Comet brightness and behaviors are notoriously difficult to predict. But, if this comet behaves itself and acts like most comets it will put on a pretty good celestial show come this November.\nWhat seems interesting, and tying it back to your book, is that they only just found it a few months ago. There are still these surprises out there in the sky, so this comet seems like a good argument for why we need to keep looking all the time.\nThat’s true. Comets, some of them get cut from the Oort cloud, which is at the very limit of our solar system, at 100,000 times the distance between the sun and the Earth. It takes millions of years for those objects to get from the Oort cloud to the inner solar system. ISON is a comet from the Oort cloud, so it’s almost certainly on its first return to the inner solar system. It’s scientifically interesting because it really hasn’t evolved much; it’s been out in the deep freeze of this Oort cloud for so long, retaining the percentage of ices and dust that formed some 4.6 billion years ago. With comets that have been around the sun several times, like Halley or other periodic comets, the volatile ices like carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide usually get depleted, and you’re left pretty much just with water ice. But these new [comets], they come in with their entire suite of volatiles – carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia, water – and so they’re the ones that are really the most interesting. I think that’s why astronomers are particularly excited about this comet.']	['<urn:uuid:8112ce58-e1f8-469c-9535-907d97ce97e9>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	6	31	909
68	How much ongoing maintenance is needed to keep a traditional wooden barrier in good condition over time?	Wood fences require considerable maintenance to maintain their appearance and condition. Depending on the paint used and climate, they need annual sanding and painting or staining. In moist climates, the wood can rot, and termites can be problematic. If posts aren't properly cemented, they can lean or fall, causing damage to nearby fence sections. Repairs can be costly as damaged sections may need complete rebuilding with new materials.	['Loading, please wait...\n(4-ft high, 209-yd fence, installed)\nGet free advice and estimates from fence contractors in your city.\nIf you’re thinking about securing your property with a fence so that you can safely let your children play or easily let your pet outside, there are important considerations to keep in mind. Several options are used to build fencing, and this guide will explore wood and chain link. In the sections below, we will explain the differences between these options to help you make an informed decision.\nWood fences provide the most versatility regarding design and finishing options. These fences can be painted to match your home’s exterior and decorative features, and lattice work or metal fixtures can be added for a custom look. Wood fences can be built from different kinds of wood, with the most common being pressure-treated pine. Spruce and cedar are other possible options. These fences range in height and include ranch/split rail, picket, and privacy styles.\nChain link fences have fewer design options and are usually limited to black, green, brown, or silver colors. Generally, chain link fences are used where privacy is less of a concern, and their utilitarian design is ideal for enclosing areas for pets, around HVAC units, or in industrial settings. The fence material is made from galvanized aluminum and can be coated in vinyl 1. Chain link fences are typically only 4 feet in height but can be built to 5- or 6-feet high.\nBoth wood and chain link fences can be installed as a DIY project. However, there is considerable labor involved. Digging holes for fence posts 2 takes a lot of time and effort and typically requires specialized equipment. Fence posts 2 should be cemented into the ground to prevent shifting or leaning over time. Using a professional is recommended because of necessary permits, site inspection, and grading 3.\nWood fences require each fence board to be nailed individually to rail 4 posts. Depending on the size of the fence, this can take many hours to complete. Chain link fences are sold in large rolls, so once the posts are installed the fence material is unrolled and attached to each post. This makes for a quicker installation.\nThe cost of a wood fence is dependant on the style, height, and type of lumber selected. For a 6-foot high, 209-yard privacy fence 5 with a gate, concrete posts, and removal of the old fencing, the cost for materials is between $8 and $18 per linear foot. Labor costs, if charged hourly, are between $25 and $50 per laborer. The total cost for this project ranges between $6,500 and $10,000. Many companies, however, will offer a flat rate quote so that homeowners are not surprised by additional costs.\nChain link fences are a more inexpensive option that can make them attractive for covering large areas in need of security, like around a business or industrial area. For a 4-foot high, 209-yard fence, materials range in price between $7 and $12 per linear foot. Labor costs range between $8 and $15 per linear foot, making the total cost for this project between $3,000 and $5,200 on average. Additional items like gates, vinyl 1 slats, or fabric screens will increase the total cost.\nWood fencing can provide considerable privacy depending on the design used and are ideal for securing a space used for playing, relaxing, or entertaining. A wood fence can be built to various heights to provide additional privacy, like around a pool area.\nChain link fences don’t provide a lot of privacy because the mesh material has large spaces that make these fences virtually see through. Slats can be installed in the chain link material, which provides some privacy. Chain link slats are usually sold by the box. They come in a variety of colors to help your fence blend in with the rest of your property. A box of slats costs around $45, and professional installation adds $2 to $3 per linear foot to the installation cost. Because the slat material is visually unappealing and not very durable, this option is not commonly used.\nWood fencing can completely block light and might not be the best choice if you have plants or a garden nearby. Chain link fences allow a lot of light through and may be ideal if you’re simply looking to limit access to your yard or protect a specific area, like a vegetable garden.\nThe maintenance requirements of wood fences are considerable in order to keep them in good repair and looking great. Depending on the paint used and climate you live in, your wood fence may require annual sanding 6 and painting or staining. Moist or wet climates may cause the wood to rot, and termites can also be a problem. If not properly installed and cemented into the ground, posts can lean or fall and will likely cause damage to the portions of the fence close to the damaged post. Depending on the amount of damage, repairs can be costly as sections of the fence may need to be rebuilt using new materials.\nChain link fences require little maintenance because the metal and other materials used are very durable in a variety of climates. The galvanized metal has been treated using a special process that makes it less likely to rust. Metal is also stronger than wood and won’t sag over time like a wood fence.\nTypically a wood fence lasts around 15 years before it needs replacement. A chain link fence will last approximately 20 years, and if you’ve selected a mesh material coated with vinyl, you can expect an even longer lifespan.\nWood fences may initially seem like a sustainable option, but this is dependent on where and how the wood was harvested. Clear cutting of old-growth forests for lumber can cause significant damage to the surrounding ecosystem. Additionally, many lumber products are treated with toxic chemicals to prohibit insects and mold growth. Chain link fences are made from easily-accessed raw materials, but they still require a significant amount of energy in the manufacturing process.']	['<urn:uuid:d4ec7909-8116-40de-a544-0b94e381e295>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	17	68	1013

It is used in scientific research to explore the interaction between neurotensin and other neurotransmitters in the brain, and produces anxiolytic, anti-addictive and memory-impairing effects in animal studies.\nMethods for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals have improved over the years, however, the technology and tools used to perform synthetic operations have remained the same. Batch-mode processes are still common but many improvements can be made by using modern technologies. Recently, the use of machine-assisted protocols has increased, with flow-based chemical synthesis being extensively investigated. Under dynamic flow regimes, mixing and heat transfer can be more accurately controlled, the use of solid-phase reagents and catalysts can facilitate purification, and tedious downstream processes (workup, extraction, and purification) are reduced.\nSteven V. Ley and co-workers, University of Cambridge, UK, have been evaluating the utility of flow-based syntheses to accelerate multistep routes to highly complex, medically relevant compounds, in this case Meclinertant (SR48692, pictured). They show that new technologies can help to overcome many synthetic issues of the existing batch process. In this case, flow chemistry has allowed control of exothermic events, controlled the superheating of solvents, and streamlined the synthesis by allowing reaction telescoping. It has also helped to prevent back mixing and the accumulation of byproducts. The use of polymer-supported reagents has simplified downstream processing and enhanced the safety of reactions, and in-line monitoring can track hazardous intermediates.\nThese new technologies have been shown to be powerful synthetic tools, although care must be taken not to convert them to expensive solutions to nonexistent problems.\nA Machine-Assisted Flow Synthesis of SR48692: A Probe for the Investigation of Neurotensin Receptor-1,\nClaudio Battilocchio, Benjamin J.

A direct comparison between conventional batch preparation and flow multistep synthesis of selective neurotensine probe SR48692 (Meclinertant) was reported by Ley and co-workers in 2013 (Scheme 6).(25)\nIn this case study, the authors investigated whether flow technology could accelerate a multistep synthesis (i.e., higher yields or lower reaction times) and overcome many synthetic issues (i.e., solid precipitation or accumulation of byproducts). The initial Claisen condensation between ketone 31 and ethyl glyoxalate in the presence of NaOEt as base and EtOH as solvent in batch is run at room temperature and product 32 is obtained in 60% yield after 3 h stirring.\nSuperheating (heat above solvent boiling point) the reaction in flow provided a faster alternative: using a 52 mL PFA reactor coil at 115 °C with a residence time of 22 min gave the corresponding product 32 in 74% yield. In order to solve some problems of solid accumulation an ad-hoc pressurized stainless-steel tank (5 bar, nitrogen) was designed; it allowed to run the reaction continuously without any precipitation or blockage.\nThe following reaction between 32 and commercially available hydrazine 33 was performed in DMF in the presence of concentrated H2SO4. After 52 min of residence time at 140 °C into a 52 mL PFA reactor coil the crude mixture was treated with an Na2CO3 aq. and then inline extracted through a semipermeable membrane with CH2Cl2. After crystallization, pyrazole ester 34 was isolated in 89% yield.\nThe corresponding reaction in batch was conducted in DMF under microwaves irradiation at 140 °C for 2 h. Running the reaction in batch on the same scale as in flow (3.58 mmol) gave product 34 in a lower yield (70%). The subsequent hydrolysis was performed combining a THF solution of ester 34 and 3 M aqueous KOH. The reaction was performed inside a 14 mL PFA reactor coil heated at 140 °C with a residence time of 14 min.\nUpon treatment with 3 M HCl aq., acid 35 precipitated, and it was isolated by filtration in 90% yield. In this case, the corresponding batch hydrolysis afforded product 35 with the same yield (90%); however, a longer reaction time (1.5 h) was required. The final amide formation was performed by reacting acid 35 (activated as acyl chloride) and protected amino alcohol 37through a telescoped synthesis. Triphosgene 36 (a safer substitute for phosgene) was found to be the best acid activator.\nTriphosgene decomposition occurred in the presence of DIPEA at 100 °C into a stainless steel heat exchanger, where phosgene was generated. The crude mixture, containing also acid 35, then passed into a 2.5 mL stainless steel reactor coil at 25 °C, to complete the formation of the corresponding acyl chloride. An inline Flow-IR spectrometer(26)was used to monitor the formation of phosgene without exposing the operator to the toxic gas during analysis. As soon as acyl chloride was formed it was reacted with protected amino alcohol 37.\nThe amide formation took place into a 14 mL stainless steel reactor coil at 100 °C with a residence time of 75 s. Amide 38 was isolated in 85% yield after quenching with NH4Cl and extraction with AcOEt. For obvious safety concerns, avoiding the handling of phosgene and the isolation of highly reactive acyl chloride intermediate represent a remarkable improvement with respect to batch procedure.\nFinally, meclinertant 39 was obtained after deprotection of ester38 by using a polymer-supported sulfonic acid. The last synthetic step was conducted in batch on a small scale; however, it could be easily transferred to flow mode by using a column packed with commercially available polymer-supported sulfonic acid.\n24 Ley, S.

J. 2013, 19, 7917, DOI: 10.1002/chem.201300696\nCLIP AND ITS OWN REFERENCES\nThe choice of the flow reactor also plays a key role in the synthesis of meclinertant (SR48692, 103), which is a potent probe for investigating neurotensin receptor-1 . The flow synthesis of this challenging compound was reported in 2013 and aims to evaluate the benefits of flow chemistry in order to avoid shortcomings of previous batch synthesis efforts particularly in regard to scale up .\nThe investigation first involved the preparation of the key acetophenone starting material 112 which although commercially available was expensive and could be generated from 1,3-cyclohexadione (104). The sequence consisted of O-acetylation, a Steglich rearrangement, oxidation and a final methylation reaction.\nAs the use of flow chemistry had already improved the O-acetylation during scale-up tests (130 mmol) by avoiding exotherms, it was anticipated that the subsequent Steglich rearrangement could be accomplished in flow using catalytic DMAP instead of stoichiometric AlCl3 as precedented (Scheme 19).\nThis was eventually realised by preparing a monolithic flow reactor functionalised with DMAP that proved far superior to commercially available DMAP on resin. Employing the monolithic reactor cleanly catalysed the rearrangement step when a solution of 106 was passed through the reactor at elevated temperature (100 °C, 20 min residence time).\nThe resulting triketone 107 was telescoped into an iodine mediated aromatisation, followed by high temperature mono-methylation using dimethyl carbonate/dimethylimidazole as a more benign alternative to methyl iodide at scale.\nThe subsequent Claisen condensation step between ketone 112 and diethyl oxalate (113) was reportedly hampered by product precipitation and clogging problems, thus a pressure chamber was developed  that would act as a pressure regulator allowing this step to be scaled up in flow in order to provide 114 on multigram scale (134 g/h).\nA Knorr pyrazole formation between 114 and commercially available hydrazine 115 had previously been found difficult to scale up in batch (the yield dropped from 87% to 70%) and was thus translated into a high temperature flow protocol (140 °C) delivering the desired product 116 in 89% yield (Scheme 20).\nEster hydrolysis and a triphosgene (118) mediated amide bond formation between acid 117 and adamantane-derived aminoester119  completed this flow synthesis. Meclinertant (103) was subsequently obtained after batch deprotection using polymer supported sulfonic acid.\nOverall, this study showcases how flow chemistry can be applied to gain benefits when faced with problems during mesoscale synthesis of a complex molecule. However, despite the successful completion of this campaign, it could be argued that the development time required for such a complex molecule in flow can be protracted; therefore both synthetic route and available enabling technologies should be carefully examined before embarking upon such an endeavour.\n|92 Myers, R.

70	what year was animal health ireland established and what type of organization is it	Animal Health Ireland was established in 2009 as a not-for-profit organization. It was tasked with providing knowledge, education and coordination required to establish effective control programmes for non-regulated diseases of livestock.	['At the end of 2019, Animal Health Ireland (AHI) celebrated its 10th anniversary.\nIt was an opportunity to reflect on the progress that has been made over that time, in animal health in Irish cattle herds, both dairy and beef. AHI was established in 2009, as a not-for-profit organisation, tasked with providing the knowledge, education and coordination required to establish effective control programmes for non-regulated diseases of livestock. Its mission is to improve the sustainability, profitability and competitiveness of Irish farming and the agri-food sector though superior animal health. AHI has been, and continues to be, co-funded by industry and government which is a positive reflection of the value placed by the industry on AHI. Over the last decade several national programmes and project areas have developed, and indeed in the last 12 months AHI’s remit had broadened to include the pig sector.\nOne such programme is CellCheck, which is the national mastitis control programme, which launched in 2010. Development of CellCheck was guided by learnings and resources from Irish research and international mastitis control programmes, particularly Countdown Downunder from Australia (Brightling et al., 2009). CellCheck was established in response to industry concern that bulk tank somatic cell counts (SCC) had been slowly rising since the late 90’s (Berry et al., 2006). It was also recognised that there was little or no coordinated approach to mastitis control at that time, often with inconsistent advice being given to farmers from various sources. In addition, while the impending abolition of quotas, which then came about in 2015, was recognised as an opportunity for Ireland, it was also accepted that it would present challenges for the industry. Ensuring optimal udder health and milk quality was one way that suppliers and processors could maximise profitability, remaining sustainable and competitive in challenging markets and times.\nAs with the other national programmes co-ordinated and led by AHI, CellCheck is supported by a Technical Working Group (TWG) and an Implementation Group (IG). The TWG is comprised of experts and experienced practitioners from a variety of fields who are tasked with drawing up factual resources, the development of decision-making tools, and the identification of areas for further research and development. By giving of their time free of charge, these experts enable AHI to access the technical resources required to develop its various programmes at a fraction of the true commercial cost of such expertise. The CellCheck Implementation Group plays a key role in the strategic direction and delivery of the CellCheck programme, as well as exploring and addressing the key industry challenges. The IG is composed of representatives from all industry stakeholder bodies. These individuals not only have an intimate working knowledge of their sectors, but also have a clear and strong mandate to articulate positions on behalf of their parent organisations and to engage robustly with the issues under consideration. In conjunction with the TWG, the IG is responsible for the development, implementation and monitoring of the programme.\nSignificant progress has been made in the udder health of the national herd, since the establishment of CellCheck. One of the most important activities within the CellCheck programme has been to establish a national SCC database. Since 2014, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine (DAFM) has been collecting bulk tank SCC data directly from the milk processors and co-ops. Currently, there are 16 milk purchasers submitting data to this central dataset, which accounts for over 95% of the national milk pool. This dataset has been invaluable in agreeing common industry targets and demonstrating progress in udder health nationally.\nThere has been a reduction in the national bulk tank somatic cell count (SCC) from 272,000 cells/mL in 2009, to 183,000 cells/mL in 2018 (Fig 1.).\nIn 2013, 39% of herds had an annual average SCC of 200,000 cells/ml or less, while in 2018, this had increased to 62%. Similar improvements were seen in the national milk pool, with the quantity of milk with an SCC<200,000 cells/mL increasing from 46% in 2013 to 65% in 2018 (Fig.2).\nNeedless to say, standards of udder health are not something that we can become complacent about however, as we can see with the slight rise in bulk tank SCC and the decline in herds and milk volume with an SCC of 200,000 cells/mL or less, between 2017 and 2018. This was undoubtedly influenced by the extreme and unprecedented weather challenges that were encountered in Ireland in 2018. Preliminary analysis of the 2019 data indicates that this ‘hiccup’ has resolved, and udder health performance has returned to 2017 levels.\n2019 was the 6th year of the CellCheck “Milking for Quality” awards. These awards are given to the 500 farmers with the best SCC results each year, based on the national SCC dataset. It is an opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate the excellent udder health performance on so many Irish dairy farms, with an annual national event attended by nearly 700 people! The SCC range of the 500 winners has narrowed year after year since the awards first started. In 2014, all winners had an SCC of 103,000 cells/mL or less, while by 2019 a winning SCC was 76,500 cells/mL or less. The awards are based on the bulk tank SCC data from the previous year, and so it was interesting and inspiring to see that despite the adverse conditions of 2018, the SCC results showed that udder health can still be maintained, through best practice (Fig 3).\nThis national improvement in udder health has also allowed farmers to increasingly adopt the “prevention is better than cure” approach, with a reduction in the numbers of mastitis treatments being used (More et al., 2017). In the last decade there has been a 34% reduction in the number of mastitis treatments used (per 100 cows) during lactation (Fig 4).\nSo what does of all this progress mean for Irish farmers? Well the tangible benefit of better mastitis control is more profit. In the early days of the CellCheck programme, Teagasc completed a piece of economic research, which quantified the potential gains to be made from reducing the average SCC of a dairy herd in Ireland (Geary et al., 2013). In partnership with Teagasc we recently completed an additional economic exercise and\n...

71	What made castles strong and what weapons could destroy them?	Castles were made strong through round towers, thick walls, moats, and gatehouses with arrow loops for defense. However, they could be destroyed by siege weapons like mangonels that hurled giant rocks, siege towers that allowed soldiers to attack over walls, and battering rams that could break down castle gates.	['Summary: Castles were a popular form of defense, used mainly during the instability of the Medieval period\nDate: 9th and 10th Centuries to perhaps the 16th Century\nLocation: Across Europe, Asia Minor and the Middle East (with variants in other parts of the world)\n- Introduction -\nThe huge fortress stood menacingly on the hill. Its thick stone walls surrounded the inner walls, towers and buildings. Often, when you picture the Middle Ages, Castles spring to mind. They were strong and helpful in those days, but are they useful today?\nLet’s suppose you are a rich nobleman living in the Middle Ages, you might be encouraged by the king to build a castle. Why? Well, when newly conquered land needed securing, a castle would be the most effective mode for defence.\nTypically, a castle was constructed in an elevated area so that the occupants could have a good view of the surroundings. Farmers and tradesmen were also encouraged to work the land and build homes near the castle, which would protect them from raids. The town was well planned. Around the houses, a strong wall was erected, and crops grew on the land that stretched out beyond the wall. Such escapades, as you might imagine, were not cheap and the king was often low in money but with clever advertising, he could sometimes persuade richer nobles to fund the business of castle building in his stead.\n- Liberating England -\nPerhaps you were convinced that building a castle was an intriguing idea. How would you proceed? To start, you would build a palisade, which is a temporary wooden fence made of sticks poking up vertically out of the ground. You put it there to secure the spot before you can construct a permanent wall. Outside the wall, you would dig a moat. It could have water in it or simply be left dry.\nUnless your castle was near a river, the ditch would be difficult and costly to fill. However, if you could fill the moat, it would be practically impossible for an enemy to dig under the wall. The drawbridge was also important. It acts a lot like a see-saw, with a pivot point and counter weights.\nDuring an attack, the heavy wooden ramp was tilted up to block the entrance, stopping the enemy from crossing the moat. The gatehouse protected the vulnerable entrance, and was made of towers, gates and arrow loops. Obviously, the wall had to be very thick, as it had a very large area to protect. The wall was supported by round towers, which were stronger than square ones because they weren’t as easy to topple. Castles were complicated yet simple and wonderfully designed for defence.\n- Name -\nWhat if, as time wore on, you could not continue to maintain your castle due to the development of stronger cannons and mortars and the growing costs of continually rebuilding the walls. As time wore on these problems appeared more frequently to nobles. Castles slowly diminished. Over the years many of them either fell into ruin or became more like fortified cities, very few lasted. The neglected castles that fell into disrepair were often torn apart to make new buildings.\nGradually, it became clear that wooden fortresses with walls of dirt and rock were easier and faster to set up. Because of technological advancements in heavy cannons and the cost of constructing castles, many of them no longer exist today.\nThe castles that remain have been restored and are used as homes, historical sites, hotels and more. Therefore, castles are useful today, but in a very different way than they were many years ago.\n1. Castles, U., Ireland, N., Castles, E., Castle, L., Designs, C., Book!, B., Me, C. and Policy, P.

(1977). Castle. New York: Sandpiper Houghton Mifflin.\nResearched and Written By\nCastles are one of the things foremost in our minds when we think of the Medieval age. But what is the true history of these gigantic defensive structures?', 'Medieval times in Europe saw extensive construction of castles for defence and strategic purposes. Thus various castle siege weapons were developed by the invading armies in order to conquer the castles. These siege weapons were not always successful but nonetheless played a very important role in the battle and were central to the fall of the medieval castle.\nThe ballista was very important siege weapon that could launch multiple arrows at once. The ballista siege weapon was so effective that it was used by both attacking and defending soldiers in Castle siege warfare. Read more about the Ballista Siege Weapon >>\nThe Battering ram was used to literally batter down the vulnerable parts of a medieval castle. Some battering rams had covers that protected soldiers from the enemy fire coming from the castle. Read more about the Battering Ram >>\nMangonel Siege weapons were a specialised type of large medieval catapult weapon that were used by medieval armies to hurl giant rocks and other projectiles at the castle walls they were attacking. Read more about the Mangonel Siege Weapon >>\nMedieval Castles were attacked by a variety of ingenious siege weapons that became more advanced as the medieval period progressed Read more about the Siege Attack Weapons List >>\nMedieval siege towers were usually large wooden structures of the same height as Castle walls. From the top of the medieval siege tower soldiers could attack the top of the enemies Castle walls across a wooden platform. Read more about the Siege Towers >>\nMedieval Trebuchet Siege Weapons had the power to bring down castles walls. Trebuchets were like giant mechanised slings with incredible destructive power against medieval castles. Read more about the Trebuchet Siege Weapon >>\nVarious types of castle siege weapons were developed over the centuries. Advanced engineering techniques were used in some of them while others were relatively simple. Some of the most popular castle siege weapons used during the medieval times included the Ballista, Mangonel, battering rams, catapults, siege towers, and Trebuchets.\nThe Ballista was one of the most important castle siege weapons whose shape was similar to that of a large crossbow. It worked on the same principle that a dart-throwing machine works, only on a much larger scale. Heavy bolts, darts, and pieces of iron could be aimed at the castle with a Ballista. It was used in the ancient world as well but became widely popular during the medieval times.\nThe Mangonel was another popular castle siege weapon which was quite similar to a catapult and was used to fire heavy projectiles from a large bucket attached to it. It had an advantage over other catapults that its design was simpler and thus it could be constructed easily. However, the Mangonel was not as accurate in hitting it’s target as a Ballista. Just like a Ballista, it was used in the ancient world but became more famous during medieval times.\nAmong the most common form of castle siege weapons were battering rams which could be made into various sizes and shapes. For instance, there were simple log battering rams, battering rams with flat heads, battering rams with iron or bronze heads, battering rams with actual ram’s style head, and others. Sometimes a roof was used on the battering ram in order to protect the soldiers from incoming enemy missiles. This roof was called a penthouse. Use of battering rams was quite popular because they were very simple to construct and easy to operate. However, they could only be used once the castle gate had been approached.\nVarious other kinds of castle siege weapons were also prevalent during the medieval times. For instance, there was a Trebuchet which was not very different from a catapult. It was mainly used to throw heavy stones and rocks at the castle gate and walls to demolish them. Similarly, another castle siege weapon was called a siege tower which was mainly constructed to protect soldiers and ladders while approaching the castle walls.\nCastle siege weapons played a very important role in conquering a medieval castle. Without these weapons, it was almost unthinkable to defeat the army within the castle. Thus, over the centuries, various new castle siege weapons were constructed with sophisticated techniques, although many of these castle siege weapons were also prevalent in the ancient times. Their use, however, became particularly widespread during the medieval times when large number of castles was built.']	['<urn:uuid:e61c600b-f24a-470a-bca7-9773994d51a7>', '<urn:uuid:8fadab8c-8229-43ec-a443-fbe12cc74c28>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	10	49	1439
72	main components technology steps blast furnace steelmaking iron production diagram overview explain	Iron production in a blast furnace involves multiple key components and steps. Iron ore (commonly haematite Fe2O3), limestone (CaCO3), and coke are fed into the top of the blast furnace as the charge. Hot air is blown in from the bottom. The limestone decomposes to form calcium oxide which reacts with sandy impurities to form slag. Through an oxidation-reduction reaction, the iron ore is reduced to molten iron containing carbon. This molten iron is then typically transferred directly to steelmaking operations. The process involves careful control of material flows and temperatures throughout the furnace's different technological zones. The entire system operates continuously for long periods to efficiently convert iron ore into pig iron, which serves as the basis for steel production.

This is done in a blast furnace. The most common ore of iron is called haematite (iron(iii) oxide). Its formula is Fe 2 O 3.\nIron Extraction Process. In the blast furnace process, the first step on the way towards heavy plate, pig iron is produced from iron ore. The composition of the ore and additions is accurately adjusted to the final products of AG der Dillinger Hüttenwerke and Saarstahl AG.\nThe production of iron from its ore involves an oxidation-reduction reaction carried out in a blast furnace. Iron ore is usually a mixture of iron and vast quantities of impurities such as sand and clay referred to as gangue. The iron found in iron ores are found in the form of iron oxides.\nExtraction of Iron using blast furnace and various types of Steel: Iron ore is reduced to iron by heating them with coke (a form of carbon) in blast furnace. As mentioned earlier, common iron ores are hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4).

Many people want to get the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certificate, but it is one of the most difficult and sought-after ones in IT. Today, many enterprises have highly sought-after expertise in the design, implementation, and management of world-class cybersecurity initiatives. Therefore, companies are eager to hire CISSP-certified employees.\nTo be successful on the exam, candidates must have a thorough understanding of cybersecurity and practical expertise in the industry. Getting the CISSP certification on your first try is possible if you know what to expect from the exam.\nAs a result, you can expect to land a job as a security consultant, security auditor, security consultant, or security system engineer after obtaining the CISSP credential. As a CISSP, you’ll be tasked with developing workplace procedures and methods for safeguarding computer networks. To protect the assets from the outside world’s threats, you’ll be integrating security mechanisms into the IT networks.\nWhat Is the CISSP?\nThe acronym CISSP refers to a person who has achieved certification in information system security. The International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium, also known as (ISC)², assesses IT professionals’ knowledge of advanced IT security threats, controls, and technologies.\nCISSP certification benefits from being vendor agnostic. In this way, you may get the hands-on experience you need without having to settle with just one platform.\nThe CISSP exam is six hours in length. ” Each of the eight domains of the (ISC)² Common Body of Knowledge is represented by a set of 250 multiple-choice and advance questions (CBK).\nHow Much Does the CISSP Certification Cost?\nThe CISSP certification exam typically costs $749, although the exact price and additional fees vary depending on where you sit for the exam. An additional $50 fee will be assessed for rescheduling your exam. You’ll have to pay $100 if you have to cancel.\nFor the next three years, you will be able to keep your certification if you complete the exam. During that time, you’ll have to pay an annual fee and submit 40 CPE credits each year for maintenance.\nAfter three years, you’ll have to recertify if you don’t renew your certification.\nCISSP Courses Cost\n|Location||CISSP course fee|\n|USA / Canada||US$ 2000 – US$ 2800|\n|India / Pakistan||US$ 300 – US$ 600|\n|Europe||US$ 2600 – US$ 3200|\n|UAE / Saudi Arabia||US$ 800 – US$ 1300|\n|New Zealand / Australia||US$ 2000 – US$ 2600|\nCourse providers in your area that provide CISSP classes will assist you if you want to learn in person. These organizations may offer the CISSP course regularly, and some may also provide customized training for individuals. You can talk to them about your alternatives and pick the best one for you.\nHowever, CISSP classroom courses are relatively expensive. The cost of classroom-based training is substantially more than that of online or self-paced choices; therefore, this kind of training may increase the total cost of your CISSP certification.\nWhat Are the CISSP Certification Exam Requirements?\nThe CISSP certification has two primary prerequisites. The first and most important thing to remember is to complete the exam. In a moment, we’ll go into greater depth on this.\nIn the meantime, let’s talk about the other requirement: work history. (ISC)² mandates that CISSP certifications be for experienced professionals only, as indicated above. CISSP certification requires five years of full-time job experience in two of the eight CISSP domains listed above to be eligible for certification. A year of experience can be substituted for a college degree or another (ISC)² approved certification, and internships and part-time work can contribute towards this criterion. The fine print can be found on the (ISC)² website.\nTo earn and retain your CISSP certification, you’ll have to pay fees, which we’ll discuss later in this article.\nWhat are the CISSP domains?\nThe subject matter that the CISSP certification covers is called CISSP domains. CISSP is an advanced certification. Thus, it isn’t for everyone who wants to pursue it. Experienced cybersecurity practitioners, managers, and executives can use it to certify that they have a thorough understanding of the various principles of cyber security.\nThe domains in the CISSP certification are:\n- computer security\n- communications and network security\n- information security – operations\n- information security – design\n- physical (environmental) security\n- legal, regulations, policy, and governance\n- business continuity management; risk management\n- applied cryptography\n- software development security.\nWho should get a CISSP Certification?\nThe “gold standard” of security certifications, the CISSP, has been referred to by some as just that. You’ll typically find a CISSP is a requirement or at least highly recommended while screening cybersecurity positions. It’s beneficial if you’re considering a United States federal government career. The CISSP certification is a sign of an infosec generalist because of the wide range of technical expertise it requires.\nCISSP isn’t for everyone, however. A CompTIA Security+ certification may be a better option for those just starting in their careers in CISSP due to its lower entry-level requirements in terms of technical knowledge and work experience. The CISSP exam also tests your knowledge of management and technical skills, which is why you’ll need some work experience before you begin the CISSP path.\nTips for Passing the CISSP Certification Exam\nThe CISSP exam is notoriously difficult. You must score at least 700 out of a possible 1,000 points to demonstrate your knowledge and expertise in each topic and pass the certification.\nCISSP certification exams are difficult to study for; therefore, here are the tips for passing the CISSP certification exam to help you succeed:\nLocate a Variety of Research Resources\nAn outline, a study guide, sample tests, and more are all available to help you prepare for the (ISC)2 certification exam. Download an official study software, buy the official textbook and use the CISSP flashcards for additional preparation options. Even though all of these resources are beneficial, passing the exam on your own is difficult.\nTo succeed on the CISSP exam, you’ll need to use various study methods, including self-study, CISSP Boot Camp, and formal CISSP Training. CISSP Courses can be taken in a classroom with other professionals, in a small group with friends, or privately with an instructor.\nForm a Team With Your Friends\nStudying in a group can lead to wonderful group conversations and help you better understand subjects you don’t understand. Attending a CISSP training course lets you meet others going through the same subject as you.\nYou can also search for discussion forums online or start your study group. Attend meetings for security professionals to make new friends and learn from others who have already passed the exam.\nMaintain a Healthy Work-Life Balance\nThere is a lot of work involved in preparing for the CISSP exam. You’re probably juggling your studies with a full-time job and other commitments outside of school. Scheduling particular study times is the most effective technique.\nTo be fully prepared for the exam, it’s essential to balance studying and completing practice exams. The week before your exam, plan to study for at least a month to avoid cramming in the last few days.\nThe CISSP exam\nThere are about equal numbers of questions from each domain listed above in the CISSP exam. The CISSP exam outline includes a breakdown of the content and a description of what to expect on test day. “Advanced inventive things” are referred to as multiple-choice questions. Identifying diagram elements and dragging and dropping responses from one side of the screen to boxes on the other are two types of questions that sound more difficult than they are.\nThe exam is computer-adaptive, and this is how it is administered in English (CAT). Essentially, this means that when you take the exam, a computer monitors your progress and adjusts to your questions. In this version of the test, there are between 100 and 150 questions, and it takes around three hours to complete. There are 250 questions, and it takes roughly six hours to complete the test in all other languages, which is linear (meaning that the questions are the same no matter how you answer). A 700-point minimum is required to pass either type of test.\nIt’s easy to schedule your exam with the help of (ISC)²’s resource page, which also provides information on exam formats and what to expect when you take the test. Check out Dex Yuan’s LinkedIn article and the (ISC)2 community forums and Reddit if you’re looking for real-world test-takers reports on how the exam experience went. It’s nice that you can see a preliminary result of your performance at the testing location so that you can plan accordingly.']"	['<urn:uuid:924308c0-7f41-40ec-9926-fbf6085dc0c9>', '<urn:uuid:455e73c3-285d-4ec5-9eeb-ab099891d50c>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	6	33	2281
75	patronage mantua florence linked renaissance artists	Both Mantua and Florence had significant patronage of Renaissance artists. In Mantua, Ludovico Il Gonzaga appointed Andrea Mantegna as court artist in 1460 with a very large salary of seventy-five lire a month, making him the first painter of repute based in Mantua. In Florence, the leading families, particularly the Medici and their banking clients, were important patrons of artists like Botticelli, who was one of the most esteemed painters in Italy during his lifetime.	"['The artist I am featuring today is the fifteenth century painter, Andrea Mantegna, who created many magnificent religious works. Andrea Mantegna was born into a lower working-class family in late 1490 or early 1491 in Isola di Carturo a small village close to Padua which was then within the Republic of Venice. His father, Biagio, was a carpenter. When he was eleven years of age he started an apprenticeship with Francesco Squarcione, an Italian painter from Padua. His school was very popular at the time and over a hundred painters passed through the school. Padua, then, was looked upon as a great place to be if you were and aspiring artist and the likes of Uccello, Lippi and Donatello spent time in the city. Mantegna, who was gifted with a precocious talent, stayed with his tutor for six years.\nAlthough he gained a great reputation as an artist and was admired by many, he left Padua and spent most of his life in Verona, Mantua and Rome where he carried on with his paintings. In 1460 he entered the service of Ludovico Il Gonzaga the Marquis of Mantua as his court artist. This engagement earned Mantegna a great deal of money which was a sign of the high regard in which his work was held. Whilst employed by Gonzaga he completed many fresco paintings of the Gonzaga family.\nOne of his early works was the St Luke polyptych which he completed as the altarpiece for a Benedictine Abbey of Santa Giustina in Padua.\nSanta Giustina (St. Justina) is depicted at the lower level of the altarpiece at the far right. She is identified by the palm branch (a symbol of martyrdom) and the short sword in her breast which refers to her martyrdom in Padua in AD 303, during the persecutions of the Christians by the Roman Emperor Maximian.\nIn the central panel of the polyptych we see St. Luke depicted writing his gospel. Although many depictions of the saint feature an ox or calf, they are absent but in keeping faith with the fact this is an altarpiece for a Benedictine abbey, Mantegna has provided Luke him with a monk’s tonsure.\nAbove St. Luke, we see two saints either side of an image of the Man of Sorrows. This is an iconic religious image that shows Christ, usually naked above the waist, with the wounds of his Passion prominently displayed on his hands and side.\nThe panel to the far right of that portrays St. Julian the Hospitaller, a Roman Catholic saint, depicted as a young nobleman. As in many depictions of this saint, he is holding a wrapped sword, held downward. In his left hand he holds a palm branch symbolising martyrdom.\nTo the left of St. Luke there is a portrait of St. Prosdocimus. In one hand he holds the bishop’s crosier, which is an ecclesiastical ornament which is conferred on bishops at their consecration.\nOther members of the deity depicted in the altarpiece are St. Jerome whose left hand points to his breast and his right holds a stone, which refers to the penances he endured to rid himself of shocking thoughts. We see him depicted in his usual red robes. Two other figures in the lower tier are dressed in the brown Benedictine monk’s habits, each hold the martyrdom symbol of a palm branch.\nAnother beautiful altarpiece fashioned by Mantegna was a commission he received from the abbot of the Basilica of San Zeno, Gregorio Correr.\nIt comprises of three main painting above a predella comprising of three almost square scenes. The central panel of the San Zeno Altarpiece depicts the Madonna holding her Child and surrounded by music-making angels. She is seated on a marble throne decorated with Roman-inspired reliefs. Hanging across the top of the three main paintings are garlands that appear to be affixed to the top of them.\nTo the left and right of this main panel there are portraits of eight saints. The saints to be included in these two paintings was the choice of the commissioning abbot. On the left are Peter, Paul, John the Evangelist and Zeno; on the right, Benedict, Lawrence, Gregory and John the Baptist.\nThe three paintings of the predella depict biblical scenes. Presently, the three paintings on the predella are not the originals which were taken by Napoleon in 1797 along with the main picture which was restored to Verona in 1815. The original outer two predella paintings are now in Tours, Musée des Beaux-Arts and the centre one is in the Louvre.\nThe left-hand panel depicts the Agony in the Garden. The setting is Gethsemane and we see an angel floating high above with the cup that symbolizes the inexorable fate reserved for Christ. Beyond the dead tree Mantegna has attempt to depict Jerusalem in accurate detail. A winding road leads through a rural scene with unrepaired boundary walls to the main gate. The central temple towering over the rest of the buildings was modelled on the Omar Mosque, which in the Middle Ages was often taken for Solomon’s Temple.\nThe middle painting depicts the Crucifixion. The setting is a cracked rocky plateau on Golgotha. The place of execution is marked by holes in the rock, that had already been used for other crosses. At the foot of Christ’s cross lies the skull of Adam, the first man. According to legend, Adam’s grave was at Calvary and was exposed by the earthquake when Christ died.\nThe panel on the right of the predella depicts the Resurrection. In the centre of this painting, the bright apparition of Christ stands out, emphasized by the darkness of the rocky grotto. The faces of the guards show a range of reactions to the miracle of the Resurrection, from a still sleepy figure gazing in front of him to a soldier rising to his feet in amazement.\nThe Adoration of the Magi known as the Triptych of the Uffizi, is a tempera painting on wood by Andrea Mantegna, completed around 1460 and is now part of the Uffizi collection in Florence. One of the questions regarding this triptych is whether it is one! The work is composed of three panels which only came together in 1827. The fact that they then became encased in a nineteenth century ornate frame does not make them part of a triptych and some art historians doubt that Mantegna created them as a triptych or envisaged them to be set up as one in the way they are now arranged. The three works were commissioned in the for Ludovico III Gonzaga’s private chapel in the Castle of St. George in Mantua.\nThe left hand panel of the triptych, known as the Ascension panel, we see a number of saints, gazing upwards at Christ as he floats skywards surrounded by a mandorla of angels. Immediately below Christ stands Mary, who faces towards us in the lower section of the panting, slightly raised on a ledge of rock.\nThe central panel of the triptych is the Adoration of the Magi. The three Magi symbolize both the three ages of man and also the three continents which were known at that time, Asia, Europe, and Africa. The adherents of different cultures among the followers of the kings are depicted realistically – they were familiar because of the activities of cosmopolitan Venice, a major trading centre and slave market. Once again we see the mandorla of angels around the Virgin Mary. Mandorla is an Italian word for almonds or almond shaped. It is a term often used in Christian art when describing an aureole enclosing figures such as Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary\nThe panel on the right depicts the Circumcision of Christ on New Year’s Day, eight days after he was born as was written in the bible (Luke 2:21-24):\n“… On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived. When the time came for the purification rites required by the Law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: “a pair of doves or two young pigeons…”\nOn the left of the painting we see Joseph carrying a wicker basket, in which are two pigeons.\nMantegna moved with his family to Mantua at the behest of the Marquis Ludovico III Gonzaga of Mantua. On many occasions Ludovico had tried to persuade the artist to enter his service. Finally in 1460 Mantegna was appointed court artist where his salary was seventy-five lire a month, a very large sum of money in those days. Mantegna was the first painter of any repute to be based in Mantua. During Mantegna’s long stay in Mantua, he and his family lived near the San Sebastiano church dedicated to St. Sebastian. Maybe this is what fascinated Mantegna with the saint as he went on to paint three versions of Saint Sebastian.\nIt has been suggested that the first painting by Mantegna depicting Saint Sebastian was completed around 1459 whilst he was still living in Padua. A few years earlier many of the Padua citizens had been taken ill, many of whom died. Mantegna contracted the plague virus but he managed to recover from the deadly disease. Saint Sebastian received the widest veneration and was called especially in times of plague as an emergency helper. It is thought that the portrait of the saint was commissioned by the Padua city elders to celebrate the end of the pestilence outbreak. Mantegna completed the work in 1459, a year before he left the city for Mantua.. Sebastian is tied to the ruins of a Corinthian column, his body is pierced with numerous arrows.\nLook at large white cloud at the top left of the painting. You should just be able to make out the figure of a man astride a horse. According to the Italian art historian Battisti, the theme refers to the Book of Revelation (19: 6-11):\n“…Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war…”\nThe nude figure of the martyr, which resembles a stone sculpture, is placed in front of an antique architectural backdrop, which looks even more “authentic” due to the Greek signature (“the work of Andrea”) on the left edge of the pillar. This first version of Saint Sebastian can be found in the Kunsthistoriches Museum in Vienna.\nMantegna’s second version of his depiction of Saint Sebastian, which he completed around 1480, is now part of the Louvre collection in Paris. The Louvre’s St. Sebastian was once part of the Altar of San Zeno in Verona. In the late 17th century-early 18th century it was recorded as being in the Sainte Chapelle of Aigueperse, in the Auvergne region of France. Its presence there is related to the marriage of Clara Gonzaga on February 24th 1482, in Mantua, at the age of seventeen, to Gilbert of Bourbon-Montpensier, who in 1486 succeeded his father as Count of Montpensier and Dauphin of Auvergne. It remained there for over four hundred years until it was acquired by the Louvre in 1910 part of the art and ancient book collector, Jules Maurice Audéoud’s legacy to the State.\nThe picture depicts the saint with a well sculpted body, tied to the ruins of a Corinthian column and pierced by numerous arrows. We look at him from below which enhances our perception of the strength and power of his figure. Sebastian’s head and eyes are turned toward Heaven which is affirmation of his unwavering Christian beliefs whilst bearing the pain of martyrdom. At his feet are a pair of grim-faced archers. Their inclusion is intended to create a contrast between the man of steadfast faith, and those who are only attracted by disrespectful and evil pleasures. It is thought that the man with the arrows is Mantegna himself.\nLook at the detail Mantegna has put into the background. The classical ruins are typical of Mantegna’s pictures. The cliff path, the gravel and the caves are references to the complications of trying to reach the Celestial Jerusalem, the fortified city depicted on the top of the mountain, at the right middle-ground of the painting, and described in Chapter 21 of John’s Book of Revelation:\n“…Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband…”\nAndrea Mantegna’s panel depicting Saint Sebastian, now in the Galleria Franchetti at the Ca’ d’Oro, is the last of his three paintings of Saint Sebastian. This painting, like the previous two, focuses on Saint Sebastian’s martyrdom, in which he is executed by a firing squad of archers who plunged their arrows into his body. Given that these arrows inflicted numerous wounds all over his body, Sebastian came to be invoked during times of the plague, due to the many body sores that it provoked. The story goes that Sebastian miraculously survived the execution due to the strength of his faith. He, according to legend, was rescued and healed by Saint Irene of Rome, who also became a popular subject for 17th-century artists. Shortly after his recovery he went to Emperor Diocletian to warn him about the fate of sinners, and as a result was clubbed to death.\nWhereas the first two of Mantegna’s depictions of Saint Sebastian resemble each other in style and represent the saint in a setting of classical architectural ruins, with lush landscapes and blue sky filling the background, this third is more sombre and is in complete contrast with the Montagne’s earlier works featuring the martyred saint. In this version he is silhouetted against a neutral, shallow background, brown in colour. Look at the facial expression in this version. It makes viewers much more aware of the pain he is suffering.\nIn the lower right corner, an inscription wrapped around a smoking extinguished candle reads\n“…NIHIL NISI DIVINUM STABILE EST. CAETERA FUMUS…”\n(Nothing is stable except the divine. The rest is smoke.)\nI cannot finish this blog about Mantegna without focusing on my favourite work of his, The Lamentation of the Dead Christ which was completed around 1490. It is one of very few oil on canvas paintings of the period. It is an almost monochromatic vision of Christ. The painting has a limited amount of tonal colouring, mainly pink, grey and golden-brown. The setting of the painting seems to be a morgue-like and claustrophobic space with its cold dark walls. This poorly lit space intensifies the paleness of the body. The forceful image is of the body of Christ laid out on a stark and granulated marble slab. Mantegna has toyed with the rules of perspective making the head large, whereas if the rules of perspective had been adhered to then the head would be much smaller than the feet. There is an intense foreshortening of the body which makes it appear heavy and enlarged.\nChrist’s suffering, before death, is plain to see. Mantegna has given us an unusual vantage point. It places the observer at the feet of the subject and by doing so, adds to one’s sense of empathy. It could almost be described as a gruesome sight. The face of Christ is lined. His head of wavy hair rests upon a pink satin pillow. The wounds seen on the back of his hands are like torn paper, as is the horizontal cut in his side made by the spear. It is almost blasphemous, as here Christ has not risen from the dead and he is like us mortals. In the foreground are the feet of Christ each with dried puncture marks made by the crucifixion nails. Look at the skill in which Mantegna has painted the folds of the shroud.\nAt the left we have three mourners, Mary, Saint John and perhaps slightly hidden by the other two mourners, Mary Magdalene. Their tear-stained faces are distorted in grief. These contorted facial features derive from the masks of classical tragedy. One cannot help but be moved by their expressions.\nIn terms of Classical art, Andrea Mantegna was one of the greatest of his time.', 'Italian Early Renaissance Painter, 1445-1510\nItalian painter and draughtsman. In his lifetime he was one of the most esteemed painters in Italy, enjoying the patronage of the leading families of Florence, in particular the Medici and their banking clients. He was summoned to take part in the decoration of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, was highly commended by diplomatic agents to Ludovico Sforza in Milan and Isabella d Este in Mantua and also received enthusiastic praise from the famous mathematician Luca Pacioli and the humanist poet Ugolino Verino. By the time of his death, however, Botticelli s reputation was already waning. He was overshadowed first by the advent of what Vasari called the maniera devota, a new style by Perugino, Francesco Francia and the young Raphael, whose new and humanly affective sentiment, infused atmospheric effects and sweet colourism took Italy by storm; he was then eclipsed with the establishment immediately afterwards of the High Renaissance style, which Vasari called the modern manner, in the paintings of Michelangelo and the mature works of Raphael in the Vatican. From that time his name virtually disappeared until the reassessment of his reputation that gathered momentum in the 1890s Related Paintings of Sandro Botticelli :. | Cristofano dell\'Altissimo,Portrait of Marsilio Ficino | Details of Primavera (mk36) | Pieta (mk08) | Madonna and child with eight Angels or Raczinskj Tondo | Domenico Ghirlandaio |\nRelated Artists:Bartholomeus van der Helst\nBartholomeus Van Der Helst Galleries\nDutch painter. He was the son of a Haarlem inn-keeper and presumably undertook part or all of his training in Amsterdam. His earliest works suggest that the painter Nicolaes Eliasz. Pickenoy was his master. Although van der Helst had probably already established himself as an independent master by the time he married Anna du Pire in Amsterdam in 1636, his earliest known work, a portrait of The Regents of the Walloon Orphanage, Amsterdam (Amsterdam, Maison Descartes), dates from 1637. Stylistically it is close to the work of Pickenoy. His portrait of a Protestant Minister of 1638 (Rotterdam, Boymans-van Beuningen) reveals the influence of Rembrandt. The young artist must have risen rapidly to fame in Amsterdam, for as early as 1639 he received the prestigious commission for a large painting for the Kloveniersdoelen (Arquebusiers or Musketeers Hall): The Civic Guard Company of Capt. Roelof Bicker and Lt Jan Michielsz. Blaeuw (Amsterdam, Rijksmus.), which formed part of the same series as Rembrandt Night Watch (Amsterdam, Rijksmus.). Van der Helst may not have completed this commission until 1642 or 1643. The ingenious arrangement of the figures in a broad composition shows the artist special talent for composing large groups. Pickenoy influence is less noticeable here than in the portrait of 1637; the self-assured poses of the individual figures were to become a characteristic feature of van der Helst work. The successful execution of this portrait established van der Helst reputation: from 1642, when he began to receive an increasing number of commissions for individual portraits, until 1670 he was the leading portrait painter of the ruling class in Amsterdam. From 1642 his technique in portrait painting gradually became more fluent and the rendering of costume materials more detailed. Some typical portraits of his earlier period are those of Andries Bicker (Amsterdam, Rijksmus.), his wife Catharina Gansneb Tengnagel (Dresden, Gemeldegal. Alte Meister) and their son Gerard Bicker (Amsterdam, Rijksmus.), all of 1642, and the Portrait of a Young Girl (1645; London, N.G.). In 1648 van der Helst painted a second civic guard portrait, The Celebration of the Peace of M?nster at the Crossbowmen Headquarters, Amsterdam (Amsterdam, Rijksmus.), a superbly composed and well painted portrait that, until the late 19th century, was considered one of the masterpieces of the Golden Age but later lost popularity because of its smooth and modish execution. It can nevertheless still be regarded as one of the most important group portraits of the 17th century. Its technical perfection, characterized by a well-modelled rendering of the figures and a smooth handling of the brush, dominated the rest of van der Helst oeuvre.ALLORI Alessandro\nItalian Mannerist Painter, 1535-1607\nBorn in Florence. After the death of his father in 1540 he was brought up and trained in art by a close friend, often referred to as his \'uncle\', the mannerist painter Agnolo Bronzino, whose name he sometimes assumed in his pictures. In some ways, Allori is the last of the line of prominent Florentine painters, of generally undiluted Tuscan artistic heritage: Andrea del Sarto worked with Fra Bartolomeo (as well as Leonardo Da Vinci), Pontormo briefly worked under Andrea, and trained Bronzino, who trained Allori. Subsequent generations in the city would be strongly influenced by the tide of Baroque styles pre-eminent in other parts of Italy.\nFreedburg derides Allori as derivative, claiming he illustrates ""the ideal of Maniera by which art (and style) are generated out of pre-existing art."" The polish of figures has an unnatural marble-like form as if he aimed for cold statuary. It can be said of late phase mannerist painting in Florence, that the city that had early breathed life into statuary with the works of masters like Donatello and Michelangelo, was still so awed by them that it petrified the poses of figures in painting. While by 1600 the Baroque elsewhere was beginning to give life to painted figures, Florence was painting two-dimensional statues. Furthermore, in general, with the exception of the Contra Maniera artists, it dared not stray from high themes or stray into high emotion.Luis de Morales\n(1510 - 9 May 1586) was a Spanish painter born in Badajoz, Extremadura. Known as ""El Divino"", most of his work was of religious subjects, including many representations of the Madonna and Child and the Passion.\nInfluenced, especially in his early work, by Raphael Sanzio and the Lombard school of Leonardo, he was called by his contemporaries ""The Divine Morales"", because of his skill and the shocking realism of his paintings, and because of the spirituality transmitted by all his work.\nHis work has been divided by critics into two periods, an early stage under the influence of Florentine artists such as Michelangelo and a more intense, more anatomically correct later period similar to German and Flemish renaissance painters']"	['<urn:uuid:2fa55253-14ae-483c-8380-6cc1aa59a281>', '<urn:uuid:eecca417-844e-43d9-be41-98bdae49b790>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	6	75	3801
76	safeguards against unauthorized digital communication monitoring	A key measure to protect against unauthorized monitoring of digital communications is cryptography. It helps ensure both confidentiality and integrity of data by making sure information is accessible only to intended parties. Additional protective measures include file and folder permissions, authentication vectors, and access control lists.	"[""The CIA triad is one of the most important concepts in information security. I'm not referring to the well-known American intelligence agency. I'm talking about a model which explains the aims of cybersecurity implementation:\nConfidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.\nIdeally, you want your data to be confidential, have integrity, and be available whether you're working in your home office as I am, or you're running a massive datacenter. I'll explain the components and some of the information security measures which are designed to assure each component.\nConfidentiality is all about making sure that data is accessible only to its intended parties. Attacks on confidentiality can include:\nThe advent of cryptography is mainly about protecting confidentiality, but it also protects integrity. File and folder permissions, authentication vectors, and access control lists can also protect confidentiality. Confidentiality can also pertain to information which isn't digital. If your office has a paper shredder, using it on paper documents with private information is also an information security measure which protects confidentiality.\nIntegrity is all about making sure that data is kept properly intact without it being meddled with in an unauthorized way. Attacks on integrity can include:\n“We're heading toward a world where driverless cars will automatically communicate with each other and the roads, automatically taking us where we need to go safely and efficiently. The confidentiality threats are real: Someone who can eavesdrop on those communications can learn where the cars are going and maybe who is inside them. But the integrity threats are much worse.\nSomeone who can feed the cars false information can potentially cause them to crash into each other or nearby walls. Someone could also disable your car so it can't start. Or worse, disable the entire system so that no one's car can start.”\nCryptographic hashing is a useful security measure for protecting data integrity. MD5 and SHA1 are two widely implemented hashing algorithms. You may see those algorithms referenced when you're looking for an installer or source code for an application. When the developer posts the hash they used, you can make sure that the files you're receiving haven't been tampered with. Integrity can also be protected by preventing unauthorized access to data assets and computer targets, as with protecting confidentiality. Firewalls and authentication vectors are two ways to prevent unauthorized access.\nAvailability is all about making sure that data and computers are available as needed by authorized parties. Attacks on availability can include:\nSome security measures to assure availability include backing up data to external drives, implementing IPS systems and firewalls in order to prevent DDoS attacks, having backup power supplies, and having redundant computers in a datacenter.\nAll cyber attacks have the potential to threaten one or more of the three parts of the CIA triad. I think the model is very important, because it can help security practitioners with risk assessment, asset management, and designing security measures. They can ask themselves, “What's the most important quality to protect for this data asset? Is it more important to protect this server's availability so that its downtime is kept to a minimum, or is confidentiality and integrity more important because its data is highly sensitive?”\nWorking in cybersecurity can mean juggling a lot of complex concepts and priorities in your head, and models like the CIA triad can offer clarity.""]"	['<urn:uuid:2ff2c0b8-003c-45af-92ea-e9390bf234b3>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	6	46	553
77	environment friendly professional garden management strategies bee habitat costs	Professional garden management combines environmental concerns with cost-effective solutions. For example, the Horniman Gardens created a bee-friendly garden with hexagonal raised beds filled with bee-loving plants, meadow turf, and bee hotels built in-house to save money. They also implemented innovative solutions like a NOx-absorbing sculpture that helps protect bees' ability to find and pollinate flowers. For general tree maintenance, costs typically range from $40-$1,100 per tree, with factors like size, accessibility, and season affecting the price.	['Wesley Shaw, the Horniman Gardens’ Head of Horticulture, was interviewed by Quetta Kaye, chair of Forest Hill Society’s Environment Committee.\nQK: Congratulations on keeping the Gardens open to the public throughout the lockdown and initiating new planting schemes. How did you manage this?\nWS: We have all been really pleased with the Gardens this year. As you say, everything looks lovely and all credit should go to the Gardens’ team who have really done a great job. When the lockdown was introduced my team were designated Key Workers to enable the Gardens to remain open and provide a place for the local community to exercise in. To safely do this we split everyone into separate teams and each team worked alternate days. Unfortunately, this meant we weren’t able to provide cover into the evening, so we temporarily reduced the closing time to 4.30pm.\nQK: Since you became Head Gardener 7 years ago, you have altered or created new planted areas in the Gardens. Where does the inspiration come from?\nWS: My brief is to try and create displays that complement the Museum’s collections and temporary exhibitions as well as keeping all the amenity areas looking good. We try and do at least one ‘pop-up garden’ each year. The ideas usually come from myself and the team, and I then present them to the senior management team.\nThis gives us a great opportunity to do some interesting and innovative horticulture. Last year we used the Brick Wonders exhibition as inspiration for the summer bedding display in the Sunken Garden and created a modernist version of a bedding scheme using blocks of colour to represent Lego bricks. Visually it made a big impact and even got a full-colour spread in The Times and The Daily Telegraph.\nOur last big project was to create the Grassland Garden in conjunction with the landscape designer Professor James Hitchmough and the plantsman Neil Lucas. This was intended to complement the new World Gallery that opened in the Museum in 2018. The idea was to celebrate grassland habitats and the relationship indigenous people have with them, as well as providing a beautiful long-lasting floral display that is low maintenance and great for wildlife.\nQK: The newly installed bee-friendly garden at the front of the Museum is particularly apt, as is the pollution-absorbing sculpture. Where did this idea come from and how long has it taken to create and install?\nWS: The area that is now the Bee Garden has been given over to wildflowers in recent years, but we decided to step it up and create a garden dedicated to supporting bees.\nThe inspiration for a bee garden came after our CEO Nick Merriman declared a climate and ecological emergency. We wanted to build a garden that would really benefit wildlife, particularly bees, and to hopefully provide some inspiration to visitors about how they can create something similar in their own gardens.\nCoincidentally around that time I met local artist Dr Jasmine Pradissitto. Jasmine was really keen to exhibit some of her work in the Gardens, so I told her about our plans for a bee garden. This worked perfectly as she has been sculpting with a material called NoxTek that removes harmful respiratory NOx pollutants from the atmosphere. NOx is thought to interfere with the ability of bees to find and pollinate flowers. It’s a great example of how public art can not only drive awareness but also create a beneficial intervention which is fitting for the ‘Culture Declares’ mission statement of increased sustainability and protection for the environment and the biodiverse creatures that need it to survive.\nThe garden is really quite simple: we have a series of hexagonal raised beds planted full of bee-loving plants, surrounded by meadow turf and two rather marvellous bee hotels created by my team. Jasmine’s sculpture takes centre stage in the raised beds as a focal point for the whole display.\nLockdown made it a bit tricky getting materials and plants, but we managed to get everything we needed and by mid-May we were finished and Flower Girl was installed. It looks great and, more importantly, it is absolutely crawling with bees! If you haven’t seen it, you really need to!\nQK: Did you come to the Horniman Gardens with preconceived ideas of what you would like to do, or have ideas evolved around the landscape and the educational aspects involved?\nWS: A bit of both really. I started shortly after the Heritage Lottery-funded redevelopment was finished in 2012. There were a few areas that hadn’t been completely finished and other areas that still needed improving, so over the last seven years we have been working our way through these, as well as trying to create pop-up gardens at the same time. But there’s always something that needs improving or changing, which is a good thing because it means the Garden continues to evolve and improve.\nQK: Without revealing any secrets, is there a budget for planting in the Gardens? By which I mean, how strictly are you constrained financially in what you are able to do?\nWS: There isn’t a budget purely for planting. I have a budget that covers all operational elements of the Gardens, and plants are included in that. We are obviously constrained by what money is available. Our pop-up gardens are built on a relatively low budget, but the advantage I have is that I have a very skilled team, which means we can do a lot of things in-house. For example, the hexagonal timber beds used in the Bee Garden were built on-site, so this saved us a lot of money.\nFor bigger projects we have an excellent fundraising team who will help us fund projects. For example, the Prehistoric Garden was partly funded by Tesco’s Bags for Life scheme.\nQK: In addition to the flower-planted areas, the Horniman Gardens is home to an enormous number of mature and some newer trees which must need regular monitoring and appropriate care. This is a very important legacy to have inherited. How is this managed?\nWS: We really love our trees, and the Horniman has a fantastic collection, but, as you say, many of them are mature and entering the later stages of their life so we have been really proactive at planting the ‘next generation’ that will continue the Horniman tree legacy.\nWe try and plant trees that are quite unusual and aren’t generally seen outside a botanic garden or arboretum. It is important to provide good aftercare especially through a hot dry summer, so you will regularly see my team out with a water bowser watering all the young trees and weeding tree circles to prevent competition from weeds and grass.\nAll our trees are risk-assessed every two years by an independent tree expert, who gives me a prioritised list of works for our tree surgeon contractor to carry out. This keeps them safe and healthy.\nQK: Congratulations on creating an exciting educational and pleasure garden — an inspiration to us all!', 'Compare Tree Trimming Costs\n$320, 25-30 Foot Tall Tree\nThis cost estimate deals with the trimming of large tree branches that hang over a home or have tree disease that needs to be remedied, not complete tree removal.\nHow Much Does Tree Trimming Cost?\n$0 – $350\nAverage Cost Estimate\n$50 – $450\n$200 – $1,200\n|Time of Year||Anytime||Winter||Spring – Fall|\n|Tree Height||20 – 60 Feet||20 – 60 Feet||20 – 60 Feet|\n|Trimmed By||DIY||Tree Service||Tree Service|\n|Local Demand||None||Low – Average||Average – Busy|\n|Debris Cleanup||Self||Tree Service||Tree Service|\n|Cost of Tools & Supplies||$0 – $300||None||None|\n|Permits, If Required||$0 – $150||$0 – $150||$0 – $150|\nOverview of Tree Trimming\nKeeping trees properly trimmed maintains not only their own attractive appearance and health, but can greatly help the surrounding trees with proper growth. It also protects your home and property (and health) from the danger and costly damage of falling limbs. Many times, the cost of trimming branches on your trees is higher than many homeowners expect until the scope of the work is understood, and the amount of detail needed to assure safety of the home, landscape and workers.\nThis Costimate details the cost of tree trimming and the factors affecting price. Your trees can be evaluated using these factors to produce a fairly accurate estimate of your tree service costs. Near the bottom of the page you can review costs and details about the project submitted by other readers. Our related Cost Estimates on Tree Removal, Stump Removal and Stump Grinding round out the discussion of costs associated with tree care.\nRelated Cost Estimates\nEstimated Tree Trimming Cost Factors\nHow much does it cost? The quick answer is that cost varies greatly from $40 to $1,100 per tree based on factors like size, whether you do it yourself or hire a pro, time of year and many other factors, which are listed below.\n- Time of Year: For obvious reasons, when trees are dormant in the winter months and have lost all their leaves, it’s a much easier task of climbing, cutting and disposing of the fallen branches. When there is less to clean up, the job is going to move quicker for the tree service company.\n- DIY or Pro Trimming: Most homeowners hire professionals to trim their trees because they don’t have the equipment needed, and they understand that the risks involved simply aren’t worth taking. Also, hiring a trained arborist ensures the work done enhances tree health and beauty. If you do the work, your tree pruning costs are limited to the equipment listed below, but only if you do the work safely without causing injury to yourself or damage to property or electrical lines.\n- Size of the Tree: Size increments used by many pro services are trees up to 30 feet, trees 31-60 feet and trees taller than 60 feet. The taller the tree, the more difficulty and costly it is to trim.\n- Number of Trees: The more trees to trim, the less the cost is per tree. This is because the cost of getting the crew and equipment to the site is spread over a greater number of trees.\n- Hazards: When power lines run through the tree or when a limb overhangs a building, extra care – and extra cost – is factored into the estimate.\n- Ease in Accessing the Trees: Trees along a road or driveway are easier and less costly to trim than those set back on the property or in soft and/or wet ground.\n- Distance to the Property: The farther the crew must travel, the higher the fuel and labor expense, and the greater your final cost will be.\n- Branch Cleanup: You can save money by cleaning up the debris. Including cutting, chipping and hauling away the wood in the estimate raises the cost of tree trimming.\n- Storm Cleanup / Demand: When a major storm causes widespread tree damage, tree services are in high demand. Costs typically rise due to overtime and weekend work.\nNote: Utility companies usually trim trees that threaten power lines to protect their investment. If the trees that need trimming are near electrical lines, make your first call to your utility company. They’ll inspect the situation and might do the work at no cost to you.\nCost of Equipment & Supplies\nHere are the cost ranges for occasional-use quality at the low end to professional-grade tools and equipment.\n- $8-$50 | Hand saw or pruning shears\n- $24-$325 | Pole saw (non-powered)\n- $125-$385 | Pole saw (powered)\n- $35-$125 | Electric chainsaw\n- $175-$950 | Gas chainsaw\n- $135-$385 | Fiberglass extension ladder (used because fiberglass doesn’t conduct electricity like aluminum)\n- $175-$450 | Tree-climbing boots\n- $50-$135 | Tree-climbing harnesses\nAdditional costs include eye protection (up to $70), protective gloves (up to $45), hard hats (up to $185), ear protection (up to $35) and wireless communication systems between those high in the tree and those on the ground directing their efforts (up to $400).\nFor every 6-10 hours in the field, a tree service crew spends an hour cleaning and maintaining its equipment.\nFor very tall trees that need branches or limbs removed high up, many companies use a cherry picker lift versus climbing the tree. While cost prohibitive to most DIY’ers, consider getting a tree service company if you have the need for very high trimming.\nPermits, Inspection, and Related Costs\nMany cities and counties require a permit to ensure safe, proper tree trimming and to contain the spread of Dutch elm disease, the Emerald ash borer and other tree-killing pests. Your local municipal office or website will have details about obtaining a permit and what it will cost.\nPermits and Inspection Cost\n- $35-$200 | Tree trimming permit, where required.\n- $75-$150 | Property line survey – If there is a question about whose property a tree is on, paying for a line survey is a protection against cutting trees you don’t own.\nTwo cost-related notes: First, make sure that the tree trimming service you hire is licensed and insured for your protection against liability for injury, death or damage to property caused by the work. Secondly, if your property is part of a homeowners’ association (HOA), check the bylaws to make sure the tree trimming you plan to do complies, or risk being fined or sued over the work.\nEstimated Labor Cost and Time\nExperienced arborists and crews are paid well for their expertise, risk and overhead costs for equipment and liability insurance. We’ve organized the price by tree size, as most tree services do. Where your tree trimming cost will fall in the range depends on the other factors listed above such as number of trees and access to them.\n- $40-$425 per tree | Trees up to 30 feet tall\n- $125-$850 per tree | Trees 31-60 feet tall\n- $185-$1,100 per tree | Trees more than 60 feet tall\nHow long does it take a crew of 2-4 arborists to trim trees? Here are common time-frames, so you can estimate how long the noise and mess will persist. These estimates including cutting or chipping the downed branches and hauling them away, since that is standard procedure on most jobs.\n- One day: One or two large trees, 5-8 medium trees or 10+ small trees\n- Two days: 3-5 large trees, 8-15 medium trees or 20+ small trees\nDIY or Hire a Pro to Trim Your Trees\nWhile I am no tree expert, I have chainsaws, both powered and manual pole saws, and a hand saw that can cut through an 8″ thick branch or so if needed. I’ve done this type of trimming project myself, many times with the help of friends and family. If you’re a homeowner, you probably have to. I limit my own tree trimming activities based on the height of the tree and the fall zone for the branches. If the tree is taller than my house, I’m calling in a tree service every time.\n- You need to be comfortable working from a ladder or climbing a tree.\n- You need to have the right tools for the job, which includes a chainsaw for larger trim jobs, pole saw, hand saws and possibly a rope to lower the branch after its cut.\nNote: In 2012, we had a large (+60 feet tall) oak tree in our backyard that hung over one corner of our home. One of the branches fell during a storm and ruined the rain gutter. When the insurance adjuster arrived, they agreed to remove the tree to prevent further damage to the roof. At the time, they paid $600 for the tree removal.\nCosts from Around the Web\n|Costimates||$250||$50 – $1,200|\n|Precision Tree||$700||$50 – $1,000 and up.|\n|TreeRemoval.com||$375||$75 – $1,000|\n|HomeAdvisor.com||$200||$75 – $1,000|\n|ThumbTack||$345||$135 – $875|\n|Trees & Bees||$360||$65 – $1,500|\n|Cutting Edge Tree Care||$250||$50 – $2,500|\n|Suggest a Cost Comparison from Another Website|']	['<urn:uuid:1dfa7946-0d81-4aa1-830a-0eb857901b54>', '<urn:uuid:47f3979a-25bf-4082-b833-85611dcb03b2>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	9	76	2656
78	How do warehouse efficiency and strategic goal-setting compare in terms of their impact on a company's success?	Warehouse efficiency and strategic goal-setting both significantly impact company success but in different ways. Warehouse efficiency focuses on minimizing logistics costs through proper storage, stock management, and damage prevention, which directly affects the bottom line. On the other hand, strategic goal-setting is part of a formalized roadmap that aligns the organization's vision, mission and goals, helping the company do a better job by focusing energy, resources and time of everyone in the same direction. Both aspects require careful planning and monitoring - warehousing needs constant management to ensure proper stock levels and raw materials availability, while strategic goals need performance measures to track and monitor achievement.	"['Logistics Operations is the skill of purposefully preparation the treatments for the procurement, storage area and action of unprocessed components, products and finalized stock (plus the associated info streams) around a business in this particular approach regarding be certain optimum upcoming and up-to-date productivity. Logistics is “the expressions of economic”, as Henry Ford has suggested and offer chain managing has reached the central of several organizations – whether it is list or professional. Give sequence supervision is an skill of comprehending the relationship in between areas, raw resources and concluded products, and the way to best present, carry and store these elements, products and complete products on their focused places. It is actually thus a key management ability, the industry vital component of decent company administration.\nProviders throughout a lot of market sectors attempt to enhance Logistics Administration by raising the performance in which they control the stream of products and solutions from issue A to level B. Increasing Logistics Managing also helps to improve over-all productiveness and good quality of program, and hence, increases a company’s bottom line. One can find several major kinds of Logistics Management, and they are generally Cost-Effective Logistics Administration, Serious-time Logistics Operations and Elaborate Logistics Managing. Within just each of these key classes there are actually sub-methods, like Logistics Setting up And Roping, Stock Placing And Frame of mind, Inventory Command and Re-sales, Manufacturing Procedures and Shipping Personally. Each sub-technique in each one of the principal classifications was created to assist in improving the Productivity with the complete method, which enhances output, charge and top quality-results.\nAmong the primary purposes of Logistics Managing, as outlined by leading Logistics Control experts, is to guarantee the “least total cost of shipping and delivery” into the purchaser. To get this done, a factory needs to be developed with the desired equipment for responding to each and every aspect from the logistics price tag formula. One example is, the introduction of full brand packages, designed for sound level and speed, has meant warehousing charges have dropped significantly, resulting in substantial cost-effective raises in the amount of merchandise which can be created in virtually any storage place, regardless of what its measurements. What this means is, one example is, that warehouses could be optimised to maintain extra supply, as an alternative to get it be placed available expecting replenishment.\nAnother aspect of Logistics Managing is always to shield both equally system and inventory. One of many key prices of managing a warehouse relates to merchandise destruction. The act of putting away solution wrongly (such as, not obtaining packing peanuts) or maybe not keeping more than enough stock accessible can mean that your particular stockroom can incur major logistics price, in the long run reducing success. In an effort to lower the effect of item damages on earnings, logistics supervision requires to ensure the factory is obviously correctly stocked and is effectively protected against product harms.\nA very important aspect of Logistics Supervision is linked information and facts and connection. It is vital that all staff members from the stockroom understand their responsibilities and they are educated appropriately. Conversation is another primary factor, since it is with consumer necessities that distributors and producers are able to match their own personal delivery service objectives. Powerful logistics supervision helps to ensure that all gatherings are well advised about predicted shipping and delivery periods and involved expenses, making it possible for successful interaction somewhere between all gatherings involved.\nYet another essential element from the efficacy of logistics administration refers to the lugging price the very products. Specified travelling techniques may help reduce the total cost of transporting, as transporting products right by freight is often less expensive than utilizing the same strategy with a number of carriers. Similarly, some service providers can help to eliminate the amount of provider rates by recharging an straight up freight price just for the 1st pickup of an particular solution. This can cut down over-all travelling having charges with a substantial margin, and can also thus make up for any shed profits from consumers that are not pleased about the product or service delivery punctually. Likewise, logistics supervision can certainly help lower the level of customer care that is definitely provided any time a item is sent later with the use of better presentation methods.\nThe necessity of logistics knowledge of handling the warehousing and provide chain runs beyond just managing the costs of travel. It is additionally essential to make certain warehousing routines are successfully handled constantly to ensure that stocks and shares are placed in supply, and also that you can find a frequent supply of uncooked resources offered to connect with potential future production requirements. Whilst method of travel is actually one area of finding, warehousing and keeping is yet another. And that they are usually not remaining to languish in unproductive opportunities since there is not enough room or personnel to maintain them, appropriate warehousing of things makes certain that they are appropriately located until finally they are necessary. This causes thrown away time and money and results in a diminished prospect of upcoming income.\nLogistics Administration involves the overall gamut of relevant exercises including getting, arranging, undertaking, controlling and observing and taking care of. It is usually viewed as the heart from any endeavor, simply because it deals with the day by day activities that have a organization running easily. Actions just like obtaining, supply sequence, buywarehousing and finalizing, change logistics, and client service all develop part of the delivery logistics industry. These things to do all have an impact on the conclusion, which is the reason administration have to be extensive and tactical. The cabability to put into practice a detailed Logistics Operations Program will help you to limit small business routine expenditures, which leads to an increased gross revenue border.\nIf you are you looking for more in regards to 寄 英國 包裹 review our web-site.\nEven more tips from encouraged publishers:', 'Effective organizations conduct strategic formulation. Strategic planning is vital because it aligns the organization\'s vision, mission and goals. According to ""Strategic Planning for Dummies"" by Patricia Olsen: ""A strategic plan is a management tool that serves the purpose of helping an organization do a better job, because a plan focuses the energy, resources and time of everyone in the organization in the same direction.""\n""A strategic plan is a formalized roadmap that describes how your company executes the chosen strategy,"" according to Olsen. Oftentimes, business plans and strategic plans are mistaken for one another. Though similar guidelines may be at use, a business plan and a strategic plan are two different concepts for two different purposes. A business plan is for a business startup, whereas, a strategic plan is for established businesses and owners aiming for organizational expansion and growth.\nStrategic Planning Framework\nThree basic components for strategic planning exist, according to Olsen. First, ask where you are you now. Review the organization\'s present position and clarify mission statements, vision statements and values. Second, ask where you are going. Define the organization\'s competitive advantage, which helps clarify the direction the organization is headed into its future. Clarify what you are best at. Establish which advantages your organization has over the industry competition. Third, ask how you will you get there. Figure out where you are going by applying goal-setting theory and other necessary tools as active steps toward success.\nCreate a mission statement. A mission statement establishes the organization\'s core purpose. According to Mind Tools, begin the mission statement by identifying the organization\'s ""winning idea."" Decide what stands out in your organization from other competitors, identify your basic measures of success, develop a quantitative goal and make sure your mission statement is both clear and concise.\nDecide your values statement by defining what your organization believes in and stands for. A values statement reveals that the organization is ethical and socially responsible. Like the mission statement, the values statement is clear and concise.\nDesired Future Position\nDevelop an all-encompassing vision statement. Unlike a mission statement, a vision statement explains where the organization is headed. Ask what your organization will look like five to 10 years into the future. A vision statement is a combination of an organization\'s mission and values that energizes people both within and outside of the organization.\nHow to Get There\nUse a SWOT analysis. This is a strategic planning tool that assesses Strengths (S), Weaknesses (W), Opportunities (O) and Threats (T). Start a SWOT analysis by listing corresponding traits below each word in the acronym.\nSet goals and create an action plan. Establish goals that are quantitative and challenging. Goals are the end result. A comprehensive action plan comprises goals that are broken down into minigoals that help you achieve your objectives.\nEstablish feedback along the way to measure and manage a strategic plan. Implement performance measures to track and monitor goal achievement during or after the strategic planning process.\nAssess your budget. Decide if your strategic plan has a sound budget.\nWatch out for strategic planning pitfalls. Strategic planning commonly fails because of lack of ownership. All your members need to feel empowered by taking part in the strategic planning process. When people do not have a stake or do not feel a sense of responsibility, this could lead to failure. Communicate clearly with employees, since miscommunication can plague the process of a strategic plan.\nMake sure that your employees are focused and aren\'t bombarded by too many job duties, especially since owners and managers can lose sight of the end goal. Establish that the company\'s vision, mission and values align with the strategic plan and firmly communicate this with employees; otherwise, it may become a meaningless plan to them.\n- Strategic Planning for ummies; Patricia Olsen; 2007\n- Mind Tools: Mission Statements and Vision Statements\n- Photo Credit ljleavell.sxc.hu\nDefinition of Corporate Planning\nCorporate planning is a systematic approach to clarifying corporate objectives, strategic decision making and checking progress toward objectives.

79	What were the key benefits and verification challenges of the Limited Test Ban Treaty?	The Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) provided significant benefits by ending public health hazards from atmospheric testing and helping to downsize nuclear weapon yields. However, verification challenges were a major concern. Skeptics worried about potential Soviet evasion scenarios, such as testing in deep space, behind the moon, or at the bottom of Lake Baikal. Secretary of Defense McNamara addressed these concerns by demonstrating that multi-megaton weapons would need to be tested 20 million miles from Earth to evade detection. Despite these verification challenges, the treaty successfully established a global norm against atmospheric testing and has 124 states-parties today.	"['Concerns over verification and compliance are a refuge for skeptics of arms control. These concerns can be substantive as well as overdramatized. No treaty is risk-free, and no monitoring regime is foolproof. Will a powerful cheater be called out, even if discovered? And what then? No treaty seeking to tame the Bomb offers the prospect of automatic penalties. Arms-control advocates have countered with the standard of “effective verification,” which basically means that militarily significant violations will be discovered in sufficient time to take remedial action.\nThe outcome of these debates over nuclear testing have typically hinged on Moscow’s behavior during and prior to the debate, the perceived benefits of the treaty at hand, and public perception of the President’s stewardship of U.S. national security. The 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty was an iffy proposition until the Senate roll was called. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty probably will be as well. For the CTBT, China’s behavior will matter as much as Moscow’s.\nThe particulars of verification matter. If these concerns appear to be outlandish, while benefits appear to be tangible, skeptics will be on the defensive. This was the case during debate over the LTBT, which stopped atmospheric tests, when skeptics argued that the Soviet Union might still test nuclear weapons in deep space, behind the moon, or at the bottom of Lake Baikal. In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1963, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara offered this rebuttal: “The Soviet Union could obtain no major results by testing in the atmosphere and deep space or underwater without incurring high risk of detection and high risk of identification” According to the Pentagon’s math, multi-megaton weapons (a greater concern at the time than low-yield tests) would have to be tested 20 million miles from the earth to evade detection – or 80 times further away from the Moon.\nA minority of the Senate – insufficient to scuttle the LTBT — was not persuaded by McNamara’s arguments. Robert Byrd, a Democrat from West Virginia, grew to become a towering figure in the United States Senate, as well as a supporter of nuclear arms and risk reduction. Early on in his Senate career, Byrd thought differently about arms control. During the debate over the LTBT, he offered this critique:\nI think we are underrating Soviet cunning and the Soviet determination to outwit us. On the other hand, I think we are overrating the Soviet fear of being caught in a violation and the Soviet respect for world opinion…. I contend that when dealing with the Communists, we must apply the maximum standards and must allow no loophole for evasion, for so long as there is a single loophole, the Communists will find it and use it.\nSouth Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond, then a Democrat, felt the same way, arguing, “The art of concealment always runs ahead of the art of detection.” Thurmond worried about a peculiar evasion scenario. He asked, “What would keep Russia from shifting her scientists, equipment, and personnel to the Chinese side [of the border] to carry out nuclear work?”\nThese arguments didn’t carry the day because they seemed far-fetched, and because the perceived benefits of a ban on atmospheric testing appeared to be so valuable and pressing. The Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, William Foster, framed the decision this way:\nWeighing the risks involved in a treaty against the value of the test ban in the reduction of the risks of a continued, intensified, and extended arms race, we have come to the conclusion that a nuclear test ban treaty is in our national interest.\nThe LTBT did not, in fact, have an appreciable impact on the arms race, since robust testing programs continued underground. The treaty did, however, end the public health hazards associated with atmospheric testing and helped to downsize the yields of nuclear weapons.\nThe next negotiating step, which took eleven more years, placed a threshold on the yields of underground tests at 150 kilotons. Grave reservations were again raised about the benefits the Kremlin could derive from cheating under the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty – claims that were, at best, a stretch. These concerns were, however, given credence by the limitations of seismic monitoring capabilities during the 1970s and the wide bands of uncertainty surrounding the actual yields of Soviet tests. Uncertainty levels were magnified further by a lack of understanding of the geology at Soviet test sites. The U.S. Senate’s hold on the TTBT’s ratification, sixteen years in duration, was eventually broken by creative, joint experiments at test sites – experiments that indicated a systematic overestimation by the U.S. intelligence community of Soviet nuclear test yields.\nSix years after the threshold treaty was ratified in 1990, negotiations on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty came to a close, a treaty that will take longer than the TTBT’s sixteen years to enter into force. Once again, grave concerns have been raised by treaty skeptics about what the Kremlin might gain by cheating. Now concerns hinge over tests with yields of perhaps ten or a few hundred tons of TNT, compared to the TTBT’s threshold of 150,000 tons of TNT.\nMonitoring capabilities have advanced considerably. The CTBT provides a global network of hundreds of distributed facilities and sensors of various kinds to warn of noncompliance at extremely low yields. U.S. national technical means of test ban monitoring are reportedly better. A ban on nuclear testing has never been harder to evade and the benefits of evasion ever never been so slight. No treaty has met the standard of effective verification more completely than the CTBT. Even so, a Senate vote on the CTBT will probably be a cliff-hanger. As with the TTBT, creative supplemental monitoring measures near test sites might be in order to convince two-thirds of the Senate to consent to ban nuclear testing completely.', 'Limited Test Ban Treaty Turns 40\nKimball, Daryl, Boese, Wade, Arms Control Today\nLIKE ALL FIRST steps, it was long awaited, tentative, and not without risk. Yet, it also held out promise. The Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), the first agreement negotiated to regulate the U.S.-Soviet nuclear competition, went into effect Oct. 10, 1963. Negotiated only months after the United States and the Soviet Union had walked back from the brink of nuclear war over missiles in Cuba, the treaty offered the hope that Washington and Moscow might be able to rein in the global nuclear arms race, thereby saving the world from an all-consuming nuclear conflagration.\nThe LTBT, which banned nuclear test explosions above ground, underwater, and in space, led to the end of the most visible and strongly opposed aspects of the arms race: hundreds of open-air explosions that spewed dangerous levels of radioactive contamination far beyond the test sites of the nuclear powers. Today, the treaty has 124 states-parties and has established a global norm against atmospheric testing. It outlasted one of its original states-parties, the Soviet Union, and the Cold War that it was conceived to help control.\nThe limits of the treaty are also still apparent. Nuclear testing continued underground for three more decades, and a comprehensive test ban treaty, which still has not entered into force, was not completed until 1996. Nuclear weapons still abound, and the number of countries possessing them has doubled. Moreover, the United States is exploring new nuclear-weapon designs that if built would require the resumption of underground nuclear testing suspended more than a decade ago. The specter of nuclear war still haunts the world, although it has receded in the minds of many.\nFormer senior U.S. officials who lived through the anxious days of the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis and the heady days of the LTBT\'s creation the following summer still see the agreement as then-President John F. Kennedy described it to the American people. Kennedy first told Americans what the treaty would not be-an end to conflict, war, communism, or arms-but declared July 26,1963, ""It is an important first step-a step toward peace-a step toward reason-a step away from war.""\nYears of Frustration\nDuring the first half of the 1950s, the United States and the Soviet Union had traded arms control proposals. But these initiatives were primarily designed to score propaganda points rather than serve as any true basis for negotiations. It was in this vein that the Soviet Union first proposed a ban on nuclear weapons testing as part of a May 1955 comprehensive disarmament plan, which included the closure of all foreign military bases-a clear nonstarter from the U.S. perspective given Washington\'s European commitments, particularly in divided Germany.\nPresident Dwight Eisenhower endorsed the idea of a nuclear test ban in 1957, moved by his own qualms about the burgeoning and costly arms race with the Soviet Union and mounting public concerns, both globally and in the United States, about the adverse health effects of nuclear weapons testing. His condition that the ban be facilitated by a halt to the production of nuclear weapons-usable material and international inspections guaranteed the proposal\'s rejection by the Kremlin, which was deeply suspicious of inspections being used for U.S. or Western espionage.\nEisenhower, as well as his successor Kennedy, faced not only Soviet objections but also domestic opposition from nuclear weapons scientists and military leaders, who feared that the Soviet Union would cheat on any agreement to gain superiority over the United States. Robert McNamara, who served as Kennedy\'s secretary of defense, recalled in a Sept. 25 interview, that one of the more outlandish arguments advanced by the military was that the Soviets would be able to cheat by testing nuclear weapons behind the moon.\nSeeking to calm the military\'s concerns, Eisenhower convened an international conference of experts in 1958 to assess how and whether cheaters could be caught. …']"	['<urn:uuid:576f122d-1fec-42c4-a0da-03933ad7c538>', '<urn:uuid:45e3f994-2ae1-4de1-8e7b-398897d6778a>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	14	98	1625
80	deletion policy criminal records pnc before 2006	Prior to early 2006, the police could delete records after a certain period based on the nature of the offense under the 'weeding' guidelines. However, deletions were not done systematically and many eligible records were never deleted. If a pre-2006 CRB check came back clear, it means the offenses were either deleted or not recorded initially.	['Aim of this page\nThis page sets out details of the current practice for retaining details of criminal records and the process involved in requesting the deletion of a caution or conviction.\nWe have separate information on the retention and deletion of DNA and fingerprints.\nThis page forms part of our information on police records.\nWhy is this important?\nMany people are unaware that details of all recordable offences remain on the Police National Computer (PNC) until they reach the age of 100.\nCautions and convictions can only be removed from the PNC in exceptional cases and it’s important to know what those circumstances may be and how you would go about applying for them to be removed.\nOn this page, when we refer to a “criminal record” we mean convictions, cautions, final warnings and reprimands.\nFixed Penalty Notices (FPN’s), Penalty Notices for Disorder (PND’s), findings of innocence, acquittals and other police intelligence (including allegations) is covered in the local police information section.\nThe current practice is for the police to store details of all recordable offences, and other specific offences, and for these to be held until the individual reaches 100 years old. What’s recorded on the PNC?\nHistorically, the process of retention has varied.\nPrior to early 2006, the police were able to delete records entirely after a certain period, depending on the nature of the offence. This was possible under the old ‘weeding’ guidelines. However, the police do not appear to have deleted records on a systematic basis, and many records that were eligible for deletion were never actually deleted. If you have a CRB check (as they were known then) that you did prior to 2006 that came back clear, your offences have either been deleted or were not recorded in the first place.\nIn 2006, the police stopped deleting records and introduced a new policy which stated that all records would be held until an individual reached 100 years of age. At the same time, they introduced ‘step-down’, which was a filtering process enabling the police to hold on to records indefinitely on the Police National Computer (PNC). Individuals could apply to have them ‘stepped down’ so that they wouldn’t be disclosed on standard or enhanced checks.\nThis step-down procedure was stopped in October 2009, following a Court of Appeal decision, meaning that even those who had records stepped down now have them back on their DBS checks. If you applied for step-down and had your records stepped down, unfortunately it is likely that they will reappear on your criminal record check and your best course of action would be to discuss these with whoever is requiring a check.\nSince October 2009, the police have not deleted cautions or convictions.\nIf you are not sure what records the police still hold, you can access your own record by doing a subject access request.\nWhat if my conviction doesn’t show up on my police record?\nCheck local records\nIt is possible that you have only received details from the PNC. You need to see a copy of the local police records from wherever you received the conviction. It may be recorded there. This wouldn’t automatically be disclosed on a DBS certificate, but may be disclosed on an enhanced certificate.\nPolice recording practices\nThe PNC does not include every single conviction. The police currently store details of all recordable offences (indictable, triable-either-way and some summary offences). They keep this data until you reach 100 years old. However, in the past, the process of recording has varied. This means that you may have been convicted in the past but it may not be recorded on the PNC.\nIn the past, the process of keeping records has also varied. Until early 2006, weeding guidelines, allowed the Police to delete records after a certain period depending on the offence. They only normally deleted records if requested, so many records that could have been deleted were not. The police stopped deleting records in 2006 and introduced a new policy of keeping all records on the PNC until a person’s 100th birthday.\nIn 2006, the police introduced a process for filtering out information before it appeared on a criminal records check. A person could apply to the police to have information ‘stepped down’ from their standard or enhanced check. This was typically in relation to offences that were very old and very minor. The decision was at the discretion of the chief constable of each local force.\nStep-down was stopped in October 2009 after a Court of Appeal decision. If you previously had information stepped down, it will now reappear on a criminal record check.\nCan convictions be removed from the PNC?\nThe Police National Computer (PNC) currently retains all information until an individuals 100th birth date. The police are obliged, under Part V of the Police Act 1997, to provide the DBS with access to all convictions held on the PNC. There was previously a system known as ‘step-down’, but this was ended into October 2009.\nYou retain the right to contact the police directly about information about you which is held on the PNC, and ask them to remove it, through the ‘Deletion of records from National Police Systems guidance’ (see below). However, it is very rare for convictions to be removed under this procedure. The deletion of records from National Police Systems is usually reserved for cases involving non-conviction information (such as unproven allegations, or findings of innocence), or where it can be proved that the arrest was unlawful or where it is established beyond doubt that no offence existed.\nThe only other option would be to legally appeal against the conviction (for example “I didn’t do it”). This can normally only be done within a short time period following the conviction. To do this, you should seek legal advice. Also note that, if you pleaded guilty at court, that makes appealing your conviction even more difficult.\nWho owns the information?\nUnder the Data Protection Act, the police are the Data Owners and Data Controllers of the information on the Police National Computer (PNC). They own and maintain the information.\nThe DBS uses information from the PNC. They cannot amend or delete information or decide how it is presented.\nDeletion of records from National Police Systems\nYou have the right to ask the police to remove information under the Deletion of records from National Police Systems guidance.\nCan cautions be removed from the PNC?\nIt is only in exceptional circumstances that the police will remove a caution.\nYou may be able to have your caution ‘expunged’ from your criminal record by applying to the police. You can do this yourself by setting out a well-argued and comprehensive reason as to why the police should consider ‘expunging’ your caution. Alternatively, you could seek legal advice.\nIf the police agree to ‘expunge’ your caution then the PNC will show ‘no further action’ instead of the caution. It will no longer be disclosed on a standard or enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check. There is no standard time period to have a caution removed, and different police forces take differing periods of time to remove cautions (for example, the Metropolitan Police Force give a time estimate of around 12-18 months for a removal application to be processed).\nYou should be aware that even if your caution is ‘expunged’, the information held by the police force could still be disclosed under the ‘other relevant information’ section of an enhanced check, if the police feel that it is relevant and ought to be disclosed. You can challenge this decision.\nRemoving information from local police records\nThe Record Deletion Process only extends to records held on the Police National Computer, National DNA Database and fingerprint database. Locally held records, including custody photographs, are not covered by this process and instead, are managed by chief officers in accordance with the Authorised Professional Practice (APP) – Information Management.\nBelow you will find links to useful websites relating to this page\n- ACPO Weeding Rules (2000) – this is no longer in force but may be useful for historical purposes.\n- ACPO Retention Guidelines (incorporating the Step Down model) (2006)\n- Court of Appeal Judgement (October 2009) – this led to the removal of step-down\n- Deletion of records from National Police Systems Guidance 2015\n- For practical information – More information on understanding your criminal record\n- To discuss this issue with others – Read and share your experiences on our online forum\n- Questions – If you have any questions about this, you can contact our helpline.\nHelp us to add value to this information.

81	How can dynamic web content be made both secure and accessible?	To make dynamic web content both secure and accessible, content updates should be user-controlled rather than automatic, ARIA live regions should be used to inform screen readers of updates, and users should have the ability to pause or hide dynamic content that updates for more than 5 seconds. For security, implementations should include updated antivirus software, proper site encryption verification through 'https', and careful link validation to prevent phishing attacks.	"['Accessibility of AJAX Applications\nWhat is AJAX?\n- XHTML (or HTML) and CSS to create an interface and visually style information. The XHTML and CSS elements can be dynamically modified to display new information or styling. These changes are typically done using the Document Object Model.\nUsing AJAX, web applications can allow high levels of interactivity and processing, but do not require the standard type of client-server interaction, specifically:\n- A web page interface is presented.\n- User information is collected (via forms, links, etc.).\n- The user submits information (submits form, activates link, etc.).\n- The server processes submitted information.\n- A new web page interface is sent to the user.\nWith AJAX, all of these steps can be handled in one interface. Examples of AJAX implementation are mapping applications, real-time searches, chats, real-time form validation and processing, live shopping cart applications, e-mail applications, and the list goes on. The types of web applications and interactions allowed by using AJAX has given rise to the term ""Web 2.0"" — something that surely indicates a major revolution in the way the web can be used. While none of the technologies that comprise AJAX are new or groundbreaking, the increased popularity and awareness of AJAX development brings with it a need for developers to be aware of the accessibility implications these technologies bring.\nWhy not AJAX?\nIn general, when content within a page can update dynamically, users should be given control over those content updates, such as by activating a link or button. If content updates automatically without user interaction, there is potential for conflict - if an element that currently has focus is removed or significantly changed, keyboard focus can be lost and a screen reader may become confused. This can often result in focus and screen reader reading to revert to the top of the web page.\nAs an example, if a page displays updated sports scores every 10 seconds, it\'s quite possible that the automatic content updates will not be accessible to screen reader and keyboard users. And worse, the rest of the page content may also be inaccessible because they cannot reach it without encountering the dynamically updating content.\nWCAG 2.0 requires that content that updates dynamically for more than 5 seconds must provide the ability to pause, stop, or hide that dynamic content. If a pause or hide link is provided, ensure that it is available in an accessible way (e.g., it will be difficult to reach a pause button plaed after the dynamic element if that dynamic element causes continual loss of keyboard focus).\nIn addition to the potential for loss of focus, dynamic content updates may not be apparent to screen reader users. Activating a link or button generally causes a change of context (i.e., the user goes to a new page). With AJAX, the content update may appear in a different location within the same page. In these cases, it is generally necessary to inform the user of this update (perhaps by using an ARIA live region or alert) or by setting focus to the newly updated content area.\nWhile there is nothing inherently inaccessible about AJAX and dynamic updates, special care and testing (including screen reader testing) is often necessary to ensure that it is presented in an accessible manner.', 'Do phishing scams have you paranoid about surfing the Web? They should not, as they can be stopped, and this article will tell you how.\nWe previously covered the topic of phishing by giving you a basic definition of what it is. To review, phishing is basically an instance where a potential victim is contacted, usually by email or telephone, by a party posing as a legitimate institution in order to trick the target into handing over sensitive information.\nIn addition to offering a basic overview of what phishing is, we also told you the different ways to detect a phishing scam. In particular, we discussed the telltale signs that are commonly found in phishing emails. Among these characteristics are a sense of urgency, an offer that is too good to be true, randomly generated names, poor grammar and spelling, and malicious links to infected websites.\nWith a basic understanding of phishing scams and how to detect them, now is the time to learn how to stop them or prevent them from creating chaos not only for your computer, but also your personal life. After all, these scams happen for a reason, and many times that reason is to pad the pockets of cybercriminals with your hard-earned money.\nSo, let us now take a look at how you can not only stop phishing scams, but also report them to help keep them from affecting new victims.\nWhether you are an expert Web surfer or a complete newbie, you will come across a phishing scam at one point or another during your online time. Some of these scams are very crafty and well-designed, so they might catch you if you are not paying attention. To help you out, here are tips that you can implement to your everyday surfing activities to avoid these scams.\nUse trusted up-to-date antivirus software and a firewall to provide a barrier between you and cybercriminals.\nUpdates, Updates, Updates\nWhether it is antivirus software, your browser, operating system, or applications, you need to keep everything updated. Vendors send out patches to fix detected vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. It may be annoying, but updating is essential to your online protection against phishing and other cyber crime.\nLeverage the Power of Nifty Toolbars\nMany popular browsers now offer the extended functionality of toolbars that can detect phishing sites. The toolbars check the site you are visiting against a blacklist of known phishing sites to tell you if you are safe.\nCheck Site Security\nWhenever you are entering in personal information, such as a password, banking information, credit card information, and the like, you want to make sure the site is properly secured so your information will not be leaked to others. There are a few things to look for to determine this. First, make sure that the “https” prefix is in the URL. Second, look for a little icon of a closed lock that means your connection is encrypted. Depending on your browser, you can click on the icon to see the site’s security details.\nManage Popups Properly\nPopups are not only irritating, but they can also be dangerous. Some come in the form of scareware that tricks you into thinking your computer is infected. Others offer phony rewards if you fill out phishing forms with your personal information. Use a popup blocker in your browser to keep popups at a minimum. If one does appear, avoid clicking options like “OK” or “Cancel” as these could just lead you into a phishing scheme or infected site. Either close out your browser, or click the X in the top right corner to exit the popup.\nWatch Where You Click\nIt may be tempting to click a lot of links when you surf the Web, but it is not a very good habit to have. Creators of phishing and other scams know what tempts users, and they leverage this knowledge to devise schemes to get you to click links that lead to sites that try to phish your information. Clicking links on a trusted site is fine, but clicking them on an unknown site, in email, or in instant messages could land you in trouble. Remember to always hover over a link to see exactly where it leads you, as some links will be disguised and will actually take you to a different site than promised.\nKeep Your Information to Yourself\nDo you want to make sure phishing attacks never compromise your personal information? If so, keep it to yourself, especially when wandering into unknown territory. If you do not disclose any personal information on the internet, you do not have to worry about anyone getting their hands on it. This goes for telephone calls as well. You never know who is on the other end. It is better off to call an institution directly or visit their official website and do your business from there. Never, ever disclose information via email, instant messaging, etc.\nRead Up on New Phishing Trends\nAs internet security companies and users out certain phishing scams, it becomes time for cybercriminals to change up their game plans. A stale scam has less of a chance to be successful as a new one, so new scams are constantly popping up around the online community. You can keep yourself educated on new phishing scams by doing periodic checks for news on the topic. A simple search in Google News for the term “phishing” should bring up plenty of news articles that detail newly detected scams. By being educated on the subject, you will be able to spot phishing scams easily and stop them from tricking you.\nPerform Account Maintenance\nAccount maintenance means checking your online accounts periodically to look for any unusual behavior. This mostly pertains to financial accounts (banking, credit cards, PayPal, etc.), but you should also do it for email accounts and social networking to make sure they are not compromised and being used to send out spam. A solid maintenance practice is to change your passwords frequently to keep hackers at bay. Do not use the same password on multiple sites, however.\nUse Common Sense\nNobody is going to give you free electronics and lottery prizes just for surfing the Web. Avoid these offers. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Use your instincts when surfing online just as you would in the real world.\nReport Phishing Scams\nIf you come across a phishing scam, report it and do your part to derail these scammers from affecting more victims. Some email services allow you to mark messages as phishing scams, such as Hotmail. You can also report phishing scams to certain websites dedicated to stopping them. Here are two links to do so:\nUnited States Computer Emergency Readiness Team - http://www.us-cert.gov/nav/report_phishing.html\nAnti-Phishing Working Group - http://www.antiphishing.org/report_phishing.html\n| DISCLAIMER: The content provided in this article is not warranted or guaranteed by Developer Shed, Inc.

82	I've been looking at fishing weights and noticed some are made of lead while others are made of different materials - what's the reason for having different materials for weights?	The use of different materials for fishing weights is primarily due to environmental concerns. Traditionally, most weights or sinkers were made from lead. However, certain states have banned the use of lead sinkers because of the potential harm they could bring to healthy ecosystems. As a result, weights are now also being manufactured in alternative materials such as brass and other metals to address these environmental considerations while still providing the necessary weight for different fishing situations.	"['Ponds, lakes, streams – all the bodies of water out there are ripe with a menu of the most prized catches possible. Even that trophy is just waiting for the ‘star’ fisherman to outsmart it.\nBut tackling the tackle is difficult. For the amateur or enthusiast just starting out, selecting the right tackle is not only important to outwit the prey, but also can be more than a bit confusing. Everyone knows the basics; but just as it is with ammo for the hunter, gear used for fishing is varied. From terminal tackle (leaders, swivels, sinkers, etc.), to fishing tackle specifically designed for a certain type of fishing, a complete assembly of tackle can be difficult to attain.\nCommercial fishing, of course, has it’s own gear and essential items, but now that the weather is warm and the lakes are calling out to one and all, the recreational angler is the one we focus on.\nThe hook was used thousands of years ago and was just a long, thin piece of bone. The hook would be fixed with bait and, when swallowed, a tug on the line was all that was needed to nab dinner.\nSeeing as that there are an enormous variety of fish, there are just as many hooks to choose from. Various sizes and every imaginable shape are manufactured, in a wide range of materials depending on the hook’s purpose. Fish hooks are made for all types of artificial or dead/live baits used in bait, fly, or even lure fishing.\nNow comes the line. Once made of horse hair, lines are now made from nylon, polyethylene and other materials that offer strength, buoyancy and the ability to stretch under load. When purchasing line, length, material and weight need to be checked out! In addition to the hook and line, that heavy trophy may just require a landing net.\nA sinker is used as a weight when angling to make the lure/bait sink faster or to increase cast distance. Coming in many shapes, sinkers may be made of lead. This is something to think about, seeing as that certain states have banned the use of lead sinkers because of the harm they could bring to those healthy ecosystems.\nA fishing rod is an additional tool used with the hook, line and sinker. The length of fishing line attaches to the long, flexible rod or pole and basically hooks the fish. This is common knowledge. However, there are so many types of rods to choose from, it is best that the fisherman knows exactly what type of fishing they want to do before ever going shopping.\nRods have become very sophisticated in our day and age, fitted with line guides and a reel for line stowage. Manufactured in everything from fiberglass to carbon fiber to bamboo, the rods can be found in many lengths ranging from 24 inches up to 20 feet. The longer the rod, the greater the advantage when it comes to casting. Fly rods, spin and bait casting rods, ice rods, surf rods, trolling rods – the list goes on, representing any possible fishing the angler wants to try.\nA spinning reel is basically a spool mounted on an axle and is used for deploying and then retrieving the line. Although reels are a traditional angler’s need, there are many reels offered for very specialized fishing.\nThere are a list of other items to aid the angler, but when it comes to choosing the bait this may just be the most important decision you make. Thankfully, fish are a lot like dogs when it comes to snacking – treats can come in all forms to entice them. Natural bait is usually best. Alive or dead, the most common bait includes; worms, leeches, salamanders and other insects. The earthworm is still the universal choice to nab the fresh water fish and the more lifelike, the better.\nAbove all, enjoy the challenges that fishing brings. And with a little luck, you may just outsmart that ‘king’ of the lake.', ""When fishing, the only thing between you and a hooked fish is the line. If the line pound test (or strength) is not enough, or the line is frayed, there's a good chance the fish will be lost. Different types of line are available for different types of fishing. The most common lines used today are monofilament, fly line, and the new braided lines. Be sure to select the right line for the type of fishing done, and always the best buy you can afford.\nBelow is a description of the lines illustrated.\n1. Monofilament: Also known as just plain fishing line, monofilament is made by a number of manufacturers, and come in a variety of pound tests, and colors. Some lines are stiff where others are limp, it's a personal preference. As with the color of the line, it's a personal thing, but some colors are easier to see. A consideration when selecting a line is that higher quality lines will resist abrasion and stretching better than cheap lines. Also, be sure to use proper knots when tying on baits or lures, a bad knot can make the line cut itself, and remember to retie the knot often. If any abrasion is noticed, retie. To protect monofilament, try to keep out of the direct sunlight when storing your rods and reels. Also, avoid contact with petroleum products such as gasoline.\n2. Fly Line: Made from a soft plastic, fly line comes from a number of manufacturers, and is available in a variety of weights and colors. Fly line comes in two types, floating and sinking. The type of line depends on the kind of fishing done. Also, almost all fly lines are tapered at the end for easier tying of the leader.\n3. Braided Lines: The newest lines available are the braided lines. Similar to the braided lines of the past, these new lines use different materials, manufacturing processes, and are thinner in diameter. Braided lines will virtually last forever, do not stretch, and are thinner compared to the test ratio of monofilaments. As an example, a 30 pound test braided line has about the same diameter as 14 pound test monofilament. The only real drawbacks to using braided lines are the high cost, cutting of the lines, and knot tying. Improvements and tools are being made to help anglers in using these lines.\nThe fishing hook, the only thing that holds the fish at the end of the line, sometimes, is a very efficiently designed fishing tool, that comes in many sizes, styles, and materials. The illustration shows four types of hooks, straight shank, offset, Aberdeen, and treble, but these are not all the styles available. There are many specialty hooks available also, but all are variations of the hooks shown. The type, size, and style of hook used is determined by the type of fishing done. In most cases, it comes down to plain common sense which hook to use, and some variations may have advantages over others.\nMost hooks are made from steel or brass. Different coatings are applied to keep the hooks from rusting, but if used enough, they will rust. When selecting a hook, think about the type of fishing that will be done. When fishing for large fish such as bass or catfish, select a good steel hook. If fishing for panfish that may be stacked in sunken brush, select a brass hook, the hook bends easier and can be pulled out of a snag. The hook sizes vary from 18 to 5/0, the larger the number, the smaller the hook. For example, a size 14 would do fine for salmon eggs when fishing for trout, where a size 1/0 would work well for plastic worms when fishing for bass.\nVariations of hooks are also available for different types of baits. For plastic baits, some hooks are designed with offset turns for better hook sets, or different eyes for anchoring the bait. Some have wires to make them weedless, while others have wider throats to handle larger live bait. If you find a hook that works for you, stay with it.\nBelow is a description of the hooks illustrated.\n1. Straight Shank: As the name says, this hook has a straight shank, and can be used for a variety of fish and baits. Though this hook can be used with plastic baits, the straight shank hook is usually used with live bait. Typical baits depending on hook size would include minnows, shiners, worms, crawdads, and crickets. The straight shank hook also comes in different styles with wider throats, heavier steel, and bent eyes.\n2. Offset Shank: Though this hook can again be used for a variety of fish and baits, the offset shank hook was developed for use with plastic baits such as worms, lizards, or salt craws. The offset design allows the eye of the hook to be buried into the plastic bait for Texas style rigging, without interfering with the performance. Again, there are variations of this hook as well with different size offsets or special bends.\n3. Aberdeen: This hook has the same design as the typical straight shank hook, but is made from brass. The brass allows the hook to be used in brush or trees where snags are common. Once pulled free, the hook can be bent back to shape and reused. The Aberdeen style hook also has variations with different bends in the shank and eye for special uses.\n4. Treble Hook: The treble hook offers the advantage of three hooks in one. Also available in steel or brass, the treble hook is used on casting baits such as crankbaits, or can be used for clumping salmon eggs for trout, or stinkbait for catfish.\nWhen fishing certain situations, a weight is needed to get the bait down, keep it in one spot, or slow the bait down through a current. There are a variety of weights available for almost every type of fishing. Almost all weights are made from lead, but some are now available in brass and other metals due to environmental considerations. Weights or sinkers range in weight from 1/32 ounce to 1/2 ounce or better.\nBelow is a description of the weights illustrated.\n1. Split Shot: The split shot is probably the most popular of all weights. Almost every fisherman has them in their tackle boxes, or on the floor of their boats. Resembling a shot form a shotgun, the split shot weight has a slit down one side. The slit allows the shot to be crimped anywhere on the line. This type of weight is used mostly when fishing for crappie or bluegill to weight down minnows, worms, or crickets. Simply find a desired location for the weight and crimp it on the line. Be sure to use pliers when crimping though, it's a lot cheaper than a trip to the dentist.\n2. Bell Sinker: Resembling a bell shape, the bell sinker is used when one or more baited lines are attached to the main fishing line, or when making a drag rig. Usually ranging in weight from 1/8 ounce to 1 ounce, the bell sinker works well when trying to keep the bait off the bottom when still fishing or moving along a current.\n3. Barrel Sinker: Similar to a bell sinker, the barrel sinker has eyes at both ends. As with the bell sinker, single or multiple baited lines can be used with the barrel sinker. In most cases though, the barrel sinker is used with a single line that's cut to a determined length to keep the bait off the bottom. The added line also allows the fish to take the bait and hold it before feeling the weight. This is a great advantage to the fisherman. The rounded edges of the barrel sinker helps to keep the sinker from snagging on rocks or in crevices. The weight ranges of the barrel sinker are from 1/4 ounce to 8 ounces.\n4. Worm Weights: Also known as slip sinkers, the worm weight is used mostly when fishing with plastic worms. Ranging in weights from 1/16 ounce to 1 ounce, the worm weight can move freely along the fishing line. When rigging a worm weight, the line is passed through the weight, then tied to the hook. While on the bottom, the fish can take the worm without feeling the weight, giving the fisherman time to get ready for the hook set. The cone shape of the weight allows it to pass through vegetation, trees, and rocks. To keep the worm and weight from hanging over trees, the worm weight is sometimes pegged to the line with a toothpick. Glass beads are also added at times between the weight and the worm to add sound when working the worm.\nWhen fishing bait, live or not, there are many times when the bait needs to be held just off the bottom or suspended at a certain depth. This is where the float or bobber come into play. Just for information, there are probably just as many styles of floats as there are hooks. The floats that are illustrated are the most common ones used. They are the Ball Bobber, Slip Bobber, and Spring Bobber.\nAll three floats can be used for a catching a variety of fish, and used in different ways. Most commonly, floats are associated with panfish such as bluegill or crappie, but are also used for trout when using salmon eggs or jigs, and bass when using large shiners. The type of fishing done and bait used may determine which float to use.\nFloats come in different sizes, colors, and materials. In most cases, which one to use is a personal preference. You may find though that some floats work better under certain situations. The size float to use will depend on the size of the bait used and the fish you're after. As far as color, it's best to find a color that you can see whether the skies are clear or cloudy. For materials, there is plastic, foam, or wood. Plastic is good, but a couple of hits on the rocks, or if they're stepped on, the float is useless. Foam is an excellent choice. They're durable and maintain their buoyancy. Wood floats are still made, but for the most part, is reserved for specialty floats.\nBelow is a description of the floats illustrated.\n1. Ball Bobber: This is probably the most common float used. The ball bobber comes in a variety of sizes and colors, and can be found in plastic or foam. The float is easy to use, just press on one side and a spring loaded hook comes out to attach to the line. The hook allows the float to be adjusted on the line, depending on the depth needed, or removed if no longer needed. The ball bobber can be used red or white side up.\n2. Slip Bobber: The slip bobber is unique from all other bobbers in the way that it is used. Unlike other floats that are attached directly to the line, the slip bobber uses a bobber stop and bead, and has a hollow stem that the line passes through. The bobber stop, which is threaded on the line, can be slid up or down depending on the depth your fishing. The bead is used to keep the bobber stop from passing through the slip bobber stem. The advantage of the slip bobber is that you can reel almost all the line in before casting, and not have 6, 8 or 10 feet of line hanging out. Once cast, the hook, bait, and sinker pull the line through the bobber until it reaches the stop. If you need to fish deeper, slide the stop higher up the line. The slip bobber is great when teaching children to fish.\n3.Spring Bobber: The spring bobber, like the ball bobber is another popular float for panfish. The design of the spring bobber allows the line to be attached on a stem below the float, which puts the connecting point below the water surface. This allows for greater stability and more sensitivity in the float. As with other floats, the spring bobber comes in many colors, sizes, and can be found in plastic or foam.""]"	['<urn:uuid:06feb97b-6b92-4f38-9794-20f237b706c2>', '<urn:uuid:e60c3be0-8478-48a6-a602-3fac04103b06>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	30	77	2722
83	How do the steps of gaining attention and establishing emotional climate work together in effective learning, and what scientific evidence supports their importance?	Gaining attention involves creating a stimulus change that signals learning is about to take place, such as going to the library or setting an alarm as a trigger. This works alongside establishing an emotional climate because the brain processes emotions before thoughts - the amygdala receives stimuli 40 milliseconds before the cortex. In practice, this means that reducing stress is crucial for learning, which can be achieved through making eye contact with students, greeting them, and taking time to chat before starting lessons. Both elements are foundational steps that prepare learners for effective knowledge acquisition.	['Robert Gagne was an American educational psychologist who pioneered the science of instruction in the second world war working with the Army Air Corps, training pilots. His focus was on simplifying and explaining what he and others believed to be good instruction.\nLike many academics he wrote and published papers on different areas, for example he developed a hierarchy of learning, similar to Bloom with behavioural aspects at the bottom and cognitive ones at the top. But he is probably most well-known for his Nine levels of learning or as it is referred to here, The nine steps of delivery.\nNow the only problem with this is that there are nine steps and anyone who has read this blog before will know, nine is just to The answer is simple, chunk it down into smaller sections.\nWhy is this important?\nGagne’s objective was to provide a systematic process to help teachers and trainers better structure what they do in order to keep students engaged and help them retain knowledge. But the process he created also provides an insight as to how learning works and can be used by students to structure their own learning. Below are the nine steps broken down under three headings. As well as explaining how each step works, I will also add comments as to what it means for a student who might be studying on their own.\n- Gaining attention\nStart the learning experience by gaining the attention of your learners. The change in stimulus tells them that learning will soon take place. For the student this means you need to create a break from what you are doing and get into a mood to start studying. This might involve going to the library or setting an alarm on your phone to create a trigger telling you something different is about to happen.\n- Informing the learner of the objective\nShare the learning objective with students early on. What should they know at the end of the session that they didn’t before. For the student it’s important you also know what you are trying to learn, what will you be aware of at the end of this session that you don’t know now. It also helps if your aware of why its important e.g. maybe it’s a very popular exam area or is developed in more detail later so you need to learn it now.\n- Stimulating recall of prior learning\nRelate the new learning back to something learned before or a similar experience your learners have had, this forms a link between the old and new. For the student this is a reflective process, how does this topic relate to what you have learned in the past, how does it fit in?\nInstruction and practice\n- Presenting the content\nPresent the new content to the learners. For the student this is where you start reading or listening to the new content.\n- Providing learning guidance\nExplain to the learners what something means by giving examples, highlight what’s difficult and what’s not. For the student this is where you have to rely on the instruction provided in the learning materials\n- Eliciting performance\nHere the learner has to practice what they have been taught in order to demonstrate understanding. For the student this is the equivalent to attempting a question or by way of analogy, trying to turn the theory of how to bake a cake into a reality by actually baking one.\nAssessment and transfer\n- Providing feedback\nProvide guidance to the learner as to what the difference was between their answer and the correct one, what do they need to do to close that gap? For the student this is where it is helpful to work with others, perhaps you mark their answer and they mark yours. To follow the cake example, take it out of the oven and look at it, is it the right texture and colour, then taste it. What do you need to do to make it the best cake ever?\n- Assessing the performance\nAssessing learner performance is usually demonstrated by asking them to take a test. For the student its very similar this time, take the test and see what score you get.\n- Enhancing retention and transfer\nThe learner now needs to demonstrate this by applying it to their job or by teaching others. This last stage often requires continual practice and feedback to become competent. For the student who thinks their objective is to do little more than pass the exam it may not seem important, however in the medium to long term applying learning is the main goal.\nAnd that’s all you have to do, nine steps that break down instruction and in so doing providing a roadmap to effective study. It has been argued that the process doesn’t work so well for more creative subjects, after all it was designed around training airline pilots. However, it can teach you to fly and most importantly land a plane it’s probably good enough for most areas of learning.', 'by Ramona Persaud\nWhen you’re standing in front of a classroom of students who’re not quite sure they even want to be in your class, much less pay attention to what’s being said, things like neuroscience, research studies, and teaching the way the brain learns are an abstraction.\nYet, brain-targeted teaching can engage and excite students because it taps into factors that stimulate the brain, grab the attention, and set the stage for learning.\nDr. Mariale Hardiman, a former school principal, now professor at Johns Hopkins, developed a teaching framework designed to help teachers, teach the way the brain learns. Practioners of the model, Justin Holbrook, Jeremy Mettler, and Vicky Krug, describe the model as a set of guidelines to help organize material, “It gives you a way to organize the material you’re covering and to explore different ways to communicate it, explains Holbrook.\nKrug continues, “Learning only occurs when the student can connect new information to old information. Teaching someone how a car works is pointless if they don’t know what a car is.”\nMettler also points out the importance of recognizing it as a non-linear process, “The components are all interrelated.”\nBrain Target 1: Establish the emotional climate for learning\nNeuroscience: The brain feels before it thinks. The amygdala (think fight/flight) receives stimuli 40 milliseconds before the cortex (thinking). (LeDoux, 1996).\nUsable classroom translation: stress impedes learning. Try to connect with your students when they come into your class by making eye contact, greetings, and taking a moment to chat before diving into the lesson.\nBrain Target 2: Creating the Physical Learning Environment\nNeuroscience: The brain craves novelty. Posner & Rothbart, 2007); lighting, background noise impact on attention; the body is designed for movement (Medina, 2008)\nUsable classroom translation: make regular changes in your classroom such as seating arrangements, wall displays. Inventory your learning space and note where it’s possible to modify things such as lighting, turning down speakers, etc.\nBrain Target 3: Designing the Learning Experience\nNeuroscience behind it: The brain looks for patterns between known and unknown information (Posner & Rothbart, 2007)\nUsable classroom translation: Give students the big picture; visually represent the connections between previous knowledge and new learning; indicate relationships among learning goals.\nBrain Target 4: Teaching for Mastery\nNeuroscience behind it: In order for information to be retained it must make its way from short-term to long-term memory.\nUsable classroom translation: Use the arts as a tool to enhance and reinforce learning goals (Rinne, Gregory, Yarmolinskaya, and Hardiman, 2011)\nBrain Target 5: Teaching for the Extension\nNeuroscience behind it: The brain is plastic. Significant changes occur in the brain due to repeated sensory experience (Fu & Zuo,2011, Karmarkar & Dan, 2006)\nUsable classroom translation: Creativity can be taught but it builds on a body of content knowledge being mastered. Interweave information and thinking in all content areas; show real world applications, move away from simple, single-answer problems to encourage divergent solutions.\nBrain Target 6: Evaluating Learning\nNeuroscience behind it: Assessments provides feedback that informs and motivates students; retrieval of information recruits memory systems, reinforcing memory for that information.\nUsable classroom translation: Feedback has to be useful, timely; model active retrieval – flashcards, self-quizzing (no looking at the answers), space learning, multiple types of assessments.\nFurther Reading & Connecting\nFor more information about brain targeted teaching go to braintargetedteaching.org\nCheck out a trailer for the documentary Grey Matters, exploring Hardiman’s model in practice, with Holbrook, Mettler, and Krug here.\nThis film is currently crowdfunding for postproduction funds (all donations are tax deductible).\nRamona Persaud is an independent documentary filmmaker, writer, and photographer. “Grey Matters” is her second film.

84	extremophiles mars life implications discovery	Extremophiles, organisms that thrive in extreme conditions harmful to most life on Earth, provide important insights for Mars exploration and the search for life. On Earth, these microbes survive in conditions like high temperatures, extreme pH levels, and very dry environments similar to Mars. The study of extremophiles has crucial implications for Mars exploration, as NASA's rovers have discovered evidence of past water and organic molecules on Mars. The presence of these conditions, combined with our understanding of extremophiles' resilience, suggests the possibility of past or present microbial life on Mars, particularly in subsurface environments protected from harsh surface conditions.	"['An extremophile is an organism that thrives in extreme conditions that are harmful to most life on Earth. In contrast, organisms from moderate temperature or neutral pH environments may be termed mesophiles or neutrophiles.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, biologists found that microbial life has a capacity for surviving in extreme environments. These are niches that are extreme in some way. They may be extraordinarily hot, or cold, or dry, or under immense pressures, or very salty or acidic. Such conditions are inhospitable to complex organisms. Some scientists suggest that life may have begun on Earth in hydrothermal vents far below the ocean surface. High temperature habitats such as hot oceans, hot springs and deep ocean thermal vents would have occurred widely in the early Archaean eon (from 3.9 billion years ago). Adaptation to these conditions may have been crucial to the development of early forms of life.\nTypes of extremophiles[change | change source]\nMost known extremophiles are microbes. The domain Archaea contains well-known examples, but extremophiles occur in bacteria as well. It is a mistake to use the term extremophile for all archaeans, as some are mesophilic. Nor are all extremophiles unicellular; protostome animals found in similar environments.\nSome extremophiles fall under several categories. For example, organisms living inside hot rocks deep under Earth\'s surface are both thermophilic and barophilic.\n- An organism with optimal growth at pH levels of 3 or below\n- An organism with optimal growth at pH levels of 9 or above\n- An organism that lives in microscopic spaces within rocks, fissures, aquifers, and faults filled with groundwater in the deep subsurface\n- An organism requiring at least 0.2molar concentrations of salt (NaCl) for growth\n- An organism that can thrive at temperatures between 80–122 °C, such as those found in hydrothermal systems\n- An organism that lives inside rocks in cold deserts\n- An organism (usually bacteria) whose sole source of carbon is carbon dioxide and exergonic inorganic oxidation (chemolithotrophs) such as Nitrosomonas europaea; these organisms are capable of deriving energy from reduced mineral compounds like pyrites, and are active in geochemical cycling and the weathering of parent bedrock to form soil\n- capable of tolerating high levels of dissolved heavy metals in solution, such as copper, cadmium, arsenic, and zinc; examples include Ferroplasma sp. and Ralstonia metallidurans\n- An organism capable of growth in nutritionally limited environments\n- An organism capable of growth in environments with a high sugar concentration\n- An organism that lives optimally at high hydrostatic pressure; common in the deep terrestrial subsurface, as well as in oceanic trenches\n- An organism that qualifies as an extremophile under more than one category\n- An organism that grows better at temperatures of 15 °C or lower; common in cold soils, permafrost, polar ice, cold ocean water, and in or under alpine snowpack\n- Organisms resistant to high levels of ionizing radiation, most commonly ultraviolet radiation, but also including organisms capable of resisting nuclear radiation\n- An organism that can thrive at temperatures between 60–80 °C\n- Combination of thermophile and acidophile that prefer temperatures of 70–80 °C and pH between 2 and 3\n- An organism that can grow in extremely dry, desiccating conditions; this type is exemplified by the soil microbes of the Atacama Desert\nReferences[change | change source]\n- ""Mars Exploration - Press kit"" (PDF).

Academic Press, San Diego.', 'Advancements in Astrobiology ResearchFSE Editors and Writers | Sept. 12, 2023\nFor millennia, humanity has gazed at the night sky and wondered if we are alone in the universe. This age-old question has driven scientific exploration and inquiry, leading to the field of astrobiology. Astrobiology is a multidisciplinary science that seeks to understand the potential for life beyond Earth, and it has seen remarkable advancements in recent years.\nAstrobiology: A Multifaceted Pursuit\nAstrobiology, often described as the ""science of possibilities,"" is a multidisciplinary field that transcends the boundaries of traditional scientific disciplines. It encompasses a wide spectrum of scientific domains, including astronomy, biology, chemistry, planetary science, and more. At its core, astrobiology seeks to unravel the mysteries of life\'s existence beyond the confines of our home planet, Earth.\nThe origins of astrobiology can be traced back to humanity\'s perennial fascination with the cosmos and the profound question of whether life exists elsewhere in the universe. While the term ""astrobiology"" is relatively recent, dating back to the mid-20th century, its foundations lie in centuries of philosophical contemplation and scientific exploration.\nAstrobiology rests on three fundamental pillars:\nUnderstanding Life on Earth: To comprehend the potential for life beyond Earth, astrobiologists first seek to understand life as we know it on our home planet. This entails exploring the origins of life, the extremes at which life can thrive, and the complex interplay between biology, chemistry, and geology.\nExploring Extreme Environments: Extremophiles—microorganisms capable of thriving in environments once considered inhospitable—have provided crucial insights into the adaptability and resilience of life. Researchers study these organisms to gain a deeper understanding of how life might endure on other celestial bodies, such as icy moons or scorching exoplanets.\nSearching for Extraterrestrial Life: Perhaps the most captivating facet of astrobiology is the search for extraterrestrial life. This pursuit involves scouring the cosmos for signs of habitable environments, analyzing the atmospheres of exoplanets for biosignatures, and even investigating the subsurface oceans of distant moons like Europa and Enceladus.\nAstrobiology thrives on interdisciplinary collaboration. Scientists from diverse backgrounds collaborate to tackle the complex questions posed by this field. Astronomers identify potentially habitable exoplanets, biologists study extremophiles, chemists investigate prebiotic chemistry, and planetary scientists analyze the geology of other worlds. This interdisciplinary approach is essential for piecing together the puzzle of life\'s existence beyond Earth.\nAs astrobiology continues to advance, ethical considerations come to the forefront. Questions about how to handle the discovery of extraterrestrial life, planetary protection to prevent contamination of other celestial bodies, and responsible exploration of potentially habitable worlds demand thoughtful ethical frameworks.\nIn essence, astrobiology embodies the human spirit of curiosity and exploration. It bridges the realms of scientific inquiry and philosophical contemplation, propelling us toward a deeper understanding of our place in the universe. While astrobiology has yet to provide definitive answers to the age-old question of extraterrestrial life, its multifaceted pursuit has illuminated the vast possibilities that await our discovery beyond the boundaries of our pale blue dot.\nReceive Free Grammar and Publishing Tips via Email\nThe Kepler Mission and Exoplanets\nOne of the most groundbreaking chapters in astrobiology research was written by NASA\'s Kepler mission, which commenced its journey into the cosmos in 2009. Its primary objective was to seek out exoplanets—planets orbiting stars beyond our solar system—in the ""habitable zone,"" where conditions might be conducive to the existence of liquid water, a fundamental prerequisite for life as we know it.\nKepler employed a remarkably simple yet ingenious approach to detect exoplanets. It continuously monitored the brightness of over 150,000 stars, looking for tiny, periodic dips in their light. These periodic dimming events, known as transits, occur when an exoplanet passes in front of its host star, causing a temporary reduction in the star\'s brightness, akin to a celestial eclipse. By meticulously recording these variations in light, Kepler unveiled the presence of thousands of exoplanets.\nOver the course of its mission, Kepler uncovered a treasure trove of exoplanets—thousands of them, with diverse characteristics and intriguing features. Perhaps the most astonishing revelation was the prevalence of exoplanets throughout the galaxy. Kepler\'s observations suggested that a substantial portion of stars in the Milky Way may host planetary systems, some of which could potentially harbor life.\nKepler\'s most exciting discoveries included exoplanets located in the habitable zone, often referred to as the ""Goldilocks zone."" These planets orbit their stars at just the right distance, where conditions may be suitable for liquid water to exist—a vital ingredient for life as we know it. While these findings don\'t confirm the presence of life, they open tantalizing possibilities for further investigation.\nThe diversity of exoplanets revealed by Kepler is awe-inspiring. From massive gas giants to rocky, Earth-like planets, the variety of worlds far exceeds what was previously imagined. Kepler\'s data showed that planetary systems come in a multitude of configurations, challenging our preconceptions and expanding our understanding of celestial mechanics.\nIn 2018, after nearly a decade of observations, the Kepler spacecraft retired. Its legacy, however, endures. The wealth of data it provided continues to fuel scientific inquiry and exploration. Kepler\'s successors, such as NASA\'s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), have picked up where it left off, furthering the quest to identify exoplanets and assess their potential habitability.\nThe Kepler mission stands as a testament to human ingenuity and our insatiable curiosity about the cosmos. Its contributions to astrobiology are immeasurable, reshaping our understanding of the prevalence of exoplanets and the potential for life beyond Earth. As we gaze at the stars and ponder the mysteries of the universe, Kepler\'s enduring legacy reminds us that the search for other habitable worlds is a quest that continues to captivate our imagination and drive scientific exploration.\nMars Exploration and the Search for Life\nMars, the fourth planet from the Sun, has long been a focal point in the quest for extraterrestrial life. The allure of the Red Planet lies not only in its proximity to Earth but also in tantalizing hints of its watery past and the possibility that microbial life may exist or have existed there. Mars exploration missions, particularly those in recent years, have provided compelling evidence that fuels the ongoing search for life beyond our home planet.\nHumans have been captivated by Mars for centuries, envisioning it as a potential abode for life. Early telescopic observations revealed surface features, including polar ice caps, that hinted at a dynamic and Earth-like world. This fascination intensified with the advent of space exploration.\nWater is a fundamental ingredient for life, and Mars has offered intriguing clues about its presence. Ancient river valleys, lakebeds, and evidence of liquid water flows on the Martian surface suggest that Mars was once a more hospitable world. This historical water presence has fueled hopes of finding evidence of past or present life.NASA\'s Mars rovers, including Curiosity and Perseverance, have played pivotal roles in Mars exploration. These robotic geologists have traversed the Martian landscape, conducting experiments, analyzing rocks, and searching for signs of habitable conditions. The discovery of organic molecules and the detection of methane in the Martian atmosphere have raised tantalizing questions about the potential for life\nMethane, a simple organic molecule, is of particular interest in the search for life. On Earth, methane is often produced by biological processes. While the exact source of methane on Mars remains uncertain, its presence adds complexity to the search for microbial life or other sources of this intriguing gas.\nThe search for life on Mars is an ongoing endeavor, and future missions are poised to expand our understanding further. These missions include the Mars Sample Return campaign, which aims to collect Martian samples for return to Earth, where they can be studied in more detail. Additionally, the search for subsurface life, protected from harsh surface conditions, remains a focus of exploration.\nAs our exploration of Mars deepens, so does the recognition of the profound implications of discovering life beyond Earth. Such a discovery would revolutionize our understanding of biology and our place in the universe. While the quest for life on Mars has yet to yield conclusive evidence, each mission brings us closer to unraveling the enduring mystery of whether life exists—or once thrived—on the Red Planet. Mars remains an enigmatic world, holding secrets that continue to captivate the imagination of scientists and space enthusiasts alike.\nExtremophiles on Earth: Insights into Alien Life\nLife on Earth is remarkably adaptable, thriving in a breathtaking array of environments, from scorching hydrothermal vents at the ocean\'s depths to the icy expanses of Antarctica. These hardy organisms, known as extremophiles, provide invaluable insights into the potential for life to exist in extreme conditions on other celestial bodies.\nExtremophiles, meaning ""lovers of extreme conditions,"" challenge conventional notions of where life can flourish. They have been discovered in some of the most inhospitable places on Earth, such as acidic hot springs, salt flats, and deep-sea hydrothermal vents. The resilience of extremophiles showcases the adaptability of life forms and hints at the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\nStudying extremophiles offers a window into the fundamental requirements for life. These microorganisms have evolved unique biochemical and physiological adaptations to survive in their extreme habitats. For example, thermophiles thrive in high-temperature environments, while acidophiles endure highly acidic conditions.\nDeep-sea hydrothermal vents, located on the ocean floor, are one of the most extreme environments on Earth. The superheated water, rich in minerals, harbors a diverse community of extremophiles. These vent ecosystems provide a tantalizing analogy for potential life on other celestial bodies, where subsurface oceans may exist.\nExtremophiles have become darlings of astrobiology—the study of the potential for life beyond Earth. The discovery of extremophiles challenges the traditional habitability criteria and expands the horizons of where scientists should search for life in our solar system and beyond.\nMars, with its frigid temperatures and harsh surface conditions, is often compared to Earth\'s extreme environments. By studying extremophiles in Mars analog sites on Earth, such as the Atacama Desert in Chile, researchers gain insights into how life might persist on the Red Planet.\nThe discovery of exoplanets—planets orbiting stars outside our solar system—has ignited the imagination of astrobiologists. Some of these exoplanets may possess extreme conditions that challenge our understanding of habitability. Extremophiles provide a basis for considering the potential for life on such worlds.\nIn summary, extremophiles on Earth are not just resilient survivors; they are our guides to the possibility of life beyond our planet. By pushing the boundaries of where life can exist, these microorganisms inspire scientists to broaden their search for extraterrestrial life. Extremophiles remind us that life is tenacious, adaptable, and capable of flourishing in the most unlikely places—a testament to the incredible diversity and resilience of biology on Earth and, potentially, in the cosmos beyond.\nReceive Free Grammar and Publishing Tips via Email\nThe Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI)\nThe quest to detect signals from intelligent civilizations beyond Earth is one of the most profound and tantalizing endeavors in the realm of astrobiology. Known as the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), this scientific pursuit aims to answer one of humanity\'s most fundamental questions: Are we alone in the universe?\nThe roots of SETI can be traced back to the pioneering work of scientists like Frank Drake, who conducted the first modern SETI experiment in 1960, known as the Drake Equation. This equation aimed to estimate the number of technologically advanced civilizations in our Milky Way galaxy with which we might be able to communicate. While it provided a framework for thinking about the search, it did not yield direct results.\nSETI researchers employ a variety of methods to scan the cosmos for signals that may be indicative of intelligent extraterrestrial life. These methods include the use of radio telescopes and more recently, optical and infrared telescopes. The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI Institute) and other organizations actively listen for narrow-bandwidth radio signals or optical pulses that stand out against the cosmic background noise.\nThe search for extraterrestrial signals is not without challenges. The vastness of the cosmos, the limitations of our technology, and the question of whether advanced civilizations would use the same communication methods as us all pose significant hurdles. Nonetheless, advancements in computing power and the development of sophisticated algorithms have enhanced our ability to process vast amounts of data from the cosmos.\nOne of the most famous moments in SETI history was the detection of the ""Wow! signal"" in 1977. This strong, narrowband radio signal lasted for 72 seconds and matched the expected signature of an extraterrestrial transmission. While this signal has never been conclusively explained, it serves as a reminder of the tantalizing possibilities that SETI holds.\nSETI is an ongoing endeavor. Projects like the Breakthrough Listen initiative, funded by billionaire Yuri Milner, aim to dramatically expand the scope of the search. They involve scanning millions of stars in the Milky Way and other galaxies for signs of intelligent life.\nThe discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence, should it ever occur, would be one of the most profound revelations in human history. It would raise questions about our place in the cosmos, the nature of advanced civilizations, and the implications for our own future.\nIn conclusion, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence is a testament to humanity\'s insatiable curiosity and our desire to connect with other intelligent beings in the universe. While we have not yet received that cosmic ""hello,"" the search continues, driven by the belief that somewhere out there, in the vast expanse of space, another civilization may be asking the same questions and sending signals into the cosmos, hoping for a reply. SETI is a reminder that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is not just a scientific endeavor but a profound human endeavor that touches on our deepest existential questions.\nAstrobiology\'s Ethical Considerations\nAs astrobiology advances, ethical questions arise. How should we handle the discovery of extraterrestrial life? What are our responsibilities when exploring other worlds? Ethical frameworks and guidelines are being developed to address these complex issues.\nIn conclusion, astrobiology stands at the intersection of scientific exploration, curiosity, and the age-old human desire to know if life exists beyond our planet. Recent advancements in this field have brought us closer than ever to answering this profound question. While we may not have definitive answers yet, the journey of astrobiology research continues to captivate our imaginations and drive our quest to understand the cosmos and our place within it.\nTopics : Peer review science editor research publications']"	['<urn:uuid:7c892061-abd4-49bf-bf50-44e11fbe5b3b>', '<urn:uuid:b5ccfbcb-7b26-432e-abc2-8e5287b2b6cd>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	5	100	2997
85	How do contemporary Japanese pet memorial practices differ from standard cremation services, and what specific rituals are involved in honoring deceased pets?	In Japan, pet memorial practices involve scaled-down versions of human funerals, including placement in cardboard coffins and prayers by Buddhist or Shinto priests. Families can choose cremation or purchase a pet grave or shrine shelf, and continue mourning rituals by offering incense at temple altars, replacing flowers, and presenting the pet's favorite foods or toys - sometimes for up to 50 years after death. This contrasts with standard cremation services, which involve reducing the body to skeletal remains through intense heat, with optional viewing or memorial services beforehand, and the possibility of keeping the cremains in an urn or scattering them in designated gardens.

COLLIER\nLove of animals is a universal impulse, a common ground on which all of us may meet. By loving and understanding animals, perhaps we humans shall come to understand each other.\n— DR. LOUIS J. CAMUTI\nAnimal burials have been found throughout the archaeological record dating back to the Neolithic period. The question is, how do we know if those burials are the result of a human–animal bond or if the animals buried are what zooarchaeologists call articulated or associated animal bone groups?\nThere are a great many reasons why animals could be found buried that may have nothing to do with a relationship with a person. For example, animals could be buried after a sacrifice (the animal was killed but was left whole); the animal could have died of natural causes (it may have simply fallen into a pit); it may have been killed but not consumed (young animals could have been buried alive as a means of population control soon after birth); the animal could have been killed and consumed (it would show marks of butchery); it could have been killed or buried alive with a human as grave goods or food offerings (it may have been partially dismembered or butchered or could be whole); the animal could be a foundation offering (when buried under the foundation of a home); it could be a companion offering (buried alongside a human); it could be intended to accompany a human on his or her journey to the afterworld; or finally, the animal could truly be buried because of a special relationship that the human had with that animal when alive. Clearly, though, there are more reasons that an animal might have been buried if it was not a companion than if it was. The reality is that most animals found buried throughout human history were not buried as companions and were not buried in graves; they were buried in pits and were buried for a functional purpose for humans or were simply discarded by humans.\nThere are some good indications of animals being buried as companions, however. If the animals were older, were whole, and were buried either near or with humans, those are good indications that they may have been loved or well regarded by humans. Another good sign is if the animal was buried with his or her own grave goods, such as food to accompany the animal to the afterlife. This chapter, however, will deal with the archaeological and historical evidence of true animal burials and how modern animal funerary practices evolved.\nArchaeologists, historians, and anthropologists have provided us with a great deal of evidence suggesting that humans and other animals have long shared a special bond. In particular, focusing on the burial rituals and other funerary practices dedicated to nonhuman animals has demonstrated that this bond has grown stronger throughout history. One of the earliest depictions that speaks to this bond is the pre-Natufian (23,000–11,500 BCE) and Natufian (13,000–9,800 BCE) archaeological sites throughout the Eastern Mediterranean. Both of these cultures are considered unique in that, even though they were probably hunter-gatherers, they were semisedentary/sedentary and were among the first known to live in villages. These communities existed in an area that is now dry and barren but was once a lush woodland area where people cultivated numerous types of plants, fruits, nuts, and cereals as well as hunted woodland animals. Within these areas, researchers found burial sites that show evidence that the Natufian kept domesticated animals, which indicates a distinctive human–animal relationship. Although some of these animals may have been used for food, fur, and possibly to guard or hunt with, there is an indication that some animals may have been kept solely as companions.\nUyun al-Hammam, a pre-Natufian burial site, consists of several elaborate human burials, some of which contain human remains and personal ornaments such as shell beading, animal teeth, and jewelry like bracelets, necklaces, and earrings. One of these burial sites included a human buried with a fox; evidence shows that this fox was not treated as an object or an adornment but rather as a companion. It was not uncommon for archeologists to find fox burial sites in this region, although most of the foxes displayed fragmented bones or bones that exhibited butcher marks indicating that these animals were used for food or fur. However, this fox may have been buried alongside the human so they could be reunited in the afterlife. Archaeologists believe that the burial of the fox and human may have a similar symbolic importance as that of a human and dog does today. We may never know the true relationship between this human and fox; we can only speculate that there may have been emotional and social ties connecting the two. What we do know is that we see this type of emotional connection throughout history.\nThe ancient Egyptians believed animals possessed a soul like humans in addition to their physical beings. Researchers have found that some pharaohs and other elite members of ancient Egyptian society were buried with their prized animals like horses or companion animals such as dogs and cats. Examples of this were in 1400 BCE when Pharaoh Amenhotep II was buried with his hunting dog, and ten years later his successor Pharaoh Thutmose IV was buried with his favorite cat. Clearly pharaohs thought enough of their companion animals to be buried with them, either because they wanted to continue to have them as companions or for utilitarian purposes in their afterlives.\nNumerous animals like crocodiles, rams, and dogs were seen as representatives of gods in ancient Egypt, but cats were considered semidivine. There were several gods that were associated with cats, with the most famous being Bast (also spelled Bastet) who was the goddess of protection, fertility, sun, moon, and pleasure. Cats were held in high esteem because they killed vermin that would otherwise destroy crops and supplies. Although cats were often used for utilitarian purposes, only pharaohs could own cats, and since they were looked upon as the pharaoh\'s property, harming any cat was considered treason and carried stiff penalties, including death.\nWhen cats died, a cat\'s family entered into a period of mourning that included family members shaving their eyebrows to demonstrate to the public their grief. It was common for the deceased cat to be massaged with the best essential oils during the embalming and mummification process and to be wrapped in fine linen. Cats were often either buried in feline-only tombs or interred in Bubastis, which was the Bast center of worship. Cats were usually buried with milk, rats, or mice so they would have the provisions they needed for the journey into the afterlife.\nLarge numbers of animal cemeteries started to appear after the fall of the New Kingdom around 1075 BCE in Egypt. Once the New Kingdom was succeeded by the Third Intermediate Period, Egypt had no pharaoh to mediate relationships between humans and the gods. This led to a rise in animal mummies, which ordinary citizens used to petition the gods for favors, such as good health, long lives, prosperity, and easing family strife. It has been estimated that thirty-one cemeteries held at least twenty million animal mummies at one time.\nTHE CONTEMPORARY WORLD\nThere is no doubt that throughout the years animals have changed history by fulfilling utilitarian needs for herders, farmers, and hunters. They have served in religious ceremonies as well as defined social structures and provided economic status in cultures across the world. And, as can be seen from this brief look at the funerary practices of the ancient world, they have played an intimate part in the familial lives of humans as well.\nJapan has been ritually mourning animals for thousands of years, although it has only been recently that those practices have been extended to pets. According to scholars of Japanese culture, these rituals and memorials emerged because the Japanese needed to appease the spirits of those animals — bears, whales, and others — whom they killed while hunting. They were later extended to all animals who were used by the Japanese. In recent decades, with the rise of Western concepts of pet keeping and the afterlife, appeasing angry spirits is no longer the motivation behind modern pet-mourning rituals.\nJapan is a primarily Buddhist country in which most people believe that both humans and animals will be reincarnated. Each person tries to live a life of dignity and respect, and when the person dies they hope to be reincarnated as a higher being. This process will repeat until the person reaches nirvana, which is a state of pure happiness. While it is debatable if animals can reach nirvana, what can be agreed upon is that many Japanese believe that it is their responsibility to ensure that their deceased pet, who shares with them the cycle of birth and rebirth, is memorialized properly.\nToday, Japanese companion animals are held in the same regard as family members — and in fact experience very similar death rituals as human family members. An example of such a ritual from the early twentieth century follows:\nWe got a rectangular grave marker. ... On the front, I wrote, ""cat grave."" On the back, I wrote a haiku. ... To the left and right of the grave, we set out two glass vases filled with bush clover flowers. In front we put a teacup of water. ... Every month, on the same day of the month the cat had died, my wife offered a slice of salmon and a bowl of rice topped with dried bonito flakes in front of the grave.\nOnce a pet dies, there are number of ways to honor their life. Some pet owners decide to have their pet cremated or they can elect to purchase a pet grave or shelf in a shrine associated with a temple. Economic limitations may force pet owners to choose a shelf over a grave, but there are other reasons as well, such as the desire to give deceased pets others with whom to play in the spirit world.\nUsually pet funerals are a scaled-down version of human funerals and include the deceased animal being placed in a simple, cardboard coffin, and a Buddhist or Shinto priest reciting a series of prayers for the pet.\nOnce the pet is buried, the family will either purchase a headstone, or if they have rented a shelf, they will have a memorial tablet created. Memorial tablets are similar to tombstones in that they are etched with basic information about the pet but can also contain a favorite quote or endearing statement. Mourning rituals continue after the pet has been laid to rest by offering incense at a temple altar; some family members will offer incense for a period of time after the death while others only offer incense on special holidays and the anniversary of the pet\'s death. Likewise, many family members will visit the pet\'s grave or shelf during special times of the year, including the anniversary of the pet\'s death — sometimes for fifty years after the death, just as for humans. They may show respect by replacing old flowers and in some cases offering the pet\'s favorite foods or toys. It is important for family members to remember and remain respectful of their dearly loved pet, and some even feel that they will be reunited with their companion animals in another life.\nIn America, too, we find a long history of mourning practices for nonhuman animals. Indeed, the human–animal relationship is neatly blended into American history and continues to grow and change as society continues to evolve. During the precolonial period, Native Americans formed complex relationships with a variety of animals like bison, deer, and other woodland creatures. Many hunting tribes showed great respect for animals, and even though they needed to hunt them for food and other uses, they felt that they must be killed in a proper, ritualized manner. Some Native Americans believed that animal deaths are temporary and that the animal would be reincarnated and return to our world as the same species. If the hunter did not kill the animal properly, the animal could return as a ghost and haunt the hunter and possibly infect him with a disease.\nAs European settlers arrived, new animals were introduced to the developing American culture. For example, caged birds like mockingbirds and goldfinches arrived along with cats and new ""companion"" animals. By the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, purpose-bred companion animals including ""lap animals"" were prevalent in all walks of life and were commonly called ""pet."" Our affinity for companion animals continued to flourish, which is evident by the arrival of animals like dogs, cats, and squirrels showing up on greeting cards, children\'s books, and calendars during this period.\nDuring the twentieth century, people sought to better understand their livestock, flocked to roadside circuses and zoos in order to view wildlife, and many companion animals, especially dogs, retired for the night inside their family home. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), founded in 1866, and its many spin-offs were working to eliminate animal cruelty and educate people on the proper treatment of animals.\nIt was also around this time period that America\'s first pet cemetery, Hartsdale Canine Cemetery, was founded in New York. Hartsdale is not only the oldest pet cemetery in the United States but also the largest pet cemetery in the country with over forty thousand animals buried there. ""Officially and ritualistically, burying a family pet is probably a logical extension of the evolving nature of human–animal relationships, especially since that relationship has increased in emotional intensity in the twentieth century.""\nThroughout the years animals slowly moved from farm help to family members who are adored and loved. Pets are so loved that they are now showing up in a loved one\'s obituary, noted with other family members, and some even have their own obituaries. For example, Legacy.com will allow you to write a tribute to your pet and attach pictures and music. These online obituaries are a way to celebrate the life of a pet while allowing family and friends from near and far to read the obituary to share in the grieving process. It is also a way of understanding the death of a pet by enacting the rituals and memorials that were once reserved only for humans.\nThe International Association of Pet Cemeteries and Crematories estimates that there are between two hundred and three hundred cemeteries in the United States to provide aftercare services for beloved pets that have passed away. These services range from picking up the deceased pet from the home or veterinary office to full funeral services including music, prayers, flowers, and repast. Hartsdale offers a small chapel for funerals that is accompanied by a priest, scripture readings, poems (usually relating to the Rainbow Bridge), and prayers.\nExcerpted from Mourning Animals by Margo DeMello.

86	What's the key difference between Gumtree's 'death by thousand cuts' approach to crisis management and the rebuilding strategy recommended by crisis communication theory?	Gumtree's 'death by thousand cuts' approach involves proactively engaging with issues through actions like writing letters and meeting MPs to prevent reputational damage from accumulating, while the rebuilding strategy focuses on repairing relationships after a crisis has occurred by taking responsibility and offering apologies or compensation to affected stakeholders.	"['No one seeks a crisis, but being ready for one is imperative when disaster strikes, a packed audience was informed during the Crisis killers: a reputation management masterclass session at Cision’s CommsCon.\nIn a panel discussion and presentation led by Tom Ritchie, Cision’s VP GTM EMIA, crisis communications experts considered the dangers of letting the media define a crisis, learned why planning is the be all, and why a clever sorry goes a long way.\nFergus Campbell, head of communications at Gumtree, warned that “reputational damage can be achieved by a thousand paper cuts” when a company has “left a vacuum of communications”, leading, in some cases, to reputational collapse.\nHe was joined on stage by KFC’s head of brand engagement, Jenny Packwood and Ed O’Brien, managing director of crisis communications at Teneo Blue Rubicon. The group analysed the ‘death by a thousand cuts crisis’, ‘managing the unthinkable crisis’ and faced up to the ‘demons of the crisis’.\nBe true to your brand voice\nIn early 2018, Jenny Packwood was forced to deal with the unthinkable when 750 KFC restaurants failed to open across the UK because of major failings in a new distribution procedure. Jenny and her team took 321 media requests a day – about half its average number of yearly requests in a week – and faced over one thousand pieces of coverage globally across print, online and broadcast as approximately 19,000 team members were affected.\nThe team decided that only the boldest response would suffice for a crisis that had no quick fix or end in sight. Enter the FCK bucket; KFC’s creative mea culpa to their customers and staff. A print-only campaign – because “print is still the land of the statement” – allowed the company to wrestle back control in an honest and human way.\n“So often when a crisis hits it is easy, and the most comfortable thing, to retract to that safe place. We actively decided not to do that. We know about our brand, and we know what our tone is,” she said.\n“(The campaign) gave us a way of saying sorry in a way that felt true to our brand. And that gave us huge credibility and goodwill among the media and our customers. It worked for us because it is true to our brand and it is true to our tone of voice.”\nThe importance of getting on the front foot\nIn his presentation, Campbell revealed that Gumtree, an 18-year old brand and business, is the largest classified platform in the UK, with one in three adult users. But a failure to support customers through all stages of their transaction on the platform, means the company is seen as great clickbait for the media, as evidenced in the sex for rent controversy.\n“Historically we haven’t engaged in issues,” Campbell said. “What are the things that we have control over? What are the things that we don’t? With engagement – writing letters, meeting MPs – we’ve done a lot of things which we feel allows us to cancel out the death by a thousand cuts.”\nGet to know your demon\nFor Ed O’Brien, a company can only tackle a crisis if it has built up muscle memory in “peacetime”, meaning that when trouble strikes the organisation is ready for whatever may come.\nPart of this process involves understanding personality traits when pressure rises and adrenaline is high. These demons, as O’Brien describes the internal whispers, drive the worst failing in a crisis – bad decision making.\nThe three types of demon the audience were advised to avoid include: The tyrant – the demon who believes only they and their team know what to do or can be trusted. “This tends to be the demon that causes people to filter their comms response through one person. What that does is slow you down. For an international firm, it also means that you lose local perspective,” said O’Brien.\nThe fear-monger demon plays down how bad a crisis is, for fear of getting into trouble. “This drives corporate introspection which allows the outside world to set the agenda.” Meanwhile, the lunatic demon ignores all the planning that you have done, believing that ‘it doesn’t apply to me’. “The reason this is bad is that you are relying on people coming up with a plan and formulating it right at the height of the stress,” he added.\nWhilst recognising the demon in others is important, it is also crucial for individuals to face their own demons. O’Brien advises to do you work in peacetime; planning and stress-testing things in advance of a crisis to ensure panic does not take over:\n“Be really honest with yourself about what your personal demon is, and what affects you in a crisis. Think about that so you know exactly what that demon is when it comes and you know how to deal with it.”\n- By Ronan George\n- Panel (l-r): Tom Ritchie, Ed O’Brien, Jenny Packwood and Fergus Campbell', ""Every business faces crises, and while many are avoidable, it's likely that your business will get swept into one eventually. This is because many crises aren't the fault of the organization. Instead, uncontrollable factors can create unanticipated situations that force your business to respond immediately.\nWhen a crisis does hit, it's easy to panic. However, it's important to remain calm and remember your plan for handling the situation. Often times, it's how an organization handles a crisis, and not the crisis itself, that determines its reputation moving forward.\nCommunication theorist, Timothy Coombs came up with a theory to better understand how an organization should communicate in response to a crisis.\nWhat Is a Crisis?\nAccording to Coombs, a crisis is a negative circumstance involving an organization and its stakeholders, such as employees, customers, and investors. In these situations, the business needs to interpret who was responsible for the crisis and how the issue will affect the stakeholders' relationship with the organization.\nThere are three main types of crises, each based on who was responsible for the crisis and how the crisis affects the organization's reputation. It's important to note that the threat to the organization's reputation is often determined by its history with crises and existing reputation with its stakeholders.\n1. Victim Crisis\nThis type of crisis occurs when the organization is perceived to be a victim of the crisis. For example, a victim crisis can happen when the organization is rumored to be at fault — like when Tylenol was wrongly accused in 1982 of poisoning seven Chicago-based people. Instead, the deaths were actually caused by a killer lacing Tylenol with cyanide in stores. Tylenol nearly took the blame for a crisis that they had no way of preventing.\nA more common example of victim crisis is natural disasters. These events can destroy the physical infrastructure of a company, leaving it with no facility to conduct its business. In cases like these, a victim crisis presents the organization with little to no reputational threat because the situation is unavoidable and the company has no way of preventing it.\n2. Accidental Crisis\nThis occurs when the organization is at fault for the crisis, but its actions were unintentional. An accidental crisis can occur when an organization faces product or equipment failure —like when Samsung had to recall the Galaxy Note 7 in 2016 due to batteries catching on fire and exploding.\nAdditionally, accidental crises can occur when an accuser challenges the organization. One example of this when Starbucks was sued for underfilling their lattes. While this may not seem like a pressing issue on the surface, these crises can still cause significant damage to your brand's reputation. Even if they seem trivial, it's important to address these crises quickly before they have time to escalate.\n3. Preventable Crisis\nThis occurs when the organization intentionally takes a risk that leads to a negative outcome or event. An example of a preventable crisis occurred during the 2010 Haitian earthquake when the American Red Cross raised $500 million, claiming to use the funds help 4.5 billion people “get back on their feet.” However, instead of investing the money into Haitian infrastructure, the organization only built six permanent homes.\nA preventable crisis is the worst possible threat to an organization because there is a high reputational threat to the business. In these situations, there's immense pressure placed on the organization's response as well as their actions moving forward after the crises. While the brand may take measures to resolve the situation, it's extremely difficult to rebuild your reputation after one of these types of events.\nBased on these three crisis types, Coombs was able to create the Situational Crisis Communication Theory.\nSituational Crisis Communication Theory\nThe Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT) identifies response strategies that organizations can use to handle a crisis. It's based on who was responsible for causing the crisis as well as how significant the threat is to the business's reputation.\nSCCT outlines a path for crisis communication, but the business still determines what actions they'll take based on the situation. Not only is SCCT based on the organization's understanding of the crisis, but also on their pre-conceived notion of how stakeholders will respond to each type of response.\nTo plan for stakeholder responses. there are four main crisis response communication strategies.\n1. Rebuilding Strategy\nThis strategy aims to rebuild relationships with stakeholders by redeeming the organization's reputation. This is achieved by taking responsibility for the crisis and offering apologies or compensation to those affected by the outcome.\nRebuild crisis strategies should most frequently be used in response to accident crises, especially when the organization has had a history of similar crises and/or has developed a negative reputation in the past. Rebuilding strategies should also always be considered for preventable crises where stakeholder relationships may be permanently damaged. While it may take more time to rekindle the relationship, these actions will mark the first step towards that recovery.\n2. Diminish Strategy\nThis strategy works to minimize the amount of responsibility placed on the organization. This is achieved by offering excuses for or justifying the company's actions.\nDiminish crisis strategies should most frequently be used in response to victim crises where the company is not at fault for the issue. If used in response to accident crises, diminish crisis strategies should be used when the organization has had no history of crises and has a relatively positive industry reputation. For smaller crises, this strategy can help businesses minimize the negative effects of the situation while still avoiding taking unnecessary fault.\n3. Deny Strategy\nThis strategy completely re-assigns the blame away from the organization. This is achieved by confronting the accuser(s) for their invalid accusations, claiming that there is no crisis, or blaming another party for the crisis.\nDeny crisis strategies should be used in victim crises when the organization is faced with rumors or accusations that harmful, but not true. Rather than rebuilding the relationship, it's best to confront the cause of the crisis immediately to avoid further escalation. It's important to keep in mind that this strategy is only effective if your business is truly at no fault for the situation.\n4. Bolster Strategy\nThis strategy works to position the organization as an asset to its stakeholders. This is achieved by reminding stakeholders of its former good deeds and praising stakeholders for their dedication and loyalty. Bolster crisis strategies can be used in conjunction with other primary crisis strategies, especially when the organization is faced with victim crises.\nWhile each of these strategies is predicted to be effective in the specific crises laid out, it's impossible to know exactly how stakeholders — and the overall public — will react to an organization's chosen response. So, it's important to prepare not only for the public's response to the crisis but also for their response to your follow up actions.\nHow SCCT Helps Your Business\nYou may be thinking, this is all great, but how does SCCT actually help my business in the long run? Can't I just tailor each crisis communication strategy to the specific crisis at the moment?\nThese are great questions. SCCT can save you time and headaches by ensuring a smoother crisis response when and if your business faces a crisis. In addition to a short-term response, below are a few examples of the long-term benefits SCCT can provide for your company.\n1. It helps you practice and prepare for crises in advance.\nHow nervous would you feel if you went into a big, important job interview completely unprepared? You haven't done any research on the organization or practiced interview questions, and you have no idea who's interviewing you. I'm guessing you'd be feeling extremely nervous and not performing at the best of your ability.\nThe same goes for crisis response. You never want to go into a crisis blind without having ever prepped for it. This is why it's important to role play with your team using example case studies. Everyone on your crisis communication team should be on the same page about how to immediately handle negative events that impact your organization.\n2. It makes it less likely that you'll panic when an unexpected crisis arises.\nIt's easy to panic when facing a major crisis, especially if it's one you didn't see coming. Your nerves get the best of you, you're feeling discouraged by slashing comments on social media, and the pressure gets to your head. This is usually a recipe for disaster, resulting in a last-minute, unplanned response that makes matters worse.\nWhen you know that you have crisis strategies laid out by SCCT, you can breathe knowing you don't have to come up with the proper response to your crisis completely from your imagination. Rather, you can reference your existing SCCT strategies to come up with a plan of action for an unexpected crisis.\n3. It helps you categorize each crisis, making it easier to handle.\nSCCT makes you categorize your crisis into one of three types: victim, accident, or preventable. Even if you don't have a specific plan for the situation at hand, this categorization gives you a baseline to work off of. Having that starting point to work from will make you feel like you're taking action to resolve your crisis, rather than waiting and wondering what to do next.\n4. It reminds you to prioritize the public opinion.\nIt's vital that a company doesn't prioritize its own needs when responding to a crisis. Just as in any organizational action, the focus is on the customer's success, not the organization's.\nYou may believe that the best way to respond to a crisis is to immediately deny the accusations and protect your organization's reputation. However, what do your stakeholders want to hear? What's going to make them trust you again? Sometimes, that means putting aside your pride and taking responsibility for your actions, in the hopes that your honesty will regain their loyalty.\nFor more information on crisis management, read about how businesses can be threatened by different types of crisis.\nOriginally published Apr 3, 2019 8:00:00 AM, updated March 19 2019""]"	['<urn:uuid:51e2b6ee-832a-4f5a-ad0b-98ac8ca208d3>', '<urn:uuid:dde64340-1b2a-46ec-abe6-64ddfd9f319e>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	23	49	2520

Therefore, they must be good at communicating and relating and be well versed in behavioral science.\nPsych Nurse Responsibilities\nWhen working as a psych nurse, you may perform the following tasks :\n- Review a patient’s status\n- Provide care based on a prescribed treatment approach\n- Issue medicine and check side effects and responses\n- Teach patients specific coping skills\n- Offer counseling to patients\n- Work with medical team members\n- Prescribe medicines\n- Offer psychotherapy services\n- Assess and diagnose mental health conditions\nPsychiatric Nurse Practitioner Salary Range\nPsychiatric Nurses can be one of the highest paid nurse specialties. The amount they make will depend on several factors – education level, experience, workplace and location.\nThe BLS Bureau of Labor Statistics does not have dedicated salary data for Psychiatric Nurses as a category. These nurses can in fact have different levels of education and training.\nA registered nurse who specializes and works as a psych nurse will earn similar amounts to other RN’s – average salary $73,550. Further educational qualifications and training will lead to significantly higher salaries.\nIf you obtain a degree as an advanced practice nurse in the psychiatric field, you will make more money as a certified nurse practitioner (CNP) or clinical nurse specialists (CNS). Psychiatric Nurse practitioners can expect to earn an average salary of $107,480.\nA pay differential increases what you make as a psych nurse, and it is included in the hourly rate for working evening or night shifts, or for charge duties. Higher salaries are usually offered to nurses that hold BSN or MSN designations. You may also receive a sign-on bonus, depending on the nursing demand in your area. In some venues, you may be able to make overtime pay.\nThe state you work in can also have a significant effect on your wages. If you live in California, Massachusetts, Hawaii, Oregon, or Alaska, you will be paid a higher salary than if you live in other states in the US. Always bear in mind the cost of living differences when comparing earnings in different states.\nHowever, making a big salary should not be your primary reason for accepting a psychiatric nurse practitioners job. You also have to regard benefits, such as tuition assistance, health insurance coverage, and paid time off. Also, traveling psych nurses make more money than nurses who work in a healthcare facility.\nPsychiatric Nurse Practitioner Training\nTo begin your career journey, you must complete a nursing program first. Most beginning nursing programs feature a clinic rotation in the psychiatric section, which permits you to experience working in this area. You can receive further insight by volunteering at a mental health agency that helps patients with psychiatric needs.\nTo become a registered nurse or an RN, you must enroll in either a two-year program in nursing or take part in a three-year hospital-based program. You can also attend a four-year college that issues four-year bachelor degrees in nursing.\nAfter you receive nursing training, you need to sit for an RN licensing exam. This exam is referred to as the National Council Licensure Examination, or NCLEX, for short. Once you have passed the exam, you are ready to apply for nursing jobs.\nTo become a psych nurse, you need to become certified through a credentialing organization, such as the well-known American Nurses Credentialing Center, or the ANCC.\nHow to Obtain Certification\nThe five-year certification requires the following:\n- An RN license, currently active\n- Two years’ experience practicing as a registered nurse (RN)\n- At least 2,000 hours of practice in clinical psych nursing within a three-year timeframe\n- Continuing education of at least 30 hours within three years\nBecoming an Advance Practice Psych Nurse\nIf you want to expand your reach as a psychiatric nurse, you need to learn more about becoming an advanced practice psych nurse. This nursing specialty is also referred to as a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, or PMHNP-BC or a PMHCNS-BC, a psychiatric mental health clinical nurse specialist. It just depends on where you live.\nIf you want to work as an advanced nurse in psychiatry, you need to obtain a master’s or doctoral degree in the nursing field. You can obtain a certificate for the advanced designation through the ANCC.\nIf you choose to proceed to graduate school, make sure the institution is accredited. It should be accredited by the National League for Nursing (NLN) or the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, also known as the AACN.\nTop Grad Programs for Psych Nurses\nUsually, the publication, U.S. News & World Report, is the best source for top grad programs for psychiatric nurses. Popular schools include the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Rush University in Chicago, and Vanderbilt University in Nashville. Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore are two other well-respected schools.\nDepending on the state where you live, the continuing education requirements for psych nurses vary. Therefore, you need to contact your state board and nursing organization on how you should keep your RN certification and license current.\nTaking the Initial Steps\nAs you can see, you can find a good deal of opportunity working in the mental health field as a nurse. You just need to enroll in a nursing program first and receive your RN license. Once you have worked as a nurse and honed your skills, you can specialize in the psychiatric field.\nExpress Your Interest\nEven if you have been working in the field of nursing for awhile, you will find that concentrating on a mental health career in nursing is an entirely satisfying goal. Maybe you currently work in a hospital setting. If so, let your employer know that you’re interested in the mental health field. Taking this step will give you the motivation needed to pursue both your professional and educational goals.\nWork and Learn – Online Training\nOnline programs give nurses the ability to pursue a psych nursing certificate while they are working, as well. You can take advantage of today’s technology and become a better nurse. Incorporate a nursing educational program in your daily schedule so you can be more of value to your employer or advance yourself in your nursing career.\nWorking as a Psychiatric Nurse\nIf you work as a psych nurse, you will find that you need to be able to multitask well in a healthcare setting. You also need to handle stress well. After all, you are helping people with emotional problems. Therefore, you need to maintain a professional demeanor and keep your own emotions in check.\nPsychiatric Nurse Practitioner Work Settings\nYou can choose from various venues when working as a psych nurse. Some of the health care facilities you can choose from include the following:\n- Hospitals, including VA hospital and medical centers\n- Primary care facilities\n- Government facilities, such as prisons or agencies connected to the court system\n- Private physician practices\n- Substance abuse treatment centers\n- Community mental health clinics\nWhere You Can Find Psych Nursing Jobs\nAccording to statistics, psych nurses are needed the most in the western and southern states in the US. The following states, in particular, need to fill psych nursing spots:\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects job growth figures of 16% across all nursing careers through 2024. This will be higher for Psychiatric Nurse practitioners.\nA shortage currently exists of psych nurses in the field. That is because mental health is becoming an increasing concern in the US. According to statistics, about 44 million adults were diagnosed with a mental illness in 2015. This total represents almost 18% of the adults in the country, and excludes people diagnosed with substance abuse problems.\nPsychiatric nursing is a high demand nursing role, and will continue to be of importance over the next five years. Now is the time to direct your career path so you can make a difference, whether you are currently studying to be a nurse or working as a nurse practitioner.\nIf you want to help people with substance abuse issues or mental disorders as a nurse, you will find that your opportunities in this area are excellent. You just need to make a commitment along these lines.\nOnce you know what courses to take and how to incorporate skill training in your schedule, you can look forward to a brighter and more productive tomorrow.\nPsychiatric Nurse Practitioner Resources\nCheck out our other main nursing career guides and of course the nursing salary pages for lots of information.']	['<urn:uuid:f83b695a-e9f7-4e26-8230-c6d1d4d1a0ed>', '<urn:uuid:5b0660fb-c2b8-4a1f-87d4-9b05a8130c0d>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	7	101	2510

Depression is the second most common childhood mental health problem, affecting 1 in 33 children, while ADHD is the number one most common neurobehavioral disorder, affecting up to 10% of children in the United States.	"['Could Your Child Be Depressed?\nBy Jeannette Moninger\nIt\'s more than just the blues: Clinical depression among kids is on the\nrise. Here\'s how to tell if your child is suffering, and how to get\nAt first, Andrea Carpenter* blamed preadolescent hormones for her\n10-year-old daughter\'s moodiness. ""Allie was extremely irritable at home,\nand she\'d get snippy with her dad and me for no apparent reason,"" says the\nMarietta, GA, mom. Life at the Carpenters\' home grew so tense that the family\nstarted seeing a counselor who, after a few sessions, recommended that Allie\nvisit a psychiatrist. ""He mentioned depression, but I thought it was just\npuberty,"" Andrea says. Her thinking quickly changed after Allie said she\nwished she was never alive and talked about cutting her throat. ""I was\ndevastated — I knew she wasn\'t a happy-go-lucky kid, but I never thought a\n10-year-old could be suicidal.""\nIn fact, depression is the second most common childhood mental health problem.\n(Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is number one.) An estimated one in\n33 children and one in eight teens are depressed, and the World Health\nOrganization predicts that the number of kids — and adults — diagnosed with the\ndisorder could double by the year 2020. Fewer than a fourth of the estimated 12\nmillion kids in the United States who suffer from psychiatric disorders receive\ntreatment, however, which places them at high risk for failing school, abusing\ndrugs and alcohol, and committing crimes. Kids with untreated depression also\nare 12 times more likely to commit suicide. The nation\'s suicide rate for\nchildren jumped nearly 10 percent from 2003 to 2004, the largest increase in 14\nEven though up to 80 percent of depressed kids improve with treatment, many\nparents delay seeking help because of the stigma of mental illness. ""I wish\nI would have reacted quicker, but it\'s a hard thing to admit your 7-year-old\nchild is mentally ill,"" says Carmen Vandyne, a Columbus, OH, mom whose\n11-year-old daughter, Addison, was diagnosed with depression at age 7. Other\nparents hope their child will just get over it on their own. But ""depressed\nkids aren\'t just going through phases that they\'ll outgrow — they find it\ndifficult to manage their emotions without professional help,"" says child\npsychiatrist Harold Koplewicz, M.D., founder of the New York University Child\nFiguring out the difference between true depression and temporary moodiness is\ncrucial. Here\'s how to tell if your child has a problem — and what you can do\n*Names have been changed.\nWhat are the warning signs?\nWhile all children feel sad from time to time or have the occasional bad\nday, a child with depression remains in a funk for weeks or months. During this\ntime, she\'s likely to struggle at school, isolate herself from friends, cause\nproblems at home, and act like Allie Carpenter did — angry, moody, and\nirritable. Depressed kids are also as confused by their emotions as their\nparents are; they can\'t describe how they\'re feeling. Instead, they might\ncomplain about stomachaches, develop exaggerated fears, grumble about being\nbored, lack energy, or talk about death.\nThree years ago, Boston resident Robyn Hanley assumed her then 16-year-old\nson, Matthew, was going through typical teenage angst when his grades slipped\nand he started missing school because his stomach hurt. ""I wasn\'t really\nworried until he stopped hanging out with his friends and participating in\nactivities that he loved so much,"" she says. Matthew\'s guidance counselor\nnoticed the changes in him and suggested that the family talk to their doctor.\nAfter Matthew was referred to a psychiatrist and diagnosed with depression,\nRobyn learned that withdrawing from pleasurable activities and family and\nfriends is a key sign that a child is depressed.

89	genetic counseling benefits limitations cancer risk assessment privacy discrimination cost implications	Genetic counseling provides benefits in assessing cancer risk by reviewing personal and family health history to identify risk patterns. However, it has limitations including high costs if not covered by insurance, potential emotional implications like depression or anxiety, and privacy concerns. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) provides protection against employment and health insurance discrimination.	"['Genetic testing helps estimate your chance of developing cancer in your lifetime. It does this by searching for specific changes in your genes, chromosomes, or proteins. These changes are called mutations.\nGenetic tests are available for some types of cancer. These include:\nGenetic testing may help:\nPredict your risk of a particular disease\nFind if you have genes that may pass increased cancer risk to your children\nProvide information to guide your health care\nNo genetic test can say if you will develop cancer for sure. But it can tell you if you have a higher risk than most people.\nOnly some people with a gene mutation will develop cancer. What does this mean? A woman may have a 45% to 65% chance of breast cancer. But she may never develop the disease. Meanwhile, a woman with a 25% chance may develop breast cancer.\nRisk factors for hereditary cancer\nA hereditary cancer is any cancer caused by an inherited gene mutation. An inherited gene means it is passed from parent to child within a family. The following factors suggest a possible increased risk for hereditary cancer:\nFamily history of cancer. Having 3 or more relatives on the same side of the family with the same or related forms of cancer.\nCancer at an early age. Having 2 or more relatives diagnosed with cancer at an early age. This factor may differ depending on the type of cancer.\nMultiple cancers. When one relative develops 2 or more types of cancer.\nRare cancers. Some types of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, adrenocortical cancer, or sarcoma, are linked to inherited genetic mutations.\nReasons to consider genetic testing for cancer\nGenetic testing is a personal decision made for different reasons. It is also a complex decision best made after talking with your family, health care team, and genetic counselor.\nASCO recommends considering genetic testing in the following situations:\nA personal or family history suggests a genetic cause of cancer.\nA test will clearly show a specific genetic change.\nThe results will help with diagnosis or management of a condition. For example, you may take steps to lower your risk. Steps may include surgery, medication, frequent screening, or lifestyle changes.\nASCO also recommends genetic counseling before and after genetic testing. Learn more about these recommendations on genetic testing for cancer susceptibility on a separate ASCO website.\nOther factors to consider\nGenetic testing has limitations and emotional implications. These may include:\nDepression, anxiety, or guilt. A positive test result means a gene mutation exists. This result may bring difficult emotions. Some people may think of themselves as sick, even if they never develop cancer. Negative test results may also cause difficult emotions. For example, some people may experience guilt if they do not have a gene mutation that other family members have.\nFamily tension. People are generally encouraged to tell family members about test results because they can be important for the health of family members. But this information could also complicate family dynamics. Learn more about sharing genetic test results with your family.\nA false sense of security. A negative result means a specific genetic mutation is not present. But people with negative results may still develop cancer. A negative result only means the person’s risk is average. Each person’s risk for cancer is also affected by other factors. For example, lifestyle, environmental exposure, and medical history.\nUnclear results. A gene may have a mutation not linked with cancer risk. This is called a variant of unknown significance. It means that it is unclear whether the mutation will increase risk. Or people may have mutations that current tests cannot find. Many cancers are not yet tied to specific gene mutations. Also, some genes may interact unpredictably with other genes or environmental factors. And these interactions may cause cancer. So it may be impossible to calculate the cancer risk.\nHigh cost. Genetic testing can be expensive. It is particularly expensive if health insurance does not pay for it.\nDiscrimination and privacy concerns. Some people fear genetic discrimination from test results. Others worry about the privacy of their genetic information. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) protects against employment and health insurance discrimination. Discuss related concerns with a genetic counselor or doctor.\nQuestions to ask yourself about genetic testing\nBefore having genetic testing, learn about its risks and limitations. Identify your reasons for wanting a test. And consider how you will cope with test results.\nHere are some questions to help you make a decision:\nDo I have a family history of cancer?\nHave I developed cancer at an earlier-than-average age?\nHow will I interpret the results of genetic testing? Who will help me use this information?\nWill the test results affect my medical care? The medical care of my family?\nIf I have a genetic condition, can I lower my cancer risk?\nA genetic counselor can help you answer these questions. He or she can give you advice and information about the risks and benefits of genetic testing. A genetic counselor also helps people through the genetic testing process. Learn more about what to expect when meeting with a genetic counselor.', ""By Cynthia Weiss\nDEAR MAYO CLINIC: My grandmother and mother, as well as an aunt and a cousin, have had breast cancer. Another cousin was diagnosed with colon cancer recently. It has been suggested that I undergo genetic counseling to determine my cancer risk. As a young man, is genetic testing necessary for me? What benefit would I gain from visiting a genetic counselor?\nANSWER: Although it can be daunting to have a loved one diagnosed with cancer, having a family history does not mean that you will automatically get cancer. This is one of the reasons why having a discussion with a genetic counselor can be valuable.\nA genetic counselor is someone who reviews your personal health history and your family's health history to identify your personal risk for certain conditions. A genetic counselor can try to determine if there is a pattern or connection among family members' diagnoses and how that may affect you.\nFor instance, you mentioned that your grandmother, mom and a cousin have had breast cancer, but it's unclear if all of these women are on the same side of the family. If they are all related — for example they are all on the maternal side of your family — then that suggests more of a pattern that could potentially increase your risk, even as a man. Breast cancer affects men, too, though it occurs more infrequently.\nPeople seem to be most aware of genetic counseling when it comes to breast cancer. This likely is due to the fact that the most common genes associated with increased breast cancer risk — BRCA1 and BRCA2 — have received a lot of media attention over the years. In general, though, only about 5%–10% of breast cancers have a hereditary cause that can be identified. If a hereditary cause for breast cancer is discovered, this condition may increase the risk for other types of cancer, as well.\nOther cancers that may have a hereditary connection include ovarian, colon, prostate, uterine and pancreatic cancers. Concerns for a hereditary cancer syndrome rise if people are diagnosed at younger ages, have a personal history of more than one cancer, or have multiple family members with the same or associated cancers. This information may be useful for you if you decide to have children. You'll be able to determine the likelihood that you might pass along a gene and increase the risk to your offspring for certain cancers.\nMeeting with a genetic counselor doesn't immediately mean that you need genetic testing. Rather, the goal of the appointment is to have a discussion that can guide you toward making an informed decision regarding genetic testing. Discussing the potential risks and limitations of genetic testing are just as important as reviewing potential benefits of testing.\nAnother benefit of meeting with a genetic counselor is to learn more about your family risk for certain conditions, which could be valuable in the future. For instance, understanding your risk for cancer is important, but learning about certain hereditary heart and neurologic conditions, as well as more rare genetic conditions like cystic fibrosis, might help with family planning down the road.\nSometimes reviewing all of this information together allows things to be put in a new context. For some families, it illustrates a clear pattern of increased risk for certain conditions. In other cases, though, it may lower your concern.\nI recall a young woman who came to see me to discuss her significant family history of cancer. But as we began charting her family tree, we realized that only a few relatives had developed skin cancer, and they worked outdoors on a farm or in construction. In reality, her cancer risk was minimal given her lifestyle.\nAlthough it can be challenging to learn about the details of your family's health tree, especially if prior generations didn't share as much or document health concerns, it is important to talk with your family prior to meeting with a genetic counselor if you can.\nFamily history should be gathered for three or four generations on both sides, and include parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and children.\nHelpful information to gather includes:\nA good resource to help you get started is a free online tool called My Family Health Portrait. This tool is available through the surgeon general's office. It allows you to collect the information and create a family pedigree that can be printed and shared with health care professionals and your family.\nAs you discuss your family history, don't forget to talk about conditions that may not have a strictly genetic cause but may have a genetic link. Although there are conditions such as diabetes where a genetic test is not available, it's important to document the patterns in your family and share them with your primary care provider. — Sarah Mantia, Clinical Genomics, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida\nRead more stories about advances in individualized medicine.\nRegister to get weekly updates from the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine blog.\nTags: breast cancer, Cancer, cancer, center for individualized medicine, DNA Testing, gene sequencing, genetic testing, Genetics, genomic medicine, genomic medicine, individualized medicine, Lynch syndrome, Multi-omics, Precision Medicine, predictive genomics""]"	['<urn:uuid:1c356b00-d237-47b5-ad3a-558703f64326>', '<urn:uuid:c23a6a16-ada2-4a57-87a9-a93a998dba16>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T22:37:53.756469	11	55	1716
90	How does IBDV infect cells and what vaccine storage conditions prevent damage?	IBDV contains two RNA segments (A and B) that encode viral proteins, with segment B encoding VP1 polymerase and segment A encoding VP5 and polyprotein pVP2-VP4-VP3. For vaccine storage, the cells and virus particles must be kept frozen in liquid nitrogen to prevent damage and maintain titer, with diluent stored at 68-77°F (20-25°C) or 2-7°C.	['J Gen Virol 75:1803C1806. of DF-1 cells with IBDV reduced Bcl-2 expression, and this reduction could be abolished by inhibition of gga-miR-16-5p expression. Moreover, transfection of DF-1 cells with gga-miR-16-5p mimics enhanced XL-228 IBDV-induced apoptosis associated with increased cytochrome release and caspase-9 and -3 activation, and inhibition of caspase-3 decreased IBDV growth in DF-1 cells. Thus, epigenetic upregulation of gga-miR-16-5p expression by IBDV contamination enhances IBDV-induced apoptosis by targeting the cellular antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, facilitating IBDV replication in host cells. IMPORTANCE Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is an acute, highly contagious, and immunosuppressive disease in young chickens, causing severe economic losses to stakeholders across the globe. Although IBD virus (IBDV)-induced apoptosis in the host has been established, the underlying mechanism is not very clear. Here, we show that contamination of DF-1 cells by IBDV upregulated gga-miR-16-5p expression via demethylation of the pre-miR-16-2 promoter. Overexpression of gga-miR-16-5p enhanced IBDV-induced apoptosis associated with increased cytochrome release and caspase-9 and -3 activation. Importantly, we found that IBDV XL-228 contamination induced expression of gga-miR-16-5p that brought on apoptosis by targeting Bcl-2, favoring IBDV replication, while inhibition of gga-miR-16-5p in IBDV-infected cells restored Bcl-2 expression, slowing down viral growth, indicating that IBDV induces apoptosis by epigenetic upregulation of gga-miR-16-5p expression. These findings uncover a novel mechanism employed by IBDV for its own benefit, which may be used as a potential target for intervening IBDV contamination. belonging to the family, which is composed of nonenveloped viruses containing two segments of double-stranded RNA (segments A and B) (5). Segment B (2.8?kb) encodes VP1, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) linked to the virus genomic segments (6, 7), whereas segment A (3.17?kb), encoding the major components of the virus, contains two partially overlapping open reading frames THBS5 (ORFs) (8). The first ORF encodes a nonstructural protein, VP5 (17?kDa), and the second one encodes the pVP2-VP4-VP3 polyprotein (110?kDa) that can be cleaved by the viral protease VP4 to release pVP2 (54.4?kDa), VP4 (28?kDa), and VP3 (32?kDa) (9, 10). IBDV contamination causes apoptosis in the BF, spleen, and thymus of susceptible chickens, and it was reported that this VP2 and VP5 were the major viral proteins involved in IBDV-induced apoptosis (11,C15); however, other factors might also be involved in IBDV-induced apoptosis because inhibition of VP2- and/or VP5-induced apoptosis by inhibitors or knocking down the target proteins of VP2 and/or VP5 during IBDV contamination could only partially block IBDV-induced apoptosis in host cells (16,C18). Thus, it is very likely that IBDV-induced apoptosis involves multiple factors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs of 20 to 24 nucleotides?(nt) in length that are widespread in eukaryotes (19, 20). Cellular endogenous miRNAs can serve as a type of guiding molecule through base pairing with their target mRNAs, thereby leading to posttranscriptional splicing or translation inhibition by targeting the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA in target genes. It has been reported that miRNA plays critical roles in a wide variety of biological processes (21), such XL-228 as cell growth, differentiation (22), proliferation (23), apoptosis (24), immune response, cancer, etc. (25, 26). Increasing evidence suggests that cellular miRNAs contribute to the repertoire of host-pathogen interactions during viral contamination (27, 28). Alterations in cellular miRNA expression, as a consequence of host-virus interactions, play a key role in the regulation of viral replication during virus contamination (29, 30). In our previous study, we screened IBDV-infected DF-1 XL-228 cells for the potential host miRNA response to IBDV contamination by deep sequencing (31, 32). Among the miRNA candidates, gga-miR-16-5p was found to be upregulated with IBDV contamination. In the present study, we found that contamination of DF-1 cells by IBDV upregulated gga-miR-16-5p expression via demethylation of the pre-miR-16-2 promoter and that gga-miR-16-5p induced apoptosis by directly targeting the cellular antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), favoring IBDV growth in DF-1 cells, while inhibition of gga-miR-16-5p in IBDV-infected cells XL-228 restored Bcl-2 expression, slowing down viral growth. These data suggest that the epigenetic upregulation of gga-miR-16-5p expression by IBDV contamination favors viral replication in host cells via enhancing IBDV-induced apoptosis.

91	How do internet sales scams work internationally and what consumer recourse exists?	Internet sales scams often involve counterfeit cashier's check overpayments where scammers request wire refunds of excess amounts. When dealing with international companies, US laws may not apply, making it difficult to prosecute fraud, identity theft, and illegal schemes. For consumer protection, individuals should first contact company customer service departments for resolution. If unsuccessful, they can escalate to the Better Business Bureau, government regulatory agencies, or ultimately pursue legal action through small claims court or class action lawsuits. However, international fraud cases are particularly challenging to resolve in the global legal environment.	"['Group-IB, one of the global leaders in cybersecurity, has uncovered that Classiscam a sophisticated scam-as-a-service operation has expanded to Singapore in March 2022. Classiscam fraudsters, as its name suggests, target users of one of the leading classified platforms in Singapore. Scammers posing as legitimate buyers approach sellers with the request to purchase goods from their listings and the ultimate aim of stealing payment data. Ever since Classiscam’s appearance in Singapore, Group-IB Digital Risk Protection (DRP) team has detected a total of 18 domains intended to target buyers on the local classified website, however, according to the team, this number is believed to be significantly higher.\nIn line with its mission of fighting against cybercrime, Group-IB immediately shared its findings about Classiscam with the members of the Singapore Police Force’s Alliance of Public-Private Cybercrime Stakeholders (APPACT) and the local classified website in question. The main goal of this research is to raise public awareness about the latest scamming methods and reduce the number of victims.\nWhat is Classiscam?\nClassiscam, initially discovered by Group-IB researchers in 2020, is a fully automated scam-as-a-service affiliate program designed to steal payment and personal data from the users of popular classifieds and marketplaces. The scheme, unveiled by Group-IB experts, relies heavily on Telegram bots and chats to coordinate operations and create phishing and scam pages in seconds. Having originally appeared in Russia, the scheme migrated to Europe, the US and has now infiltrated the Asia Pacific. In the past three years, the Group-IB Digital Risk Protection team successfully blocked close to 5,000 resources that were part of Classiscammers’ infrastructure.\nThe hierarchy of the Classiscam groups operates in a pyramid formation. A team of administrators is on top of the chain and responsible for recruiting new members, automating the creation of scam pages, registering new accounts, and providing assistance when the bank blocks the recipient’s card or the transaction. The administrator’s share is about 20-30 percent of the stolen sum. “Workers“ receive 70-80 percent of the stolen sum for communicating with victims and sending them phishing URLs. All details of deals made by workers (including the sum, payment number, and username) are displayed in a Telegram bot.\nThe group targeting Singapore is just one of many. Since 2019, the Group-IB Digital Risk Protection team has identified and categorized 380 different groups operating under the Classiscam model in Telegram, with 90 active groups at the time of this announcement. Currently, more than 38,000 scammers are registered in these groups, which is seven times more than in 2020. According to Group-IB’s estimates, globally, the damage from the Classiscam operations can be as high as $29,500,000. More details about the scheme are available in the Group-IB report ”Demystifying Classiscam“.\nSingapore now on the Classiscammers’ list\nAs first reported by Singapore media in May, scammers posing as legitimate buyers, approach sellers on a popular classified site with the request to purchase listed goods. After analyzing the scammers’ modus operandi and network infrastructure, Group-IB researchers immediately identified a familiar pattern and realized they were not dealing with one-off scammers, but with a well-coordinated and technologically advanced scammer criminal network.\nUsing its extensive scam intelligence on the Classiscam operation and its patented Graph Network Analysis tool, the Group-IB Digital Risk Protection team revealed that the scammers designed a phishing tool that generates fake websites that mimic the official platform of a local classified website used for selling and buying goods. These fake links are generated using web panels or Telegram bots.\nFake page generator used by scammers. The screenshot above is translated from Russian to English. The original page is designed for Russian-speaking scammers.\nAfter initial contact with the legitimate seller, the scammers generate a unique phishing link that confuses the sellers by displaying the information about the seller’s offer and imitating the official classified’s website and URL. Scammers claim that payment has been made and lure the victim into either making a payment for delivery or collecting the payment.\nPhishing page designed to scam the sellers\nAfter clicking “Receive funds”, the seller, the victim, in this case, would be redirected to a phishing page where their payment card credentials are retrieved.\nPhishing page mimicking a local classified website that requests victim’s payment details\nAfter the scammers receive credit card details from the victim, they request OTP verification from the bank. This again is a fake OTP page. Once the victim submits the OTP code on the fake website, the scammers can transfer money to their accounts.\nPhishing page mimicking a local classified website that requests OTP\nAdditionally, the scammers attempt to check the victim’s bank account balance, to identify the most “valuable” cards as shown on the phishing page below.\nPhishing page mimicking local classified website designed to check the account balance\nNo one can hide from the Graph\nUsing its patented Graph Network Analysis tool, Group-IB experts were able to reveal the group of interconnected websites operated by this group of Classiscammers.\nThe network infrastructure of Classiscam operators targeting Singapore. Source: Group-IB Graph Network Analysis tool\nThe whole group’s network included more than 200 domains, 18 of which were created to deceive the users of a Singaporean classified website, including 2 active as of July 19th, 2022. The latest domain intended to target Singaporeans was created in the second week of July.\nThey do not live long by design. To complicate the detection and takedown, the home page of the rogue domains always redirects to the official website of a local classified platform. Content on the fraudulent domains is available only by direct links, which are the subsections of these websites.\nHead of Digital Risk Protection team at Group-IB’s Global HQ in Singapore\nOther websites in the network impersonate Singaporean moving companies, European, Asian, and Middle Eastern classified websites, banks, marketplaces, food and crypto brands, and delivery companies, which proves Classiscam’s global operations.\nAs it sounds, Classiscam is far more complex to tackle than the conventional types of scams. Unlike the conventional scams, Classiscam is fully automated and could be widely distributed. Scammers could create an inexhaustible list of links on the fly. In the past three years, we have successfully blocked close to 5,000 resources that were part of Classiscam infrastructure. It was only possible because we were able to identify and eliminate adversary infrastructures which produce resources to support Classiscams with the help of AI-driven digital risk protection, enriched with data on adversary infrastructure, techniques, tactics, and new fraud schemes.\nHead of Digital Risk Protection team at Group-IB’s Global HQ in Singapore\nBrands that scammers impersonate are strongly encouraged to keep themselves updated with new scamming techniques and schemes. With a specialized Digital Risk Detection system, they can actively monitor and identify phishing domains and fake advertisements.\nFraudsters targeting classifieds and marketplaces can be identified and ultimately stopped using advanced fraud protection mechanisms. For instance, Classiscammers use anonymization tools, such as antidetection browsers to create a unique fingerprint to spoof conventional anti-fraud systems. Group-IB Fraud Protection recognizes the use of such techniques. By correlating this data with other indicators, such as emails and phone numbers that could have been involved in historic fraudulent operations, the number of chat requests it generates per hour, its device parameters, etc., Fraud Protection can identify advanced social engineering schemes.\nTo avoid falling prey, steps can be taken to tackle the increase in online scamming. Users should always check the domain of the URL to verify if it’s the official website before sharing any personal and payment details. Another recommendation is when communicating with the other party for sale of goods or services, to engage with online chat designed by official websites. Finally, like with conventional scams, individuals should be wary of too-good-to-be-true offers.', 'Presentation on theme: ""CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUES""— Presentation transcript:\n1CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUES Sales and Consumer Issues Objective Interpret sales contracts and warranties within the rights and law of consumersCONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUES\n2Consumer Protection Laws Purpose:To assist consumers in judging the quality of a product and its advantages or disadvantages, andTo create an equal field with the sellers in an affluent and technology oriented marketplace.\n3Why have consumer protection laws?

Simply make the pad Thai sauce ahead of time and you’ll have dinner ready in less than 30 minutes!\nWhat is chicken pad Thai\nChicken pad Thai is a classic Thai dish made of stir-fried rice noodles and chicken, tossed in a blend of tamarind, fish sauce, and palm sugar. Often garnished with lime and bean sprouts, this dish offers a balance of sweet, sour, and salty.\nAuthentic chicken pad Thai\nHonestly, it’s surprisingly hard to find a truly authentic version, even in some Thai restaurants. What you often get is far from the sweet, tangy, and savory stir-fried noodles that define this classic.\nThis classic Thai street food is a staple all around the globe, and with it, lots of weird variations exist.\nLet’s be real: ketchup and peanut butter in pad Thai? That’s a culinary no-no! Ketchup has no business with authentic Thai chicken noodles.\nSome Westernized recipes rely on just vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar. And yes, they’re simple, but they miss the mark on the genuine, authentic flavors.\nAn authentic chicken pad Thai recipe:\n- Has tender noodles with a bite: The noodles are cooked to perfection – tender, yet with a bite – somewhere between soft and al dente.\n- Is love at first bite: That traditional blend of fish sauce, tamarind, crisp bean sprouts, and perfectly cooked noodles? It’s what dreams are made of.\n- Is balanced: The best pad Thai sauce nails a perfect balance of sweet, salty, and sour, without one flavor overpowering the other.\n- Feels light: A portion of these chicken noodles should fill you up perfectly – satisfied without feeling stuffed.\nAuthentic pad Thai recipe substitutions\nThai food is all about variety. Every region in Thailand, and even each home, has its own special take on flavors and ingredients. You can easily tweak this recipe and make it right just for you:\nVegetables: Feel free to toss in your favorite stir-fry vegetables, it’s not traditional, but you can make this recipe yours. Try bell peppers, carrots, broccoli, snap peas, mushrooms, etc.\nProteins: Not a fan of chicken? No problem! Switch it up with pork, tofu-only, shrimp, or your favorite seafood. Simply adjust the cooking time accordingly. For a version with beef, try my beef pad Thai recipe.\nNoodles: No need to stick to the traditional rice noodles. Mix it up with sen yai noodles or glass noodles.\nFor the exact measurements, please scroll down to the recipe card at the end of this post.\n- Pad Thai sauce – The perfect blend of sweet, sour, and salty. Made with palm sugar, tamarind paste, fish sauce, and water.\n- Flat dry rice noodles – The noodles should be tender with a slight chew. Dried rice noodles can be found at any Asian grocery stores and different brands are readily available.\n- Dried shrimp – A traditional Thai ingredient, dried shrimp adds a depth of umami and seafood flavor.\n- Firm tofu – Firm tofu provides a nice tender bite and a unique, subtle flavor. Perfect for vegetarians.\n- Chicken – Cut your chicken into thin slices for quick cooking and tenderness. The thinly sliced chicken can easily absorb the pad Thai sauce and blends with the noodles. Use chicken fillets or boneless skinless chicken thighs.\n- Sweet preserved radish – Sweet preserved radish adds a subtle tangy-sweet note and crunch to the stir-fried rice noodles.\n- Bean sprouts – Bean sprouts, a staple in authentic pad Thai, bring a refreshing crunch and fresh flavors. I like to garnish with fresh bean sprouts just before serving.\n- Garlic chives – Garlic chives can be substituted with leek or green onions.\n- Shallots – Shallots add a natural sweetness and light onion-like taste without overpowering the other flavors\n- Garlic – The fragrant base of many Thai stir-fry dishes, adding a pungent flavor and lots of aroma.\n- Egg – Eggs bring a creamy texture and rich flavor that perfectly complements the noodles.\n- Oil – Use a neutral oil with high smoke point, like canola oil or vegetable oil.\n- Roasted peanuts – The finishing touch to a great tasting pad Thai are crushed peanuts. Roasting peanuts prior to crushing them will make them even tastier.\n- Thai chili flakes – I love eating spicy Thai food, and spicy pad Thai is no exception. With red pepper flakes, you can easily make your noodles spicy.\n- Lime – Serve with a lime wedge on the side for adding a tangy note.\nStep 1: Soak flat rice noodles in water until they are soft but still have a little bit of resistance. Read your package instructions for soaking time.\nStep 2: Cook your chicken with 1 tablespoon of oil until it’s done.

Then, add garlic, dried mini shrimp, and preserved radish, continue to cook for another minute.\nStep 5: Move everything to one side of your pan, add the pre-soaked noodles and water in the other half. Then, stir-fry the noodles with water until they’re softened. At this point, mix the whole thing together.\nStep 6: Stir in your homemade pad Thai sauce and cook for about a minute, until the noodles are coated with sauce and everything is well mixed.\nStep 7: Add your cooked chicken and mix well with the noodles.\nStep 8: Move everything to one side of your pan, crack an egg into the other half.

93	electric current flow direction charge carriers	In a typical metal conductor like copper wire, electrons flow from negative to positive, but the actual charge moves in the opposite direction. However, in some materials like semiconductors with electron holes, both the charge and charge carriers move in the same direction. In electrolyte solutions, charges move in two directions as negative ions travel one way and positive ions travel the opposite way. This is also demonstrated in electrochemical cells like the Daniell cell, where electrons flow from the zinc electrode through the wire to the copper electrode, while in the internal circuit, cations migrate to the cathode and anions migrate to the anode through the salt bridge.	['Chapter 26. Electricity from chemical reactions. An electrochemical cell A device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy.

94	digital process replica benefits security concerns	Process simulation software provides key benefits like viewing entire facilities remotely and enabling collaboration through digital representations that can be easily shared. However, this digital connectivity also raises cybersecurity concerns, as networked systems are vulnerable to unauthorized access, data theft, and malware introduction, particularly through cloud-based software and BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) practices.	"['Process Simulation Software\nRecent scientific developments have affected our world in many new and positive ways: a rising standard of living, critical medical advances, and fundamental insights into the functioning of the natural world. As our knowledge has expanded, so has the need to find ways to track and represent this information. For dynamic and multivariate systems, digital computing has proven to be a powerful tool. Software process simulations can calculate astonishingly complicated chains of effects, giving researchers and engineers a comparatively cheap way to explore different scenarios without having to risk physical assets or resources to do so.\nA wide variety of processes can be replicated in a digital environment; basic chemical production, biological energy flows, weather systems, even complex industrial processes can be reproduced in process simulation software. This is specialized software that allows real world processes to be simulated on the computer\nIn the early days of process simulation, each piece of software would be built from scratch. A stack of punch cards, laboriously programmed with typewriters modified to punch holes in cards, would be fed into a machine, and any mistakes in the coding could mean days of lost work. Nowadays, process simulation software is quick, digital, and general purpose: it needs only to be provided with the conditions of the process being simulated in order to function. Many distributions include an easy-to-use software wizard which prompts the user for the information the simulation needs in order to create the digital model. For example, the first thing the software may ask for when setting up a new process simulation is for the user to select a list of chemicals that are used in the process.\nContemporary process simulator software distributions include a visual representation of the process being simulated. Serving as a living schematic of the industrial process, pieces and components of the process are added by the user. These bits of information may be as generalized as an abstracted energy stream, or as specific as a manufacturer’s model-number.\nOnce the process simulation has been built, it will need to be tested against real-world data to confirm that it is functioning correctly. Process simulation software provides the user the opportunity to add parameters to adjust for differences between theoretical and actual yields.\nProcess simulation software can provide a number of benefits to users in industrial settings. One of the key benefits: the process simulation software acts as a visual aid for users who otherwise may not be able to view an entire plant or facility. For example, the Baytown Refinery in Texas, the tenth largest oil refinery in the world, covers 3,400 acres. There is no practical way to view the entire operation of this facility in person, and a digital abstraction can help provide an intuitive sense of the process.\nIncreased collaboration is another benefit of the process simulation software because this digital representation can be easily shared across an organization. Sending a file, or even collaborating in real-time with a cloud-synced process simulation, means personnel can perform useful work remotely. A production optimization specialist doesn’t need to be on site in order to make recommendations; they can simply demonstrate the changes in the process simulation software.\nBecause the functioning of the asset can be analyzed without making physical changes to the asset, process simulation software is invaluable for refinery optimization, value chain optimization and production optimization. Companies looking to maximize their margins, reduce asset failure, or increase environmental compliance can test process adjustments directly in the process simulation software, exploring a variety of options until they find the parameters that best fit their goals.\nA company or organization that uses process simulation software can link this simulation into a live data stream from sensors on the assets being simulated. This simplifies the process of keeping the simulation up to date, as information about the actual functioning of the process is supplied in real-time.\nThe simulation doesn’t need to be a mere receiver of information; process simulation software may include integration with system controls, meaning changes made in the simulation can be directly applied to the process.\nBeyond merely enabling a demonstration of the process as it exists, process simulation software can help companies make process improvements or find entirely new paths of production by making it easier and more affordable to test process variables.\nHow is process simulation software different from process simulator software?\nThese terms are synonymous. Technically, a simulation runs within a simulator, but since all process simulation software packages include the ability to both create a process simulation and to run a process simulation, the distinction is irrelevant.\nWhat kind of processes can be simulated in process simulation software?\nMany different kinds of processes can be modeled. Chemical engineers can simulate industrial production of chemicals; biologists can design bioreactors for biological molecules; oil refineries can perform refinery modeling. The list of process simulations that can be performed in process simulation software is growing by the day.\nHow is process simulation software related to digital twin technology?\nDigital twin technology uses live data from an asset’s sensors to update a live model of an asset in digital twin software, while process simulation software does not necessarily track the actual asset in real-time. In addition, digital twin technology seeks to represent the physical aspects of the asset in software; process simulation software simply replicates the external function of the asset.\nThe Digital Twin and the Smart Enterprise', 'This paper is an exploration of what could be a subset of data integrity, with added dimensions -cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is a growing concern for all, whether you work in the legal, financial or consumer industries. It could affect you personally.\nCybersecurity is a recent concern for the medical products industries, a result of their increased reliance on networked electronic software, records and signatures. Initially there were regulations such as 21 CFR Part 11 in the U.S. and Annex 11 in Europe. But more must be done to ensure the integrity of CGMP documents / records. Cybersecurity is an issue that will only increase over time, as records become more electronic, and communications are more networked or accessible.\nAs a result, the US FDA has issued the following Guidances for Industry:\n- “Cybersecurity for Networked Medical Devices Containing Off-the-Shelf (OTS) Software Document”, issued on: January 14, 2005; and\n- “Content of Premarket Submissions for Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices”, issued on: October 2, 2014; and\n- “Postmarket Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices” -- Draft Guidance, issued on: January 22, 2016\nAs the titles above indicate, the focus is on medical devices. But the principles can and should be applied to a company’s computerized systems as well. In this article, we will also focus on devices, but will also draw attention to company computerized systems where appropriate, to flag related potential problems with an e-records based QMS, computer-facilitated production and/or test / lab equipment / systems.\nOf necessity, cybersecurity in the medical products industries is coming under increased regulatory review. Regulatory agencies leave the ""how"" of cybersecurity compliance up to the manufacturer, as long as the principles in the guidances are met in the resulting product and/or system. Related issues are primarily addressed by the CGMPs, specifically design control (21 CFR 820.30) for devices, and post-production by the CAPA system, among others.\nCybersecurity – Why?\nFDA and news media have emphasized the prevalence of cybersecurity issues, such as data / identity theft, and hacking which pose hazards to many activities and businesses / industries. Our, and the FDA’s and EU’s concern, is with medical products’ users.\nFurther adding to the problem is the industrial growth of BYOD – “Bring Your Own Device” (laptop, tablet, smart phone, or similar “smart” device) – in the workplace. This growing trend poses a problem to cybersecurity, including unintentional and intentional malware introduction.\nThe increasing use of cloud (Internet)-based software to accomplish CGMP tasks, store / retrieve data (data warehousing) and similar uses poses another two-fold concern. In many cases, the updates, upgrades, new revisions / releases, service packs, and similar are automatically uploaded to a company’s systems, which can pose:\n- Security risks, with the potential for introduction of compromised code, retrieval of confidential data, data integrity issues (discussed in our previous article), and similar; and\n- Render previous computer systems’ verification and validations worthless (no change control / “line drawn in the sand”).\nSuch issues are troubling because ensuring data integrity / cybersecurity is an important component of industry’s responsibility to ensure the safety, efficacy, and quality of medical products, the records documenting their manufacture and use, and consequently, of FDA’s ability to protect the public health.\nA growing number of medical devices are designed to be connected to computer networks, or facilitate the use of removable storage, such as flash or thumb drives. Such “networked” medical devices incorporate use software (off-the-shelf or custom) that is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, such as viruses and worms, phishing, and similar unauthorized or unknown intrusions.\nSuch vulnerabilities pose a risk to the safe and effective operation of such medical devices. This mandates an ongoing maintenance effort throughout the product life cycle to assure an adequate degree of protection. FDA issued their Cybersecurity Guidance to clarify how existing regulations, including the Quality System (QS) Regulation, 21 CFR 820 (medical device CGMPs), 21 CFR Part 11, Electronic Records / Electronic Signatures, apply to such cybersecurity maintenance activities. It discusses the basic principles the FDA expects of companies producing products containing networked software / firmware. Though geared to medical devices, the principles apply to all regulated industries with networked and/or portable memory accessible software / firmware (e.g., flash / thumb drives, BYOD access) computerized systems – records maintenance, production and test equipment and similar.\nHowever, the Cybersecurity Guidance specifically targets devices that incorporate off-the-shelf (OTS) software. Therefore, it primarily applies to device manufacturers who incorporate OTS software in their medical devices. The QS Regulation, 21 CFR Part 820, applies to software maintenance actions. This is in addition to the other guidance documents the Agency has issued in the past on software. Companies using SOUP (software of unknown pedigree) in their products (or systems) should also be aware of and address similar concerns.\nThe FDA recommends that medical device manufacturers consider the “NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity” framework core functions to guide their cybersecurity activities:\n- Respond; and\nIdentify and Protect\nMedical devices capable of connecting (wirelessly or hard-wired) to another device, to the Internet or other network, or to portable media (e.g. USB or CD) are more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats than devices that are not connected. However, never assume invulnerability, verify to challenge vulnerability, and document such verification.\nThe extent to which security controls are needed will depend on the following:\n- The device’s / systems intended use;\n- The presence and intent of its electronic data interfaces;\n- Its intended environment of use;\n- The type of cybersecurity vulnerabilities present;\n- The likelihood the vulnerability will be exploited (either intentionally or unintentionally); and\n- The probable risk of patient harm due to a cybersecurity breach.\nManufacturers should also carefully consider the balance between cybersecurity safeguards and the usability of the device in its intended environment of use. See also the newly revised standard IEC 62366-1 (2015) and -2 (2016), Usability Engineering, for such a process.\nEnsure Trusted Content\nRestrict software or firmware updates to authenticated code. One authentication method manufacturers may consider is code signature verification. Use systematic procedures for authorized users to download version-identifiable software and firmware from the manufacturer. Ensure capability of secure data transfer to and from the device, and when appropriate, use methods for encryption.\nDetect, Respond, Recover\nImplement features that allow for security compromises to be detected, recognized, logged, timed, and acted upon during normal use. Develop and provide information to the end user concerning appropriate actions to take upon detection of a cybersecurity event. Implement device features that protect critical functionality, even when the device’s cybersecurity has been compromised. Provide methods for retention and recovery of device configuration by an authenticated privileged user.\nVulnerabilities and Risk\nFDA states that a cybersecurity vulnerability exists whenever the software provides the opportunity for unauthorized access to the network or the medical device. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities open the door to unwanted software changes that may have an effect on the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. Failure to properly address these vulnerabilities could result in an adverse effect on public health. A major concern with OTS software is the need for timely software patches to correct newly discovered vulnerabilities in the software.\nThe FDA recommends that the manufacturer conduct a vulnerability analysis, both initially (premarket) and ongoing (post-market). The approach should appropriately address the following elements:\n- Identification of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities;\n- Assessment of the impact of threats and vulnerabilities on device functionality and end users / patients;\n- Assessment of the likelihood of a threat and of a vulnerability being exploited;\n- Determination of risk levels and suitable mitigation strategies; and\n- Assessment of residual risk and risk acceptance criteria.\nAs mentioned above, and especially software / firmware, initial design and subsequent continuous improvement activities must consider hazards / risk, per ISO 14971. Such risk is focused on the end user – patient and/or clinician. The hazard analysis should address both “normal"" as well as “fault” risks, i.e., not just failure mode risk, the most prevalent approach, but also risk posed by the proper function of the product. In such an analysis, the manufacturer must also consider cybersecurity as part of this regular hazard analysis. Exposure to the web, as in the networked devices focused on in this guidance, increases such cybersecurity risks to the patient / clinician. Hazard / risk analysis’ goal is risk mitigation, documented in the Risk Management File and Report (ISO 14971), as well as in the Design History File (21 CFR 820.30). Consider system boundaries and connections to the external environment. In all such analysis, software must be considered with its associated hardware.\nThe above is to be supplemented by on-going monitoring of actual and potential vulnerabilities, consistent with the Quality System Regulation (21 CFR part 820), including complaint handling, internal quality audits, CAPA (corrective and preventive action), software validation and risk analysis, and servicing. Such programs should emphasize addressing vulnerabilities which may permit the unauthorized access, modification, misuse or denial of use, or the unauthorized use of information that is stored, accessed, or transferred from a medical device to an external recipient, and may impact patient safety.\nThe Agency defines critical components of such a program to include:\n- Monitoring cybersecurity information sources for identification and detection of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risk;\n- Understanding, assessing and detecting presence and impact of a vulnerability;\n- Establishing and communicating processes for vulnerability intake and handling;\n- Clearly defining essential clinical performance to develop mitigations that protect, respond and recover from the cybersecurity risk;\n- Adopting a coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy and practice; and\n- Deploying mitigations that address cybersecurity risk early and prior to exploitation.\nPostmarket cybersecurity information may originate from an array of sources including a company’s own CAPA / warranty / complaint system, independent security researchers, in-house testing, suppliers of software or hardware technology, health care facilities, and information sharing and analysis organizations. To manage postmarket cybersecurity risks for medical devices, a company should have a structured and systematic approach to risk management and quality management systems consistent with the CGMPs.\nPer the guidance, it is the device manufacturer who incorporates software in their medical device, that bears the primary responsibility for the continued safe and effective performance of the medical device / system, including the performance of the software that is part of the device / system. This is instead of the user or a contract programmer / software developer. FDA recommends that purchasers and users of medical devices who may be subject to a cybersecurity vulnerability contact the manufacturer with their concerns. Even when there are times when it is appropriate for the user to become involved, the user should not attempt to make changes without seeking the manufacturer’s advice and recommendations.\nSoftware patches that address cybersecurity vulnerabilities are addressed in general in the CGMPs. For example, the need to be vigilant and responsive to cybersecurity vulnerabilities is part of a company’s obligation under CAPA. The preamble to the QS Regulation explains that actions taken should “be appropriate to the magnitude of the problem and commensurate with the risks encountered”, i.e., “risk-based.” Design validation requires that devices conform to defined user needs and functional requirements, including an obligation to perform software validation and hazard / risk analysis, where appropriate.\nSoftware changes to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities are design changes, and thus must be verified / validated before approval and issuance. However, FDA premarket review is not usually required prior to implementation of a software patch to address a purely cybersecurity vulnerability for a previously cleared / approved device.\nIn general, FDA review is necessary when a change or modification could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the medical device (see also FDA Memorandum K 97-1, and their two recent draft guidances on changes to a device having a 510(k), one specifically addressing software). This is to allow an FDA review of any issue that affects a risk to health posed by the device, and should be the key determinant in making such a decision on the need for an new regulatory review.\nThus, it is possible, but unlikely, that a software patch will need a new 510(k) submission. And the more robust the V&V of the patch / change, the less likely the requirement for a new submission would be. As with all changes made to devices, a company must document the basis of its decisions in the Design History File (DHF) and/or related CGMP documentation.\nHowever, for medical devices approved under Premarket Approval Application (PMA) (21 CFR Part 814), a PMA supplement is required for a software patch, if the patch:\n- Results in a change to the approved indications for use; or\n- Is deemed by the manufacturer to have an adverse effect on the safety and effectiveness of the approved medical device.\nNote: The two points above are also “red flags” for changes to devices covered by a 510(k) that would probably also require a new 510(k).\nOtherwise, the company should report its decision to apply a software patch to its PMA device to the FDA in its annual reports.\nIn all cases, validation of software changes made to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities is required. All software design changes must be verified / regression tested / validated, including those computer software changes to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This would be in accordance with an established protocol, before approval and issuance. However, for most software changes intended to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities, analysis, inspection, and testing – documented -- should be adequate and clinical validation should not be necessary.\nThe manufacturer should always maintain formal business relationships with their OTS software vendors to ensure timely receipt of information concerning quality problems and recommended corrective and preventive actions – perhaps by means of the contract or a Quality Agreement. Because of the frequency of cybersecurity patches, the FDA’s Guidance recommends that the company develop a single cybersecurity maintenance plan to address compliance with the QS Regulation and the issues discussed in the guidance document.\nAlthough the guidance recommends that the medical device manufacturer to perform these software maintenance activities, there may be situations in which it is appropriate for the user facility, OTS vendor, or a third party to be involved. The software maintenance plan should provide a mechanism for the manufacturer to exercise overall responsibility while delegating specific tasks to such other parties. The vast majority of healthcare organizations will lack detailed design information and technical resources to assume primary maintenance responsibility for medical device software and will have to rely on the manufacturer to assume the primary maintenance responsibility.\nLifecycle considerations require that the expected growing knowledge of the science of the product and its manufacturing process / equipment translate into manufacturing improvements, and reduction in variation, consistency / homogeneity within lots, and consistency / homogeneity between lots, improved product quality, all reflected in subsequent V&V activities. See FDA’s Guidance on Process Validation.\nThe training of personnel in detecting data integrity issues is also required as part of a routine CGMP training program. Training personnel to detect data integrity issues is viewed as consistent with the personnel requirements discussed in the CGMPs.\nAs stated at the outset, Cybersecurity is a relatively new term for the CGMP community.

95	Being an occupational health specialist, what's worse: metal fume fever or asbestosis?	Asbestosis is more severe as it is an incurable, progressive lung disease that causes permanent scarring and can be fatal. Metal fume fever, while serious, is a temporary condition causing breathing problems, cough, fever, muscle aches and general malaise that develops 4-6 hours after exposure to metal vapors.	"['Who is at risk for work-related lung disease?\nYou may be at risk for work-related lung disease if the air you breathe at work contains an excessive amount of dust, fumes, smoke, gases, vapors or mists. Workers who smoke are at a much greater risk of lung disease if they are exposed to substances in the workplace that can cause lung disease. Poor ventilation, closed-in working areas and heat increase the risk of disease. Outside air pollution also can increase the risk of lung disease in people who work in jobs that expose them to substances that can cause lung disease.\nWhat substances in the workplace can cause lung disease?\nMany substances found in the workplace can cause breathing problems or lung damage. Some of them include the following:\n- Dust from such things as wood, cotton, coal, asbestos, silica and talc. Dust from cereal grains, coffee, pesticides, drug or enzyme powders, metals and fiberglass can also hurt your lungs.\n- Fumes from metals that are heated and cooled quickly. This process results in fine, solid particles being carried in the air. Examples of jobs that involve exposure to fumes from metals and other substances that are heated and cooled quickly include welding, smelting, furnace work, pottery making, plastics manufacture and rubber operations.\n- Smoke from burning organic materials. Smoke can contain a variety of particles, gases and vapors, depending on what substance is being burned. Firefighters are at an increased risk.\n- Gases such as formaldehyde, ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide, ozone and nitrogen oxides. These are associated with jobs where chemical reactions occur and in jobs with high heat operations, such as welding, brazing, smelting, oven drying and furnace work.\n- Vapors, which are a form of gas given off by all liquids. Vapors, such as those given off by solvents, usually irritate the nose and throat first, before they affect the lungs.\n- Mists or sprays from paints, lacquers (such as varnish), hair spray, pesticides, cleaning products, acids, oils and solvents (such as turpentine).\nWhat kinds of breathing problems can occur following exposure to such substances?\nSome substances can cause you to have upper respiratory irritation or irritation of your nose and/or throat with cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose and scratchy throat.\nViral infections and allergies produce similar symptoms. You should become suspicious of a work-related illness if your nose and throat are often irritated and breathing problems seem to occur when you are at work. Breathing in substances at work can also increase your risk of developing bronchitis, flu-like symptoms, asthma or emphysema.\nA person who has bronchitis has a persistent cough that produces mucus or sputum and lasts at least 3 months to a year. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of bronchitis, but workplace toxins can also play a role.\nIf you notice that you often have what seems to be the flu, your illness may be caused by something you are exposed to at work. The following are some work-related lung diseases that can make you feel as though you have the flu:\n- Allergic alveolitis (also known as ""farmer\'s lung"") can occur after excessive exposure to moldy hay.\n- Metal fume fever occurs from inhalation of metal vapors, such as in welding and other metallic operations.\n- Polymer fume fever can occur after breathing the fumes of polymers, such as Teflon.\nA worker who has one of these conditions develops breathing problems, cough, fever, muscle aches and general malaise (a feeling of being tired and having no energy) 4 to 6 hours after exposure to the substance. If such symptoms occur again and again when you are at work, this is a clue that your illness may be related to your work.\nIf you develop asthma for the first time as an adult, the illness could be related to something you are exposed to at work. Asthma symptoms include wheezing, chest tightness, a persistent dry cough or trouble breathing.\nEmphysema usually occurs in older people who smoke. However, people who have worked with coal, asbestos or silica dust for 20 years or more can also develop emphysema. They may have a cough, fatigue, chest tightness and difficulty breathing.\nWhat should I do if I think something in the air at work is making me sick?\nVisit your doctor if you think the air at work is making you sick. Your doctor will probably ask you to provide some of the following information:\n- When your symptoms first appeared\n- How often you have symptoms\n- The time of day that the symptoms are worse\n- Whether you feel better on some days\n- How you think your symptoms relate to work\n- What types of materials you come in contact with at work\nYou may find it helpful to keep a written record of these things to share with your doctor. Be sure to make a note of your shift or work hours, the days of the week you work and the days of the week you are off work. Try to recall previous jobs, hobbies and smoking habits -- anything that might have affected your lungs. If your doctor has sent you an occupational health history form, fill it out as completely as possible.\nYour doctor may find it helpful to know all of the ingredients listed on the containers of materials you use in the workplace. Make a list of these ingredients and write down any precautions and first-aid measures that are printed on the label.\nAsk your employer for copies of the material safety data sheets (MSDSs) at your workplace. These are information sheets about the products that you use in the workplace. All employers are required by law to complete these forms, and you have a right to see them. Bring them with you to your doctor\'s appointment.\nHow can I keep from having my lungs damaged by something I\'m exposed to at work?\nIf you smoke, stop. This is the most important thing you can do for your overall health, regardless of risks at your workplace. Smokers have a greater risk of developing some work-related lung diseases than nonsmokers.\nUse a respirator. A respirator is a device you wear over your mouth and nose that cleans the air before it enters your body. You must be properly fitted and trained to use a respirator. Over time you should be refitted and retrained in how to use it. The respirator must be carefully cleaned after each use and it should be checked to ensure that it works properly. Use a respirator as a temporary measure until you are no longer exposed to the damaging substance.\nIf you are exposed to damaging substances at work, talk to your supervisor about the need for adequate ventilation and new procedures to reduce or eliminate your exposure. A change in ingredients, work practices or machinery can reduce hazards in the air. Ventilation systems can remove pollutants and toxins from the air to reduce exposure and prevent buildup. Local exhaust ventilation can be used to remove polluted air at the point where it is generated by a hazardous process or machine. At some jobs, people can be separated from the hazardous materials.\nWritten by familydoctor.org editorial staff', 'Last modified: July 20, 2021\nWhat Is Asbestosis?\nAsbestosis is a chronic lung disease characterized by scarring in the lungs caused by inhaling asbestos fibers.\nMost cases trace back to consistent exposure to asbestos-containing materials in construction sites, ships and industrial facilities. For an asbestos-related illness to develop, it usually takes years of regular asbestos exposure, followed by a latency period that may last decades before symptoms present.\nThere is no cure for asbestosis, but treatment can alleviate symptoms.\nQuick Facts About Asbestosis\n- Incurable lung disease that makes breathing progressively more difficult\n- Usually caused by years of occupational asbestos exposure\n- Contributing cause of death for more than 1,000 Americans each year\n- Signifies an elevated risk of developing asbestos-related cancer\nBecause this disease is similar to other types of pulmonary fibrosis, diagnosing asbestosis requires thorough medical and occupational histories in addition to medical testing. Most patients diagnosed today were exposed to asbestos before the 1970s when the U.S. began to restrict the use of the toxic mineral.\nDespite asbestos abatement efforts throughout the country, the demolition or renovation of older buildings can put Americans at risk of asbestos exposure. Furthermore, 125 million people around the world are still regularly exposed to asbestos in the workplace, according to the World Health Organization’s estimate.\nAsbestosis takes less time to develop than cancer, so an asbestosis diagnosis signals a high risk of developing lung cancer or mesothelioma in the future.\nCauses and Risk Factors of Asbestosis\nAsbestosis is caused only by exposure to asbestos. Inhaling asbestos causes microscopic fibers to become lodged within lung tissue, leading to damage and scarring.\nThe damage caused by asbestos is due to inflammation of the tissue in the lungs. Inflammation occurs when your body senses a foreign invader and sends macrophages, a type of white blood cell, and other immune cells to stimulate and boost the immune system.\nThe scar tissue that forms as a result of the inflammation can occur around the lung’s air sacs, or alveoli, making it more difficult for your body to receive oxygen. Asbestosis can also affect fibroblast cells, which produce the extracellular matrix and collagen responsible for the integrity of your lungs.\nWorkers in the construction, railroad, automotive and shipbuilding industries are more likely to be at risk for asbestosis.\nAnother group of at-risk workers includes drywall removers, firefighters, demolition workers and others who assisted at the World Trade Center after the 9/11 attacks. These workers were exposed to asbestos used in the construction of the north tower.\nAsbestos exposure can develop into asbestosis based on the following factors:\n- Amount and concentration of asbestos\n- Size, shape and chemical makeup of the asbestos\n- Length of time an individual was exposed to asbestos\n- Health factors such as smoking or a history of lung disease\n- Genetic factors or specific mutations in DNA that increase risk of disease\nSymptoms of Asbestosis\nWhen scar tissue forms around the lungs’ microscopic air sacs, it gradually becomes harder for them to expand and fill with fresh air.\nThis can cause a series of symptoms, including:\n- Shortness of breath\n- Persistent dry cough\n- Chest tightness and pain\n- Loss of weight and appetite\n- Crackling sound when breathing\nThe stiffening of the lungs causes the coughing, discomfort and crackling sound associated with asbestosis, and it also results in less oxygen being delivered to the blood, causing shortness of breath. Because the body relies on oxygen for energy, chronic breathing difficulties lead to fatigue and weight loss.\n- Pulmonary Hypertension\nThe formation of scar tissue may also constrict arteries and make it harder to pump blood out of the heart and into the lungs without increasing the pressure required to perform the action. This is called pulmonary hypertension, which is a different condition from the more commonly occurring “high blood pressure” or systemic hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is dangerous because it forces the heart to work harder, potentially leading to earlier problems with coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure.\n- Clubbed Fingers and Toes\nWhen the lungs deliver insufficient oxygen to the blood, a symptom called “clubbing” may arise. The tips of the toes and fingers appear wider and rounder than normal. Fingernails and toenails may become deformed because of the lack of oxygen reaching the body’s extremities\nPatients can minimize symptoms of asbestosis by taking steps to improve their lifestyle.\n- Eat a well-balanced diet and stay hydrated.\n- Get adequate sleep every night and take short rests during the day.\n- Exercise regularly without overexerting yourself.\n- Prevent respiratory infections by getting flu and pneumonia vaccines, washing your hands and avoiding large crowds.\n- Avoid air pollution and tobacco smoke.\nDoctors use imaging scans, lung function tests and medical and occupational histories to diagnose asbestosis. Patients typically go to the doctor with breathing problems and undergo an X-ray or CT scan in addition to lung function tests.\nIf signs of scarring appear on image scan results, and the patient has a history of significant asbestos exposure, doctors will consider an asbestosis diagnosis. It is generally challenging to diagnose the disease because there is no simple, quick test for asbestosis, but a combination of tests and a history of occupational asbestos exposure is the current diagnostic standard.\nAsbestosis is an irreversible condition. With the exception of lung transplantation, all asbestosis treatment options are palliative, meaning they address the symptoms of asbestosis to improve the patient’s quality of life.\nBecause the condition gets worse over time, patients require increased treatment as they age.\n- Supplemental Oxygen\nSupplemental oxygen from a portable oxygen tank is often necessary for patients with reduced lung capacity. The tank delivers extra oxygen to the lungs through a plastic tube with two prongs that fit into the patient’s nostrils.\nMedications can thin lung secretions to make coughing easier and relieve chest pain. However, corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory medications) and immunosuppressants are ineffective for treating asbestosis.\n- Pulmonary Rehabilitation\nPulmonary rehabilitation helps patients learn techniques and make lifestyle changes to better cope with chronic breathing difficulties. A team of therapists work together to provide for both physical and psychological needs.\n- Lung Transplants\nLung transplants are most often considered when asbestosis is accompanied by more severe lung diseases such as emphysema or lung cancer. It is a highly invasive, last-resort treatment, and in order to be put on a lung transplant waiting list, a patient has to undergo extensive screening to determine the relative chances of success.\nSome patients also find relief through complementary and alternative medical treatments such as acupuncture, massage therapy and homeopathic medicine. While none of these treatments offers a cure for asbestosis, many of them do offer relief from pain and improved pulmonary function.\nPrognosis for Asbestosis\nThe outlook for patients with asbestosis depends on how much asbestos they were exposed to. Those who endured a high level of exposure will have more severe disease that may progress quickly. Patients with a lower level of exposure may develop a mild case that progresses slowly or not at all.\nUnfortunately, aside from a lung transplant for asbestosis, there is no way to cure or reverse the scarring caused by asbestos exposure.\nAsbestosis vs. Mesothelioma\nAsbestosis is considered a type of pulmonary fibrosis due to the scarring of lung tissue over time. Asbestosis is not a cancerous disease, but it does indicate a high risk of later developing asbestos-related lung cancer.\nMesothelioma is a type of cancer and is characterized by the formation of one or more tumors in the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart.\nBoth conditions are caused by years of occupational asbestos exposure and can affect the parenchymal tissue of the lungs. This delicate tissue is responsible for oxygenating red blood cells.\nAsbestosis and mesothelioma can take decades to recognize and diagnose, as the damage is not evident until long after asbestos exposure. Symptoms are similar in both conditions. However, a mesothelioma diagnosis requires a biopsy, where an asbestosis diagnosis is determined by imaging scans, asbestos exposure history and medical history.\nCommon Questions About Asbestosis\n- How long can you live with asbestosis?\nUnlike mesothelioma, asbestosis is considered a chronic disease. Patients with an asbestosis diagnosis often live for several decades. However, the disease can be deadly, and many asbestosis patients suffer from severe respiratory issues.\n- What are the symptoms of asbestosis?\nAsbestosis symptoms commonly include:\n- High blood pressure\n- Shortness of breath\n- Chest pain\n- Weight loss\n- What is the difference between asbestosis and mesothelioma?\nMesothelioma is cancer that forms in the mesothelial tissue surrounding the lungs, chest cavity and abdomen. Asbestosis is not cancer, but a chronic respiratory disease and a type of pulmonary fibrosis. Asbestosis and mesothelioma have the same cause as other asbestos-related diseases.\n- What causes asbestosis?\nAsbestosis is caused by years of chronic inflammation and tissue scarring as a result of asbestos fibers lodged in the lungs. The only cause of asbestosis is asbestos exposure. The amount, concentration and type of asbestos all contribute to the risk of developing asbestosis.\n- Can asbestosis be cured?\nThere is no cure for asbestosis due to its similarity to pulmonary fibrosis and other chronic respiratory illnesses. Asbestosis treatment options focus on reducing symptoms and improving breathing ability.\nThank you for your feedback.

97	As someone who's planning to visit a performance of Celtic Christmas, I'd like to know more about the creator of the show - what's his background and experience with Irish traditions?	Tomáseen Foley, the creator of the show, was born and raised on a small farm in Teampall an Ghleanntáin, a remote parish in southwest Ireland, in an area known as Sliabh Luachra. He is recognized as a master of Irish narrative and a keeper of Irish cultural traditions. For twelve years, he has been performing his Celtic Christmas show to critical acclaim across the US, and he also performs other shows including 'A Saint Patrick Celebration' and 'Irish Times'. He has released two CDs: 'Parcel From America' and 'The Priest and the Acrobat'.	"[""Poet W.B. Yeats said of his fellow Irish citizens “We have made our art of simple things.” Indeed we have. Unlike the “high culture” of continental Europe, it was the ordinary people, very often rural people, that gave birth to Ireland’s heritage -- the great and priceless treasury of Irish culture. The music, the singing, the dancing, the storytelling – all were created and nurtured in the heart and by the hearth of small farmers, tradesmen, fishermen, laborers, and so-called servant ‘girls’ and ‘boys’ -- very few of whom had any concept at all of themselves as artists. We, their kith and kin, are their blessed beneficiaries: blessed in being able to draw freely from that seemingly infinite treasury they created, to bring A Celtic Christmas to audiences all over the country year after year.\nWe have made our art of simple things.\nNortheastern State University and the Sequoyah Institute will bring “A Celtic Christmas” to the NSU Center for the Performing Arts on Tuesday, Dec. 4 at 7:30 p.m. The show is sponsored by Barbara Abercrombie and Tery DeShong.\nLong, long before “Riverdance,” ordinary men and women, at the end of a day working in field, meadow, bog, or glen, would gather at each others’ cottages and, rhythmically battering the floor with their hob-nailed boots, would raise sparks off the flagstones as they danced jigs, reels, and hornpipes, and would ‘raise the rafters’ with the fiery music of fiddle, whistle, harp and the mesmerizing uilleann pipes. In concert halls from California to Florida, from Texas to Michigan, “Tomáseen Foley’s A Celtic Christmas” recreates just such a night.\nAnd who better to do it? Tomáseen is the second youngest of seven children and was born and reared on a small farm in the remote parish of Teampall an Ghleanntáin in the southwest of Ireland – part of the renowned cultural enclave now known as Sliabh Luachra. His show, “A Celtic Christmas,” takes us back to Ireland of the 1950s, to a night before Christmas, to a place where the motor car, the television, and the telephone were little more than unlikely rumors, and to a time when the neighbors would gather at each others’ homes, bringing with them not only their traditional musical instruments, but also their songs, their dances, their laughter, and -- always, ever and always -- their stories.\nHe brings with him some of the finest exponents of the traditional Celtic arts performing anywhere today – on either side of the Atlantic. New to this year’s show is Marta Cook – winner of the World Championship Irish Harpist title at the All-Ireland Fleadh Cheoil in 2001, and recipient of the Peter and Margaret Nalty Memorial Trophy. She is considered one of the finest Irish harpists in the world, and is also a champion Irish step dancer.\nBack with the show for the fourth successive year is virtuoso Kathleen Keane – on fiddle, whistle, vocals and traditional Irish dance. Kathleen’s music is featured in The Titanic, Backdraft, The Road to Perdition and The Cinderella Man. As well as being considered a child prodigy on the tin whistle, the Chicago Tribune nominated her as one of the world’s finest Celtic Fiddlers. She studied Irish step dancing under Michael Flatley (Riverdance/ Lord of the Dance) and went on to become a champion Irish dancer.\nMusic Director William Coulter is an internationally acclaimed master of the steel-string guitar. In 2005, he won a Grammy for a track he contributed to Pink Guitar, a solo guitar compilation of Henry Mancini tunes. He has been performing and recording traditional Celtic and American folk music for 25 years. The most recent of his seven CDs on the Gourd Music label is the acclaimed solo album The Road Home.\nReturning for the second year is Uilleann Piper Brian Bigley. From the age of eight, Brian studied the traditional, rarely heard, uilleann pipes with Achill Island (Co. Mayo) piper Michael Kilbane -- with whom he also studied flute, whistle and low whistle. He has toured extensively throughout North America, Europe and the UK. He is also a world-class Irish step dancer -- he competed in the World Championships in Glasgow, Scotland in 2002 and in Killarney, Ireland in 2003.\nStoryteller Tomáseen Foley was born on a small farm in the remote parish of Teampall an Ghleanntáin in the west of Ireland. Rego Irish Records says he is a master of the Irish narrative and a keeper of the flame for a priceless piece of Irish culture. For each of the past twelve years, from Thanksgiving until Christmas, his show “Tomáseen Foley’s A Celtic Christmas” plays to critical acclaim and packed concert halls around the US. His show “A Saint Patrick Celebration” tours from late February through mid-March; two other shows, “Tomáseen Foley’s Irish Times,” and his one-man “Lines from my Grandmother's Forehead” tour throughout the remainder of the year. The Oregon Cabaret developed a hit musical from his story Parcel From America. He has released two CDs: “Parcel From America,” and a live recording, “The Priest and the Acrobat.”\nTickets for “A Celtic Christmas” are $20 for adults, $18 for NSU alumni, $16 for NSU employees, $14 for senior citizens, $10 for students and children, and $5 for NSU students. To purchase tickets, contact the NSU Box Office at (918) 458-2075.\nAdditional funding for the show is provided by the Oklahoma Arts Council and the National Endowment for the Arts.

98	what differences exist between perception action coupling and mind body dualism theories of consciousness	The event-control approach emphasizes a coupling between perception and action where they share neural resources and form a unified system, with perception and planning constituting a distal-event system that constrains action. In contrast, mind-body dualism posits that mental and physical properties differ dramatically. The event-control model suggests perception and action are intrinsically linked in a constraining rather than causal manner, while avoiding both reductionism (reducing mental to non-mental) and dualism's separation of mental and physical substances.	"[""Emergence of self and other in perception and action: An event-control approach\nGraduate studies at Western\nConsciousness and Cognition 12 (4):633-646 (2003)\n|Abstract||The present paper analyzes the regularities referred to via the concept 'self.' This is important, for cognitive science traditionally models the self as a cognitive mediator between perceptual inputs and behavioral outputs. This leads to the assertion that the self causes action. Recent findings in social psychology indicate this is not the case and, as a consequence, certain cognitive scientists model the self as being epiphenomenal. In contrast, the present paper proposes an alternative approach (i.e., the event-control approach) that is based on recently discovered regularities between perception and action. Specifically, these regularities indicate that perception and action planning utilize common neural resources. This leads to a coupling of perception, planning, and action in which the first two constitute aspects of a single system (i.e., the distal-event system) that is able to pre-specify and detect distal events. This distal-event system is then coupled with action (i.e., effector-control systems) in a constraining, as opposed to 'causal' manner. This model has implications for how we conceptualize the manner in which one infers the intentions of another, anticipates the intentions of another, and possibly even experiences another. In conclusion, it is argued that it may be possible to map the concept 'self' onto the regularities referred to in the event-control model, not in order to reify 'the self' as a causal mechanism, but to demonstrate its status as a useful concept that refers to regularities that are part of the natural order.|\n|Keywords||No keywords specified (fix it)|\n|Categories||categorize this paper)|\n|External links||This entry has no external links.

Do minds stand outside the natural order? Is a unified picture of mental and physical reality possible? The Mind in Nature provides a staunchly realist account of the world as a unified system incorporating both the mental and the physical. C. B. Martin, an original and influential exponent of 'ontologically serious' metaphysics, echoes Locke's dictum that 'all things that exist are only particulars', and argues that properties are powerful qualities. He also spells out the implications of this view for philosophical conceptions of causation, intentionality, consciousness, and the mind-body problem. Martin emphasizes the importance of non-conscious 'vegetative' systems, which provide clear examples of intentionality in the form of representational use. The slide from representational use to consciousness involves a change in the material of use, but not the form of representation. A concluding chapter provides an argument for the view that an ontology of particular substances and properties leads ineluctably to monism: the bus we board with Locke takes us directly to the world of Spinoza and Einstein. Along the way, we are led to understand the nature of minds and conscious states of mind in a way that avoids both reductionism (the idea that mental is reducible to the non-mental) and dualism (the idea that mental substances or properties differ dramatically from physical substances and properties).\n|Keywords||No keywords specified (fix it)|\n|Categories||categorize this paper)|\n|Buy the book||$14.29 new (79% off) $20.00 used (70% off) $65.00 direct from Amazon Amazon page|\nSetup an account with your affiliations in order to access resources via your University's proxy server\nConfigure custom proxy (use this if your affiliation does not provide a proxy)\n|Through your library|\nReferences found in this work BETA\nNo references found.\nCitations of this work BETA\nDavid Yates (2013).

99	My roof has been leaking for a while and I've noticed the wooden beams feel kind of spongy when I touch them. I also see some black fungus - what could this mean?	These symptoms strongly indicate you have wet rot developing in your roof timbers. When roof timbers feel 'spongy' to touch and black fungus appears on the woodwork, these are clear signs of wet rot. This is a serious issue because while wet rot cannot spread into brickwork, it can make your roof timbers structurally unsafe and might ultimately require a complete roof replacement.	"['Damp Proofing Dorking Surrey (RH4): Problems with damp in your property in Dorking may not just look unappealing, but they can also lead to dangerous structural and health issues as well. If not cured speedily, some of the more critical problems can cost thousands of pounds to repair, and may be hidden away beneath patches of damp and peeling wallpaper. If you have a problem such as this there\'s not much that you can do yourself, and the wisest thing to do is to call on a competent Dorking damp proofing company to carry out an evaluation and suggest solutions.\nIn Dorking buildings there are 3 main problem areas of how damp can affect your property:\n• Penetrating Damp\n• Rising Damp\nThese three key types of damp are outlined in greater detail in this article, together with suggestions for prevention and resolution, in the event you find them in your home or business in Dorking.\nThings like cracked roof tiles, damaged guttering, cracks in brickwork and cavity wall issues are common external factors that can lead to penetrating damp in your home. Inside your Dorking property, penetrating damp can be a result of damaged shower trays, overflowing baths or sinks and leaky or burst pipes. If left to continue leaking these elements allow water to soak into walls and woodwork, which over time result in damp dark patches on walls, broken or blistered plaster and flaking or bubbling paintwork.\nWet rot can develop in your roof timbers if you\'ve got a leaking roof that\'s been neglected over a period of time. Wet rot cannot spread into brickwork, but it can mean that in the worst outcome your roof timbers become structurally unsafe, necessitating a new roof. If a black fungus starts to appear on any woodwork and the roof timbers feel ""spongy"" to touch, you might have the beginnings of wet rot.\nYou should not panic however, because to stop these problems from occurring, a few basic steps such as examining piping for leaks, cleaning and checking your roof and rain gutters for leaks and repointing brickwork should avoid such situations. An experienced damp proofer in Dorking will check all of these areas to help prevent any further problems, as an element of resolving your dampness issues.\nSuper easy to spot and a cause of damp in many Dorking properties, condensation is incredibly common. Small droplets of water appear on cooler surfaces when they come into contact with moist, warm air. It\'s a problem because of poor ventilation in areas where there\'s high humidity, i.e. boiler rooms, kitchens and bathrooms.\nWiping up any droplets that form, and making certain you have sufficient ventilation in the affected areas, are amongst the simplest solutions to such issues. This might call for the installation or upgrade of cooker hoods, extractor fans and air bricks to help redirect the damp air to the outside of your house.\nA damp proof survey by an established Dorking specialist may also find circumstances which bring about the situation by sucking in damp air from outside. To adequately minimise condensation problems, airflow needs to be properly regulated. A certified Dorking damp proofing company will be happy to offer advice and solutions in connection with this.\nA damp proof course has been fitted as standard on houses constructed in the UK since 1875. It is quite possible that you might not have one installed if your home or property in Dorking was built before this year. It\'s a possibility that your DPM may have been damaged somehow if you are experiencing rising damp issues in a house built after this year.\nIt can be hard to distinguish rising damp, however some giveaway indications are; crumbling or rotten skirting boards, a white powdery deposit being discovered on floor surfaces or forming on walls and tide marks on walls. If you notice or think you might have any of these signs, it is possible you have a rising damp problem.\nThe initial step towards managing your problems with rising damp should simply be to check whether or not you\'ve actually got a damp course on the exterior walls of your home in Dorking. To be certain of an adequate measure of protection the damp proof course needs to be above ground level by at least 150 millimetres. You can dig the surrounding ground away to create this space if it is currently not enough, or you can install a DPM higher up if the former isn\'t feasible.\nIf your damp course is correct and the gap is not the root cause of the problem, dampness might be rising up through your floors and into your walls, which might be a much more challenging issue.\nDamp proofing specialists in Dorking will quickly detect and remedy rising damp using a number of different methods. Older houses which either don\'t have a DPM, or have one that is damaged over an extensive area, can be treated with a damp proof injection cream. This special cream is injected with a nozzle into holes drilled along the wall\'s mortar joint, and before the cream can set it turns into liquid and penetrates into the surrounding brickwork forming a barrier that is repellent to water.\nIf the damp proofing cream treatment isn\'t sufficient, or the damage is too extensive to your membrane, a brand new damp proof course may have to be installed. This is taking repair work to the extreme, however it may be the only resolution to your rising damp.\nPainting with a bitumen based, waterproof latex emulsion, is another potential option for smaller areas of membrane damage. Wooden flooring, tiles or carpeting will have to be lifted before any work can be undertaken, as it is applied underneath your floor coverings. Also used as part of the tanking procedure to make a space watertight, this is an especially effective treatment in cellar areas. Before the bitumen coating has has dried out completely, your Dorking damp proof specialist might suggest the application of building paper (a foil backed specialist membrane), for added protection.\nTanking: Tanking an area, such as a cellar or basement, is the process of covering exposed surfaces in a watertight paint. This should be applied at the base level of floors and walls, so all wall coverings and plaster must be removed and the relevant surfaces prepared properly before work commences. You can replaster the wall surfaces and decorate over the top of it, as soon as the paint has dried completely. This is an exceedingly disruptive job since it needs to be applied to a whole basement level or ground floor of a property, and it\'s preferable to get more than one expert opinion about whether this really is the only resolution to your rising damp issues.\nSOLVING DAMP PROBLEMS WITH DEHUMIDIFIERS\nDehumidifiers are an effective way of reducing the moisture content in the air, so for condensation problems they can be of help. The fact that they merely mask the cause of the damp and don\'t cure it, is the main disadvantage with dehumidifiers.

100	How do ancient myths inspire both art and education today?	In art, Solange Pessoa's work draws inspiration from ancient civilizations, mythology, and primordial times, as seen in her paintings that evoke historical cave paintings and her use of traditional materials like genipap paint used by indigenous people. In education, contemporary academic courses like 'The Anthropology of Monsters' examine ancient mythological creatures alongside modern monsters, studying how beings like demons and spirits have been portrayed and experienced across different cultures and time periods, demonstrating the ongoing relevance and influence of ancient mythological concepts.	"['Artist: Solange Pessoa\nVenue: Mendes Wood DM, Brussels\nExhibition Title: In the Sun and the Shade\nDate: January 22 – April 11, 2020\nFull gallery of images, press release and link available after the jump.\nImages courtesy of Mendes Wood DM São Paulo, Brussels, New York. Photos by Kristien Daem.\nMendes Wood DM Brussels is pleased to present In the Sun and the Shade, the first European solo show of works by the Brazilian artist Solange Pessoa, coinciding with her acclaimed first solo institutional exhibition in the United States, currently on view at Ballroom Marfa.\nUtilizing the entirety of the Brussels gallery space, the show includes a new body of biomorphic ceramic sculptures, a series of genipap paintings (2013-2017) as well as the new triptych Primavera Bêbada (English: Drunk Spring) (2019). The exhibition also showcases new sculptures made from cement and moss, as well as Pessoa’s long-conceived installation, comprising of three large bronze reliefs and grapes. Occupying an entire room on the first floor of the gallery, this work is closer in scope and complexity to Pessoa’s museum installations.\nThe exhibition also debuts Pessoa’s most recent video work Lonjuras (2019), a culmination of footage that the artist has collected since 2012. The title refers to an expansion of time between two points – a designation of immense distance. Through her documentation of terrestrial elements, Pessoa points to a gap in time, drawing our attention to things that pre-existed long before any utterance of civilization on Earth. It is through this video work that Pessoa ties together the evocation of the primordial, mythical times that play out in the exhibition.\nPessoa’s expansive practice draws inspiration from a plethora of sources: archaeology and ancestry, the history of her land and the ancient civilizations that made their mark on it, ancient pictographs and traditional craft, Brazilian Baroque and poetry. These and many other references simmer under the surface, underpinning an artistic career that spans over three decades and comprises of sculpture, installation, painting, drawing and video.\nThe rich and varied landscape of her native Minas Gerais, a state located in south-eastern Brazil, where the artist lives and works, has engendered in her a continuous fascination with nature. The result of this deep bond with her surroundings are her telluric works, often composed of organic and unconventional materials including hair, grass, fruit, feathers, minerals, moss and much more.\nHer earlier series of paintings (from 2013-2017) on view have been rendered with genipap paint, made from a tropical fruit used by indigenous people since ancient times. Here, primordial memory is Pessoa’s guiding output; the graphic essence of organic forms in these compositions, as well as in her large painting Primavera Bêbada (2019), recall those of historical cave paintings. It is in this way that Pessoa simultaneously evokes parietal art and Modernist paintings.\nWith the use of organic matter that can be found in her paintings as well as in her sculptures, there is a sense that Pessoa has allowed nature to take its course and ultimately take over her work. This is particularly felt in her sculptures, where there is an evident blurring of lines between art and nature, a confusion Pessoa relishes.\nIt is important to understand that Pessoa’s scope is not reduced to the aesthetic field alone; for her the natural environment is not merely there to be imitated, instead it constitutes an experience that she irrevocably mediates through her art. The interplay between nature and imagination creates a double landscape – both a visual impression and an imaginative mindscape. Her work straddles the border between the real and the unreal, visual and illusion, the conscious and the unconscious.\nDuality is a recurrent trope in Pessoa’s oeuvre and inextricably connects her long-standing practice to the Brazilian Baroque tradition. The title In the Sun and the Shade is inspired by the poetry of Brazilian writer and fellow Mineiro, Paulo Mendes Campos, and draws attention to the stylistic dualities that can be found across the artist’s practice. Her challenging combination of sensual, organic materials, such as hair, moss and fruit, with solid materials, such as bronze and ceramic surfaces, create an aesthetic of contrasts that evoke darkness and light, hardness and softness, excess and dearth.\nSolange Pessoa (1961, Brazil) lives and works in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.\nHer selected solo exhibitions include Longilonge, Ballroom Marfa, Marfa (2019); Mendes Wood DM, New York (2018); Blum & Poe, Los Angeles (2017); Mendes Wood DM, São Paulo (2016); Metaflor- Metaflora, Museu Mineiro, Belo Horizonte (2013); Museu de Arte da Pampulha, Belo Horizonte (2008); Museu da Inconfidência, Ouro Preto (2000); Palácio das Artes, Belo Horizonte (1995), and Centro Cultural São Paulo (1992).\nPessoa received a grant from the Pollock Krasner Foundation (1996/1997), and has participated in numerous group exhibitions in Brazil and abroad including Untitled, Punta Della Dogana, Venice (2020); Veredas, Mendes Wood DM, São Paulo (2019); Invenção de Origem, Estação Pinacoteca, São Paulo (2018); La Fin de Babylone – Mich Wunder, dass ich so Fröhlich bin, Koln Skulptur #9, Cologne (2017); New Shamans (2016), High Anxiety (2016), and No Man’s Land: Women Artists (2015), Rubell Family Collection, Miami; Arte e Patrimônio, Paço Imperial, Rio de Janeiro (2014); Mostra do Redescobrimento, CAPS Musée d’Art Contemporain, Bordeaux (2001), and Heranças Contemporâneas (1999) and Encontros e Tendências (1993), Museu de Arte Contemporânea, São Paulo.', ""Postgraduate Course: The Anthropology of Monsters: Demons, witches, cyborgs and other fabulous creatures (PGSP11460)\n|School||School of Social and Political Science\n||College||College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences\n|Credit level (Normal year taken)||SCQF Level 11 (Postgraduate)\n||Availability||Available to all students\n|Summary||This course is about monsters. It is about the way in which monstrous bodies mix and match realms that should be kept separate - nature/culture, human/animal, male/female, familiar/unfamiliar, material/immaterial and, above all, self/other. From African witches and the ghost of Burnt\nWoman in Australia to Freddy Krueger or 'pharma' animals and cyborgs, it brings together Western and non-Western monsters in order to explore some of the ways in which they have been portrayed and experienced in different ethnographic contexts as well as through time.\nDo monsters exist and how can we define them? What role do monsters and monster narratives play in culture? Does the logic of monstrosity remain constant across time or does each era embrace the monsters it needs? Do African witches or the ghost of Burnt Woman in Eastern Australia\nshare anything with Freddy Krueger, cyborgs or the chimeric 'pharm' animals of the new biotechnologies? How useful is it to bring together cinematic monsters like Freddy Krueger with African witches or, indeed, African witches with cyborgs? Focusing on a number of monstrous beings\n(demons, witches, vampires, spirits, cyborgs, chimeras, tc.), this course attempts to answer these questions by exploring some of the ways in which monsters have been portrayed and experienced in different ethnographic contexts as well as different times.\nThis exploration is organized around two main themes. We will start with the idea that monsters are arbiters of order and disorder - they allow us, that is, to express ideas about what is normal and channel fears about what is not. As 'the abnormal' that monsters represent appears to be conditioned by the mixture of different realms that need to be kept separate, the first part of the course will concentrate on different kinds of Monstrous Bodies in relation to particular examples of such a mixture (e.g., human/animal, self/other, male/female, familiar/unfamiliar, material/immaterial).\nIn the second part of the course, Monstrous Technologies, we shall concentrate on the idea that monstrosity does not simply represent fear of abnormal selves or abnormal bodies but also challenges, permeates and constructs normal selves and normal bodies. In this\nsense, rather than a simple representational category, it may be seen as a way of being or becoming.\nFrom the uncanny to the abject: un/familiar monsters\nFrom Gods to heroes and angels: im/mortal monsters\nFrom the impossible to the forbidden: im/moral monsters\nExcess and lack\nDefilement and disgust\nRuination and transgression\nEntry Requirements (not applicable to Visiting Students)\n||Other requirements|| None\nInformation for Visiting Students\n|High Demand Course?\nCourse Delivery Information\n|Not being delivered|\nOn completion of this course, the student will be able to:\n- Demonstrate critical knowledge and advanced understanding of the key theories, concepts and issues central to the anthropological study of monsters and the monstrous.\n- Critically analyze, synthesize, and evaluate research and contemporary debates about alterity as well as navigate complex issues to form informed opinions and analyses.\n- Exhibit a critical awareness of the articulation and significance of cultural and political forces that contribute to the 'monsterization' of the Other.\n- Demonstrate the ability to question, examine, and understand key anthropological issues through independent research.\n- Communicate through empirically grounded and theoretically informed written work and oral presentations, their knowledge of issues relevant to the study of monsters and their comparative significance.\n|Forth, G. 2008.
