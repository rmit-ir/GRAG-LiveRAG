1	compare dc bldc induction motor efficiency maintenance	DC series motors have low efficiency, are bulky, and require frequent maintenance due to brush wear. BLDC motors offer higher efficiency, greater power density, and minimal maintenance since they lack brushes, but need complex controllers. Induction motors provide good efficiency, simple design, high reliability and low maintenance needs, though their efficiency is lower than permanent magnet motors. While DC motors are simple to control, both BLDC and induction motors require sophisticated control systems with inverters/controllers for operation.	"['This simplest form of AC induction motor or asynchronous motor is the basic, universal workhorse of industry. Its general construction is shown in Fig. 1. It is usually designed for fixed-speed operation, larger ratings having such features as deep rotor bars to limit Direct on Line (DOL) starting currents.\nElectronic variable speed drive technology is able to provide the necessary variable voltage, current and frequency that the induction motor requires for efficient, dynamic and stable variable speed control.\nModern electronic control technology is able not only to render the AC induction motor satisfactory for many modern drive applications but also to extend greatly its application and enable users to take advantage of its low capital and maintenance costs.\nMore striking still, microelectronic developments have made possible the highly dynamic operation of induction motors by the application of flux vector control. The practical effect is that it is now possible to drive an AC induction motor in such a way as to obtain a dynamic performance in all respects better than could be obtained with a phase-controlled dc drive combination.\nThe stator winding of the standard industrial induction motor in the integral kilowatt range is three-phase and is sinusoidally distributed. With a symmetrical three-phase supply connected to these windings, the resulting currents set up, in the air-gap between the stator and the rotor, a travelling wave magnetic field of constant magnitude and moving at synchronous speed. The rotational speed of this field is f/p revolutions per second, where f is the supply frequency (hertz) and p is the number of pole pairs (a four-pole motor, for instance, having two pole pairs). It is more usual to express speed in revolutions per minute, as 60 f/p (rpm).\nThe emf generated in a rotor conductor is at a maximum in the region of maximum flux density and the emf generated in each single rotor conductor produces a current, the consequence being a force exerted on the rotor which tends to turn it in the direction of the flux rotation. The higher the speed of the rotor, the lower the speed of the rotating stator flux field relative to the rotor winding, and therefore the smaller is the emf and the current generated in the rotor cage or winding.\nThe speed when the rotor turns at the same rate as that of the rotating field is known as synchronous speed and the rotor conductors are then stationary in relation to the rotating flux. This produces no emf and no rotor current and therefore no torque on the rotor. Because of friction and windage the rotor cannot continue to rotate at synchronous speed; the speed must therefore fall and as it does so, rotor emf and current, and therefore torque, will increase until it matches that required by the losses and\nby any load on the motor shaft. The difference in rotor speed relative to that of the rotating stator flux is known as the slip.\nIt is usual to express slip as a percentage of the synchronous speed. Slip is closely proportional to torque from zero to full load.\nThe most popular squirrel cage induction motor is of a 4-pole design. Its synchronous speed with a 50 Hz supply is therefore 60 f/p, or 1500 rpm. For a full-load operating slip of 3 per cent, the speed will then be (1 – s)60 f/p, or 1455 rpm.\nA disadvantage of the squirrel cage machine is its fixed rotor characteristic. The starting torque is directly related to the rotor circuit impedance, as is the percentage slip when running at load and speed. Ideally, a relatively high rotor impedance is required for good starting performance (torque against current) and a low rotor impedance provides low full-load speed slip and high efficiency.\nThis problem can be overcome to a useful extent for DOL application by designing the rotor bars with special cross sections as shown in Fig. 2 so that rotor eddy currents increase the impedance at starting when the rotor flux (slip) frequency is high.\nAlternatively, for special high starting torque motors, two or even three concentric sets of rotor bars are used. Relatively costly in construction but capable of a substantial improvement in starting performance, this form of design produces an increase in full load slip. Since machine losses are closely proportional to working speed slip, increased losses may require such a high starting torque machine to be derated.\nThe curves in Fig. 3 indicate squirrel cage motor characteristics. In the general case, the higher the starting torque the greater the full load slip. This is one of the important parameters of squirrel cage design as it influences the operating efficiency.', ""Laird Connectivity’s Gar and Barracuda products offer reliability, durability, and performance\nMotors are the most essential part of any Electric Vehicle(EV). These are responsible for utilizing the chemical energy stored in the cells and converting it to rotational energy thus driving the wheels and causing the movement of the vehicle, hence these motors are also called traction motors.\nIn this article, we will be reading about different types of traction motors used in Electric Vehicles and learn about their characteristics. We will be comparing the characteristics and see which traction motor you need to use in your next Electric Vehicle.\nFeatures of a Best Traction Motor\nThe most important features for an EV motor are efficiency, torque, cost, power to weight ratio, and reliability. The efficiency of an EV motor and the motor controller has a direct impact on the vehicle’s weight because the lost power must be compensated by a bigger battery which will impact the total weight of the vehicle. Therefore, it is fair to say that the overall performance and efficiency of an EV are primarily determined by the type of motor driver used. Hence it is essential to compare the torque-speed characteristics and power-speed characteristics in order to select the best traction motor.\nTypes of Motors used in EVs\nMotor technology has come a long way since the first DC motor, the refinement in power electronics has also paved the way for more efficient and more powerful motors. EVs use various types of motors depending on their propulsion system. Motors can be categorized based on the type of current required such as DC motors and AC motors. Furthermore, the motors can be classified based on the type of their construction or if permanent magnets are present or not. Some common types of motors used in EVs are BLDC motor, Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM), Induction motor(IM), Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM), Synchronous Reluctance motor, etc.\nDC Series Motor\nThe DC series motor, which is also known as the brushed DC motor is the most basic type of motor and has been widely used since the 1900s. The motor works when the electrical current is passed through its coils which are arranged within a fixed magnetic field. This motor is simple to control and has a high initial torque capacity making this motor a good choice. It uses brushes and commutators for working. By ensuring the direction of current the rotation of the motor can be controlled. But the major drawback is that the brushes tend to wear out fast requiring regular maintenance.\nThe characteristics of the DC series motor is shown below:\nThe brushed DC motors are not preferred in personal EVs such as scooters or cars due to their low efficiency, bulky size, and need for frequent maintenance. But are still popular in applications requiring high torque and load-bearing capabilities. Hence, the DC series motors are widely used in Indian Railway locomotives, cranes, heavy equipment, etc.\nAdvantages of DC Series Motor\n- Very high starting torque\n- Easy to control\n- high load capacity\nDisadvantages of DC Series Motor\n- Low efficiency\n- Bulky in size\n- Requires frequent maintenance\nApplication of DC Series Motor\nIndian Railway locomotives, cranes, heavy construction equipment, etc.\nBrushless Direct Current Motors (BLDC) is also known as electronically commutated motor. These motors are one of the most common motors used in the EV industry. BLDC motors do not have brushes and therefore require very low maintenance compared to the DC motors, but unlike the brushed DC motor which has a simple operation, driving a BLDC motor requires complex motor controllers.\nThese are extensively utilized in a variety of applications owing to benefits such as low rotor inertia, compact construction compared to other motors with the same power rating and higher efficiency. BLDC motors have low losses since they use permanent magnets in the rotor and offer quicker reactions making them perfect for EV application, especially for 2 wheelers.\nThe torque-speed curve of a BLDC motor is shown below:\nFrom the above torque-speed curve, it is clear that the torque of the motor decreases linearly with the increase in speed. The motor has a very high starting torque but provides a low torque at a higher speed.\nTypes of BLDC Motors\nBased on their construction and design, there are two types of BLDC motors: inner rotor design or hub motor and outer rotor design or BLDC outrunner motor. The basic architecture of inner rotor and outer rotor brushless motors differs significantly. As we know that the magnets are used to spin all brushed and brushless motors. The rotor is the component that spins and holds the magnets while the stator's job is to produce a charge that repels or attracts the magnets, causing the motor to spin. The stator is on the exterior and the rotor is on the inside in a hub motor while the outer rotor has a completely opposite arrangement. The below image shows a hub motor and the components of a hub motor.\nAdvantages of BLDC Motor\n- Brushes are not required.\n- higher torque compared to other motors at the same current and voltage.\n- Extremely high power density.\n- Extremely efficient.\nDisadvantages of BLDC Motor\n- Low torque at higher RPM\n- Requires an external motor controller\nThe induction motor (IM) is also known as an asynchronous motor. There are basically 2 types of IM, a single-phase induction motor and a three-phase induction motor. Single-phase induction motors (SPIMs) are still not widely used in vehicles due to their problematic starting, low-speed operation complexity, and other control disadvantages. Hence only the 3 phase IMs are used. These motors are called induction motors because the electric current in the rotor required to create torque is acquired by electromagnetic induction from the stator winding's revolving magnetic field. There are 2 types of induction motor based on the type of its rotor. An induction motor's rotor can be either a squirrel cage rotor or a wound-type rotor. The IM runs at a speed slower than their synchronous speed, hence, the induction motors are also known as asynchronous motors. The Induction motors are preferred because of their simple design, great dependability, robustness, ease of maintenance, low cost, and ability to operate in a variety of environmental situations. In case of inverter failures, IMs may naturally de-excite, which is a significant safety benefit for EVs. IMs' field-oriented vector control is standardized in the industry.\nThe major disadvantage of IM motors includes lower efficiency compared to Permanent Magnet(PM) Motors or BLDC motors, greater power losses (due to cage losses), and a poor power factor. In the constant power operation area, the weakening of the flux can be employed to increase the speed range. Some vehicles utilize dual inverter technology as dual inverters can also be used to expand this region.\nThe below image shows the torque-speed characteristics of an Induction motor.\nThe induction motor requires an inverter to convert the energy stored in the battery to an AC power, a picture of the Tesla Model 3 inverter is shown below:\nThe inverter is mounted in the motor housing of a 3 phase induction motor. The below picture of the induction motor is taken from the youtube video by Weber State University.\nAdvantages of Induction Motor\n- Very high efficiency\n- Simple design\n- Robustness and can be used in harsh environment\n- Requires low maintenance\n- Low-cost motors\nDisadvantages of Induction Motor\n- lower efficiency compared to PM motors or BLDC motors\n- Higher power losses\nApplication of Induction Motor\nUsed in Tesla Model S and Tesla Model X\nPermanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM)\nAs the name suggests, PMSM is an AC motor that uses a permanent magnet in its construction. It is a hybrid of a brushless DC motor and an induction motor. Brushless permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) offer a high level of dependability and efficiency. They also have a greater torque, lower frame size, and no rotor current than AC induction motors, all of which are benefits over AC induction motors (AICMs). Because there is no stator power allocated to magnetic field creation, it has a better power density than induction motors with similar ratings. Therefore, the main benefit of a PMSM is that it can help you in reducing the size of your design without sacrificing torque, thanks to its excellent power-to-size ratio. PMSMs are commutated similarly to BLDC motors, however, the waveforms used need to be sinusoidal due to the structure of the windings.\nPMSM employs vector control methods to reach this level of control. Field Oriented Control(FOC) is a term used to describe vector control approaches. The vector control technique works by decomposing a stator current into two parts: a magnetic field generator and a torque generator. After the breakdown, both components can be controlled independently.\nThe speed torque curve of a PMSM is shown below:\nFrom the above graph, it can be inferred that the BLDC motors have a constant torque at a lower speed while it has a constant power region.\nAdvantages of PMSM\n- It provides greater efficiency at high speeds\n- It is far easier to maintain and install than an induction motor.\n- It is capable of retaining full torque at low speeds.\n- It provides smooth torque and dynamic performance\nDisadvantage of PMSM\n- Difficult to control\n- Higher cost\n- Used in Nissan leaf\nSwitched Reluctance Motor (SRM)\nA switched reluctance motor creates torque by altering its magnetic reluctance. It has salient poles and windings similar to a brushless DC motor's stator, but the rotor is constructed of steel cut into salient poles with no magnets or windings. Unlike normal brushed DC motors, the power is sent to the stator windings rather than the rotor. When the magnetic field created by the stator and rotor varies, SRM functions via alternating currents in the stator. Switched reluctance motors contain fewer rotor poles than stator poles to avoid a circumstance when both rotor and stator poles match up together and no torque is produced.\nBecause of its control flexibility, simple structure, low cost, and great efficiency, a switching reluctance motor has several advantages over other types of electric motors. Due to the absence of a permanent magnet or winding in its rotor, an SRM is suitable for extremely high-speed applications and can sustain high temperatures. It also results in a durable and simple construction as well as a low manufacturing cost. Similarly, if a failure develops in any one winding or phase, the motor can still operate, but at a lower load. The biggest problem with SRM is its non-linear properties due to magnetic saturation, making precise torque control difficult.\nThe below image shows a speed torque curve of a Switch Reluctance Motor.\nFrom the above image, we can see that the SRM has a constant torque and constant power mode similar to PMSM but unlike PMSM where the torque declines to zero instantly after reaching the threshold, the SRM has a gradual decline even at higher speed.\nAdvantages of SRM\n- Cheaper than other motors\n- Simple to design and repair\n- SRM motors can operate at harsher conditions compared to PMSM or BLDC motors.\nDisadvantage of SRM\n- Controlling torque is difficult\n- High level of noise\n- High level of vibration.\nApplication of SRM\nHonda Civic Hybrid Electrical Vehicle\nThere are different types of motors available in the market, each of the motors have their own advantages and disadvantage. The Brushed DC motor provides simple control and high initial torque but has lower efficiency and requires regular maintenance. The BLDC motor is extremely efficient and is also available in a hub-type enclosure which can be directly used inside a wheel reducing the additional cost and weight of the mechanical transmission, but the control mechanism of a BLDC is very complex. The Induction motor is a low-cost motor with high reliability and robustness but it is similar to a BLDC motor, it also requires an inverter as it is an AC motor. Furthermore, it has a lower efficiency than the BLDC motor. Then we have PMSM which is a cross between a BLDC and an IM. PMSM provides high torque and has a very high power to weight ratio but requires a very complex control method to drive the motor. There is Switched Reluctance Motor which is capable of working in harsh environments and is simple to design while being cost-effective but its non-linear characteristics make precise torque control challenging. So, we can say that there is not a one-fit solution for all the applications. All the motors have their own use cases and selection of motor can only be done after careful consideration of the application and its requirement.

2	What are the cleaning verification methods and E. coli prevention strategies?	For cleaning verification, ATP monitoring systems provide rapid evaluation through bioluminescence reactions, offering speed, accuracy and sensitivity in detecting surface contamination. For E. coli prevention, key strategies include maintaining clean kitchens, proper hand washing, cooking foods to 75°C, avoiding cross-contamination, proper food storage at 4°C or below, and ensuring thorough cleaning of preparation equipment.	"['Cleaning/Sanitization Verification with ATP\nATP Cleaning Verification and Monitoring Systems offer rapid evaluation of biological contamination on surfaces. Primarily, ATP Cleaning Verification and Monitoring Systems are used to test surfaces after cleaning/sanitization/sanitation efforts are completed to gauge the effectiveness of the performed remedial work.\nATP Cleaning Verification and Monitoring Systems are used in a variety of industries including:\n- Doctor’s offices\n- Mobile testing/diagnostics vehicles\n- K-12 schools\nAssisted Care Facilities\n- Adult/Senior daycare\n- Nursing homes\n- Cruise ships\n- Fitness centers\n- Food/beverage processing\n- Cannabis processing\n- Call centers\n- Break rooms\n- Category-3 water\n- Crime scene/trauma\nWhy is testing of surfaces important?\nInfectious diseases are disorders caused by organisms. Infectious diseases are spread by direct contact, indirect contact, insect bites, and food contamination.\nFomite transmission refers to the transmission of infectious diseases by germs left on objects. A fomite is any inanimate object (such as door knobs, faucet handles, flooring, furniture, hand rails, tabletops, utensils, toys, etc.) that, when contaminated with or exposed to infectious agents (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites), can transfer disease to a new host. When you touch the contaminated object, you can pick up the germs.\nTesting surfaces for biological contamination can help identify contamination loads on high-touch surfaces. The identification of ATP on surfaces may also serve as a surrogate for microbial contamination that may not be easily tested for in the field.\nWhat is ATP?\nAdenosine Triphosphate (ATP) is the universal energy molecule found in all living things. Animals, plants, bacteria, and fungi (molds/mushrooms/yeasts) cells produce ATP in the mitochondria (powerhouse) of cells. ATP is used as a source of chemical energy for cells.\nHow is ATP used in ATP cleaning verification and monitoring systems?\nATP testing devices contain a natural enzyme found in fireflies. This enzyme produces a bioluminescence (light-producing) reaction when it contacts ATP. Using the bioluminescence emitted by the reaction, the luminometer measures ATP encountered and displays/saves the results numerically in the form of Relative Light Units (RTU).\nWhy is using an ATP cleaning verification and monitoring system a good metric for evaluation of biological contamination?\n“While many methods exist for evaluating cleanliness, ATP bioluminescence is the only method that combines quantitative data collection with scientific measurement and still delivers speedy results.”1\nSpeed– Real-time analysis yields actionable information in seconds.\nLinearity– There is a direct, proportional, straight-line relationship between RLU and ATP.\nRepeatability– There are dependable results with a low coefficient of variation (CV).\nSensitivity– The is an extremely low Limit of Detection (LoD) allowing for identification of low levels of ATP above background noise.\nAccuracy– Based on a comparative study of commercial ATP Hygiene Monitoring Systems2, the ATP system used by FSG Inspections is the closest to 100%, thus the least variable and most accurate in the study.\nWhat equipment does equipment does FSG Inspections use?\nFSG Inspections uses the EnSURE™ Touch advanced cleaning verification and monitoring system by Hygiena. Hygiena is the global industry leader in ATP cleaning verification and monitoring systems. The EnSURE™ Touch is Hygiena’s next-generation, state-of-the-art ATP system that collects, analyzes, and reports ATP and site data.\nIn order to have robust quality controls, FSG Inspections uses the Hygiena CalCheck LED Calibration Verification system in addition to the EnSURE™ Touch in-built startup calibration check for secondary on-site positive and negative calibration checks.\nSamples are collected by UltraSnapTM and SuperSnapTM surface samplers based on sensitivity requirements of the Client.', 'About e coli\n, also known as Escherichia coli, was discovered by Escherich in 1885. Escherichia coli is a conditionally pathogenic bacteria. Under certain conditions, it can cause gastrointestinal infections or urinary tract infections of various tissues and organs in humans and various animals.\nE coli size\nThe size is 0.5×1～3 microns. Chow flagella, can move without du spores. It can ferment a variety of sugars to produce acid and gas. It is a normal resident bacterium in the intestines of humans and animals. It enters the intestines with infants after birth and is accompanied by humans for life, accounting for almost 1/3 of the dry weight of feces.\nE coli shape\nE coli is Brevibacterium, with blunt round ends and Gram negative. Sometimes, due to different environments, individual cells appear to be spherical or filament-like; E. coli are mostly single or two, but they will not be arranged in a long chain shape; most E. coli strains have capsules or microcapsules Structure, but cannot form spores; most E. coli strains grow fimbriae, some of which are host-specific fimbriae that have adhesion to the host and some other tissues or cells.\nE coli classification\nAt present, the internationally recognized classification mainly includes six types of E. coli, namely intestinal pathogenic E. coli (EPEC), intestinal toxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and intestinal invasion that can cause gastrointestinal infections. E coli (EIEC), intestinal hemorrhagic E coli (EHEC), intestinal aggregative E coli (EAEC) and intestinal Shiga-like toxins found in recent years also have certain invasive E coli (ESIES) In addition, there are urethral pathogenic E coli (UPEC) that can cause urinary tract infection, and the newly named intestinal agglomerative adherent E. coli (EAggEC).\nAccording to the ability of E. coli to produce hemolysin and the ability to hemolyze, E. coli can be divided into two categories: hemolytic E. coli and non-hemolytic E. coli.\nAccording to the ability of E coli to produce enterotoxin during the infection process, E coli can be divided into two categories: enterotoxigenic E coli and non-entotoxinogenic E. coli. Enterotoxigenic E. coli is an important pathogen of any infectious diarrhea in humans and various animals. The identification of enterotoxigenic E. coli is mainly to determine the type of enterotoxin secreted by the isolated E. coli. In addition, according to the ability of E. coli to produce enterotoxin, combined with its sensitivity to different enterotoxins, E coli can be classified as enterotoxin type.\nE coli infection\nE. coli is normal resident bacteria in the intestines of animals, and a small part of them cause disease under certain conditions. The serotypes of E. coli can cause gastrointestinal infections in humans or animals, mainly caused by specific fimbria antigens, pathogenic toxins and other infections. In addition to gastrointestinal infections, they can also cause urinary tract infections, arthritis, and meninges. Inflammation and septic infections.\nEscherichia coli includes several bacterial groups with different pathogenicity. Human E. coli infections are roughly divided into two types: intestinal infections and extraintestinal infections.\nE coli symptoms\nThe most typical symptom of intestinal infection may be diarrhea. If the infection is severe, shock may occur, blood pressure may drop, and heart rate may increase. If it is an intestinal infection, nausea, vomiting, fever, urinary frequency, and urgency may occur after E. coli infection.\nE coli pathogen\nGenerally, E. coli is divided into four bacterial groups according to its pathogenicity to humans: common E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, and invasive E. coli. The latter three are pathogenic bacteria that cause diarrhea.\nE coli pathogenesis\nEach flora includes a certain number of serotypes. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli can produce heat-resistant enterotoxin and heat-resistant enterotoxin. The production of these two enterotoxins is genetically controlled by plasmids. The plasmid is a kind of non-chromosomal DNA that can be easily transmitted. The mutual transmission of plasmids can enable the non-toxin-producing strains to obtain toxin-producing ability. Due to the delivery of the plasmid, Escherichia coli of any serotype can produce enterotoxin and colony factor, thus having pathogenicity.\nE coli treatment\nFirst, if the symptoms of infection are not very serious and the diarrhea and abdominal pain are mild, oral administration of bifidobacteria can improve gastrointestinal dysfunction and regulate intestinal microflora disorders.\nIf the abdominal pain and diarrhea are serious and there is watery stool, consider giving anti-inflammatory treatment such as quinolone antibiotics or berberine, and appropriate fluid replacement to improve dehydration symptoms.\nWhere does e coli come from\nEscherichia coli is one of the most common microorganisms, widely distributed in nature, most of which are not pathogenic, mainly parasitic in the intestines of humans or animals, and are called ""normal flora"" by humans.\nE coli transmission\nThe main source of infection of human E. coli disease is that a large number of E. coli pathogens are excreted in the feces of gastrointestinal infection patients. The transmission route of E. coli among people is mostly through the fecal-oral transmission route, which can cause the spread or epidemic of E. coli disease under certain conditions.\nEnterobacter sakazakii in powdered infant formula\nEnterobacter sakazakii is a creature that exists in the environment and is commonly found in facilities and home environments where infant formula is produced. Although infant formula is not a sterile product and may be contaminated with pathogens that can cause serious diseases, if the infant formula is properly prepared and stored, the risk of infection by Enterobacter sakazakii can be greatly reduced. To safely prepare infant formula, you must first clean and sterilize the feeding and preparation equipment.\nE coli prevention\n1. Keep the bai place and kitchen utensils clean, and properly dispose of garbage.\n2. Keep your hands clean and trim your nails frequently.\n3. Wash your hands with soap and water before eating or handling food. You should also wash your hands after using the toilet or changing diapers.\n4. Tap water should be used for drinking water, and it is best to boil it before drinking.\n5. Fresh food should be purchased from a reliable place, not patronizing unlicensed hawkers.\n6. Avoid eating high-risk foods, such as milk that has not been processed by low-temperature sterilization, as well as undercooked hamburger steaks, ground beef, and other meat foods.\n7. When cooking food, wear clean, washable apron and a hat.\n8. Food should be thoroughly washed.\n9. Perishable food should be covered with a lid and stored in the refrigerator.\n10. Raw food and cooked food, especially beef and beef offal, should be handled and stored separately (store cooked food on the top of the refrigerator and raw food on the bottom) to avoid cross-contamination.\n11. The refrigerator should be cleaned and melted regularly, and the temperature should be kept at 4 degrees Celsius or below.\n12. If all parts of the food are heated to 75 degrees Celsius, E. coli O157:H7 can be eliminated; therefore, ground beef and hamburger steak should be thoroughly cooked to 75 degrees Celsius for 2 to 3 minutes, until the cooked meat is completely turned It is brown, and the gravy becomes clear.\n13. Do not handle cooked food with bare hands; if necessary, wear gloves.\n14. Food should be consumed as soon as possible after cooking.\n15. If it is necessary to keep leftover cooked food, it should be refrigerated and consumed as soon as possible. Reheat thoroughly before eating. Spoiled food should be discarded.\nTest for e coli\nThis method is mainly for the cultivation of E. coli on a medium at 44.5°C, which contains a fluorescent substrate and requires 24 hours of cultivation. The main steps include fermentation, separation culture, secondary fermentation, microscope observation, etc.\nMatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry\nMatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MAL-DITOF-MS) method is to mix the sample to be measured with the matrix solution at a certain ratio, and use pulsed laser irradiation to excite the matrix, causing the polymer to generate molecular ions and molecular ion polymerization The body is accelerated and detected in a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. As a result, the measured polymer is separated according to the mass number\n, processed to form a mass spectrum, and analyzed and compared by software to screen and determine the specificity (fingerprint) spectrum to achieve Differentiation and identification of target microorganism species or strains.\nImmunomagnetic bead method\nThe main principle of the separation technology is to use magnetic beads as a carrier and an antibody to combine the antibody and the magnetic beads, and then to complete the mechanical movement through magnetic technology to separate E. coli. Compared with other ways of separating bacteria, this method has certain advantages. This technology can improve the detection success rate of pathogenic Vibrio in samples, and the immunomagnetic bead technology can treat different microorganisms in different bacterial species. , And to a large extent improve the detection efficiency.\nAutomated instrument testing\nThe main use of immune automated analyzer, this technology was produced and used in 1970. With the development and progress of science and technology, automatic instrument detection technology is widely used, and it is very convenient to operate, it can save a lot of time, its degree of interference is small, it can save manpower and material input, and can also improve the accuracy of detection. In the current development process, the application of automatic enzyme immunoassay system is very extensive.\nIn the development process in recent years, bioluminescence technology is widely used, and it is a relatively rapid technology for detecting microorganisms. In active cells, ATP is its common energy metabolic product, which can provide the energy required during the physiological activities of cells. And, this technology can maintain a certain content within a certain range in the living body. The detection technology of Escherichia coli in food can adopt the method of fluorescence photometry, because the reason that the organism emits light is the role of luciferase, which produces the effect of light emission. The substance comes from the fireflies in North America and can catalyze the oxidation of fluorescein. However, the substance is unstable and can quickly decompose the fluorescence. In addition, the detection technology result acquisition process is very fast, and the device is easy to carry, very suitable for on-site detection.']"	['<urn:uuid:070ebfd7-ccdc-4c41-8ed2-347e4b160e94>', '<urn:uuid:d14e7f23-fa2b-4da3-ae78-b1c62096de48>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	11	54	2256
3	probable cause vs search warrant fourth amendment requirements difference compare	Both probable cause and search warrants are governed by the Fourth Amendment, but they have different requirements. Probable cause allows police to make warrantless arrests when they have reasonable belief that a crime has been or is about to be committed. In contrast, a search warrant requires police to present an affidavit to a judicial officer establishing probable cause, and must particularly describe the place to be searched and items to be seized.	"['Inherit the Wind. The Practice. The People vs. O.J. Simpson.Whether a trial is depicted in a movie, on television, or in real life, Americans cannot seem to turn away. From the crime itself, to the arrest, to the jury\'s verdict, Americans have been fascinated by the justice system.\nWhat rights can Americans claim if they are accused of crimes? The 4th, 5th, 6th, and 8th Amendments provide much of the constitutional basis of these rights.\nDue process means that laws must be applied fairly and equally to all people, especially to a citizen accused of a crime. The Constitution uses the phrase in the 5th and 14th Amendments, declaring that the government shall not deprive anyone of ""life, liberty, or property, without due process of law..."" The 5th Amendment protects people from actions of the federal government, and the 14th protects them from actions by state and local governments.\nThe purpose of the 4th Amendment is to deny the national government the authority to make general searches and seizures of property. A major issue over the years has been the interpretation of ""unreasonable"" searches and seizures. The rules can be complicated. They also change often, but the general principle is that searches are valid methods of enforcing law and order, but unreasonable searches are prohibited.\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\nOver the years, the Supreme Court has interpreted the 4th Amendment to allow the police to search the following:\nThe 5th Amendment requires that a citizen cannot be accused of a serious crime without a grand jury investigation. It also forbids double jeopardy — the act of bringing a person to trial a second time for the same crime.\nNo person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\nThe Fifth Amendment also grants the right to a defendant to refrain from testifying against himself or herself. Probably the most famous modern interpretation of this provision is the right to remain silent. The famous Miranda v. Arizona (1966) case required that individuals arrested for a crime must be advised of their right to remain silent and to have counsel present. This intended to prevent forced or involuntary confessions under police pressure. Although the Supreme Court had long held that involuntary confessions could not be used in federal courts, state courts did not always comply. Now local police departments must issue warnings known as ""Miranda Rights"" to people that they arrest.\nA very important principle related to the 4th and 5th Amendments is the exclusionary rule, which upholds the principle that evidence gathered illegally cannot be used in a trial.\nThe 6th Amendment guarantees that an individual accused of a crime has the right ""to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.""\nIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\nWhat is a person can\'t afford to have a lawyer for his or her defense? Until the 1963 ruling in Gideon v. Wainwright, many states did not ensure this right. Clarence Earl Gideon could not afford counsel when he went to trial for breaking into a poolroom in Bay Harbor, Florida. He was convicted and sent to prison, where he spent years researching his rights. Finally, he successfully petitioned the Supreme Court to hear his case, and they ruled in Gideon\'s favor, ensuring the right to counsel in state as well as federal courts.\nThe 8th Amendment prohibits ""cruel and unusual punishments,"" a concept rooted in English law. But again, what does the phrase really mean? By far, the most controversial issue that centers on the 8th Amendment is capital punishment, or the practice of issuing death sentences to those convicted of major crimes.\nExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\nIn general, states are allowed to pursue their own policies regarding capital punishment. The Supreme Court did not challenge the death penalty until 1972 in Furman v. Georgia. Even then, it did not judge capital punishment to be cruel and unusual punishment. It simply warned the states that the death penalty was to be carried out in a fair and consistent manner.\nRights of those accused of crimes are protected in other parts of the Constitution. For example, Article I affirms the right of a writ of habeas corpus, a court order that requires a judge to evaluate whether there is sufficient cause for keeping a person in jail. However, the most extensive protections are found in the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 8th Amendments.', 'POLICE LIMITATION ON THE POWER OF SEARCH AND ARREST 1\nPolice Limitation onthe Power of Search, Arrests, and Seizure\nWhile the United States’ Constitution enshrines the individuals’right to privacy and certain freedoms, the rights are not absolute.When justifiable, the federal and state law enforcement personnel areallowed to search one’s property, car, and premises for the purposeof finding and seizing any illegal, stolen goods as well as asubstance that constitutes evidence of the occurrence of a crime.However, while the law grants police officers the right to infringeon a person’s right to privacy and certain freedoms, it has a clearprovision on how this ought to be done. The Fourth Amendment securesindividuals in their persons, properties, and premises againstunreasonable seizures and searches. The Fourth Amendment provides thetwo conditions only under which the right to privacy may beinfringed. They include in the presence of a probable cause and insupport of affirmation or an oath that undertakes to describe theplace and the property to be searched and items to be seized. Thereare two types of searches or arrests with and without a warrant.\nOnly under two circumstances can an arrest, search and seizure berecognized as legal. The first case is when the police have probablecause. The presence of probable cause is a requisite that empowers apolice officer to make an arrest without a search warrant. Under theprobable cause rule, police officers must prove that it is morelikely than not that the individual or property to be searched isinvolved in one way or another in the commission of a crime. Onlyupon the fulfillment of this basic tenet can a search be termed asreasonable. According to the Legal Information Institute (2014), aprobable cause entails the police having a reasonable basis thatmakes them believe that either a crime has been or is about to becommitted. The Fourth Amendment enshrines the probable cause andrequires that police have reasonable grounds for conducting an arrestor search without a search warrant. According to the Legal StudiesInstitute (2014), the Supreme Court in the Illinois v. Gates made anattempt to clarify the definition of the term probable cause. Itdefined probable cause as the practical and factual consideration ofeveryday situations under which any prudent or reasonable man acts.It means that police officers can only utilize the probable causeexemption to the right to privacy as provided for in the FourthAmendment when an individual fails to act in the way any reasonableor prudent person ought to (United States Government PublishingOffice, 1992). The deviation from the normal by an individual givespolice officers the basis on which to arrest without a warrant. Under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, a search and anarrest warrant must be preceded by probable cause. The existence ornonexistence of probable cause is left entirely to the policeofficers` use of their discretionary powers. It is up to the policeofficers to interpret the current situation and make an informeddecision on whether it mandates them to make an arrest without anarrest warrant.\nPolice are limited when making arrests, searches, and seizures in theabsence of probable cause, as a warrantless arrest is invalid.Besides, the absence of a probable cause invalidating a search orarrest, it also results in the suppression of all evidence seizedfrom the suspect or their property. Under the exclusionary ruleestablished by the U.S Supreme Court in 1961 if a Court whenreviewing the circumstance under which the search was made comes to aconclusion that there was an unreasonable search involved, the seizedevidence under the same condition are rendered inadmissible in acourt of law (Legal information Institute, 2014). It means that ifthere is no other evidence available to sustain the case broughtagainst an individual whose person or property was searched, underthe exclusionary rule the person ought to be acquitted of all thecharges. According to Katz (1997), the exclusionary rule tends toelevate the protection of the individual`s privacy to a supreme levelwhile relegating the truth-determining role of a criminal trial tosecondary importance. The rationale behind the exclusionary rule isthat police officers are more likely to conduct reasonable searchesif they know that an improper search will result in an acquittal evenwhen the suspect is guilty. The doctrine of the probable causeapplies in the search warrant only when there is a high chance that asearch without a warrant will culminate in the discovery of pertinentevidence. However, even in a circumstance that may result in thepolice officers obtaining crucial evidence, they are required toconsider the option of getting a search warrant. It means that thereliance of a probable cause without a search warrant should only bea last resort when the latter cannot be sought due to timeconstraints.\nPolice officers are limited in the exercise of their power to arrest,search and seizure as they are required to obtain a search or arrestwarrant prior to them executing the above mandates. If there are noissues of the time constraints involved, police officers are requiredto present their suspicion of the existence of evidence or a crime ina certain property or premises to a judicial officer before they aregranted the right to search the same. According to Smith (2009), inthe Arizona v. Gant, the U.S Supreme Court held that police officersought to get a warrant to grant them the right to search a suspect’svehicle after detaining or arresting the suspect when a probablecause is missing. When seeking a search warrant, police officers areexpected to present an affidavit that supports their contention thatthey have sufficient and credible information that establish theexistence of a probable cause. However, unlike when civilians areinvolved, affidavit involving police are not elaborate as there is apresumption that law enforcement officers can be trusted to provideimpeccable information. Hence, the affidavit to support their requestfor a search warrant does not require the presence of an attorney asthe judicial officer can rely on their word of mouth. Additionally,police officer’s power to search is limited as they can only searchand seize items indicated on the search warrant. As previouslyindicated probable cause should precede a search warrant. Accordingto the United States Government Publishing Press (1992), the doctrineof particularity requires that a search warrant particularly describethe items to be seized. Thus, the rationale behind the policesearching and seizing only the things indicated in the search warrantis that they were unaware of the existence or involvement of otheritems in a crime before coming into contacts with them. It means thatpolice officers cannot go about collecting any items they find in theproperty in which they are executing a search warrant.\nIn conclusion, while police officers enjoy massive power when makingan arrest, search, and seizures, these powers are limited by theConstitution. By limiting, the Constitution states the scope or theextent in which law enforcement officers may execute a search,arrest, and seizure. For instance, the Fourth Amendment to the U.SConstitutions enshrines the right to privacy that forbids any searchon an individual’s person, property and premises unless in theexistence of a probable cause and oath or affirmation. It means thatthe police can only make an arrest or search when they have aprobable cause which is the belief that crime is more likely that notto have occurred and that the person or property being searched wasinvolved in one way or another. While the existence of a searchwarrant is the other acceptable way the police can execute a search,arrest, and seizure, it must be preceded by the probable cause. Therepercussion of infringement of the rules stipulated by theconstitution on what constitutes reasonable search results in thesuppression of the evidence collected under what is termed as theexclusionary rule.\nLegal Information Institute.

4	How do UEBA and QRadar track risky user activities?	Security analytics with UEBA monitors user behavior by using algorithms to uncover patterns and identify indicators of malicious activity, while QRadar's User Behavior Analytics dashboard provides a summary of user risk data and detailed insights around users and user risk through its UBA Overview page.	['No organization has a crystal ball and thus cannot predict the future, particularly where security threats are involved. However, by using security analytics tools like UEBA, your organization can better analyze security events and potentially detect a threat before it impacts your revenues or infrastructure.\nIn this page, we will walk through the term security analytics, define the benefits of this approach, examine use cases, and see how security big data analytics works.\nIn this page:\n- What is security analytics\n- Benefits of data analytics for security\n- Security analytics use cases\n- Security big data analytics\nWhat is Security Analytics?\nSecurity analytics is a proactive security approach that uses big data analytics and machine learning to gather, categorize and analyze data collected from network devices to detect advanced threats.\nThese solutions aggregate data from a myriad of sources like endpoint and user behavior data, business applications, external threat intelligence sources, and non-IT contextual data.\nMachine learning technology plays an important role in modern cybersecurity, allowing for near real-time data and threat analysis. Analysis of inputs including asset metadata, geolocation, threat intelligence, and IP content, can be used for rapid threat response and for forensic investigation.\nThe need for security analytics\nThe cybersecurity sector is growing due to advances in the techniques and tactics of cyber attackers, which can compromise a system in seconds and sometimes go undetected for months. Attacks are often difficult to detect because they happen quickly and the indicators can be dispersed across different data sources, such as network servers, endpoints, and applications.\nSecurity analytics provide organizations with visibility into complex attack techniques such as compromised credentials, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. Unlike traditional security tools, it helps with early detection of attackers through the analysis of user account activities for insider threat behaviors. Security analytics can also provide information back to the organization’s security ecosystem, allowing other systems to act on suspicious activities.\nBenefits of data analytics for security\nThe ability to analyze large amounts of data from various sources near real-time gives security analytics an advantage over traditional security approaches.\nSecurity analytics correlates events based on combined data from logs and other sources, in near real-time, detecting indicators of suspicious activity. The result is proactive security that helps organizations detect threats earlier in the attack chain and significantly improve response times.\nMaintaining regulatory compliance\nSecurity analytics assists with adherence to industry and government regulations such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR. It monitors access, authentication, and user behavior, helping with insider threat detection, and collects log data for auditing.\nThe platform reporting capabilities provide companies with a unified view of all data events helping compliance managers identify potential non-compliance.\nImproved forensic capabilities\nSecurity big data analytics are especially useful for forensic investigation. This tool provides information about the origin of an attack, how it happened, and the extent of the damage. By exposing the existing compromise, security teams can pinpoint when an attack may have started and build an accurate attack timeline.\nSecurity analytics use cases\nCybersecurity analytics have a multitude of use cases, from network monitoring to forensic investigation. Some of the most common use cases include:\n- Monitor employees to detect insider threats—monitors critical and sensitive systems and analyzes user actions for suspicious behavior, including monitoring privileged users through metadata, keystrokes, and forensics capabilities.\n- Analyze network traffic—correlates events and detects patterns that may indicate a potential attack.\n- Monitor user behavior to detect threats—the analytics platform utilizes user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) to profile suspicious behavior by using algorithms to uncover patterns and identify indicators of malicious activity in user behavior.\n- Identify endpoint threats—the platform uses endpoint threat detection to reveal attackers targeting the endpoints of an organization.\n- Detects data exfiltration—security analytics prevents the unauthorized download or copying of data by blocking unauthorized communication channels and stopping users from submitting their credentials to non-enterprise sites, thus preventing credential theft from phishing attacks.\n- Help you stay within compliance regulations—the platform helps your organization automate compliance requirements, such as log data collection, managing personal data flow, monitoring data activity, and compiling reports, enabling the compliance team to identify compliance violations.\nSecurity big data analytics\nToday, an organization’s data exists across a diverse set of assets, applications, and operating systems. Data volumes continue to increase, so security big data analytics are critical to understanding organizational risk.\nThe role of big data analytics in security\nBig data analytics uses advanced statistical and data science models to detect anomalies in real time for threat analysis. These solutions generate security alerts and combine them with additional forensic data to detect and respond to cyber threats. Big data analytics allow organizations to monitor for insider threats, triggering automated workflows should risky behaviors be detected.\nTo expose suspicious behavior, these tools use machine learning and data analysis to predict attacks and create baselines for what is a normal activity. Security teams are alerted to anomalous user behavior and can create timelines to fully understand the end-to-end impact.\nMachine learning in cybersecurity\nMachine learning involves training computers against data sets, allowing them to identify patterns. Security analytics uses machine learning, combined with additional data science-driven statistical modeling capabilities to identify both known and unknown patterns with a high degree of accuracy.\nThrough machine learning, advanced threat analysis can:\n- Create a baseline of normal activity to model anomalies. This applies both for user activity or for network traffic.\n- Analyze malware activities that escape antivirus detection to define if they are a threat or not.\n- Correlate historic data of intrusions and attacks to identify patterns and detect intrusions.\nStream data processing for real-time threat analysis\nStream data processing enables organizations to perform threat analysis near real-time, analyzing data as soon as it is available to identify threats earlier in the attack chain. Stream data processing integrates data from external sources, continuously generating dynamic data.\nThe use of security big data analytics and machine learning tools helps organizations identify suspicious activities, detect insider threats, and monitor user behavior near real-time. Security teams can thus keep up with the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, predict attacks, and stop cyber threats before they cause damage.\nWant to learn more about User and Entity Behavior Analytics?\nHave a look at these articles:\n- What UEBA Stands For (And a 5-Minute UEBA Primer)\n- What Is UEBA and Why It Should Be an Essential Part of Your Incident Response\n- Threat Detection and Response: How to Stay Ahead of Advanced Threats\n- User Behavior Analytics (UBA/UEBA): The Key to Uncovering Insider and Unknown Security Threats\n- Behavioral Profiling: The Foundation of Modern Security Analytics', 'IBM Security® QRadar® Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) helps security teams detect, prioritize and respond to threats across the enterprise.

5	forward contract spot forward parity explanation	Spot-forward parity describes the relationship between spot and forward prices of assets in a forward contract. For an asset that provides no income, the forward price (F) equals the spot price (S) multiplied by e^(rT), where r is the continuously compounded risk-free rate and T is time to maturity. This relationship exists because in a perfect capital market, buying the asset today and holding it should cost the same as buying a forward contract and taking delivery.	"['In finance, a forward contract or simply a forward is a non-standardized contract between two parties to buy or to sell an asset at a specified future time at a price agreed upon today, making it a type of derivative instrument. This is in contrast to a spot contract, which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset on its Spot Date, which may vary depending on the instrument, for example most of the FX contracts have Spot Date two business days from today.\nNote: the current usage of the term forward is inconsistent. Compared to the trade date, the spot date is already two days ahead in the future. There is no reasonable argument why two days ahead is not forward but three days is forward. A overnight date is before spot date, so consequently it should be called backward. Furthermore, some currency pairs (e.g. CAD and USD) trade spot as only one day after today, etc.\nThe party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future assumes a long position, and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future assumes a short position. The price agreed upon is called the delivery price, which is equal to the forward price at the time the contract is entered into.\nThe price of the underlying instrument, in whatever form, is paid before control of the instrument changes. This is one of the many forms of buy/sell orders where the time and date of trade is not the same as the value date where the securities themselves are exchanged.\nThe forward price of such a contract is commonly contrasted with the spot price, which is the price at which the asset changes hands on the spot date. The difference between the spot and the forward price is the forward premium or forward discount, generally considered in the form of a profit, or loss, by the purchasing party.\nForwards, like other derivative securities, can be used to hedge risk (typically currency or exchange rate risk), as a means of speculation, or to allow a party to take advantage of a quality of the underlying instrument which is time-sensitive.\nA closely related contract is a futures contract; they differ in certain respects. Forward contracts are very similar to futures contracts, except they are not exchange-traded, or defined on standardized assets. Forwards also typically have no interim partial settlements or ""true-ups"" in margin requirements like futures – such that the parties do not exchange additional property securing the party at gain and the entire unrealized gain or loss builds up while the contract is open. However, being traded over the counter (OTC), forward contracts specification can be customized and may include mark-to-market and daily margin calls. Hence, a forward contract arrangement might call for the loss party to pledge collateral or additional collateral to better secure the party at gain.[clarification needed] In other words, the terms of the forward contract will determine the collateral calls based upon certain ""trigger"" events relevant to a particular counterparty such as among other things, credit ratings, value of assets under management or redemptions over a specific time frame, e.g., quarterly, annually, etc.\n- 1 Payoffs\n- 2 How a forward contract works\n- 3 Example of how forward prices should be agreed upon\n- 4 Spot–forward parity\n- 5 Relationship between the forward price and the expected future spot price\n- 6 Rational pricing\n- 7 Theories of why a forward contract exists\n- 8 See also\n- 9 Footnotes\n- 10 References\n- 11 Further reading\nThe value of a forward position at maturity depends on the relationship between the delivery price () and the underlying price () at that time.\n- For a long position this payoff is:\n- For a short position, it is:\nSince the final value (at maturity) of a forward position depends on the spot price which will then be prevailing, this contract can be viewed, from a purely financial point of view, as ""a bet on the future spot price""\nLong forward payoff.png\nShort forward payoff.png\nHow a forward contract works\nSuppose that Bob wants to buy a house a year from now. At the same time, suppose that Andy currently owns a $100,000 house that he wishes to sell a year from now. Both parties could enter into a forward contract with each other. Suppose that they both agree on the sale price in one year\'s time of $104,000 (more below on why the sale price should be this amount). Andy and Bob have entered into a forward contract. Bob, because he is buying the underlying, is said to have entered a long forward contract. Conversely, Andy will have the short forward contract.\nAt the end of one year, suppose that the current market valuation of Andy\'s house is $110,000. Then, because Andy is obliged to sell to Bob for only $104,000, Bob will make a profit of $6,000. To see why this is so, one needs only to recognize that Bob can buy from Andy for $104,000 and immediately sell to the market for $110,000. Bob has made the difference in profit. In contrast, Andy has made a potential loss of $6,000, and an actual profit of $4,000.\nThe similar situation works among currency forwards, in which one party opens a forward contract to buy or sell a currency (ex. a contract to buy Canadian dollars) to expire/settle at a future date, as they do not wish to be exposed to exchange rate/currency risk over a period of time. As the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars fluctuates between the trade date and the earlier of the date at which the contract is closed or the expiration date, one party gains and the counterparty loses as one currency strengthens against the other. Sometimes, the buy forward is opened because the investor will actually need Canadian dollars at a future date such as to pay a debt owed that is denominated in Canadian dollars. Other times, the party opening a forward does so, not because they need Canadian dollars nor because they are hedging currency risk, but because they are speculating on the currency, expecting the exchange rate to move favorably to generate a gain on closing the contract.\nIn a currency forward, the notional amounts of currencies are specified (ex: a contract to buy $100 million Canadian dollars equivalent to, say $114.4 million USD at the current rate—these two amounts are called the notional amount(s)). While the notional amount or reference amount may be a large number, the cost or margin requirement to command or open such a contract is considerably less than that amount, which refers to the leverage created, which is typical in derivative contracts.\nExample of how forward prices should be agreed upon\nContinuing on the example above, suppose now that the initial price of Andy\'s house is $100,000 and that Bob enters into a forward contract to buy the house one year from today. But since Andy knows that he can immediately sell for $100,000 and place the proceeds in the bank, he wants to be compensated for the delayed sale. Suppose that the risk free rate of return R (the bank rate) for one year is 4%. Then the money in the bank would grow to $104,000, risk free. So Andy would want at least $104,000 one year from now for the contract to be worthwhile for him – the opportunity cost will be covered.\nFor liquid assets (""tradeables""), spot–forward parity provides the link between the spot market and the forward market. It describes the relationship between the spot and forward price of the underlying asset in a forward contract. While the overall effect can be described as the cost of carry, this effect can be broken down into different components, specifically whether the asset:\n- pays income, and if so whether this is on a discrete or continuous basis\n- incurs storage costs\n- is regarded as\n- an investment asset, i.e. an asset held primarily for investment purposes (e.g. gold, financial securities);\n- or a consumption asset, i.e. an asset held primarily for consumption (e.g. oil, iron ore etc.)\nFor an asset that provides no income, the relationship between the current forward () and spot () prices is\nwhere is the continuously compounded risk free rate of return, and T is the time to maturity. The intuition behind this result is that given you want to own the asset at time T, there should be no difference in a perfect capital market between buying the asset today and holding it and buying the forward contract and taking delivery. Thus, both approaches must cost the same in present value terms. For an arbitrage proof of why this is the case, see Rational pricing below.\nFor an asset that pays known income, the relationship becomes:\nwhere the present value of the discrete income at time , and is the continuously compounded dividend yield over the life of the contract. The intuition is that when an asset pays income, there is a benefit to holding the asset rather than the forward because you get to receive this income. Hence the income ( or ) must be subtracted to reflect this benefit. An example of an asset which pays discrete income might be a stock, and an example of an asset which pays a continuous yield might be a foreign currency or a stock index.\nFor investment assets which are commodities, such as gold and silver, storage costs must also be considered. Storage costs can be treated as \'negative income\', and like income can be discrete or continuous. Hence with storage costs, the relationship becomes:\nwhere the present value of the discrete storage cost at time , and is the continuously compounded storage cost where it is proportional to the price of the commodity, and is hence a \'negative yield\'. The intuition here is that because storage costs make the final price higher, we have to add them to the spot price.\nConsumption assets are typically raw material commodities which are used as a source of energy or in a production process, for example crude oil or iron ore. Users of these consumption commodities may feel that there is a benefit from physically holding the asset in inventory as opposed to holding a forward on the asset. These benefits include the ability to ""profit from"" (hedge against) temporary shortages and the ability to keep a production process running, and are referred to as the convenience yield. Thus, for consumption assets, the spot-forward relationship is:\n- Discrete storage costs:\n- Continuous storage costs:\nwhere is the convenience yield over the life of the contract. Since the convenience yield provides a benefit to the holder of the asset but not the holder of the forward, it can be modelled as a type of \'dividend yield\'. However, it is important to note that the convenience yield is a non cash item, but rather reflects the market\'s expectations concerning future availability of the commodity. If users have low inventories of the commodity, this implies a greater chance of shortage, which means a higher convenience yield. The opposite is true when high inventories exist.\nCost of carry\nThe relationship between the spot and forward price of an asset reflects the net cost of holding (or carrying) that asset relative to holding the forward. Thus, all of the costs and benefits above can be summarised as the cost of carry, . Hence,\nRelationship between the forward price and the expected future spot price\nThe market\'s opinion about what the spot price of an asset will be in the future is the expected future spot price. Hence, a key question is whether or not the current forward price actually predicts the respective spot price in the future. There are a number of different hypotheses which try to explain the relationship between the current forward price, and the expected future spot price, .\nThe economists John Maynard Keynes and John Hicks argued that in general, the natural hedgers of a commodity are those who wish to sell the commodity at a future point in time. Thus, hedgers will collectively hold a net short position in the forward market. The other side of these contracts are held by speculators, who must therefore hold a net long position. Hedgers are interested in reducing risk, and thus will accept losing money on their forward contracts. Speculators on the other hand, are interested in making a profit, and will hence only enter the contracts if they expect to make money. Thus, if speculators are holding a net long position, it must be the case that the expected future spot price is greater than the forward price.\nIn other words, the expected payoff to the speculator at maturity is:\n- , where is the delivery price at maturity\nThus, if the speculators expect to profit,\n- , as when they enter the contract\nThis market situation, where , is referred to as normal backwardation. Forward/futures prices converge with the spot price at maturity, as can be seen from the previous relationships by letting T go to 0 (see also basis); then normal backwardation implies that futures prices for a certain maturity are increasing over time. The opposite situation, where , is referred to as contango. Likewise, contango implies that futures prices for a certain maturity are falling over time.\nIf is the spot price of an asset at time , and is the continuously compounded rate, then the forward price at a future time must satisfy .\nTo prove this, suppose not. Then we have two possible cases.\nCase 1: Suppose that . Then an investor can execute the following trades at time :\n- go to the bank and get a loan with amount at the continuously compounded rate r;\n- with this money from the bank, buy one unit of asset for ;\n- enter into one short forward contract costing 0. A short forward contract means that the investor owes the counterparty the asset at time .\nThe initial cost of the trades at the initial time sum to zero.\nAt time the investor can reverse the trades that were executed at time . Specifically, and mirroring the trades 1., 2. and 3. the investor\n- \' repays the loan to the bank. The inflow to the investor is ;\n- \' settles the short forward contract by selling the asset for . The cash inflow to the investor is now because the buyer receives from the investor.\nThe sum of the inflows in 1.\' and 2.\' equals , which by hypothesis, is positive. This is an arbitrage profit. Consequently, and assuming that the non-arbitrage condition holds, we have a contradiction. This is called a cash and carry arbitrage because you ""carry"" the asset until maturity.\nCase 2: Suppose that . Then an investor can do the reverse of what he has done above in case 1. But if you look at the convenience yield page, you will see that if there are finite assets/inventory, the reverse cash and carry arbitrage is not always possible. It would depend on the elasticity of demand for forward contracts and such like.\nExtensions to the forward pricing formula\nSuppose that is the time value of cash flows X at the contract expiration time . The forward price is then given by the formula:\nThe cash flows can be in the form of dividends from the asset, or costs of maintaining the asset.\nIf these price relationships do not hold, there is an arbitrage opportunity for a riskless profit similar to that discussed above. One implication of this is that the presence of a forward market will force spot prices to reflect current expectations of future prices. As a result, the forward price for nonperishable commodities, securities or currency is no more a predictor of future price than the spot price is - the relationship between forward and spot prices is driven by interest rates. For perishable commodities, arbitrage does not have this\nThe above forward pricing formula can also be written as:\nWhere is the time t value of all cash flows over the life of the contract.\nFor more details about pricing, see forward price.\nTheories of why a forward contract exists\nAllaz and Vila (1993) suggest that there is also a strategic reason (in an imperfect competitive environment) for the existence of forward trading, that is, forward trading can be used even in a world without uncertainty. This is due to firms having Stackelberg incentives to anticipate their production through forward contracts.\n- Forward to forward contract\n- Futures contract\n- Derivative (finance)\n- Forward exchange market\n- Forward market\n- Forward price\n- Swap (finance)\n- 988 transaction\n- Non-deliverable forward\nOther types of trade contracts:\n- John C Hull, Options, Futures and Other Derivatives (6th edition), Prentice Hall: New Jersey, USA, 2006, 3\n- Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n- Forward Contract on Wikinvest\n- Gorton, Gary and K.

6	brain size neanderthal human cognitive ability relationship	Although Neanderthals and modern humans have overlapping brain size ranges, the internal organization of the brain is more important for cognitive abilities than absolute size. The distinctive globular shape in modern humans develops through a unique developmental phase after birth that is absent in Neanderthals. This affects key brain areas like the basal ganglia and cerebellum, which are involved in movement coordination, memory, attention, planning, and potentially language evolution.	"[""Neandertal genes influence brain development of modern humans\nDNA fragments from Neandertals in the human genome shed light on brain evolution\nA characteristic feature of modern humans is the unusually round skull and brain, in contrast to the elongated shape seen in other human species. An interdisciplinary research team, led by the Max Planck Institutes for Psycholinguistics and Evolutionary Anthropology, brought together fossil skull data, brain imaging and genomics. By studying Neandertal DNA fragments found in the genomes of living Europeans, the scientists have now discovered genes that influence this globular shape.\nModern human skulls have a unique ‘globular’ (round) shape. Our closest cousins, the long extinct Neandertals, had the elongated skulls that are typical of most primates. This striking shape difference is suspected to reflect evolutionary changes in the relative sizes of structures of the human brain, perhaps even in the ways that key brain areas are connected to each other. However, brain tissue doesn't itself fossilize, so the underlying biological explanation has remained elusive.\nAn international research team, led by paleoanthropologist Philipp Gunz from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and geneticists Simon Fisher and Amanda Tilot from the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics developed a new strategy to investigate this question. The team combined analysis of fossil skulls, ancient genome sequence data and brain imaging. “Our aim was to identify potential candidate genes and biological pathways that are related to brain globularity”, says Tilot. To tightly focus their search, they took advantage of the fact that living humans with European ancestry carry rare fragments of Neandertal DNA buried in their genomes, as a result of interbreeding between Neandertals and the ancestors of modern Europeans. Different people carry different fragments, which are scattered through the genome.\nEndocasts of fossil and modern skulls\nThe researchers first used computed tomographic scans of fossil Neandertal skulls and skulls of modern humans to make endocasts - virtual imprints of the interior of the braincase. They then developed a single measure of globularity, based on the differences in skull shape between humans and Neandertals. Next, the scientists teamed up with colleagues at the Radboud University, the University of Greifswald and UC Irvine, to determine the degree of globularity of thousands of healthy present-day humans, using data from magnetic resonance imaging. Although modern human brain and skull shapes are all clearly distinct from those of Neandertals, the scientists still found considerable differences in globularity among the participants. Finally, the researchers studied the genomes of around 4,500 of the participants to identify the fragments of Neandertal DNA that each person carried. Would any of these Neandertal DNA fragments influence brain globularity in their living human sample?\nThe team found Neandertal DNA fragments on chromosomes 1 and 18 that were associated with less globular (more elongated) brains. These fragments were associated with altered activity of two genes, UBR4 and PHLPP1, which are already known to play roles in important aspects of brain development (neurogenesis and myelination respectively). The strongest evidence for effects of these Neandertal DNA fragments on gene activity were in the putamen (in the basal ganglia) and the cerebellum. “The potential for links between evolutionary changes in brain globularity and mechanisms affecting the basal ganglia and cerebellum is intriguing”, says Gunz. Both structures receive direct input from the motor cortex and are involved in the preparation, learning, and coordination of movements. The basal ganglia also contribute to cognitive functions such as memory, attention, planning, skill learning, and potentially speech and language evolution.\nNo conclusions on cognitive skills\nThe authors stress that recent archaeological evidence has documented sophisticated symbolic behaviours in Neandertals that had previously been attributed exclusively to modern humans, such as the enigmatic structure built deep inside Bruniquel cave, and Neandertal cave-art from Iberia. As Gunz notes, “The focus of our study is on understanding the unusual brain shape of modern humans. These results cannot be used to make inferences about what Neandertals could or could not do”.\n“The effects of carrying these rare Neandertal DNA fragments are really subtle, but detectable due to the large sample size”, explains Fisher, adding “This is only our first glimpse of the molecular underpinnings of globularity. Like other aspects of brain structure, globularity is a trait that is likely to be influenced by the combined effects of many different genetic variants.”\nAccording to the research team, this discovery generates hypotheses that can be tested with new experiments, for example using human neuronal tissue that can be grown in the laboratory. Gunz and Fisher are now scaling-up the approach for investigations in larger samples such as the UK Biobank. They anticipate that future genome-wide screening studies will reveal additional genes associated with globularity, as well as indicate how this fascinating trait is linked to other aspects of human biology.\nAK, MS, SEF/PG"", 'November 9, 2010\nNeanderthal And Modern Human Brains Developed Differently\nWhether cognitive differences exist between modern humans and Neanderthals is the subject of contentious disputes in anthropology and archaeology. Because the brain size range of modern humans and Neanderthals overlap, many researchers previously assumed that the cognitive capabilities of these two species were similar. Among humans, however, the internal organization of the brain is more important for cognitive abilities than its absolute size is. The brain\'s internal organization depends on the tempo and mode of brain development.\nBased on detailed measurements of internal shape changes of the braincase during individual growth, a team of scientists from the MPI has shown that these are differences in the patterns of brain development between humans and Neanderthals during a critical phase for cognitive development.\nDiscussions about the cognitive abilities of fossil humans usually focus on material culture (e.g. the complexity of the stone tool production process) and endocranial volumes. ""The interpretation of the archaeological evidence remains controversial, and the brain-size ranges of Neanderthals and modern humans overlap,"" says Jean-Jacques Hublin, director of the Department of Human Evolution at the MPI-EVA in Leipzig where the research was conducted. Hublin adds, ""our findings show how biological differences between modern humans and Neanderthals may be linked to behavioral differences inferred from the archaeological record.""\nNature of the evidence: As the brain does not fossilize, for fossil skulls, only the imprints of the brain and its surrounding structures in the bone (so called ""endocasts"") can be studied. The researchers used state-of-the-art statistical methods to compare shape changes of virtual endocasts extracted from computed-tomographic scans. The distinct globular shape of the braincase of adult Homo sapiens is largely the result of a brain development phase that is not present in Neanderthals.\nOne of the key pieces of evidence was the skull reconstruction of a Neanderthal newborn. In 1914, a team of French archaeologists had excavated the skeleton of a Neanderthal baby at the rock shelter of Le Moustier in the Dordogne. The original bones of the skeleton had been lost to science for more than 90 years, until they were rediscovered among museum collections by Bruno Maureille and the museum staff. The restored original baby bones are now on permanent display at the MuseÃÂe National de PreÃÂhistoire in Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil. The museum\'s director Jean-Jacques Cleyet-Merle made it possible to scan the delicate fragments using a high-resolution computed-tomographic scanner (ÃµCT). Using computers at the Max Planck Institute\'s virtual reality lab in Leipzig, Philipp Gunz and Simon Neubauer then reconstructed the Neanderthal baby from the digital pieces, like in a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle. ""When we compare the skulls of a Neanderthal and a modern human newborn, the Neanderthal\'s face is already larger at the time of birth. However, most shape differences of the internal braincase develop after birth,"" explains Gunz. Both Neanderthals and modern human neonates have elongated braincases at the time of birth, but only modern human endocasts change to a more globular shape in the first year of life. Modern humans and Neanderthals therefore reach large adult brain sizes via different developmental pathways.\nIn a related study the same team of MPI researchers had previously shown that the developmental patterns of the brain were remarkably similar between chimpanzees and humans after the first year of life, but differed markedly directly after birth. ""We interpret those aspects of development that are shared between modern humans, Neanderthals, and chimpanzees as conserved,"" explains Simon Neubauer. ""This developmental pattern has probably not changed since the last common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans several million years ago."" In the first year of life, modern humans, but not Neanderthals, depart from this ancestral pattern of brain development.\nEstablishing when the species differences between Neanderthal and modern human adults emerge during development was critical for understanding whether differences in the pattern of brain development might underlie potential cognitive differences. As the differences between modern humans and Neanderthals are most prominent in the period directly after birth, they likely have implications for the neuronal and synaptic organization of the developing brain.\nThe development of cognitive abilities during individual growth is linked to the maturation of the underlying wiring pattern of the brain; around the time of birth, the neural circuitry is sparse in humans, and clinical studies have linked even subtle alterations in early brain development to changes in the neural wiring patterns that affect behavior and cognition. The connections between diverse brain regions that are established during this period in modern humans are important for higher-order social, emotional, and communication functions. It is therefore unlikely that Neanderthals saw the world as we do.\nThe new study shows that modern humans have a unique pattern of brain development after birth, which separates us from our closest relatives, the Neanderthals. This uniquely modern human pattern of early brain development is particularly interesting in light of the recent breakthroughs in the Neanderthal genome project. A comparison of Neanderthal and modern human genomes revealed several regions with strong evidence for positive selection within Homo sapiens, i.e. the selection occurred after the split between modern humans and Neanderthals. Three among these are likely to be critical for brain development, as they affect mental and cognitive development.\n""Our findings have two important implications,"" says Philipp Gunz. ""We have discovered differences in the patterns of brain development that might contribute to cognitive differences between modern humans and Neanderthals. Maybe more importantly, however, this discovery will tell us more about our own species than about Neanderthals; we hope that our findings will help to identify the function of some genes that show evidence for recent selection in modern humans.""\nPhilipp Gunz, Simon Neubauer, Bruno Maureille, and Jean-Jacques Hublin\nBrain development after birth differs between Neanderthals and modern humans.\nCurrent Biology, November 9, 2010\nA lost Neanderthal neonate found.\nNature (September 5, 2002) doi: 10.1038/419033a\nNeubauer, S, Gunz, P, and Hublin, JJ\nEndocranial shape changes during growth in chimpanzees and humans: a morphometric analysis of unique and shared aspects.\nJ Hum.

7	How do different penguin species in the Southern Hemisphere protect and care for their eggs when they're nesting?	Emperor penguins have a unique approach where they don't build nests at all - instead, the male balances the single egg on top of his feet for 62-67 days during incubation, forming a mobile 'nest' that allows them to move and huddle during severe winter storms. The male handles all incubation while the female returns to sea. In contrast, Fiordland penguins (tawaki) are very secretive nesters, placing their nests in caves, rock crevasses, under tree logs and roots, or in almost impenetrable vegetation, which may be an adaptation that developed in response to historical hunting by Maori.	['In the depths of the rainforests of New Zealand’s rugged Southwest breeds one of the world’s rarest penguin species – the Fiordland penguin. New Zealand Maori call it tawaki or sometimes pokotiwha. While the latter term translates to “gleaming head” owing to its conspicuous yellow crest, tawaki has a considerably more mythical ring to it.\nThe Maori names for most New Zealand bird species reflect their respective calls – such as kiwi, kea, kaka. While this is also true for the two other penguin species inhabiting the New Zealand mainland – the Yellow-eyed penguin or hoiho and the Little Penguin or kororā – the term tawaki originates from ancient legends.\nIn Maori mythology, Tawaki was a god that walked the earth in human form. Why Maori would name a small – it stands a mere 55cm tall – and rather cuddly penguin after a god may have many reasons. Legend has it that Tawaki’s fellow human beings did not realise he was a god until “he ascended a lofty hill, threw aside his vile garments and clothed himself in lightning“. Thinking about it one could certainly argue that the yellow crest makes for a convincing lightning costume.\nIt could also be that the notorious heavy rainfalls of the West Coast and Fiordland might have something to do with the naming: “In Maori myth, the god Tawaki caused the flood when he cracked the crystal floor of Heaven and sent the sky waters cascading downward.“\nTawaki inhabit the southwestern coast lines of New Zealand’s South Island as well as Stewart, Codfish and Solander Island in the South. The northernmost breeding colony is located at Heretaniwha Point at the western end of Bruce Bay in the central West Coast, while the last breeding pairs occupy nest sites around Port Pegasus at the southern tip of Stewart Island. The two extremes of the tawaki breeding range seperate less than 500km. However, the true coastline length tawaki have available for breeding is somewhere in the region of 1,500-2,000 km owing to the vast and deep fiord systems that riddle the aptly named Fiordland National Park.\nUnlike all other crested penguin species that breed in well-defined colonies with up to several thousand nests crammed into rather constrained areas, tawaki have evolved to be very secretive birds. Their nests are located in caves, rock crevasses, under tree logs and roots or almost impenetrable vegetation. This, combined with the fact that most of the areas they inhabit are very hard to reach, explains why we still know very little about the species.\nTawaki is presumed to be one of the rarest penguin species with current estimates of their population ranging between 2,500 and 3,000 breeding pairs; the population is suspected to undergo a continuos decline. However, the species’ preference to breed in extremly rugged and inaccessible terrain makes population counts a daunting task and more of a guesswork than a reliable assessment. So there could be more. But there could also be less.\nIn comparison to other penguin species, we know very little about tawaki. Only a handful of studies have been conducted in the past 40 years, the most comprehensive of which was carried out in the early 1970s. Most of what we know is limited to the birds’ breeding biology, their nesting behaviour and the threats they are facing.\nWell, there is a whole bunch of different threats that tawaki have to live with. Let’s start with the threat we know the most about: terrestrial predators.It is important to know that New Zealand is an island country that for millenia was dominated by birds. The only mammal that ever made it here were bats. This changed dramatically a few hundred years ago.\nWhen the Maori arrived in New Zealand, they became the biggest threat as they took tawaki for food; the species cryptic breeding behaviour might be a direct result of this. However, it was with the arrival of the pākehā – the white man – that it really turned southwards for tawaki. In the 1800s the European settlers brought with them a considerable array of four-legged beasts some of them as pets (cats & dogs), some of them to breed for their fur (stoats and possums), and some by accident (mice, rats). All of these sooner or later started to roam the land and migrate to the remotest areas of the New Zealand mainland, preying upon endemic bird species many of which had lost their ability to fly, like the Kiwi and Kakapo. And penguins.\nSaying this, the fact that Kakapo is quasi-extinct as a result of stoat predation while there still are penguins, shows that the latter must certainly be more resilient. The fact that penguins can be quite pesky when attacked probably works in their favour. But regardless it is quite clear that New Zealand birds would be better off without any terrestrial predators. What’s more, unlike the terrestrial birds that “only” have to deal with land-based threats, penguins have to cope with threats while out at sea.\nAnd these sea-based threats might be an euqally big, if not bigger problem for tawaki.\nFisheries bycatch – set nets\nThe industrialisation of fisheries in the 20th century brought with it an ever increasing amount of fishing gear in the water. Particularly, fisheries involving nets have become a substantial threat to seabirds. And in New Zealand, one particular type of fisheries starts to emerge as one of the worst things that can happen to penguins – set netting. Set nets consist of a single, stationary net wall that floats upright in the water column. Set nets can be brought out just below the surface, in mid-water or close to the seafloor. And while their main purpose is to catch fish, they are a lethal threat to any marine animal that gets entangled in them and more often than not drowns. Bycatch of marine mammals and seabirds in set nets is a serious problem in New Zealand and it is known that it causes significant mortality in Yellow-eyed penguins.\nTo which degree set netting impacts on tawaki we don’t know. On one hand, the observer programmes of this fisheries does not deliver reliable estimates of bycatch rates in the regions where penguins are affected. On the other hand, we don’t know anything about the foraging behaviour of tawaki, i.e. if their foraging grounds overlap with set netting regions, whether their diving behaviour makes them likely to end up in set nets.\nIn recent years, New Zealand policy makers have turned towards a more liberal approach to mining operations. This comes in several facets which potentially impact tawaki. On one hand, terrestrial mining interests along the West Coast are substantial. On the oher hand, oil exploration in New Zealand waters has become a hot topic and, again, the West Coast is an area of considerable interest.\nAll this means that tawaki might have to cope with run-off pollution from terrestrial mining operations as well as potential oil spills. But again, we have no clear information whether tawaki forage in current or future “pollution danger zones”.\nThe world’s oceans are getting warmer. This brings with it substantial change in marine ecosystems and decreasing oceanic productivity. Obviously these changes are likely to affect top marine predators such as tawaki. Yet, it does not need to be all doom and gloom. Despite the reasonably limited range of tawaki, the species inhabits immensly diverse marine habitats (more on that on the Project page). This might be an indication that tawaki are adaptable and able to adjust to new situations.\nHowever, this does not mean that everything is indeed peachy.\nFirst of all, we have no idea whether there is actually any truth to the idea that tawaki can somehow cope with ocean warming. And even if tawaki are super-flexible and can adapt to change, everything has its limit… and the more we know about such limits the more we can do to mitigate reaching this limit.\nAs mentioned before, we know very little about tawaki. And most of what we know about the species covers the terrestrial part of their biology. Yet as a penguin, tawaki spend most of their time at sea – and as such will be vulnerable to the multitude of sea-based threats like the ones discussed above but also threats we have no idea that they exist.\nThis is why the Tawaki Project sets out to find out what tawaki do while at sea, what affects them when they are in the water and how this impacts on their population in the long run.', 'Emperor penguins are superlative birds. The largest penguin, they are the only bird that breeds in the depths of the Antarctic winter, and they can dive deeper (500 m) and survive longer without eating (4 months) than any other bird. Emperor penguins are also the only bird species that breeds on ice, and one of the few birds that doesn’t build a nest – the male balances the egg on top of his feet. When combined with their stunning good looks and ridiculously cute chicks, it is little wonder that emperor penguins command so much attention.\nEmperor penguins are very large penguins that could only be confused with the related, smaller king penguin. They are dark silver-grey on the back, and white on the breast and belly. The diagnostic broad pale patch on the side of the neck is yellow in adults and dull white in juveniles. Adults have a black head and chin, while juveniles have a chin colour that may vary from white to dark grey. The slender, decurved bill has a pink stripe on the lower mandible (paler in juveniles). Recently fledged chicks are about half the size of adults.\nVoice: a powerful, klaxon-like bray.\nSimilar species: king penguin is smaller and more brightly coloured, with a relatively longer bill. The pale neck patch is narrower (spoon-shaped) and dark orange in adults. When swimming, king penguins have smaller, brighter neck patches that do not reach the water, compared to the larger paler neck patch of the emperor penguin that extends to the water line.\nDistribution and habitat\nEmperor penguins are characteristic and abundant denizens of the Antarctic pack-ice. The 46 known colonies are scattered around the entire Antarctic continent, with almost all colonies located on fast ice (sea ice attached to the land) close to permanent openings (polynyas) in the sea ice. These polynyas, maintained by winds or currents, allow breeding adults to access feeding grounds during incubation and chick-rearing, including when the sea ice is at its annual maximum extent. The world population was estimated at 595,000 breeding pairs in 2009.\nAdults are rarely seen beyond the pack-ice, which extends to about 60° S at its maximum extent south of New Zealand. Juveniles tracked by satellite after leaving their natal colonies have been found to swim well north of the pack-ice, up to 54° S. Vagrants have occurred up to 40-41° S off Argentina and New Zealand.\nNew Zealand records\nThe two New Zealand records are contrasting tales. A bird in adult plumage came ashore on Oreti Beach, Southland, on 5 April 1967, and was released without fanfare off Dog Island, Foveaux Strait, the following day. The second record was an immature bird ashore on Peka Peka Beach, Kapiti coast, 20-24 June 2011, before being taken into care following excessive consumption of sand. This bird became a media sensation (widely known as ‘Happy Feet’), and was eventually released north-east of Campbell Island on 4 September 2011.\nBehaviour and ecology\nThe emperor penguin takes the generic penguin feed-and-fast lifestyle to extremes. They lay down extensive subdermal body fat, providing both insulation and energy reserves. This fat allows them to survive weeks or months without feeding during courting, incubation, chick care, moult, and the often lengthy transit between the sea and breeding colonies. As a result, the body weight of emperor penguins fluctuates greatly between about 23 and 45 kg. Males can lose up to 45% of their bodyweight during the 4 months that they are continuously at the colony from the start of courtship (March-April) through to after the egg hatches (July-August).\nThe single large egg is incubated entirely by the male for 62-67 days, with the female returning to the sea for 2 months until soon after the egg hatches. The egg, and later the young chick, is balanced on its parents’ feet during brooding. This mobile ‘nest’ allows the adults to move around, including forming their famous huddles during severe mid-winter blizzards. Both parents feed the chick through to fledging in December, timed to occur as the sea-ice breaks up in summer.\nBreeding adults moult in January-February, with juveniles and non-breeders moulting in November-December, either at colonies or elsewhere on Antarctic continent and sea ice. They first breed when about 5 years old, and have a life span of at least 20 years.\nEmperor penguins mainly consume fish, also squid and krill, captured by pursuit diving. Dives are of up to 18 min duration, typically to depths of 50 metres, exceptionally to over 500 metres. Chicks are fed by regurgitation by both parents.\nFretwell, P.T.; LaRue, M.A.; Morin, P.; Kooyman, G.L., Wienecke, B.; Ratcliffe, N.; Fox, A.J.; Fleming, A.H.; Porter, C.; Trathan, P.N. 2012.

8	As a cultural anthropologist researching coming-of-age ceremonies, I'd like to know what exactly happens during the traditional teeth cutting ritual in Bali?	The teeth cutting ceremony is performed on both men and women when they reach maturity (marked by menstruation in women and voice changes in men). The ceremony involves trimming 6 teeth in the upper jaw - 4 incisors and 2 canines. This ritual symbolically eliminates six bad human traits: loba (greed), krodha (anger), kama (lust), moha (confusion), mada (drunkenness), and matsarya (jealousy).	['Bali is an island known as the island of the gods. It is one of the islands that is a tourist paradise that has a tourist attraction for both foreign tourists and local tourists. This is because the area has a very attractive beauty for tourists. The island community mostly embraces Hinduism. Not only the natural beauty which is amazing, but also the diversity of art and culture in Bali. This important point is more interesting to be known further by tourists. These are interesting culture in Bali that you could see while you are there.\n- The unique traditional clothes\nFamous Balinese traditional clothing seems very popular for foreign tourists. Some of them are even interested in wearing traditional Balinese clothes that do look attractive and bring different nuances to the wearer.\nOne of the traditional Balinese clothes for women who are still teenagers uses kemben songket, prada belt (sagen) to twist the hips and chest, as well as wastra cloth. For the inside of women’s clothing, there are tapih and sinjang fabrics. It is also coupled with the beauty of jewelry ornaments that adorn the head and hair of the woman’s bun.\nWhile Balinese cultural clothing for men, one of them is using udeg or headband, plus wearing a tie or umpal scarf, a wastra cloth, a cloth, and a keris ornament and shirt belt are added.\n- A lot of pura or temples as the place of worship\nPura is a place of worship for Hindus in Bali. In Bali alone there are thousands of temples in the city center to even remote areas. Thousands of these temples seemed to bring a spiritual atmosphere that was thick with Hinduism.\nSome temples are allowed to be seen and enjoyed by tourists but there are usually several rules that must be met. If you are around the temple you will feel the cool atmosphere that always decorates any temple, not to mention the activities of Balinese people who diligently visit temples to pray and to deliver offerings at the temple.\n- A number of awesome Bali Dances\nThe thing that should not be missed when visiting for a vacation in Bali is watching a Balinese dance performance that has been worldwide. Even a lot of tourists are willing to come to Bali just to study or want to watch Balinese dance by their own eyes.\nBalinese dance has its own uniqueness, even if each dance contains some moral messages to convey. Famous Balinese dances include Panji Semirang Dance, Pendet Dance, Condong Dance, Kecak Dance, and many more. If you feel interested in dancing Balinese dance, you can take part in one of the easy dances for you to follow, such as the Kecak dance which is quite easy to do.\n- The teeth cutting ceremony\nThe next interesting Balinese culture is the teeth cutting ceremony. A teeth-cutting ceremony must be done on women and men who have grown up which is marked by menstruation in women and an enlarged voice in men.\nUnlike its real name, this ceremony is only intended to describe or tidy up certain parts of the teeth. The teeth that were trimmed were 6 teeth in the upper jaw including 4 incisors and 2 canines left and right. The purpose of this ceremony is to eliminate the 6 bad traits that are usually possessed by humans namely loba (greedy), krodha (anger), kama (hawa nafsu), moha (confused), mada (drunk), and matsarya (envy).\n- Many stages of rituals must be completed on Balinese wedding ceremony\nAs with wedding ceremonies which usually involve many rituals to be carried out, as well as Balinese culture in weddings, the bride and groom must go through several things.\nSome of Balinese wedding traditions and rituals that must be passed include ceremonies ngekeb, mungkah lawang, madengen with, mewidhi widana, and mejauman ngabe typing pillows. All these rituals have deep meaning to teach prospective brides how to live in the household in the future, of course, accompanied by prayers to God so that prospective brides will always be blessed in their lives.\n- Rindik is the Balinese musical instrument\nDon’t think that Balinese culture does not have art in the form of musical instruments inherited from generation to generation. There are a lot of musical instruments as the result of Balinese culture. And the great thing is the music is still being preserved until now.\nOne of the most popular musical instruments with Balinese culture is the rindik musical instrument. This traditional musical instrument is made of bamboo which is salendro. Rindik can be played by 2 to 4 people. This musical instrument is often used to accompany joged bumbung dance performances and also for music at weddings.\n- Famous Musical Instruments in Indonesia\n- Traditional Music of Indonesia\n- Importance of Music in Indonesian Culture\n- Ngurek Ceremony mostly like a magic show in a real life\nNgurek ceremonies are almost like debus or magic shows which usually exist in East Java. In this ceremony, the perpetrators must insert sharp objects such as keris on their bodies without feeling pain and injury.\nForeign tourists will usually be attracted to this ceremony. This ceremony aims to convince people to believe in God Almighty. If someone has trusted and done all the commands of God they will get grace and also blessings from God.\n- Sacred Melasti Ceremony\nThe melasti ceremony is usually carried out before Nyepi Day by Hindus in Bali. This ceremony aims to be self-purification before doing Nyepi Day. You can see the procession of ceremony on the beach near Bali. Underline that you come several days before Nyepi day in Bali.\nThis ceremony is carried out by Hindus on the beach by praying and praying while asking God for forgiveness about their mistakes and mistakes. They believed that the melasti ceremony could erase their past sins and make them reborn in a holy state.\n- When galungan comes, penjor is everywhere\nOne culture that will be felt in Bali is the existence of penjor. Penjor is curved bamboo decorated with young coconut leaves and other unique ornaments. On Galungan Day, surely you will wonder why on every road, residential house, and office building is a pair of curved bamboos filled with decorations, aka Penjor.\nPenjor is interpreted as an expression of human gratitude for the welfare given by the Creator. So do not be surprised if the ingredients used to decorate penjor come from agricultural products. You wil see the road in Bali become more cheerfull when Galungan comes.\n- On Nyepi day Bali turns into dying island\nOn Nyepi day Bali will be pitch black without a single light, like an island dying without inhabitants. There is no activity during the Nyepi Holy Day of Saka New Year. This will certainly be an attraction for Balinese culture.\nOn the transitional day of the saka year, all residents confined themselves to their homes to carry out chess brata penyepian, namely four abstinence which included not doing activities / work (observing works), not turning on lights or fire (pati geni), not traveling (pati kelurahan ) and do not hold recreation, fun, or rah-rah (pati aksi).\n- Ngaben as the ritual of burning the corps\nOne of the interesting cultures in Bali is the “Ngaben” ceremony where the ritual of burning corpses is carried out. This ritual is a form of liberating the human soul to return to God as the Creator.\nNgaben in Bali also becomes very unique with the existence of replicas of the Meru and Oxen buildings included in the cremation procession. Even some of the Ngaben processions that were held were quite large by making Meru with dozens of meters high, as one of them in the Puri Ubud family environment often became the center of attention of tourists in Bali.\n- Hindu religious ceremonies are conducted almost every day in Bali\nIt is not wrong to call Bali as the Island of the Gods, because almost every day the Hindus people hold religious holy rituals. You will often meet Balinese women carrying offerings on their heads, listening to sacred songs from a number of temples around, and even seeing sesajen (offerings) decorating in front of their homes.\nThat is the culture in Hinduism in Bali. They love religion and culture so much that the tourists who visit come to feel the atmosphere of Balinese culture.\nAfter reading those lists, you must be curious enough to explore more about Balinese culture. Don’t worry since you can still follow those culture activities since the ceremony usually widely open for public tourists.']	['<urn:uuid:eef54064-2a72-4b29-9661-e8e010693949>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	22	62	1432
9	aging population challenges us solutions	The U.S. faces significant challenges with its aging population, as people 65 and older are expected to reach 19% (72.1 million) by 2030. To address this, communities are implementing various solutions. The AARP Network of Age-Friendly Communities promotes eight key domains: outdoor spaces, transportation, housing, social participation, respect and inclusion, civic participation, communication, and health services. Additionally, technological solutions are being developed, including sensor-based monitoring systems and smart home technologies that help seniors live independently. These solutions combine community-based support with innovative technology to create sustainable, health-promoting environments for older adults.	"['Ariel Skelley/Blend Images via Getty Images\nThe aging of the U.S. population is one of the greatest challenges facing our society.\nPeople age 65 and older represented 12.9 percent of the population in the year 2000 but are expected to grow to 19 percent of the population (72.1 million) by 2030. This demographic shift has widespread implications that will impact families, businesses, government, social services, public health, health care and the community at large.\nAs America’s population ages, it is becoming increasingly important for cities and communities to adapt to the needs of older adults. Making cities and communities age-friendly is one of the most effective responses to this demographic shift and prepares for the aging of subsequent generations.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), an age-friendly community is one in which services, settings, structures and policies support and enable older adults — and people with varying needs and capacities — to remain healthy, active and engaged. Also important is a commitment to creating physical and social environments that promote healthy aging and a positive quality of life for older citizens.\nAARP Network of Age-friendly Communities\nAARP’s age-friendly network helps promote well-designed, livable communities for people of all ages by working with communities throughout the U.S. to adopt safe, walkable streets; improve housing and transportation options; increase accessibility to key services and enhance opportunities for residents to participate in community activities.\nThe AARP program is focused on fostering health and sustaining economic growth in communities. To become a member of the network, a community must commit to a multiphase process of (1) planning, (2) implementation and evaluation and (3) a continual improvement of its age-friendly commitment through ongoing monitoring and evaluation.\nThe age-friendly initiative targets eight key domains that influence the health and quality of life of older adults. These “livability” domains are: (1) outdoor spaces and buildings, (2) transportation, (3) housing, (4) social participation, (5) respect and social inclusion, (6) civic participation and employment, (7) communication and information and (8) community support and health services.\nOpportunities And Benefits For Public Health\nThe AARP Network of Age-Friendly Communities offers state and local health departments a unique opportunity to build upon current public health efforts.\nSimilar to public health environmental change efforts, the age-friendly concept is built around a comprehensive, multifaceted, cross-sector approach that promotes policies and strategies for meaningful and sustained change. Many of these strategies closely align with public health efforts to promote active and healthy communities, but with a particular focus on the older population. Consequently, age-friendly community efforts provide a platform for furthering public health efforts, extending the reach and expanding synergies among initiatives at the community level.\nSpecific benefits include:\n- Increased opportunities to forge and expand upon partnerships with community groups: Potential partners could include local officials, city departments (e.g., public works, parks and recreation, transportation, etc.), community planners, business leaders, university faculty, community-based organizations, urban and rural development groups, neighborhood associations, Smart Growth and environmental groups, pedestrian and bicycling groups and aging services providers.\n- Enhanced coordination and impact of efforts: Similar to public health practices, age-friendly community efforts align programs, integrate planning and combine resources with AARP and other community partners, thus improving the capacity for sustainable policy and environmental changes.\n- Increased ability to bridge sectoral, geographical and political boundaries: The notion of including health in all policies can be advanced through more diverse cooperative partnerships.\n- Improved opportunity to engage community members, specifically older adults: Incorporating the views and needs of the community into efforts to promote development and healthy aging can help ensure success.\nAs part of the larger, global effort affiliated with WHO, participation in the AARP Network of Age-Friendly Communities can provide access to an international network of communities and partners, along with an increased availability of tools, resources and best practices for creating and maintaining age-friendly communities.\nWhat Public Health Brings to The Table\nIn addition to benefiting from involvement in age-friendly efforts, state and local health departments can contribute significantly to the AARP Network of Age-Friendly Communities program by bringing a public health perspective and expertise to the multiphase process localities must complete in order to become a member of the network. Examples include:\n- Serving as a key resource in the planning process by providing epidemiological and surveillance data to assess the health status of the community (particularly older residents) and enhance the ability of partners to accurately identify problems, gaps and needs.\n- Providing technical assistance and expertise in formulating policies and mobilizing partnerships to improve the age-friendliness and health of a community.\n- Conducting assessments and evaluation of the impact of proposed programs, policies or projects to the health of the community and older adults and providing practical information to decision makers as they consider various options.\n- Assisting with continuous improvements among members of the AARP Network of Age-Friendly Communities by routinely assessing the health status and needs of community members, linking older adults to community supports and health services and assisting with evaluation efforts to determine the effectiveness of implemented strategies.\n- Providing access to research on innovative strategies that improve the health and age-friendliness of communities through public health affiliations with academic and research institutions.\nLearn More About Livable Communities and Public Health\n— from ""5 Questions for Rose Gowen, M.D.""\nA Livable Lesson\nA major focus of public health is to help support and create livable communities. Numerous livable communities-related public health resources (including publications, assessment tools, tool kits, best practice models, strategic plans and training modules) are available online and from various organizations. Learn how to work with public health departments.\n— read ""How to Work with Public Health to Advance Livable Communities""', 'We have tested our monitoring and health alert system in TigerPlace, an aging in place facility near the University of Missouri campus in Columbia, MO and, more recently, in assisted living in Cedar Falls, IA. The proposed project will build on this work with an innovative, interactive healthcare service. The monitoring system with health alerts will be introduced into independent housing in Kansas City. A new interactive exercise coaching interface will connect a remote physical therapist to senior clients in the home. GENI-enabled networking will be incorporated to support interactive monitoring and coaching that operates in real-time.\nThis project is a collaboration between three different disciplines: Music, Engineering and Health Science. The long-term goal is to develop strategies for injury-prevention in undergraduate piano students. Common causes of injury among young pianists are: skeletal misalignment, excessive muscular tension and repetitive stress injury.\nThe general objective is to develop and test a prototype ACL Gold computer software utilizing the Microsoft Kinect motion sensor that includes a screening tool and intervention to help prevent ACL tears in female youth athletes. The program measures the knee abduction angle during specific jumping and cutting tasks.\nIn this project, we test the concept in senior housing in Cedar Falls, Iowa, using in-home sensors and remote video conferencing for the nurse care coordination. Fiber networking in Columbia and Cedar Falls will provide the bandwidth and latency essential for this approach. Previous system development is utilized and a new hydraulic bed sensor has been integrated. The sensor configuration also includes the team’s previous work with the Kinect depth images for extracting gait parameters of residents in the home.\nThe main goal of this work was to develop algorithms for early illness recognition in elderly. Early illness recognition (EIR) is important, as research has shown that results in better medical outcomes and a reduction in health care cost. We developed methodologies (see Figure 1) that link sensor data to the medical (nursing) records for monitoring the residents of TigerPlace, an aging in place community from Columbia, Missouri.\nHuman subject experiments will be conducted with college students and elderly participants to explore spatial descriptions in a fetch task; results will drive the development of robot algorithms, which will be evaluated using a similar set of assessment experiments in virtual and physical environments.\nBuilding on our current work, we propose to validate and deploy an innovative technological approach that automatically detects when falls have occurred or when the risk of falls is increasing. Subjects will not have to press buttons, pull cords or wear any devices. This new “passive” approach using sensors in the home could revolutionize detecting and preventing falls as well as measuring fall risk.\nWe leverage ongoing research at a unique local eldercare facility (TigerPlace) to study active sensing and fusion using vision and acoustic sensors for the continuous assessment of a resident’s risk of falling as well as the reliable detection of falls in the home environment. The project investigates the interplay between fall detection and fall risk assessment.\nEarly illness detection and recognition of small changes in health conditions are essential for early interventions when treatment is the most effective and when prevention of dramatic changes are still possible. We propose to develop a prospective innovative technological approach to early illness detection and chronic disease management using inexpensive sensors embedded in the environment.\nResearchers at the University of Missouri-Columbia and the University of Washington have established a multidisciplinary team comprised of researchers in computer science and engineering, nursing, and medical informatics dedicated to developing and evaluating technology to keep older adults functioning at higher levels and living independently. We have leveraged ongoing research at a unique local eldercare facility (TigerPlace) to study vision-based recognition methods for multi-person environments designed to capture continuous and automated assessments of older adults’ physical function.\nWe propose a carpet with pressure sensors distributed throughout the floor with an average of 10 sensors per square foot sheet; these will be incorporated onto flooring material such as carpeting, flexible tiles or linoleum. We will be able to “see” the person’s footsteps, assess their gait, and identify their location.\nOur objective is to explore new information technologies to assist the independent living of elderly people and enhance their quality of life at home, while utilizing the time and attention of caregivers and eldercare specialists in the highest efficiency.\nThe overall objective of our RAND/Harford Interdisciplinary Geriatric Health Care Research Center is to promote interdisciplinary research with a special focus on development of innovative clinical and health services interventions for older adults. We will impart to junior faculty and graduate students the needed attitudes, knowledge, and skills for conducting relevant interdisciplinary research related.\nThe dream of older Americans is to remain as active and independent as possible for as long as possible. They want to age in place, not in institutions like nursing homes. Recently, enabling technology in the form of low cost sensors, computers, and communications systems has become available, which with supportive health care services makes the dream of aging in place a reality.\nAmericans are living longer and more fulfilled lives, and they desire to live as independently as possible. But independent lifestyles come with risks. To address these issues, researchers are developing “smart home” technologies to help older adults remain independent at home while controlling costs. Smart homes enhance residents’ safety and monitor health conditions using sensors and other devices. Such technology can help keep older adults independent while controlling costs.']"	['<urn:uuid:a83f99e7-420e-43a3-9225-edf061f95f3e>', '<urn:uuid:fd21baa0-1e4b-4e90-bac9-d8c118e4f7a9>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	5	91	1856
10	What is the Jain concept of God and how does it relate to the idea of karma?	The Jain concept of God differs from other religions. While many religions believe in a God who created and maintains the world, Jains believe in godhood that can be attained by every soul. These enlightened beings are called Arihantas or Tirthankars - they are omnipotent and know everything about past, present and future. They have destroyed their inner enemies like anger, greed, ego and deception. According to Jainism, karma is an ethereal substance that accumulates around the soul through desire-driven actions. The Arihantas are free from major karmas and have achieved liberation from the cycle of births and deaths. They serve as spiritual guides helping others achieve liberation, though they did not create the universe, which Jains believe is eternal.	"['Rita: Sir many of my friends in school talk about God. Jesus is their God, Krishna is another God. Can you tell me something about our God?\nTeacher: Many religions say, ""God created the world. He maintains it. He controls it. He is very kind. He forgives us for our sins. He knows everything. He makes us happy. ""\nRita: Does Jainism say the same thing about God?\nTeacher: No, Jains have a different concept of God. It is not God, but godhood that can be attained by every soul. He/she who attains it, is omnipotent. He knows everything about all the past, present, and future at the same time. He is free from the four major Karmas. We call these great souls Arihantas. There have been many Arihantas. In present time cycle, there were twenty-four of them who set up the religious order afresh to help us cross the cycles of birth and death. They also re-establish the order of the Jain-Tirth formed of sadhus, sadhvis, male and female house holders and that is why they are also called Tirthankaras. The Jains worship them.\nRita: Did they create universe?\nTeacher: No, the world is a natural phenomena. It is eternal which means that it was here from the beginning of time and will be here forever.\nRita: Sir, what are some different names for them and who were they?\nTeacher: In Jainism they are called Tirthankars, Jinas, Vitrag, or Arihants. They lead us to the spiritual path and ultimately to liberation. Before renouncing their worldly life, some of them were kings, or princes, while others were ordinary people.\nIn Jainism we believe that every human, as well as any other living being has the potential to become perfect and omnipotent. But not all living beings may have this potential capability in this life.\nRita: Can we say then, that Lord Mahavira is a ""Jain God""?\nTeacher: Yes, Lord Mahavira is a ""Jain God"". There were twenty-three such ""Gods"" before him in this time cycle. However, they are really not called ""Gods"" in the sense of them being the creator of the world. We call them Tirthankars or Arihants.\nRita: Oh! Now I can tell my friends that Arihantas or Tirthankars are our Gods. Will you tell us more about Lord Arihantas?\nTeacher: Sure. You know that every name has a meaning. Kumud means ""lotus"", and Ravi means ""sun."" Similarly the word Arihant is made up of two words. They are ""Ari"" and ""Hant."" Ari means ""enemy"" and Hant means ""destroyer"". So Arihant literally means ""destroyer of enemies.""\nPayal: But, sir, the other day you said that Jains do not hurt anyone. Then how can our Lord Arihanta be a destroyer? I do not understand that.\nTeacher: Payal, you are right. As a Jain, we are not supposed to hurt or destroy anyone. An Arihant\'s enemies were not animals, bugs, or people like you and me. Arihantas did not have any enemies outside but they were from within.\nAmar: The enemies within!!!\nTeacher: Some times we get mad at friends, brothers, or sisters for very small matters. Sometimes we hide our toys when our friends come over to our house. We also cry at the mall when our parents don\'t let us buy toys. Some kids show off in their class and act as if they know everything. These tendencies may look good to us at that time, and we may consider ourselves smart, but those thoughts are evil tendencies and sooner or later, they are going to get us in trouble.\nThese tendencies are our wrong desires. They are not good. Since they stay within us, they are our inner enemies.\nShila, Does this make sense to you? Can our desires be our enemies?\nShila: Yes Sir, now it makes sense. I remember the other day when I got mad at my best friend, she stopped talking to me. A few days later, when I really needed her help to study for a test, she did not help me and I got a ""B"" on the test. Now I realize how getting mad caused me to get a ""B"".\nTeacher: Sunil, have you experienced this kind of trouble?\nSunil: Yes, one day my sister and I were by ourselves at home. My sister got hungry and wanted to order pizza. She did not have enough money, and I would not share any of my money with her. So she had to stay hungry. A few weeks later, our parents dropped us off at the mall to go shopping. While we were at a clothing store, I noticed a nice jacket that I wanted to buy. I checked the price, and I saw that I did not have enough money. I asked my sister, if she would let me borrow some money. She said ""No\' and reminded me about when she wanted to order pizza. I told myself, if I would have shared the money and not been so miserly, she would have given me money to buy that jacket. Later she said, ""Don\'t feel bad. I am not going to be like you, but remember that it is good to share."" Now I know that sharing is a very good idea.\nTeacher: Does anyone else want to say anything?\nHina: Yes sir, now I realize what our inner enemies are. We\nshould control our anger. We should not be greedy. We should not insult anyone. We should not deceive anyone. In other words, we should control our desires.\nTeacher: Yes, we should have total control of our desires, so that no matter what happens, we don\'t get mad, greedy, or arrogant.\nArihantas did not destroy people, animals, birds or bugs, but they destroyed their inner enemies like anger, greed, ego, and deception (AGED).\nAshish: Now I know who the Arihantas are. They destroyed their inner enemies, but I still do not understand why we call them gods?\nTeacher: Now, we are coming to the rest of the story. Once a person becomes an Arihanta, he/she knows everything and can perceive everything in the universe. He knows what is happening now, what will happen in the future and what has happened in the past at the same time. There is nothing that he does not know. He teaches us that we should be free from our inner desires. When we die, we are reborn as something else. When a Lord Arihanta dies, he/she becomes a Lord Siddha and is never born again. He is liberated from the worldly cycle of birth and death forever. That is why Lord Arihantas are called Gods.\nAshish: I still have one question. When we go to the temple our parents tell us to pray to the Gods. What are we supposed to pray to them?\nTeacher When we pray, our prayers admire the Jinas for being free from their inner desires. Our prayers should not wish for rewards, but should remind us how to live a good Jain life. We also pray to them for being our models. We must try to follow their footsteps in order to achieve the supreme goal of liberation.\n1) Do Jains believe in God?\n2) What do other religions say about their Gods?\n3) Do Jains believe God is the creator of the universe?\n4) What are some different names for Jain Gods?\n5) What does Arihanta mean?\n6) What are our inner enemies?\n7) Can anyone be an Arihanta?\n8) Who is a Lord Siddha?', ""The Truth About Karma\nWhat karma means\nKarma literally means what you do with your organs of actions (karmendriyas) such as your hands, feet, etc. However, actions are performed not only by your organs of action but also by your organs of perception (jnanendriyas), your mind, ego and intellect. In other words, your thoughts, intentions, emotions, attitudes, desires and attachments are also considered part of your karma. What this means is that whether you are asleep or awake, whether you are active or inactive, you accumulate karma and bind yourself to the cycle of births and deaths.\nTypes of karma\nYour karma is also of different types, which are listed below. They make the resolution of your karma even more difficult. Primarily there are two types of karma.\n1. Karma accumulated in the past\n2. Karma accumulating now\nThen, depending upon how it is spent or resolved, you can recognize some more\n1. Your past karma which is completely resolved and accounted for\n2. Your past karma which is bearing fruit now\n3. Your past karma which will bear fruit in future in the current life\n4. Your past karma which will bear fruit in the future lives\n5. Your present karma which will bear fruit in future in the current life\n6. Your present karma which will bear fruit in the future lives\n7. Your present karma which is bearing fruit immediately right now\nDepending upon the source, you can identify a few more\n1. Karma arising from your actions\n2. Karma arising from your inaction\n3. Karma arising from the actions of others for which you are the cause\n4. Karma arising from the random events or acts of God\n5. Karma arising from the collective actions of groups, communities and nations of which you are a part.\nFinally, depending upon the fruit it bears you can identify primarily four types of karma.\n1. Good karma arising from virtuous actions\n2. Bad karma arising from sinful actions\n3. Mixed karma arising from both good and bad inherent in your actions\n4. Neutral karma arising from selfless actions when you offer them to God\nKarma in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism\nKarma is central to these three traditions. The idea of karma is rooted in the Vedas. The early Upanishads such as the Brihadaranyaka and Chandogya Upanishads refer to the concept of karma and suggest that those who perform sacrifices and live virtuously go to ancestral heaven or achieve liberation in contrast to those who indulge in sinful actions, and neglect their duties. They go to the subterranean worlds from where they return and take birth as insects. In the Vedic tradition, karma originally meant all sacrificial actions. Later the scope of the meaning was extended to include all types of human actions that produced fruit. The Bhagavad-Gita identifies desire as the root cause of karma. In the true tradition of the Upanishads, it superimposes the concept of sacrifice upon the concept of karma and provides a practical solution to resolve the problem of karma. Desire ridden actions, both good and bad, bear karmic fruit. If actions are performed without desires and selfishness, they do not cause karma. If they are performed as an offering to God (as a sacrifice) it is even better. Hinduism also believes that you can neutralize karma with the grace of God, or your guru.\nBuddhism does not believe in soul or God in the traditional sense. It believes in the transience of all forms of life. Even gods are mortals, although their life span may extend to thousands of years or eons. In the end everyone has to decay and disintegrate, and everyone without any exception is subject to karma. Thus, unlike in Hinduism, Buddhism believes that the problem of karma cannot be resolved fully unless one attains liberation. Thus, whether you perform actions with desires or without desires, you cannot reverse the inexorable wheel of existence which moves forward relentlessly. You will escape from it only when you cease to exist as an individual and enter a state of emptiness or nothingness. Hinduism, Buddhism do not believe in grace alike. You may accumulate good karma by worshipping the Buddhas, the gods or the Boddhisattvas. Because of that merit you may attain higher states of consciousness (jhanas) in your meditation and succeed in neutralizing your past karmas. Whatever you may do, on their own, the gods will not neutralize them. However, like Hinduism, Buddhism recognizes desires as the root cause of karma and suggests right living on the Eightfold Path to resolve it. In both traditions, self-purification, practices such as virtuous conduct, self-control, concentration, meditation and self-absorption play a key role. Both traditions also hold that your karma is stored in your own consciousness as latent impressions and dominant desires and attitudes, which are carried forward to your next life.\nFundamentally, Jainism holds similar views about karma as Hinduism and Buddhism. However in Jainism karma is not a mere record of your actions. It is rather an ethereal substance, which accumulates around your soul or Self as you engage in desire-ridden actions. It is something like dirt, or a troublesome impurity that clogs your system and prevents you from being free. You can get rid of this impurity only through intense self-purification by performing severe austerities without any compromise.\nThus, these three traditions hold you accountable for your actions and make you the central cause of your life and destiny. Where gods, God or jinas play a role in neutralizing your past karma, again it is your actions and your initiative which prompts them to come to your help.\nTruths and misconceptions about karma\nThe following are a few misconceptions about karma\nKarma is not fate. Fate means what has been predetermined for you by forces other than yourself. Karma means what you have done intentionally and what consequences such actions produced. According to karma theory, you create your own fate. Gods or God would not create it. They merely decide your fate based upon your past actions. Whatever Acts of God or chance events that are part of your destiny are also produced by the collective karma you accumulate along with others.\nGods and karma: In Hinduism gods are not subject to karma because they are selfless beings who live and do their duties for the sake of upholding the creation. They participate in God's eternal duties (sanatana dharma) selflessly. Therefore, even if they indulge in emotional actions, they do not incur sin. So is the case with human beings who act like gods and live selflessly. In Buddhism, gods are subject to karma. Hence, the Buddha suggested that one should not strive to take birth in heavens but try to achieve liberation.\nKarma is not mere actions. Karma means actions having consequences performed out of desires or intentions. Such desires and intentions may be good or bad, and both will lead to karma. Since it is virtually impossible to avoid negative karma by performing only good actions or by avoiding actions themselves, you must resolve it only by overcoming desires.\nKarma is not about to do good or bad. Both types of actions lead to bondage. That is the theme. Good actions ensure you a place in heaven. Bad actions lead to one's spiritual downfall into lowest hells. What is important is you have to transcend both good and bad actions by transcending desires themselves. For that you have to control your desires and passions and practice detachment, dispassion, detachment and sameness.\nYour karma is not recorded in heaven or hell. A memory print of your past is hidden deep within your own consciousness. It contains memories of all your past lives. You cannot access it normally, but you may at times tap into it in deep meditative states. This memory print, often described as latent impressions (samskaras) remains in your consciousness, until you burn them all through intense self-purification. This memory print is your password or your ID-card for entry into higher or lower worlds.\nSuggestions for Further Reading\n- What Karma means?\n- What is Karma in Hinduism?\n- Karma or Kamma In Buddhism\n- Kamma and its fruit\n- Study guide on Kamma or karma\n- Jainism and the Concept of Karma\n- The Bhagavadgita on Karma, the Law of Actions\n- Principles and practice of karma yoga\n- Karma Yoga, the Yoga of Action\n- Lessons from the Dance of Kali, the Mother Nature\n- Letting your God live in You - The True Essence of the Hindu Way of Life\n- prajnanam brahma - Brahman is Intelligence\n- Maslow's Hierarchy Of Needs From The Perspective Of Hinduism\n- The Defintion and Concept of Maya in Hinduism\n- The Meaning of Nirvana\n- Self-knowledge, Difficulties in Knowing Yourself\n- Hinduism - Sex and Gurus\n- The Construction of Hinduism\n- The Meaning and Significance of Heart in Hinduism\n- The Origin and Significance of the Epic Mahabharata\n- The True Meaning of Prakriti in Hinduism\n- Three Myths about Hinduism\n- What is Your Notion of God?\n- Why Hinduism is a Preferred Choice for Educated Hindus""]"	['<urn:uuid:287ecc5b-6778-4b7f-9bd4-12f5252df86c>', '<urn:uuid:af12ab5f-5c38-4698-b9b2-9857cc01f431>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	17	120	2767
11	What are my responsibilities as a homeowner when building or renovating my house to make sure everything is done legally?	As a homeowner, you are ultimately responsible under the Building Act if your house doesn't meet required standards, even if you delegate tasks to others. All building work must comply with the Building Code, and you need to get a building consent from your local council before starting construction (unless the work is exempt). When employing professionals, your registered architect or designer must prepare plans that meet Building Code performance standards, and your builder must construct according to the approved specifications and plans. While you can choose to exceed minimum performance levels, you must at least meet the minimum standards for strength, durability, weatherproofing, fire resistance, and energy efficiency as specified in the Building Code. It's important to employ skilled people who know all building controls and stay current with new standards and rules.	"[""What the owners of residential buildings are responsible for under the building laws, and what work is exempt.\nCompliance with the Building Act\nUnder the Building Act, all building work must comply with the Building Code.\nIf you are planning on building a new house or doing alterations, you have to get a building consent from your local council before construction starts (unless it is work that is exempt).\nTo help explain the building consent and approval process, the Department of Building and Housing has produced a booklet entitled The Building Act and You, which contains essential information about your rights and responsibilities as you build or renovate. It tells you what you need to do at each step to ensure your building project is done legally, which will avoid potentially costly mistakes or delays. It also explains how the law will protect you if things don't go to plan.\nBuilding Consent Authorities (BCAs) look at the detailed plans drawn by the registered architect or designer to see if the proposed house or building work complies with the Building Code. If it does comply, the BCA will issue you with a building consent allowing the work to proceed. When the house is finished, you apply to your BCA. The BCA conducts a final inspection and issues a code compliance certificate (CCC) if it is satisfied that the building work complies with the building consent.\nYou must apply for a CCC once the work is complete. If you do not apply within two years from the date your consent is granted, your BCA should contact you to follow up on the work.\nCouncils are required by the Building Act 2004 to keep information for the life of any building. This information will include the plans and specifications provided when applying for building consent, inspection reports by BCAs, and code compliance certificates.\nThis information can be researched, for example, when you are looking to buy an existing house.\nWho is responsible?\nMost people use the expertise of those in the building industry to advise them on the legal requirements of the building laws and many delegate the task of obtaining a building consent to their architect/designer, builder or project manager.\nWhen you employ a registered architect or other type of designer, they must prepare plans and specifications that meet the Building Code performance standards or the building consent application won’t be approved by your BCA. The builder then has to build the house to the specifications and plans so that the end result matches what was approved in the building consent.\nUltimately you will be responsible under the Building Act if your house does not meet the required standards, so make sure you employ skilled people who know all the building controls and keep up-to-date with new standards and rules.\nMeeting minimum performance levels\nSubject to planning and resource management requirements, no one can make you achieve a higher or more restrictive standard than that which is required by the Building Code. In other words, when you are building a house or doing some other building work around home, provided it meets the minimum performance levels in the Building Code, you can be confident that your home will be sufficiently strong, durable, weatherproof, fire-resistant and use energy relatively efficiently. You must build the house to the specifications agreed in your approved consent.\nHowever, there is nothing to stop you exceeding these performance levels if you choose. For example, you can use concrete tile roofing that exceeds the minimum standards and is likely to outlast you and your grandchildren. You are free to look for creative and innovative ways of adding features that improve your comfort and enjoyment of the house, providing they at least meet the minimum performance levels in the Building Code, and are checked as doing so through the building consent process.\nWhat work is exempt?\nGenerally, only work specified in Schedule 1 of the Building Act 2004 is exempt from needing a building consent. Amendments to the Schedule came into effect on 16 October 2008.\nThe Department of Building and Housing has a useful guide back-grounding the exemptions (http://www.dbh.govt.nz/UserFiles/File/Publications/Building/Guidance-information/pdf/guide-to-exemptions.pdf).\nSome common examples are:\n- Retaining walls up to 1.5 metres in height, providing they are not carrying any load other than the ground.\n- Construction, alteration or removal of an internal wall of an existing building but only if structural stability is not reduced, the means of fire escape is not affected or the wall is not made of bricks, concrete blocks mortared together.\n- Fences up to two metres in height (other than fences around swimming pools).\n- Garden sheds that are less than one storey and less than 10 square metres in floor area which do not sanitary facilities or facilities for the storage of drinking water, and are not positioned any closer than the shed's own height to a boundary.\n- Closing in an existing veranda or patio where the floor area does not exceed five square metres.\n- Low platforms (deck) not more than one metre off the ground.\n- Repairing or replacing part or all of a single story privately owned outbuilding.\nNote that building work that is exempt from requiring a building consent must still comply with the Building Code.\nIf you are unsure, check the full version of Schedule 1 of the Building Act and ask your local council before doing any work as each of these examples may have certain limits and definitions.\nYour local council may grant additional exemptions if they consider the work is likely to be carried out to the Building Code or, if not, is unlikely to endanger people or buildings.""]"	['<urn:uuid:db16d22e-20d6-49ee-a452-9f091ebe5cb2>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	20	134	944
12	What roles do expertise and practice frequency play?	Regarding expertise, the documents challenge the notion that experts are repositories of meaning, particularly in music fields where experts often claim privileged access to meaning through their specialized knowledge. As for practice frequency, studies on Tai Chi show varying recommendations - some programs demonstrated benefits with three 35-minute sessions per week for 12 weeks, while others found improvements with more intensive schedules like 90-minute sessions six days per week for eight weeks. The optimal frequency remains unclear, as studies used different protocols with varying results, though most showed positive outcomes when practiced regularly.	"['Posted by Luana Life, Marketing Coordinator\nIn this post, Allan Moore shares his thoughts on the publishing process—from germ to publication—of his book Song Means: Analysing and Interpreting Recorded Popular Song.\nSong Means was some ten years in the writing. It had its roots in my undergraduate music studies, where the requirement to ‘analyse’ a piece did not seem to me adequately answered, even then, by simple parsing of harmonies and description of form. The list of questions I generated in order to get further into a piece eventually, after much experience of teaching analysis, and notwithstanding the shift of application to a popular music repertoire, became the germ which generated the book, and which, in its latest guise, appears as the book’s final chapter. The success I had in teaching through this interrogative method encouraged me to want to share it with the community of readers: my first aim in writing the book was not, then, to contribute to the field as much as to contribute to the potential understanding of listeners. The serious consideration of listeners, however, is not something that musicology is very good at, while the serious consideration of what listeners listen to is not something that popular music studies excels in. As I wrote the book, then, I realized I had the potential opportunity to intervene in two distinct fields. Reviews and citations of the book suggest to me that this aim may come to be realized, although it is still a little too early (the book has been out less than three years) to tell. And, surprisingly, nobody has yet taken me to task for what, from my vantage-point, is the book’s particularly glaring omission, something I shall have to fill if it ever goes to a second edition.\nI continue this binary for a moment, for there is a yet more important point to make: musicology, as a whole, regards popular music as musically too simplistic to bother with; popular music studies, as a whole, regards popular music as culturally too important to approach with techniques which risk charges of dread formalism. In both fields, experts tend to ground their expertise in the privileged access they believe this gives them to the music’s meaning. My other key intention was to argue, and provide a methodology to underpin the position that, whatever else experts are, they are not repositories of meaning.\nI am fortunate indeed to have gained much experience in academic writing, which meant I was able to approach this book in a very different way to that which I used to approach my earliest books. If as an author you believe in what you are writing, then while you should seek guidance both before you start, and in rewriting once you have finished various drafts, I believe it is crucial that you do not seek guidance while you are writing, if your writing is in any way to be described as the result of a creative process. For this book, I was able to manoeuvre my other research activities and commitments such that I wrote a full, detailed, draft of the book before writing the proposal. This meant that the proposal had a convincing level of depth, which is missing from many book proposals I have seen. Since the job of the proposal is to convince publishers that they need to take on a book, the more fully formed your ideas are, the more they have been tried out (on the page, at least), the more committed you should be able to make your proposal. If you can so organize your time, I think this is far preferable to the practice of writing a proposal and a couple of draft chapters and hoping you can fulfil their potential later on if called upon to do so.\nThe idea of writing being ‘enjoyable’ is something I find utterly strange! Writing is difficult, it’s a chore, and there are always innumerable things I would rather be doing. When I say ‘writing’ in this sense, I guess I mean inventing adequate words to put on paper in the first place. It is a completely different process to going through and re-writing, which I find inexplicably engaging and enjoyable. Sometimes my first pass has to be to put down any old rubbish, because it can always be improved on (you should have seen the way this paragraph first looked…). I must admit, though, I also find the process of relating my ideas to the music I hear to be fascinating, whichever actually comes first. And to be able to listen, to just about anything I choose to listen to, because I can eventually justify it as ‘work’, feels like the most extreme luck. I hope it doesn’t run out quite yet.\nAllan F. Moore 2015\nAbout the Author: Allan F. Moore is Professor of Popular Music at the University of Surrey. Author of seven monographs and edited collections, he is series editor for Ashgate’s Library of Essays in Popular Music, has been on the editorial board of Popular Music since 2000, and was founding co-editor of twentieth-century music. He has published nearly 100 articles and reviews in the field.\n‘Song Means is an astonishing achievement, and an exceptionally important book. Drawing on more than 20 years of his own writing on popular music, but synthesising and developing it in a quite remarkable way, Allan Moore accomplishes what seems almost impossible: a completely engaging, beautifully clear, authoritative, and undogmatic account of musical meaning across a huge range of pop songs. Written in direct, accessible and uncomplicated language, but tackling fundamental questions of musical meaning and the nature of musical materials, the book is rooted in Moore’s own encyclopaedic knowledge of popular music set in a sophisticated conceptual framework. This is a landmark in the musicology of pop, and a book that will have a profound impact on how people think about, and understand, the most globally pervasive form of music of our times: the pop song.’ Eric F.

O'Mathúna, PhD, Dr. O'Mathúna is a lecturer in Health Care Ethics, School of Nursing, Dublin City University, Ireland; he reports no consultant, stockholder, speaker's bureau, research, or other financial relationships with companies having ties to this field of study.\nPart 2 of a Series on Tai Chi: Risk of Falling as Outcome\nTai chi is increasingly being used in fall prevention programs, especially with the elderly. Part 1 of this article described tai chi in some detail and reviewed research studies involving the practice where the incidence of falls was the primary outcome. The review found a relatively small number of studies, which were generally supportive of tai chi as a program to reduce falls in those living in the community. Another group of studies have measured outcomes regarded as indicators of a person's risk of falling. These studies will be the focus of this article.\nFear of Falling\nIn addition to physical injury, falls can lead the elderly to become afraid of falling. Approximately half of the elderly living in the community experience such fear of falling, although it can have a variety of sources.1 This fear can lead to a debilitating spiral of loss of confidence, reduced physical activity and social involvement, more falls, further frailty, and loss of independence. Tai chi is one of several interventions that has been evaluated to determine if it reduces fear of falling, which may be taken as a predictor of reduced falling. A 2007 systematic review of these interventions identified 12 high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs), of which three evaluated tai chi.1\nTwo of these studies also measured the number of falls and were reviewed in more detail in Part 1.2,3 Both were carried out with older people living in the community. The number of falls, and the fear of falling, was reduced significantly in both. A third study in this area randomly assigned 49 people, older than age 60 who lived in the community, to either a tai chi or control group.4 Those assigned to the control group were asked to make no changes in their physical activity and did not meet together except when outcomes were being measured. Tai chi was practiced as a group for one hour daily for eight weeks. If participants could not attend the group session they were asked to conduct a 30-minute session at home. On average, subjects participated in 35 hours of tai chi over the eight weeks. Using the Falls Efficacy Scale, those in the tai chi group had significant improvements in their fear of falling compared to the control group (P = 0.006). The authors noted that their study design did not allow determination of whether the benefit may have arisen at least in part from the regular social interaction in the tai chi group.\nImpaired balance has been identified as a major intrinsic factor contributing to falls among the elderly.5 Beginning in the 1990s, a number of cross-sectional studies showed that tai chi practitioners exhibited less swaying and had better balance than matched controls who did not practice tai chi.6 However, many of these studies were conducted using younger and middle-aged adults, not older adults.7 Also, since these were cross-sectional studies, differences could have existed prior to training in tai chi.\nOne trial found no correlation between balance performance and number of years of tai chi experience.5 Therefore, an RCT was conducted with 49 community-dwelling older people (average age 69 years) who had no experience with tai chi.5 Those in the intervention group undertook 90 minutes of tai chi together, six days a week for eight weeks. Those in the control group met together for a general education program that lasted the same length of time. Using two validated balance measures, the tai chi group had significantly better balance at four weeks, eight weeks, and four weeks after the intervention stopped. Their scores on these tests were similar to those recorded by experienced tai chi practitioners, suggesting that the benefits of tai chi for balance can be achieved within four weeks.\nOne of the studies reviewed in Part 1 found fewer falls after tai chi training than with exercise training, and also showed improved balance.3 Regression analysis found that those participants who improved their balance were also significantly less likely to fall in the subsequent six months. In addition, the study of fear of falling in 49 older community dwellers described above found significant improvements in one-leg balancing among those in the tai chi group (P < 0.001).4 Another RCT involved 49 elderly men with osteopenia or osteoporosis.8 The community-dwelling men (aged 60-82 years) were randomly assigned to a non-intervention control or 18 weeks of tai chi practiced for 45 minutes, twice a week. Significant improvements in balance were found for the tai chi group while no changes were found in the control group.\nIn contrast, another study randomly assigned 180 community-dwelling elderly people (aged 65-74 years) to one of three groups.9 One group engaged in tai chi, another performed resistance exercises, and the third had no intervention. The exercise sessions were conducted three times per week for one year. No significant differences were found between the groups with respect to balance, flexibility, muscle strength, or number of falls. Among women in the study, those in the tai chi and exercise groups had significantly less loss of bone mineral density than women in the control group (P < 0.05).\nYet another study showed that after one hour of tai chi, three times weekly for 12 weeks, 39 older people (average age 65 years) had improvements on a battery of tests measuring balance, muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility.10 However, no control group was used in this particular study.\nTwo of the RCTs described above that found a reduced incidence of falls also measured physical functioning. The earlier RCT involved 200 participants and conducted several measurements of muscle strength, flexibility, cardiovascular endurance, and body composition.2 Few statistically significant differences were found, except that those in the tai chi group had less loss of grip strength and greater lower extremity range of motion than the control group. The other RCT found significantly greater improvements in trunk flexibility among those in the tai chi group compared to the control group (P < 0.001).\nA quasi-controlled study randomly assigned two long-term care facilities to be either the tai chi or control site.11 A total of 68 residents participated. Tai chi classes were taught three times per week for 35 minutes for 12 weeks at one site, while the control site received no exercise intervention. The number of falls did not differ between the sites, but outcomes for muscle strength, flexibility, balance, and mobility were significantly better in the tai chi group compared to control (P < 0.001).\nNo adverse effects of tai chi were reported in the studies reviewed here.\nThe first part of this review examined the small number of existing studies evaluating tai chi in the elderly, and generally found tai chi reduced the incidence of falls among community-dwelling adults. The studies examined here of risk factors for falls lend further support to the conclusion that tai chi is beneficial. The total number of studies remains small, however, and much heterogeneity exists in study design and outcomes measured. Much variety exists in the tai chi protocols and frequency of practice, with little consensus regarding the schedule needed for beneficial or optimal effects. Further research is needed before firm recommendations can be offered, but the indications are that tai chi is useful in helping to reduce falls and risk of falls.\nTai chi training may be of benefit in helping prevent falls in elderly people living in the community. Less evidence is available to support the use of tai chi for those who are more frail or reside in nursing homes.\nTai chi programs vary considerably in duration and rigor; therefore, they should be approached carefully and the intensity increased gradually. As with any exercise program, individualized medical advice should be sought before commencing, and any changes carefully monitored.\nPeople should remain alert to any symptoms that indicate overexertion. Keeping such cautions in mind, regular practice of tai chi may help improve balance and physical functioning, and thus contribute to reducing the incidence of falls and fear of falling.\n1.

13	I'm growing apples in my backyard and want to feed the whole fruits to my chickens, but I'm worried about the seeds being poisonous since they contain cyanide. How dangerous are apple seeds compared to other foods that contain cyanide like almonds?	While it's true that both apple seeds and almonds contain cyanide compounds, they pose different levels of risk. Almonds, particularly bitter almonds, are extremely poisonous if not heat-treated and are actually illegal to sell unprocessed in many countries due to their high cyanide content. In contrast, apple seeds contain such a small amount of cyanide that they're completely safe for chickens - a chicken would need to eat over 500 apple seeds in one sitting for it to be toxic. The cyanide doesn't build up over time and is quickly removed by the liver and kidney. This is similar to many other common seeds like sunflower, courgette, cucumber and squash seeds, which also contain small, safe amounts of similar compounds.	"['Everyday we chow down on food produced from plants that carry deadly poisons. Most of the time we don’t need to be concerned with this as the mass production of fruit and vegetables ensures that we are usually safe, but from time to time people accidentally kill themselves by unwittingly eating the wrong part of a plant. In order to ensure that this never happens to you, I have put together a list of the most commonly seen poisons that we come in to contact with in our kitchens.\n10. Cassava (Yuca)\nThough not too widely used in the United States, cassava is a woody shrub that is generally found in the Caribbean and South America. When using cassava, it can either be made to be sweet or bitter. The taste, as well as the smell, all depends on the amount of cyanogenic glucosides, which are in fact, extremely poisonous. Most who prepare it like it to be bitter, as it keeps away insects and even animals. If cassava is prepared incorrectly, it can be deadly. Cassava poisoning, due to high levels of cyanide, is known as Konzo. Cassava poisoning leads to irreversible paralysis.\nInteresting fact: Cassava roots are ground into a flour-like substance which is then used to make tapioca. Cassava leaves contain cyanide but if pounded into a paste with flour and left in the shade for 5 hours, the cyanide is broken down.\nPufferfish stand to be the second most poisonous vertebrate in the world. Though you won’t find pufferfish in the U.S., many in Korea as well as Japan find some parts of the fish to be delicacies. However, certain organs of the fish, such as the liver, as extremely toxic, and can be deadly. The poison in the fish, known as tetrodotoxin, can cause numbness, high blood pressure, and muscle paralysis, which is what leads to death as the diaphragm muscles become paralyzed, disabling breathing. Known as fugu when eaten as a meal, many in Asian countries refuse to not eat the fish.\nInteresting fact: Pufferfish has been made illegal to be eaten by the Emperor of Japan.\nThere are about 5000 types of mushrooms known in the U.S. and about 100 of them are said to be toxic, while less than a dozen are deadly. In any case, mushrooms can cause gastrointestinal discomfort. Since mushrooms are fungi and the fact that there are so many species, it can be hard to know which are poisonous. As rule of thumb, it is usually said that any mushroom found in the wild are more than likely poisonous. One of the deadliest types of mushroom toxins is Alpha-amanitin, which causes extreme liver damage. Toadstools, as they are called, are the poisonous mushrooms.\nInteresting fact: There are 38,000 known kinds of mushrooms; about 5% of these are toxic.\nThough really seeds and not nuts, cashews grow inside of a shell-like structure that grows on a fruit. When buying “raw cashews” in the store, take note that these nuts have actually been steamed and are not entirely raw. This is because raw cashews contain urushiol, which is the same chemical that you’d find in poison ivy. It can cause the body to have a very similar reaction to one experienced from poison oak or ivy. If a high level of urushiol is ingested, it can be deadly. Cashew poisoning is rare, but those who handle them in order to manufacture them to get the shell off sometimes experience the side-effects.\nInteresting fact: Cashews come from a fruit, which in South American countries, is eaten, and the seeds (cashews) are then thrown away.\nYou’ve probably eaten a chili or two in your life. No matter if it was an extremely hot one, or one that was pretty mild, every chili you have ever consumed has contained a chemical called capsaicin. In chilies, capsaicin is what makes them spicy and “hot.” Of course one chili won’t hurt, but if you eat enough of them, capsaicin can kill you. The chemical is so strong that it is used as a paint stripper, and it is even used in pepper spray used by police forces. In hotter chilies, such as habaneros, capsaicin can be felt on the skin if you cut the chili, as it will produce a burning sensation.\nInteresting fact: Chilies are extremely high in Vitamin C. One green chili pod is said to contain about 6 times as much Vitamin C.\nWe’ve all heard something or another about potatoes. Whether it is the potato famine, some Irish story, or some other historical event centered on potatoes, one thing you may not have heard of is that potatoes are toxic. The stem and leaves of the plant are toxic, and even the potato itself is toxic. If you’ve ever looked at a potato, you may have realized that some turn a greenish color. This is due to levels of glycoalkaloid poison. In the past, there have been deaths due to potato poisoning. It is rare, but most happen due to someone drinking potato leaf tea, or eating green potatoes. Death doesn’t come suddenly. It usually results in weakness and then a coma. Don’t worry about having the occasional green potato chip, but do discard any potatoes that have green eyes, sprouts, or greenish skins, rather than prepare and serve them, especially to children.\nInteresting fact: Potatoes make great food for astronaut! In fact in 1995 potato plants were taken into orbit on the Columbia and actually grown.\nAlmonds, most always said to be nuts, are actually seeds and are extremely popular in kitchens around the world. Much like cashews, almonds are extremely poisonous if not introduced to some sort of heat source. It is generally the bitter almonds that need to be treated to get rid of the poison. The seeds are full of cyanide, and in many countries are illegal to sell without having been processed in order to get rid of the poison within the seed.\nInteresting fact: Almonds are said to be one of the earliest cultivated foods, being mentioned in the Bible’s Old Testament.\nCherries are definitely one of the most versatile fruits. You can eat them raw, cook them, bake them, and get them tart or sweet. Cherries can even be used in certain types of liquor. Despite their overall red goodness, cherries are toxic. If you’ve ever eaten a cherry and without thought chewed on the pip or left it in your mouth, you more than likely introduced hydrogen cyanide into your body. If a cherry pip is chewed, crushed, or somehow damaged, it automatically produces hydrogen cyanide. Symptoms of mild poisoning include headache, dizziness, confusion, anxiety, and vomiting. Larger doses can lead to difficulty breathing, increased blood pressure and heart rate, and kidney failure. Reactions can include coma, convulsions, and death from respiratory arrest.\nInteresting fact: Cherries contain extremely high amounts of Melatonin which is good for helping and keeping the body regulated.\nApples are definitely a popular fruit no matter where you go. Like others on the list, and many other types of fruits, apples contain cyanide, but not in high levels. The fruit itself does not contain the chemical, but you will find cyanide in the apple’s seeds. Eating all of the seeds in one apple won’t kill you, but it’s definitely not recommended. Of course, if enough apple seeds are eaten, this means chewed and swallowed, it can result in complications.\nInteresting fact: Apples float because at least 25% of their mass is nothing but air.\nDespite the extreme popularity of tomatoes and many countries, it is true that they are poisonous. Though the fruit itself doesn’t contain poison, the stem as well as the leaves contain a chemical known as glycoalkaloid. Higher levels are said to be found in wild tomatoes, but those grown domestically still contain glycoalkaloid. This chemical is known to cause upset stomachs and nervousness. The leaves and stem can be used in cooking for flavor, but must be removed before eating. This chemical is so powerful that it is actually used as a way to control pests.\nInteresting fact: In 1893, in the U.S. Supreme Court case Nix v. Hedden, it was argued whether or not a tomato was a vegetable or a fruit, which dealt with taxes being paid on vegetbles and not fruits. In the end, the court ruled that a tomato is a vegetable when referring to the Tariff Act, but is botanically a fruit.', ""In this post I'm going to review and fact check some of the food that is commonly listed as toxic to chickens\nWhat makes food toxic?\nTo start with, I think it's useful to step back to understand what makes food toxic. Most of the food thought to be toxic to chickens, relates to food that contains potent phytochemicals:\n- Avocado: Persin\n- Tomatoes: Tomatine\n- Onions and Garlic: Sulfur\n- Potatoes: Solanine\n- Apple seeds: Amygdalin\nWhat are phytochemicals?\nThese chemicals are the plants defences, such as naturally occurring pesticides, antibacterials and anti-fungals. Some of these can be toxic at high doses. However at low doses, there's plenty of research to show that some of these are beneficial.\n“the poison is in the dose”\nStress kicks in natural defences\nRecent research and theories on nutrition suggest that some of the health benefits from fruit and vegetables come from minute exposure to stress from the chemicals produced by plants. And when we eat them and when chickens eat them, they cause a small amount of stress which kicks in natural defences, making the body and the immune system healthier and better prepared. Without this stress, our cells become complacent and less able to defend itself against disease.\nCan chickens eat Avocado?\nPhoto Source: www.kjokkenutstyr.net\nAvocado is often listed as a food that’s toxic to chickens. Sometimes the whole avocado is listed as toxic. And sometimes only the skin and seeds are listed as toxic.\nAvocados are toxic to chickens because they contain a natural fungicide called persin, which birds are particularly sensitive to. Err on the side of caution and don’t feed your chickens any avocado, including the pulp.\n2. Apple seeds\nCan chickens eat apple seeds?\nSource: liz west on Flickr\nApple seeds is often listed as a food that’s toxic to chickens because they contain cyanide.\nApple cores and their seeds are perfectly safe to feed your chickens.\nSo it's true that apple seeds contain cyanide.\nBut the amount and concentration of cyanide is so small it doesn’t harm chickens. And cyanide doesn’t build up over time and is quickly removed by the liver and kidney.\nA 1kg chicken would need to eat over 500 apple seeds in one sitting for it to be toxic.\nThere are also lots of other nuts, fruit and vegetables seeds that contain similar amounts of amygdalin. This includes almonds, sunflowers, courgette, cucumber and squash.\n3. Potato skins / peels\nCan chickens eat potato skins / peels?\nSource: Peter Hinsdale on Flickr\nPotato skins contain solanine which can kill your chickens.\nPotato skins are perfectly safe to feed your chickens. However solanine is produced in toxic amounts in the green parts of the potato, so you should avoid green potato skin, shoots, leaves and stems.\nTo prevent potatoes from going green, store them in a cool, dark place.\nIf potatoes are green and spouted, throw it out.\nBut there isn't enough Solanine in potatoes to cause harm.\nStudies show potato waste meal can be used as a substitute for maize (corn) for up to 30% of a chickens diet without any negative effects.\nIt’s actually green potato skin and sprouting potatoes that contains much higher amounts of Solanine (100 times more) and should be avoided. The green colour is chlorophyll which isn’t toxic. However solanine is produced in the green parts of the potato. So this includes green skin, shoots, leaves and stems.\n- Handbook of Poultry Feed from Waste: Processing and Use, A.H. El Boushy, A.F.B. van der Poel\n- Was It Something You Ate?: Food Intolerance: What Causes It and How to Avoid It, John Emsley, Peter Fell\n4. Green tomatoes and leaves\nCan chickens eat green tomatoes and leaves\nImage Source: Kaarina Dillabough on Flickr\nYou shouldn’t feed your chickens green tomatoes or tomato leaves, because they contain toxic levels of solanine.\nGreen tomatoes and tomato leaves are perfectly safe for your chickens to eat and are an excellent part of a varied and healthy diet.\nThe common advice that green tomatoes contain solanine is wrong. Tomatoes are a member of the nightshade family but don’t contain solanine.\nTomatoes contain tomatine. There are significant quantities of tomatine in green tomato and tomato leaves, but tomatine isn’t toxic. As stated by Dr. Mendel Friedman of the federal Department of Agriculture, who has studied potato and tomato alkaloids for two decades:\n“Commercial tomatoes contain tomatine. Solanine, is a potato alkaloid. There are significant quantities of tomatine in green tomato fruits, which people have long eaten fried and pickled. And tomatine appears to be a relatively benign alkaloid.”\nRather than being toxic, studies reported by Dr. Friedman show tomatine has lots of health benefits:\n- Improves the cholesterol profile of animals: Tomatine ingested by animals passes through unabsorbed. It binds to cholesterol, ridding the body of both alkaloid and cholesterol.\n- Protects against cancer: Green tomato extract was shown to lower the incidence of cancer in animals and inhibits the growth of various human cancer cells.\n- Stimulates the immune system: Purified tomatine was found to stimulate the immune system in desirable ways.\nCan chickens eat onions?\nImage Source: Stilleben on Flickr\nYou shouldn’t feed onions to your chickens because they contain high amounts of sulfur which is toxic to chickens.\nAvoid feeding your chickens onion, except in very low doses as a supplement (2-3 grams). Onion contains sulfur which is toxic to chickens in sufficient amounts (more than 5 grams). However at low doses (2-3 grams) there is some evidence that onion and garlic has positive effects such as improved growth and feed intake.\nOnions are toxic to chickens in sufficient amounts. This includes all forms of onion: raw onion, cooked onion, onion powder and other plants of the Allium family (e.g. garlic, leeks, shallots).\nSulfur in onions decomposes to disulfides through digestion which can destroy red blood cells and can cause anemia or even death.\nThe toxic dose of onions hasn’t been well studied in chickens, however a good guide is to keep it to less than about 5% of feed (about 5 grams a day). If a chicken eats a bit more than this as a one-off, it’s not likely to be affected. But a chicken that regularly eats large amounts of onion could be affected.\nIn practice, chickens don’t generally eat raw onions but will eat cooked onions. So you need to be especially careful when feeding leftovers to your chickens. So don't go feeding your chickens onion soup.\n- Pale Comb And Wattles\n- Loss Of Appetite\n- Rapid Respiratory Rate\n- Difficulty Breathing\nThe interesting thing about onion and garlic is that at low doses (2-3 grams), studies show it has positive effects. This is roughly about a quarter of an average sized clove of garlic. For commercial operations, garlic and onion are being explored as an alternative to antibiotics for growth promotion.\nSome of the positive effects that have been studied from low doses of onion and garlic include: Improved growth, improved feed intake, decrease in bad cholesterol and improved meat quality. These positive effects are thought to come from the antibacterial and anti-fungal properties of onion and garlic.\n5. Uncooked Rice\nCan chickens eat uncooked rice?\nImage Source: Rob & Dani on Flickr\nUncooked rice expands in your chicken's stomach, causing digestive issues and can even cause your chickens to explode.\nUncooked rice is safe to feed your chickens. It doesn't expand or blow up and is a nutritious option to include in your chickens diet.\nThis seems to have started from the myth that wedding rice causes pigeons to blow up and has carried across to advice for chickens.\nUncooked rice is actually part of a chicken's natural diet. Jungle fowl (the chicken's wild ancestor) eat a lot of bamboo rice when bamboo goes to seed, which is similar in a lot of ways to normal rice.""]"	['<urn:uuid:b58526ac-11bf-49ca-bfe4-74c99fb00691>', '<urn:uuid:c6828ce8-8606-4de7-8312-a3b900337851>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	42	120	2725
14	How long does a bamboo plant take to grow back?	Bamboo takes just 59 days to grow back to full height after being cut down at the root, without need for re-planting.	['What is “Green Burial”?\nis an environmentally sustainable alternative for funeral and burial where the body is returned to the earth to decompose as naturally as possible and be recycled into new life. A Green burial does not preclude you from having an opportunity for private family time to say good-bye, a visitation, and memorial ceremonies to recognize and celebrate the life of your loved one.\nWhat is Basic Care?\nBasic Care is the care that is provided to your loved one in preparation of private family time to say good-bye. This care will include bathing and washing, combing of your loved one’s hair, and application of a topical disinfectant. We check for valuables and return any items to your family with an inventory list. We gently position your loved one’s body and gently close their eyes and mouth to natural lines of closure. We will remove any soiled clothing or sheets and will dress them in a hospital gown and cover them with a clean sheet until we receive the clothing you desire to use for their burial. The use of our temperature controlled care facility to facilitate temporary preservation is also provided. With Basic Care, there is no Embalming Care provided.\nWhat is the purpose of a Casket?\nA casket holds a person with respect and dignity while in our custody. A “green” casket is a container, generally manufactured of wood, designed for the viewing of a deceased loved one in the funeral home for both private family time of goodbye and public visitation periods. The casket also serves as dignified and respectful storage for the body and allows for ease of transportation to the cemetery for interment or entombment. A green casket will be biodegradable.\nWhat materials are used in Green Caskets?\nThere are several materials that may be used for Green casket construction, ranging from simple pine to woven sustainable materials. Bamboo is grown and harvested at licensed plantations (when it is cut down at the root, it takes just 59 days to grow back to full height without need for re-planting). Willow is cut from bushes known as crowns which remain harvestable for approximately 40 years before they need to be re-planted.\nThese caskets will biodegrade, leaving nothing but human remains within six months to one year from the time of burial. These caskets are also appropriate for cremation; an added benefit is the lack of toxins released into the environment during the cremation process.\nDo you need an Outer Burial Container or Vault?\nIn conventional burial, an outer burial container is placed in the ground, in a concrete box form and helps support the weight of the earth to prevent the grave from collapsing. It is a cemetery requirement that aids the cemetery in maintenance of their grounds. You may skip the vault if the cemetery permits it, or pick a concrete burial container with an open bottom to let the body come into contact with the earth.\nIn instances where there is no natural or green burial options available, the ceremonies provided can still reflect Green or Natural care, the casket can be a “Green” casket, and the minimum environmental impact container can be used.\nCan survivors participate in the burial process by watching the burial process?\nYes, survivors can participate in the completion of the burial process.\nWhat is Cremation?\nCremation is a process to prepare a deceased human person for final disposition by reducing them to bone fragments and skeletal particles through intense heat and flame. Cremation is a two-step process. After this first step has taken place, a person’s remains, mainly bone fragments and skeletal particles, are gathered and these remains are placed in a processor, creating a uniform powder-like texture. Due to the irreversible nature of cremation, most states require a waiting period before the actual process may begin. In Massachusetts, at least 48 hours must pass before cremation may be authorized.\nCremation does not exclude the need to recognize an individual and a life lived; or the need for dignified and respectful treatment of a body including, when desired or necessary, cosmetic restoration, clothing, and other related care; or the need for a private or public gathering; either with or without ceremony or ritual; or the need to select and arrange for meaningful final placement of a body following cremation; or the need to permanently and appropriately memorialize the life and the individual.\nCremation uses fewer resources than other disposition choices but it also has an environmental impact. The Green Burial Council is working towards provisions to help identify ways to reduce or off-set the environmental impact of cremation. The main objective is to offer viable options for reducing the “eco-footprint” in whatever manner that is deemed appropriate by survivors.\nWhat is the purpose of a Cremation Container?\nA Cremation container holds a person with respect and dignity while in our custody and is designed for the viewing of a deceased loved one for private family time of good-bye and any public ceremonies. A container will also allow for ease of transport and proper placement into the cremation chamber, also with respect and dignity. A cremation container also facilitates the cremation process and allows for safe handling of an individual for our associates while in our care. Because we have standards to facilitate dignity and respect, we require a cremation container. Most “green” burial caskets will serve this intended purpose or a basic alternative container may be used.\nWhat is the purpose of an Urn?\nAn urn is a specialized container to hold a person’s cremated remains. It will keep a person’s cremated remains together and protects the integrity of the cremated remains. Urns can be used for the following manners of final disposition: Interment, Entombment, Scattering, or Keepsake/Memorialization. We have urns that are designed to be biodegradable for scattering or for burial purposes or burial at sea.']	['<urn:uuid:cb6c099e-f368-483b-acf0-4b98af0d73a9>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	10	22	980
15	what surgical procedure steps involved placing cochlear implant duration anesthesia recovery	The cochlear implant surgery is a one to two hour procedure performed under general anesthesia. The process involves making an incision behind the auricle, creating a hollow in the bone for the implant housing, and carefully drilling through the mastoid process to reach the middle ear. The surgeon must navigate around the organ of balance, facial nerve, and gustatory nerve, using neuromonitoring to protect the facial nerve. The cochlea is opened through the round window membrane, and the stimulation electrode is inserted 20-30 millimeters into the cochlear coils using soft surgery techniques. After sealing the site and fixing the electrode and implant, the skin is sutured. Patients may experience some dizziness post-operation but can typically be discharged within four days.	"['Cochlear implant (CI)\nFor 30 years now, cochlear implantations have been performed in the ENT Clinic at the Klinikum rechts der Isar. At our clinic itself, as well as in cooperation with other institutes of the Technical University of Munich and our international cooperation partners, we are involved in several research projects in order to offer our patients state-of-the-art care.\nThe CI consultation before a possible operation as well as the follow-up treatment takes place in the friendly rooms of the Munich Comprehensive Hearing Center (Hörzentrum München).\nA cochlear implant is not a hearing aid, but a hearing prosthesis. Unlike a hearing aid, it does not act as a sound amplifier to support an injured ear. Rather, it replaces the function of the inner ear by directly electrically stimulating the auditory nerve.\nFor this purpose, a stimulation electrode is placed as close as possible to the auditory nerve fibers. In CI implantation, it is inserted into the fluid-filled cavities of the cochlea.\nThe CI system consists of internal and external components:\nThe sound vibrations are picked up via microphone on the speech processor (1). The speech processor processes the acoustic signal by performing frequency and volume coding (which otherwise takes place in the inner ear) and calculates an electrical pulse pattern. This information is transmitted from the transmitter coil (2), held by a magnet, through the skin to the implant (3). The implant checks the received information and stimulates the auditory nerve (5) via the electrode (4).\nFigure: with kind permission of the company MED-EL, Innsbruck\nThe CI is not an alternative to a hearing aid: A CI is basically only suitable for patients whose hearing ability is no longer sufficient for free speech communication despite the use of powerful conventional hearing aids in the affected ear.\nCochlear implantations are performed in both children and adults. The age range of patients who have been fitted with a CI at the Klinikum rechts der Isar is between nine months and 93 years. If infants born deaf are promptly provided with a CI, almost normal speech development is usually guaranteed.\nBoth the bilateral treatment with a CI has been established for many years, as well as the CI treatment of patients with unilateral deafness (and hardly restricted opposing ear). Only hearing with both ears enables directional hearing. Hearing with both ears improves speech understanding in noisy environments and is less strenuous.\nEspecially for children and their parents, hearing/speech development with CI is associated with an intensive work and learning process. In order to get a realistic assessment of the individual requirements, some points should be given special attention and clarified in advance with infants and children. These include the precise diagnosis of possible developmental disorders and chronic diseases, as well as ensuring that the child\'s environment allows for continuous technical care and language.\nUnderstanding with a cochlear implant must first be practiced: This is because the CI electrode generates a pulse pattern on the auditory nerve that is not identical to the stimulus pattern produced by a healthy inner ear.\nWhen the CI is switched on for the first time (which happens about 4 - 6 weeks after the operation, when all wounds have healed accordingly), the patients immediately perceive sounds or noises over a wide range of frequencies, but they often cannot interpret them correctly and therefore cannot understand speech immediately.\nFor the initial fitting, we admit our adult CI patients for another week. For most of them the new sound is very unfamiliar. Together with our speech therapists, the patients practice recognizing speech step by step in this new sound experience. In children, in the absence of cooperation, an ""objective setting"" is also possible using the deducible stimulus responses of the auditory nerve (NRT, ART). In general, a large proportion of patients manage to follow a conversation in a quiet environment after the first week. In adults, the first follow-ups after fitting take place after 3, 6 and 12 months. Subsequently, we perform an annual medical and technical follow-up examination.\nDespite optimal fitting and aftercare, only in a few exceptions does a CI achieve a hearing performance comparable to that of a normal hearing person. In general, hearing with the CI requires a significantly increased concentration and as soon as louder ambient noise is added, even a very good CI patient will have difficulties with speech comprehension, especially if the fitting is only one-sided.\nThe implant is inserted in a one to two hour operation under general anesthesia.\nFirst, the skin is opened directly behind the auricle (the scar is later no longer visible under the hair). In the bone behind the ear a hollow is created for the implant housing, so that it cannot slip later and is not visible as a bulge under the scalp. Now the bone process behind the auricle (the so-called mastoid process) is drilled out millimeter by millimeter under the surgical microscope - this is done with special drills with spherical drill bits.\nIn this way, the surgeon reaches the middle ear. On the way there, the surgeon identifies the organ of balance, the facial nerve and the gustatory nerve. The integrity of the facial nerve is monitored throughout the entire operation with a so-called neuromonitoring.\nIn the middle ear, the approximately 1 cm large air-filled space behind the eardrum, there is (in addition to the ossicles) also the entrance to the inner ear, the cochlea. The cochlea is usually opened in the round window niche by cutting the round window membrane, through which the stimulation electrode is inserted about 20 - 30 millimeters deep into the two and a half spiral coils of the cochlea. The opening of the cochlea and insertion of the electrode is done atraumatically (so-called soft surgery) in order to preserve any residual hearing in the best possible way. This site is immediately sealed again, then the electrode cable and the implant are fixed and the skin is closed with sutures.\nDirectly after the operation, dizziness may occasionally occur, otherwise the procedure is relatively easy and painless. Our patients can usually be discharged within four days.']"	['<urn:uuid:c2a2f1cc-2a48-4d14-97b2-8c1ade186225>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	11	120	1017
16	How do I write the copyright symbol on my computer?	There are several ways to type the copyright symbol (©): On Windows, press and hold ALT while typing 0169 on the number pad. On Mac, press and hold OPTION and type 'g'. You can also access it through the Character Map in Windows Accessories, or through 'Emoji & Symbols' under Edit on Mac. Additionally, you can simply copy and paste the symbol from the internet.	"['The copyright symbol is usually tucked away at the edge or a corner of a published or produced material that’s considered “visually perceptible” either directly or with a machine’s help. Though quite small, its presence holds a huge significance, especially for the copyright holder. If you\'re not the owner or holder of the copyright then you need to be careful about using other people’s creation so you won\'t bear legal liabilities.\nWhat is a copyright symbol?\nA copyright symbol, also known as a copyright notice, is a specific identifier that informs the public that someone has ownership over an original creation. It is designed as an encircled capital C © to refer to the ""copyright.""\nThe symbol is in accordance with the 1952 Universal Copyright Convention which states that, along with the ©, a copyright notice must also contain the name of the copyright owner and the year the original work was published or produced. These conditions are also underscored in the U.S. 1976 Copyright Act.\nSince March 1, 1989, however, the Copyright Act removed the requirement for copyright notices. Essentially, this means that creators of materials published or produced after the said date do not have to put a copyright sign or notice on their work because they automatically enjoy the protection of the copyright law. Yet, some creators still put the copyright mark or notice even if their works have been recent to further safeguard their legal rights and as a deterrent against potential thieves.\nWhy use a copyright symbol?\nHaving a copyright icon denotes that the work or material is someone\'s original creation. If the notice is present, then it will make it easier for the public to seek the copyright owner for permission to use the material.\nIf it so happens that this work has been infringed, then it\'s also easier for the copyright holder to file a copyright infringement lawsuit or negotiate for compensation and acknowledgment. The individual, group, or entity that violated the owner\'s copyright won\'t be able to say that they did not know the work was copyrighted since the symbol is present. However, they could get away with claiming that they innocently took someone\'s work if there was no symbol or mark on the material.\nIn some cases, copyright can also help determine the term of protection based on the year of publication. It can also establish the identity of the copyright holder in cases where the work or material has been existing for several decades.\nHow to use a copyright symbol\nIt\'s the copyright owner who has the responsibility to use the copyright symbol or provide a copyright notice on the material. The copyright icon contains three main elements:\n- The © icon or the word ""Copyright"" and its abbreviated form, ""Copr.""\n- The copyright owner’s name - which doesn\'t necessarily have to be the author or artist. Sometimes, other individuals or companies that hired the creator may be the copyright owner.\n- The year of first publication or production. However, this may not be necessary for images, graphics, sculpture, and other forms of artwork. The publication or production date may also not be needed for reproduced copyrighted work as in greeting cards, postcards, toys or any useful articles, as per the Copyright guidelines.\nWhen a copyright notice is omitted\nAs stated, original works made public after March 1, 1989, do not need a copyright notice. However, a problem might arise for materials published or produced before this date if the copyright notice has been omitted. The law requires that a correction to the omission should have been corrected five years after the first time it was published.\nWhere to place the copyright symbol\nWhile the notice is optional, copyright owners may actually use any type of placement for its copyright icon or notice. However, it would be prudent for the copyright owner to apply formalities when placing the notice. Ideally, two things must be considered:\nit should not be concealed it must be legible or easy to read by anyone who sees the material\nIn single-page materials, the copyright notice may appear on the front or back. In books or multiple pages, copyright notices are usually placed on:\n- The title page\n- The back of the title page\n- The first page following the title page\n- The last page after the main content\n- The back page\nOn websites, the copyright notice may be sufficient on the footer of the home page, but some web owners have copyright signs on every page, and that\'s perfectly fine, too. Sometimes, web owners also put clickable copyright notices that redirect users to the details of the copyright, such as permissions, restrictions, and other information that the copyright holder might deem useful to deter violations.\nCopyright symbol examples\nThe most common copyright notice looks this way: (Symbol or Word) (Year of Publication) (Copyright Owner)\n© 2019 John Doe\nCopyright 2019 The Workshop Company\nCopr 2019 Photography, Inc.\nIn cases of unpublished works, which is still protected by copyright laws, the notice may be formatted this way:\nUnpublished © 2019 John Doe\nUnpublished Copyright 2019 The Workshop Company\nUnpublished Copr 2019 Photography, Inc.\nHow to type copyright character ©\nThere are several ways you may insert the copyright character into your documents or elsewhere.\n1. Copy it from the web\nMost of the time people basically copy and paste the copyright character from the internet. Just select the copyright character, copy it and past it where you need it.\n2.

17	As an epidemiologist studying urban health transitions, I'm curious about the historical relationship between wealth and health in cities, and how does this compare to current water access inequalities in urban areas?	In 17th and 18th century England, wealth provided little survival advantage in cities as the infectious disease environment overwhelmed any benefits of better housing and food. The close relationship between wealth and health only emerged in the 19th century. Today, similar inequalities persist in water access - many peri-urban settlements in large cities are not served by centralized water systems due to socio-cultural, economic, and political reasons, forcing residents to obtain water from unsafe sources, including informal connections to central water systems.	"['The fate of migrants moving to cities in 17th- and 18th-century England demonstrates how a single pathogen could dramatically alter the risks associated with migration and migratory patterns today.\nCities have always been a magnet to migrants. In 2010, a tipping point was reached for the first time when, according to the World Health Organization, the majority of the world’s population lived in cities. By 2050, seven out of 10 people will have been born in – or migrated to – a city. One hundred years ago, that figure was two out of 10.\nToday, cities are generally the safest places to live. If you live in one, you’re likely to be richer than someone living in a rural environment. If you’re richer, you’re likely to live longer. If you live in a city, you have better access to hospitals and healthcare, and you’re more likely to be immunised.\nBut that was not always the case. In 17th- and 18th-century England, city life was lethal – disproportionately so for those migrating from the countryside.\nDr Romola Davenport is studying the effects of migration on the health of those living in London and Manchester from 1750 to 1850, with a particular focus on the lethality of smallpox – the single most deadly disease in 18th-century England. In the century before 1750, England’s population had failed to grow. Cities and towns sucked in tens of thousands of migratory men, women and children – then killed them. It’s estimated that half of the natural growth of the English population was consumed by London deaths during this period. Burials often outstripped baptisms.\nIn 2013, cities are no longer the death traps they once were, even accounting for the millions of migrants who live in poor, often slum-like conditions. But will cities always be better places to live? What could eliminate the ‘urban advantage’ and what might the future of our cities look like if antibiotics stop working?\nBy looking at the past – and trying to make sense of the sudden, vast improvement in survival rates after 1750 – Davenport and the University of Newcastle’s Professor Jeremy Boulton hope to understand more about city life and mortality.\n“For modern migrants to urban areas there is no necessary trade-off of health for wealth,” said Davenport. “Historically, however, migrants often took substantial risks in moving from rural to urban areas because cities were characterised by substantially higher death rates than rural areas, and wealth appears to have conferred little survival advantage.”\nThe intensity of the infectious disease environment overwhelmed any advantages of the wealthy – such as better housing, food and heating. Although cities and towns offered unparalleled economic opportunities for migrants, wealth could not compensate for the higher health risks exacted by urban living.\n“Urban populations are large and dense, which facilitates the transmission of infectious diseases from person to person or via animals or sewage. Towns functioned as trading posts not only for ideas and goods but also for pathogens. Therefore, growing an urban population relied upon substantial immigration from rural areas,” explained Davenport.\n“After 1750, cities no longer functioned as ‘demographic sinks’ because there was a rapid improvement in urban mortality rates in Britain. By the mid-19th century, even the most notorious industrial cities such as Liverpool and Manchester were capable of a natural increase, with the number of births exceeding deaths.”\nDavenport has been studying the processes of urban mortality improvement and changing migrant risks using extremely rich source material from the large London parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields. The research, funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Economic and Social Research Council, is now being augmented with abundant demographic archives from Manchester, funded by the Leverhulme Trust.\nFor both cities, Davenport and colleagues have access to detailed records of the individual burials underlying the Bills of Mortality, which were the main source of urban mortality statistics from the 17th to the 18th century. These give age at death, cause of death, street address and the fee paid for burial, which enables them to study the age and sex distribution of deaths by disease. In addition, baptismal data allow them to ‘reconstitute’ families as well as to measure the mortality rates of infants by social status.\n“The records themselves give only a bald account of death,” said Davenport. “But sometimes we can link them to workhouse records and personal accounts, especially among the migrant poor, which really bring home the realities of life and death in early modern London.\n“Smallpox was deadly. At its height, it accounted for 10% of all burials in London and an astonishing 20% in Manchester. Children were worst affected, but 20% of London’s smallpox victims were adults – likely to be migrants who had never been exposed to, and survived, the disease in childhood. However in Manchester – a town that grew from 20,000 to 250,000 in a century – 95% of smallpox burials were children in the mid-18th century, implying a high level of endemicity not only in Manchester but also in the rural areas that supplied migrants to the city.\n“So studying urban populations can tell us not only about conditions in cities but also about the circulation of diseases in the rest of the population.”\nThe greater lethality of smallpox in Manchester is, for the moment, still a mystery to researchers; but evidence suggests the potential importance of transmission via clothing or other means – as opposed to the person-to-person transmission assumed in mathematical models of smallpox transmission in bioterrorism scenarios. Although smallpox was eradicated in the late 1970s, both the USA and Russia have stockpiles of the virus – which has led to fears of their use by terrorists should the virus ever fall into the wrong hands. Data on smallpox epidemics before the introduction of vaccination in the late 1790s are very valuable to bioterrorism researchers because they provide insights into how the virus might spread in an unvaccinated population (only a small proportion of the world’s population is vaccinated against smallpox).\nFrom 1770 onwards, there was a rapid decline in adult smallpox victims in both London and Manchester, which Davenport believes could be attributable to a rapid upsurge in the use of smallpox inoculation (a precursor of vaccination) by would-be migrants or a change in the transmissibility and potency of the disease. By the mid-19th century, towns and cities appear to have been relatively healthy destinations for young adult migrants, although still deadly for children.\n“Smallpox was probably the major cause of the peculiar lethality of even small urban settlements in the 17th and 18th centuries,” said Davenport, “and this highlights how a single pathogen, like plague or HIV, can dramatically alter the risks associated with migration and migratory patterns.”\n“The close relationship between wealth and health that explains much of the current ‘urban advantage’ is not a constant but emerged in England in the 19th century,” added Davenport. “While wealth can now buy better access to medical treatment, as well as better food and housing, it remains an open question as to whether this relationship will persist indefinitely in the face of emerging threats such as microbial drug resistance.”\nHeader Image : An 1802 cartoon of the early controversy surrounding Edward Jenner’s vaccination theory, showing using hiscowpox-derived smallpox vaccine causing cattle to emerge from patients.

Consumption of unsafe water continues to be one of the major causes of the 2.2 million diarrheal disease deaths occurring annually, mostly in children (WHO/UNICEF, 2000).\nDespite major efforts to deliver safe, piped, community water to the World\'s population, the reality is that water supplies delivering safe water will not be available to all people in the near term (Argawal et al., 1981; Feachem et al., 1978; IDRC, 1980). The millenium declaration established as a goal halving the proportion of the global population without access to safe water by 2015. One reason for this is that fecal contamination of source and treated water is a persistent, worldwide problem. Sanitation coverage is inadequate in many parts of the world and is likely to persist for the foreseeable future. Fecal contamination of source and treated water is further exacerbated by increasing populations, urban growth and expansion, peri-urban settlement and continued and perhaps increasing pollutant transport into ground and surface water due to deforestation, global climate change, recurrent disastrous weather events (hurricanes, cyclones, floods, tsunamis, etc.) and increasing coverage of the earth\'s surface with impervious materials.\nCurrent estimates of the number of people using microbiologically unsafe water are probably low. This is because the assumptions about the safety or quality of water based on its source, extent of treatment or consumer handling do not take into consideration several well-documented problems. One problem is that co-called protected or improved sources, such as boreholes and treated urban supplies, can still be fecally contaminated and deliver microbially unsafe water. In some cities the water systems abstract unsafe water from unprotected or contaminated sources and deliver it to consumers with no or inadequate treatment, yet these water systems are classified or categorized as improved and safe. Another problem contributing to the underestimation of the population served by unsafe water is contamination of water during distribution whether water is piped or carried into the home. Many communities have protected or improved water supplies and treated water that is microbiologically safe when collected or when it leaves a treatment plant. However, substandard water distribution systems, intermittent water pressure due to power outages and other disruptions, and illegal connections to the distribution system often lead to the introduction of fecal contamination and therefore, microbiologically contaminated water at the consumer\'s tap or collection point. In some urban water supplies the infrastructure for water distribution to consumers is so inadequate that pressure drops, losses and other intermittent pressure changes, deteriorating, open or leaking conveyances and other distribution system deficiencies lead to infiltration or intrusion of contaminated water and increased waterborne disease risks. Such deficiencies result in the delivery of unsafe water to consumers, even though the water may have been obtained from a high quality, protected source and centrally treated by physical and chemical methods to improve quality. Furthermore, in many large cities, including some of the World\'s megacities, peri-urban settlements are not served by the centralized water system for socio-cultural, economic, political, technological and other reasons. Because these unserved urban dwellers are forced to obtain water from any available source, including informal and clandestine connections to the central water supply system, their water is typically contaminated.\nPeople now drinking unsafe household water also include those in rural as well as urban settings. Many rural dwellers lack indoor plumbing or nearby outdoor piped water from a safe supply (from wells, boreholes, protected or upland surface water sources, etc.). Often they have to travel considerable distances to reach any water source, regardless of quality, for collection and household use (White et. al., 1972). Many urban dwellers are also lack safe water (WHO, 2000; Swerdlow et. al., 1992; Ries et. al., 1992; Weber et. al., 1994).\nA further problem is that water collected for domestic use often becomes re-contaminated or further contaminated by unsafe consumer storage and handling practices at the household level. Many of the world\'s people continue to obtain their water on a daily or other frequent basis from any available source and either carry it or otherwise have it delivered to the home for personal use. Typically, this water is gathered and stored in vessels of various designs and materials. Often, the water is not treated or otherwise protected from subsequent contamination during use. Such household water is at high risk of being contaminated by various pathogenic viruses, bacteria and parasites associated with fecal wastes and other sources. This is because water is typically obtained from the most convenient source, which is often fecally contaminated, and typically, additional contamination occurs due to a variety of unsanitary conditions and practices during storage and use. Microbial contamination of collected and stored household water is caused not only by the collection and use of fecally contaminated water that was not safe to begin with but also by contamination of initially microbiologically safe water after its collection and storage. Factors contributing to this problem are unsanitary and inadequately protected (open, uncovered or poorly covered) water collection and storage containers, the use of unsanitary methods to dispense water from household storage vessels, including fecally contaminated hands and dippers, lack of protection against contamination introduced by vectors (flies, cockroaches, rodents, etc.) and inadequate cleaning of vessels to prevent biofilm formation and accumulation of sediments and pathogens.\nImproving and protecting the microbial quality and reducing the infectious disease risks to consumers of collected water stored in households requires alternative or interim strategies and approaches that can be implemented effectively, quickly and affordably. As will be described in this report, technically feasible, effective, socio-culturally acceptable and affordable methods for treatment and storage of household water to improve microbial quality and reduce waterborne disease risks are now available. Waiting for the provision of piped, microbiologically safe community water systems to the many people lacking such services is an inappropriate response to the basic need for safer drinking water that can be met on at least a provisional basis by available technologies. Effective measures are needed immediately to provide at risk populations with safer water at the household level until the long-term goal of providing safe, piped, community water supplies can be achieved.\nThere is now conclusive evidence that simple, acceptable, low-cost interventions at the household and community level are capable of dramatically improving the microbial quality of household stored water and reducing the risks of diarrheal disease and death in populations of all ages in the developed and developing world. A variety of physical and chemical treatment methods to improve the microbial quality of water are available and many have been tested and implemented to varying extents in a variety of settings and for a diverse range of populations. Many different water collection and storage systems and strategies have been developed, described and evaluated on the basis of various criteria for household and community use. Some of them have been tested under controlled conditions in the laboratory and implemented in field to evaluate their ability to produce drinking water of acceptable microbiological quality and to maintain this quality during storage and use. Some of them also have been evaluated in the field for their ability to reduce diarrheal and other waterborne diseases among users. Because of the importance of education, socio-cultural acceptance, changing people\'s beliefs and behaviors, achieving sustainability and affordability in the provision of safe water, some of the most promising household water treatment and storage systems and their implementation strategies include or are accompanied by efforts to address these considerations.\nThe purpose of this report is to critically review the various candidate technologies and systems for providing microbiologically improved household water and to identify the most promising ones based on their technical characteristics and performance criteria. These characteristics and performance criteria are: effectiveness in improving and maintaining microbial water quality, reducing waterborne infectious disease, technical difficulty or simplicity, accessibility, cost, socio-cultural acceptability, sustainability and potential for dissemination. The focus of this critical review is on technologies and systems to protect water during storage collection and use, improve the microbial quality of the collected water, and thereby reduce pathogen exposure and risks of diarrheal and other waterborne diseases. This is not intended to be a comprehensive review of water treatment methods that reduce and thereby minimize exposures to various chemical contaminants. While toxic chemicals in drinking water are an important public health concern, it has been repeatedly demonstrated and generally accepted that the most important and immediate risks to human health by using contaminated drinking water are those from enteric microbes of fecal origin or other sources. Hence, the focus herein is on strategies and systems for protection and improvement of the microbiological quality of household water and prevention and control of waterborne microbial diseases. However, some of the technologies that reduce waterborne microbes also reduce certain toxic chemicals, such as arsenic.\n2. Purposes and Benefits of Household Water Treatment and Storage\nThe purposes of household water treatment and storage addressed in this review are those intended to improve and maintain the microbial quality of the water for drinking and other potable purposes, such as food preparation and essential hygiene in child care and treatment of illness (breast feeding and preparation of infant foods and oral rehydration solutions) and thereby reduce disease transmission. The main benefit of microbiologically safe water for these purposes should be obvious: reducing the risks of diarrheal and other waterborne infectious diseases. The alternative, unsafe water, is a major source of pathogen exposure and increased risk of waterborne infection, illness and death. Hence, the provision of microbiologically safe household water has the potential to reduce the infectious burden of the developing world\'s population. Recent estimates put this burden at 4 billion cases of diarrhea and 2.2 million deaths annually, mostly in children under five years of age. A compelling reason to accept and promote treatment and safe storage of collected household water to improve microbial quality is the ability of this health-related intervention to reduce the infectious disease burden of the user population. Notably, it is now well documented that the provision of safe water alone will reduce diarrheal and other enteric diseases by 6 to 50%, even in the absence of improved sanitation or other hygiene measures. Reducing household diarrheal disease by more than 5% is an important achievement, because this is the minimum achievable target reduction in disease burden considered worthy of promotion and implementation by health authorities. Furthermore, as will be documented later in this report, reductions in diarrheal disease burdens in excess of 5% by household water treatment and safe storage have been achieved for children under 5 years of age. This outcome clearly shows that children under age 5 are protected by the intervention of household treatment and safe storage of collected water, despite the likely opportunities for transmission of these diarrheal disease agents by other exposure routes. Hence, treating water at the household level and storing it safely to improve microbial quality apparently reduces the frequency and magnitude of encounters of children under age 5 with diarrheal pathogens in the home.\nAlthough the combined roles of safe water and adequate hygiene and sanitation in reducing diarrheal and other diseases are clear and well documented, there is uncertainty and even debate over the magnitude of the contribution of safe water to this outcome (Esrey et al., 1985; 1991). Some studies have suggested that improved hygiene and sanitation are more important than safe water in reducing diarrheal and other water-borne and water-washed diseases (US Agency for International Development, 1993). In the minds of some, the provision of safe water alone is unlikely to result in reductions of diarrheal and other infectious diseases. This is because the other transmission routes of these potentially waterborne diseases, such as person-to-person contact, food, fomites and vectors are not being controlled and continue to be major sources of pathogen transmission. Hence, it is assumed that provision of microbiologically safe water alone will have little or no beneficial effect on infectious disease transmission in the absence of improved sanitation and other hygiene measures. This assumption is now known to be incorrect. Recent studies of only safe water interventions clearly document not only the improved microbiological quality of household water but also significant reductions in diarrheal disease (Handzel, 1998; Mintz et. al., 2001; Quick, 1997; Quick et. al., 1999; Semenza et. al., 1998). This beneficial effect is especially achieved when the technological intervention for improved household water treatment and storage is supported by educational and motivational efforts to transfer the technology and develop individual and community understanding and support to maintain compliance and assume responsibility for its continued use and dissemination. It is also clear that the combined roles of safe water and adequate hygiene and sanitation are likely to achieve the greatest reduction in infectious disease burden compared to either intervention alone. However, it is now apparent that improving household water collection, treatment and storage is one option for achieving a beneficial health effect by reducing diarrheal and other infectious diseases. Household water treatment and storage systems are one of many waster, sanitation and hygiene options that deserve due consideration in the identification, prioritization and implementation of water, sanitation and hygiene measures for use at household, community and regional levels.\nIt is assumed that treated community water supplies in developed countries generally are of high microbiological quality and therefore safe with respect to waterborne microbial disease risks. However, significantly increased risks of waterborne gastrointestinal illness have been attributed to a centralized community water supply system in a large city of a developed country (Laval, Quebec, Canada) where water was extensively treated by modern methods and met all microbial quality requirements (Payment et al, 1991; 1996). These findings suggest that pathogens at levels below detection but high enough to cause measurable gastrointestinal illness either penetrated the multiple treatment barriers or they entered the treated water subsequently in the community distribution system or within household plumbing. Hence, even extensively treated community drinking water of high microbiological quality and assumed to be of low risk in developed countries may still be contributing significantly to community diarrheal illness. It is noteworthy that the apparent risks of waterborne diarrheal illness from the treated community water delivered by the distribution system were significantly decreased either by point-of-use water treatment or by protecting the treated water from post-treatment contamination (i.e., bottling it at the treatment plant and delivering the bottles to consumers). Additionally, the infectious disease risks from fecally contaminated and microbially unsafe water in developed countries is considered even greater in the water supplies of smaller communities than the larger ones. Small community water supplies are at greater risk than larger ones because they often lack the technical expertise and financial resources to adequately protect source waters, provide sufficient and technically reliable treatment and maintain the integrity of their distribution systems. For example, most waterborne outbreaks in the United States of America are due to systems with no or inadequate treatment, vulnerable watersheds and aquifers, distribution system deficiencies and serving smaller communities. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that in communities throughout the world, improving household water quality by point-of-use treatment reduces risks of diarrheal disease and significantly improves microbial quality.\nIn this review the candidate technologies and approaches for household water treatment and storage are examined on the basis of their technical feasibility, practicality and availability, effectiveness in improving the microbiological quality of the water and reducing waterborne disease, cost, and potential for sustainability and dissemination.']"	['<urn:uuid:13de1ab7-4f3b-495e-b350-de0db632b3d6>', '<urn:uuid:0795cb48-6c54-4684-938f-49762dc1a982>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	32	82	3838
18	How do process models help control automation, and what security measures protect them?	Process models help control automation by using mathematical relationships of relevant parameters, combining historical data with stoichiometric relationships to predict and optimize performance. They can serve as diagnostic tools to identify divergences between theoretical and actual plant performance. For security protection, these automated systems require risk assessment methodologies that include hazard identification, risk analysis, and implementation of control measures. This involves evaluating potential threats, determining who may be harmed, deciding on precautions, and continuously reviewing and updating security measures to protect against evolving cyber threats.	['Do-it-yourself model-based control\nWhen regulatory control can’t do the job, and you can’t find an off-the-shelf APC package, your only option may be to build your own. It’s not easy, but it can be done and good ones can make a world of difference.\nThere can be situations where conventional regulatory control might not run a process optimally and your company management might want to try some variation of advanced process control (APC). While there are various sub-groups under this umbrella, one common approach is model predictive control (MPC), also more generically known as model-based control. This method uses a mathematical model of a process connecting relationships of relevant parameters.\nBuilding such a model begins with an understanding of what is actually happening to the feedstocks as they are turned into final products. This includes chemical reactions, energy balance, reaction times, and so on. For some processes, it is possible to purchase existing process models that can be added to your control system. The more common the process, the greater likelihood that you will be able to buy one off the shelf. For example, there are many plants that make ethanol from corn and there are basic similarities from one location to another, so there are multiple model platforms available.\nHowever, if your need is more specialized, a pre-packaged solution may simply not be available. In those situations, one option is creating your own process model to drive your DCS. This kind of project is not for the faint of heart, but at the same time it is not impossible. Those who have participated in such projects suggest that the most critical factor for success is deep knowledge of the process and experience with the individual plant.\nMost models applied to a working plant use actual historical data combined with basic stoichiometric relationships. “There are two different mindsets,” says Chad Harper, CAP, PMP, director of technology for Maverick Technologies. “For one, you can use a recipe scenario where the process may be so deterministic that some first principles approach can be pulled together and get you where you want to be. The other one applies inferred properties using first principles to look at key variables in the plant and go through a regression process utilizing the plant data. You’re looking for the actual plant dynamic models to be able to put in there. We’ve done both.”\nIn either case, Harper warns that the model has to be adapted to the specific plant in question since every process unit has its own operating peculiarities. He adds, “Even if you can model something in a steady state environment you can rarely say, ‘Here are the numbers that I want to be at. Go!’ Process dynamics, closed-loop control behavior, and bumpless activation all have to be accounted for.”\nThe approach may be based on the information and resources available in a given situation, effectively using what you have to work with. Ric Snyder, senior product manager, information software and process business at Rockwell Automation, suggests, “Some people like to build empirical models because they have lots of data. Others like to do equation-based models because they have some chemical engineering knowledge or first principles models available. For building the models themselves, there are lots of dynamic identification toolkits that people can use, so once you’ve identified a specific tool and you have the data, building the model or regressing the parameters out of the data is not particularly difficult, it’s more the judgment of knowing what inputs I need and what are the outputs that I think I can predict. This is where some degree of chemical engineering knowledge and background is crucial in order to get good models. It’s more about defining what the model structure should be and what things should relate to that.”\nOne way to create a model is to do it first using a process simulator as a means to test your assumptions. When the simulator is working, you can see how closely it follows actual plant operation and vice versa.\n“In process plants, you don’t have the luxury of trial and error,” says Tony Lennon, industry marketing manager for industrial automation at MathWorks. “A plant manager’s real job is to make sure product is being shipped out the door while dealing with safety considerations, damage to equipment, downtime, and so on. Simulation is a means of making good design and implementation decisions, so when you do go to the plant manager, you can show what you’ve done with the simulation, reproduce the error, and say, ‘We need to try this,’ and then explain why you think it’s going to work.”\nLennon warns that simulations can’t be created in a vacuum but must reflect the reality of a specific plant environment. “If you’re going to use a simulation tool, you have to model what is happening in your plant today,” he adds. “If you haven’t done that, then don’t even continue because you haven’t captured the real dynamics of your plant. The most effective way to do that is to combine real process data in some sort of system identification process along with some type of first principles model.”\nDealing with problems\nEvery process unit has its quirks. Even if all the equipment is functioning correctly, there are still upsets, non-linear elements, and bottlenecks that challenge operators. An effective model should be able to ride through those by including some feedback element to account for un-modeled disturbances.\n“I’ve done several implementations of an octane control on a catalytic reformer in a refinery,” Harper says. “There’s an analyzer, but it’s about 45 minutes down the train, so it’s calculating the octane coming out of a reformer based on all sorts of variables, including the feed rates, quality of the feed stocks, and several other things. A model-based controller has been successful in a refinery that might be doing all manner of crude stocks, sweet, sour, and it still rides through those. But it’s a pretty complex model because it covers all the different scenarios and everything’s been regressed through the model itself. It took some time to set up correctly and a good bit of work, but if you can do it, you’ve created an exceptionally valuable controller. It’s probably one of the best returns on investment a plant can make.”\nA simulation can serve as a diagnostic tool, showing where theoretical and actual plant performance characteristics diverge. Lennon says the idealized world can point to flaws in the real one: “If a plant is designed properly to produce a certain capacity per day, bottlenecks will be in the physical system. You have 8-in. pipelines and you can only flow so much through the control valves and heat exchangers. So say you’re in a plant start-up, and you expect a certain output per day, and you aren’t achieving that when you reach steady state. Every time you try to ramp up, you start to get dynamic instability in the system. You can use the process model to investigate how you’re actually controlling the system. In that case, if you’ve done the physical sizing of the plant properly, I would believe that you’ve done something wrong in the control system. Maybe some of your control elements or field instruments are not behaving properly. That’s where you would compare data from the real plant to what the simulation said it should be. If everything is sized properly for that level of output, you need to go back to the control system to see why you’re not able to reach your desired output.”\nOnly as good as your people\nWhile there is no argument that model-based controllers can operate very successfully, if you’re going to create your own, they will only be as good as the individuals you have doing the work. Like many improvements you might try, if your engineers don’t understand what’s happening, you can’t count on a positive outcome no matter how sophisticated your tools are. “Coming up with a simulation model does take a degree of experience with the actual process,” Lennon explains. “We can’t replace experience. We can give great tools that allow somebody with experience to say, ‘We understand that once this tank is full, you can’t put any more in it.’ You can’t trade experience for a software package.”\nSnyder agrees: “There’s no substitute for good practical knowledge and experience. Nobody becomes an MPC guru overnight or even within a year or two. There’s still a lot of art, even though there is lots of mathematics and lots of science in there. A lot of things you learn by doing.”\nHot water heater as process example\nHere’s a simple demonstration: consider a gas-fired, 50-gal hot water heater, as you might have in your home. Most designs are simple and have a thermostat that turns the fixed burner on and off in response to the water temperature at the outlet. A more sophisticated design might use a PID controller that can modulate the burner in response to the outlet temperature as the key process variable. This approach might not be effective ultimately if you need critical control of the outlet temperature. With the large volume in the tank, the process could be sluggish since it might take a long time to change the temperature of that much water. For example, say the inlet temperature goes down 20 °F. By the time the sensor at the outlet recognizes the change, the temperature in the tank may have fallen significantly.\nOne approach might be to create a model of the process. Here are a few of the main elements we need to quantify or measure continuously:\n- Outlet water temperature, which is our primary process variable\n- Inlet water temperature, which determines how much the temperature has to change\n- Flow rate, which determines the volume we have to heat\n- Burner output, which is a function of natural gas feed and our only control effort\n- Heat transfer ability of the tank, which is non-linear since there is a fixed surface area, and\n- Heat loss through the walls of the tank.\nThe process model quantifies all those relationships, and as long as each variable can be measured, performance should be predictable. If the flowrate is 2 gpm and the temperature change from inlet to outlet is 100 °F, we can calculate the amount of heat we need and therefore the amount of gas. Non-linear elements such as the tank’s ability to capture heat and loss through the sides, can be built into the calculations. As those variables move around, the model should respond and keep the outlet temperature stable. If we’ve done a good job, it will be able to respond to changes quickly and track to the setpoint more accurately than simple regulatory control.\nPeter Welander is a content manager for Control Engineering. firstname.lastname@example.org\n- Advanced process control can helps situations where regulatory control is inadequate.\n- Creating a process model using mathematical tools can help run the controller and serve as a diagnostic tool.\n- The accuracy of your model and its ability to control depends heavily on the skill of your people.\nRead more about APC below:', 'Figure 1: Top 15 cyber threats (source: ENISA)\nAutomation and emergent cyber-security threats\nAutomation is the key factor that will be increasingly present in the factories of the future. By definition, automated systems are characterized by a set of software and hardware components that allows computer systems, network devices or machines to function without any manual intervention. Processes are completely automated with the help of control loops and special logic: these systems use several events as input and perform operations based on conditional decision-making and specific control logic. Therefore, operations can be performed without a human operator physically located at the site where the system is installed.\nThis type of systems is used in a wide range of applications, such as control and monitoring systems, data security applications, factory automation systems, automated message response systems, autonomous vehicles etc.\nThe rise in automation leads to significant advantages in economic and safety terms. Some of the benefits are the elimination of the risk of human errors, the improvement of user productivity, the development of standardized operations and a greater operations management. At the end of the processes, the accuracy and precision of the final job is even greater in most of the cases.\nA crucial issue of automated systems is without doubts the high security standards that these devices must guarantee; in fact, they are exposed to spam, virus and security threats, therefore they need a certain degree of protection. Regarding cyber security, threats against automation networks are indiscriminate, but they can carry potentially destructive results. Examples of attacks are network spoofing and denial of service which can cause the loss of process alarms and, indeed, potential serious safety issues which can cause damages to the system itself but also to the external environment (other systems, workers, etc.).\nAn example of a cyber threat against operation technologies that caused significant material, economic and reputational damages was the Stuxnet computer virus . It caused the destruction of the uranium enrichment centrifuges in IRAN through legitimate commands (syntactically and semantically correct) but incorrect for the functioning of the system. The purpose of the software was the sabotage of Iran’s Natanz nuclear power plant. In particular, the virus had to disable the centrifuges of the plant, preventing the detection of malfunctions and the presence of the virus itself.\nThe Stuxnet architecture is extremely complex with three large modules: a worm that damages PLCs and allows the software to self-replicate on other machines, a link that runs the copies created by the worm and a rootkit that hides the virus making it undetectable.\nTo be successful, a cyber-attack against an automated system must learn the information on the targeted plant and its operating methods. This information is acquired by the malware through sniffing operations that is passive interception of data passing through the network in a prolonged first phase in which operation is dormant. An example is Blackenergy3 which was found to be installed and dormant in some control systems of various American utilities for at least 5 years. Indeed, latency is a weakness for this type of attack as there is the possibility that the malware can be identified during normal verification operations, sometimes even fortuitously as recently occurred in Saudi Arabia where investigations to determine the causes of a fire caused the discovery of dormant malware (which had no implications for the fire).\nRisk Assessment as a countermeasure\nRisk Assessment is a methodology aimed at identifying hazards and risk factors that have the potential to cause harm (hazard identification), analyzing and evaluating the risk associated with that hazard (risk analysis, and risk evaluation), and determining appropriate ways to eliminate the hazard, or control the risk when the hazard cannot be eliminated (risk control). Indeed, Risk Assessment can represent a useful weapon against cyber-security threats as main tool for prevention.\nThe aim of the risk assessment process is to evaluate hazards, then remove that hazard or minimize the level of its risk by adding control measures, as necessary. By doing so, a safer and healthier workplace has been obtained. The goal is to try to answer the following questions: what can happen and under what circumstances? What are the possible consequences? How likely are the possible consequences to occur? Is the risk controlled effectively, or is further action required?\nAssessments should be done by a competent person or team of individuals who have a good working knowledge of the situation being studied. Include either on the team or as sources of information, the supervisors and workers who work with the process under review as these individuals are the most familiar with the operation.\nIn general, a risk assessment is developed following the five following steps :\nStep 1: Hazards identification\nHazards can be identified by using a high number of techniques: one of the most common remains interviewing operators and make safety audits and test on the examined systems. Moreover, database could be useful to carry out further analysis on external factors, e.g. identify most frequent cyber threats.\nStep 2: Definition of who may be harmed and how\nOnce hazards have been identified the hazards, the relative levels of risks must be evaluated. It is necessary to understand which component of the system can be damaged, which services can be affected and which level of business disruption could be caused by the cyberattack.\nStep 3: Evaluate the risks and decide on precautions\nOnce hazards have been identified, the step consists of the completely remotion of the associated risks. When it is not possible, then certain control measures should be put in place. A risk assessment matrix is one of the possible methods to quantitatively measure the level of risk and residual risks, but evaluation is growing more and more accurate through forefront methodologies, data analysis, modelling and AI algorithms.\nStep 4: Record findings and implement them\nSignificant findings should be recorded. These findings should include the hazards identified, the risk level estimated, the likelihood and potential impact of each threat, the potential mitigation effect of countermeasures etc.\nStep 5: Review risk assessment and update if necessary\nRisk assessment must be periodically reviewed and updated. Changes could be in terms of new equipment, substances, and or tasks, that have been introduced since the last assessment took place. In case of significant changes on past risk assessments, a new assessment is necessary to consider new hazards, as well as possible control measures that should be introduced.\nNew findings for Risk Assessment of Automated Systems\nThreats mitigation and the improvement of the security levels in the field of automated electronic systems is a widely discussed topic. As a consequence, several methodologies have been developed in order to implement a valid risk analysis in the best possible way. A first help for the identification and mitigation of risks affecting information and automated systems could be provided by software applications. For instance, applications could be designed for the use with a database containing historical data on errors and risks, as well as an approach based on risk assessment and neutralization. This allows excluding the most serious risks at the earliest stages of the life cycle of the information system, while focusing on those that are considered relevant for the examined system.\nBeing automated systems domain very broad, targeted methodologies have been developed to respond to needs of a certain sector. For what concerns Automated Driving (AD) systems, new concepts have been recently introduced, such as a state-of-the-art framework for cyber-security analysis, known as Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA). It quantifies the likelihood and the impact of attack and combines them in order to derive an attack risk value. A novelty that could be introduced is the bespoke integration of the impact calculation, which incorporates the notion of controllability of an attack by the AD system and/or by the driver . While, for instance, in the Robotic field researchers have proposed an “Attacker” model and they have confronted it with the minimal set of requirements that industrial robots should honour: precision in sensing the environment, correctness in execution of control logic, and safety for human operators. It has been demonstrated that the modelled attacker can subvert such requirements through the exploitation of software vulnerabilities, leading to severe consequences that are unique to the robotics domain .\nThe combination of all studies relating to risk assessment for the various automated systems are useful and crucial to the design of any system and the result will be a safer overall environment for the users to operate, as well as resilient and protected equipment to safeguard continuity of operations and economic value of assets.\n Josh Fruhlinger, “What is Stuxnet, who created it and how does it work? | CSO Online,” 2017. https://www.csoonline.com/article/3218104/what-is-stuxnet-who-created-it-and-how-does-it-work.html.\n Health and Safety Executive, “Risk Assessment: A Brief Guide To Controlling Risks In The Workplace,” Toxicol.

19	project manager wants understand how to slice and organize software errors for better testing management	Errors can be tracked and organized in two main ways: 1) Errors by cause - categorizing similar errors together, such as program errors, documentation errors, or operator errors. This helps identify common issues that can be addressed more vigorously. 2) Errors by subsystem - tracking which parts of the system have unusually high numbers of errors, which helps determine where more testing focus is needed.	['Collecting metrics is the best way to know whether a process is under control and within overall tolerances. The testing process is no different. If you have a large or complex project, you should collect testing metrics to ensure that the process is going well and accomplishing its objectives.\nAs an example, one of the objectives of testing is to catch as many errors as possible. However, you should expect that the more testing you perform, the fewer errors you will catch over time. If your metrics show that you continue to uncover more and more errors over time, it probably means you have some fundamental development processes that are out of control.\nThe place to start\nThe collection of testing metrics starts after the unit testing. Unit testing is too unpredictable and too unstructured to make much sense from a metrics standpoint. However, the following metrics can be captured from integration testing through the end of the testing process.\n- Total errors uncovered: This is strictly a count of each error uncovered. By itself, it does not have as much meaning as when it is combined with other information for analysis.\n- Total errors by week: This measure gives an overall sense for how the testing process is going. You would expect that a vast number of errors would get caught in the early stages of testing. As time goes by, the number of errors uncovered per week should decrease. You may never reach a point were you find no more errors, but the team cannot complete testing if the number of errors is not tapering down close to zero.\n- Number of hours spent correcting errors per week: This metric provides a sense for the relative complexity of errors caught in testing. Early in the testing process, you may encounter errors that are time consuming to correct. However, as the testing cycle proceeds, the time that you spend correcting errors should decrease.\n- Error correction hours per error uncovered: This metric is similar to the prior metric. As you get further and further into the testing process, you should find that the time required to fix the typical error is getting shorter and shorter. If you uncover late errors that are time consuming to correct, it is usually a sign that the errors trace back to problems in the design or business requirements phases.\n- Number of completed test cases/total number of test cases: This metric gives the team a sense for how much work has been completed and how much is remaining.\n- Budget vs. actual effort, cost, and duration: These are standard metrics that point out how the project team is executing the testing process vs. the original estimates.\n- Total testing cost/effort vs. total development cost/effort: This metric provides some perspective on how one project spends its development time vs. other projects. If the average project spends 25 percent of its time in testing and your project spent 35 percent in testing, it might point out certain inefficiencies.\nSlicing and dicing the errors\nError tracking can be tracked in a number of ways. They are all ways to provide further information to help in making decisions on how the testing process is going and where to focus the team’s testing time.\n- Errors by cause: The project team can track and categorize errors that are similar in nature. For instance, program errors will probably account for most errors in the beginning, but you may find later that errors can be traced to poor documentation or operator errors. Errors that are coming from a common cause can be attacked more vigorously.\n- Errors by subsystem: If a small number of subsystems have an unusually high number of errors, it can be a sign that more focus needs to be placed in those particular areas.\nProduction defect metrics\nProblems uncovered in the testing process are referred to as errors. Once the application goes into production status, these same problems are referred to as defects.\n- Number of defects in production: This is an important metric to determine the overall effectiveness of the testing process. In a perfect world, an application would have no errors when it is implemented in production. However, there are always some. Counting these errors gives a sense of the stability of the system. You can capture similar metrics after implementation as you did during the testing process. For instance, you can capture the number of errors per week, which should decline over time, and the number of hours to fix production errors, which should also decline over time.\n- Production downtime: This metric measures the amount of time an application is down because of errors. This can show the business pain caused by production defects.\n- Cost of defects: This metric measures the cost of defects uncovered in production. This can include the cost of fixing the defects and the cost of people and resources that are idled or underutilized because of the downtime.\nMeasurement is the key\nThe only way to really know how your testing is going is to measure it. Here is what you should keep in mind as you keep track of your testing.\n- Testing metrics should be captured to provide a sense for how the entire testing process is progressing.\n- The most important component of testing metrics is the capturing of the number of errors. In addition, further information can be gathered as to the cost and effort associated with correcting the errors. With this information, valuable insight can be gathered into whether the testing process is under control or not.\n- Much of the same information that is captured during the testing process can also be gathered after the application goes into production. At that point, problems should continue to be tracked as defects.']	['<urn:uuid:40022e69-3449-42c6-a617-395576c58e82>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	15	65	969
20	When should athletes start prevention and for how long?	Prevention should ideally start at ages 12-14, though some suggest ages 6-12 for developing good habits and proper technique. The benefits are optimized when preventive programs continue throughout the playing season, rather than just preseason. Studies show 6 weeks of intervention with three weekly sessions decreased serious knee injuries in the following season.	"['A series of studies published by Dr. Noyes and researchers at the Noyes Knee Institute have shown that several sports-specific training programs were proven effective in improving athletic performance indicators. The programs were all developed using Sportsmetrics ( http://www.sportsmetrics.org) as a base. Sportsmetrics was the first ACL injury prevention program published in the medical literature in 1995 that was shown to significantly reduce the incidence of noncontact ACL injuries in female athletes. Since then, Dr. Noyes and researchers have continually improved the program and now combine the ACL injury prevention aspects with athlete performance components for basketball, soccer, volleyball, and tennis players. Training is performed 3 times a week for 6 weeks and consists of a dynamic warm-up, jump/plyometric training, strength training, sports-specific speed/agility drills, and flexibility exercises. Athletes undergo a series of tests before the first training session and after the final training session. The training requires supervision by certified coaches/trainers, but only minimal equipment.\nThe Sportsmetrics Tennis program was initially published in 2010 and a follow-up report will appear in the Journal of Athletic Enhancement in early 2015. This represented the first tennis-specific training program for junior players (not playing on a national level) published in any medical journal. A group of 42 junior players (31 females, 11 males) participated in the program, and a subset of 15 players participated in multiple training sessions an average of 9 months apart. For all players, statistically significant improvements were measured for speed, agility, dynamic single-leg balance, and abdominal endurance. Players who participated in multiple programs continued to improve, although the magnitude of the improvements were smaller than those obtained from the first training program.\nThe Sportsmetrics Soccer program was studied in a group of 124 female athletes aged 12-18 years. The supervised program was conducted on soccer fields and weight rooms in Cincinnati area high schools. After completion of the program, significant improvements were measured in agility, aerobic power, speed, and vertical jump height. The athletes also improved their landing skills and positioning on a drop-jump test, which we believe reduces the risk of sustaining a noncontact ACL injury.\nThe Sportsmetrics Basketball program was analyzed in 57 female high school players. Training was conducted in high schools before the beginning of the season. The athletes significantly improved their aerobic power and vertical jump height, along with their landing skills and positioning on a drop-jump test. Aerobic fitness is paramount in basketball because players will experience fatigue as the game progresses that can negatively affect performance.\nThe Sportsmetrics Volleyball program was conducted in 34 high school female athletes. The supervised sessions lasted 90-120 minutes and were held before the start of the high school season. After training, significant increases were measured in aerobic power, vertical jump height, and abdominal strength. Approximately 70% of the athletes improved in these tests. Significant improvements were also found in landing skills and positioning on a drop-jump test\nBarber-Westin SD, Hermeto A, Noyes FR: A six-week neuromuscular and performance training program improves speed, agility, dynamic balance, and core endurance in junior tennis players.

J Strength Conditioning Research 24: 2372-2382, 2010.', '- Prevention -\nAlthough some may perceive sports-related injuries to be unavoidable and simply a part of the game, these occur in predictable patterns and many are preventable through the implementation of targeted interventions. As detailed previously, the two most problematic injuries in basketball are related to the ankle and knee. As a result, numerous studies had been conducted to evaluate different intervention strategies and different protective equipment in preventing injuries of these body parts.\nThere is no standardized intervention program established to prevent lower limb injury. The common traits of alternative effective protocols include a combination of the following elements: 1) preseason conditioning, 2) education, and 3) proprioceptive balance training programmes (functional training). The use of protective equipment in injury prevention is still partially inconclusive and requires further assessment. \n1) Preseason conditioning\nPreseason conditioning is used to develop flexibility, strength, power, sport-specific fitness and training technique (e.g. to learn how to avoid common injury mechanism). The benefit appears to be optimized when the preventive programme is continued throughout the playing season.\nUsing a sample of female soccer, volleyball and basketball players, it was found that 6 weeks of preventive intervention (three sessions a week) decreased the number of serious knee injuries over the next sporting season.  Furthermore there is evidence that showed significant reductions in ankle sprain also, after introduction of preventive programmes in volleyball. Similarly preventive programmes in football (soccer) produced a 50-75% reduction in injuries in general and a significant reduction in ACL injuries. \nEducation to athletes, coaches and sports federations is very important. Effectiveness of injury prevention strategies and safety promotion in sports depends on the compliance to advice from sports medicine specialists. Important challenge is to convince coaches and athletes to accept existing knowledge and to put it into practice. They sometimes show scepticism in the field with questions ‘‘Are the exercises really worth doing? It takes 20 min; is it necessary to do this program every training session?\'\' These and similar doubts should be decreased showing evidence based data that prevention of some injuries is possible\n3) Proprioceptive training\nProprioceptive training has been used to prevent ankle sprains since this form of prophylaxis was first proposed in 1965. Most functional training protocols consisted of stability and postural control exercises.  It is a unique method of training, because it stimulates multiple planes of ankle movement on a weight bearing foot, an activity that would occur infrequently otherwise. Proprioceptive training often involves the use of devices such as tilt boards, ankle disks, balance boards, and so on, which demand use of the muscles that pronate and supinate the feet.  It was shown that proprioceptive training was more effective prophylactic measures for ankle sprains in basketball than orthosis. [3, 4]\n|Spain center Marc Gasol has his ankle taped before the game|\nThe prophylactic devices\nThe prophylactic devices, like taping and bracing/orthosis, is the most common preventive method used among athletes. The similarity of these devices is to wrap the ankle joint from the foot segment to the shank segment. Some studies suggested that these devices provided a mechanical support to resist the ankle inversion moment, but some suggested that it instead improved the proprioception and joint position sense and thus maintained a proper anatomical position during landing. Bracing and taping may have negative side effects (uncomfortable if not fitted properly, skin irritation, relatively high costs, etc.). \nThe effectiveness of these devices in reducing the ankle sprain injury rate was reported in numerous studies and its main merit is the improvement of the proprioceptive function of a previously injured ankle. [2, 5] Randomised clinical trials have reported that orthosis reduces the incidence of ankle sprains in previously sprained ankles, but not in previously uninjured ankles. The use of external support should be recommended for a period of 12 months after an ankle sprain, because the risk of reinjures is increased during the first year and the ligaments need about a year to heal properly and to regain their normal strength and proprioceptive ability after an ankle injury. \nPragmatists argue that the potential benefits of knee taping and bracing are related to enhancing sensorimotor control rather than providing mechanical constraint, but the evidence to support this remains contradictory. There is some evidence to show that knee bracing can enhance sensorimotor control in subjects with a history of knee injury, but the effect is lessened with more demanding functional tasks, and the clinical benefits of such small changes have also been questioned. It was found that the application of an elastic bandage can enhance joint positional sense in knees with an ACL tear, and it supports the use of knee bracing in preventing re-injury. Generally there is no consistent evidence of effectiveness for knee bracing in reducing knee injury in adult and adolescent athletes. \nWhen to start prevention of injuries?\nMany preventive programs are targeted toward athletes aged from 15 to early twenties. It is possible that the implementation of injury prevention programs would be more beneficial at an earlier age; according to some authors we should put most effort into prevention from 12-14 years. From a motor learning aspect even age 6-12 might be important in relation to develop ‘‘good habits\'\' (good warm-up routines and movement patters) and to establish correct playing technique.\nFor more detailed information you can download the fact sheet ""Preventing injuries in Basketball"" here\n1.

21	lean six sigma kaizen differences continuous improvement	Lean Six Sigma (LSS) and Kaizen represent different approaches to continuous improvement. LSS focuses on implementing comprehensive changes that can take years, with principles like 5S (sort, set, shine, standardize, sustain) and requires significant organizational transformation. Kaizen, on the other hand, emphasizes smaller, steady steps without requiring large investments or technological innovations. While LSS can be burdensome for smaller operations, Kaizen specifically targets developments that are less costly and demand pluralistic participation. Both philosophies share the goal of empowering employees and creating a culture of continuous improvement, but they differ in their implementation approach and scale of change.	['Creating an efficient manufacturing process is a difficult and time-consuming undertaking.\nIt’s a continuous process that can take literally hundreds of projects to achieve. Applying principles such as those associated with Lean Six Sigma (LSS) into an operational mindset can take years. Fully implementing some facets of LSS can be too burdensome, especially for smaller operations, but putting your own spin on the philosophy can still yield results. One key benefit is the adoption of an attitude of “continuous improvement” that can help companies of any size realize they can always do better and that everyone is responsible for making that happen.\nThis philosophy has been around for 30-plus years. It’s well-known in the industry that finding success in your efforts to introduce continuous improvement thinking is all about how employees are empowered to apply the principles themselves.\nPersuading Your Workforce to Choose Change\nOne of the biggest obstacles in any implementation is how employees react to the switch to a culture that embraces change. A lot of the literature on LSS dives right into all the principles and assumes that the high-level ideas are all common sense. But you just can’t assume a rollout of this philosophy will go smoothly at a company that’s never embraced it before. You must overcome that “change factor.”\nIn the Lean world, the key word is “monument,” which refers to any hard-to-move marker of the way things were done in the past. Just like any company can benefit from a continuous improvement mindset, every company also has to deal with monuments; you find them in people, in procedures and processes, and within departments. They don’t want to move. Sometimes you have to work around them, and sometimes you have to find a way to break them open and loosen them up.\n1. Continuous Improvement: Attack low-hanging fruit first to gain buy-in\nIf you can show those resistant to change that even small revisions can lead to big results early in your implementation process, they may come on board more quickly. Then they become more willing partners on future projects and become more involved in the process.\nSeveral little things can be done early in the rollout that can make such a big impact. Projects are generally most successful if they make someone’s job easier. For instance, a cumbersome process for how to deal with replacing scrap parts on the floor might involve filling out multiple forms, getting multiple approvals, and coordinating part pulls and inventory adjustments.\nWhen the entire process is laid out and examined, a manufacturer may find several unnecessary bottlenecks that can waste workers’ time in several departments. It’s this process of eliminating unnecessary tasks and reducing waste within a process often makes people’s jobs easier.\nIt doesn’t have to be an earth-shaking project that gets you started. At first, workers may need to be guided through the process of completing a project. Start with simple projects, and as you gain experience, and people understand they can participate in it and buy into the process, then projects can get larger and larger.\n2. Continuous Improvement: Empower employees to make and own processes\nThe great thing about LSS thinking is that there really aren’t any barriers for any company to set up projects to change processes and procedures their particular employees find cumbersome. If there is some aspect of a job that doesn’t make any sense, there’s probably either something that can be fixed within the process or an entirely new and improved process that can be created.\nEmployees know about their immediate processes, as well as how and what they do affects those processes before and after they’ve played their part. All workers across the company should strive to learn how they impact the big picture and think about how their routine activities affect how they and others do their jobs. This type of critical thinking is essential to find a better way to lay out a process that can affect one or several employees’ job functions.\n3. Continuous Improvement: Don’t limit the scope of what can be improved\nOne of the big principles of LSS is “5S” – sort, set, shine, standardize and sustain. LSS thinking is a more successful program if you’re able to sustain your successes. In the world of contract manufacturing, companies may have dozens of different jobs working their way through floor at any time, and that number of jobs and the jobs themselves often change rapidly.\nThe floor requires a degree of cleanliness and space to be able to move things. And when you need to move product or increase throughput to improve Takt times, you have to be able to move material. An operation that’s cluttered, with issues like benches that are too close together, restricts material flow, which slows throughput and makes it more difficult to meet Takt times.\nBut the scope of any operations project can be wider than just who and what are on the floor at any given time. LSS floor space projects can start when the building is first being designed and should involve employee-led teams. Employee leaders should weigh-in on even the seemingly small details like where lights and benches should be located.\nThere are some things within a facility that have to be fixed in a certain dedicated place, because of power needs, or pneumatic requirements, or the stationary nature of some machinery. But other factors like material flow, work area shapes, and dozens of other things must be reviewed to make an effective Day 1 plan for the floor. And team leaders should work together to reconfigure and continually reassess how to handle almost everything that isn’t bolted down within the facility.\n4. Continuous Improvement: Scale what works when you’re ready to do so\nWhen manufacturers start applying this kind of all-for-one philosophy to their production process, they can make improvements not only to the way things are down but also to the scale at which they’re done. If a customer suddenly asks for a massive increase in production to meet their own internal demands, a manufacturer will be better able to meet the increase if LSS standards and techniques and continuous improvement thinking are already in place. When a manufacturing line has been established using LSS techniques, it will be relatively easy to duplicate the production lines to increase throughput to meet Takt times.\nWith a sustained increase in production output over time (e.g., every week) the gains are clear to see and can lead to overall production gains that can be truly staggering. Manufacturers will only be able to tackle a large project like this after they’ve started ingraining the principles of LSS; once they’ve had the chance to earn buy-in from the entire team, project start-up times can decrease drastically.\nOnce you commit to continuous improvement, prep for the long haul.\nFostering this type of mindset within employees can take months—even years—to take hold and become the prevailing cultural attitude. And people tend to revert to what they know best, especially in crisis situations—which often means they fall back to processes they followed prior to Lean implementations. But employees enjoy working for a company where they’re empowered to have the revelations like, “Why the heck am I writing this report when it’s already in two different places in our database?” That worker may have just eliminated hours of waste per year for several people.\nEvery employee, in every position, has that moment at some point in time when they’re executing their roles. And that’s the attitude we foster with all employees: If there is a better way or a better idea, bring it up! If it doesn’t work, then try something else! That’s the attitude manufacturers want to project if they want their employees to keep opting in to a continuous improvement mindset.', 'The philosophy of working and self-improvement is called Kaizen, so that we can always do better with the desire to achieve perfection.\nFeeded by Japanese traditions, Kaizen was developed according to lifestyle and adapted to the business world and then spread all over the world. The improvement in Kaizen’s philosophy focuses not on the outcome. Kaizen offers small but steady steps to achieve better. This results in long-term results. However, the business world of the West focuses on moving fast and getting quick results. Increasing competition, especially with globalization, rapidly changing technology and increasing customer expectations require faster action.\nAlthough Kaizen is not a result-oriented process, it should be kept in mind that improvements in the process will affect the outcome. Considering the continuity of process-oriented improvement, we can accept that this improvement will be permanent and effective. In this way, the employees can see and understand the effects of the work they are doing and the process they carry out on the result more clearly. This increases participation and motivates employees. Continuous Improvement: Kaizen\nKaizen’s main objective is to enable companies to do better, faster and more costly work. All problems that hinder access to these objectives should be found and eliminated. Therefore, the first Kaizen principle to be acquired is to recognize that there are problems. Problems are not to live, but to unravel. In other words, there can be no improvement in the place where there is no problem. The first step in solving problems is to accept them and make them visible. However, the process is not completed by solving the problem. It is necessary to take the necessary measures to ensure that the solution is reinforced and standardized and not to happen again.\nSince Kaizen is an improvement approach, the changes that require very large investments and that require everything from the beginning do not take place in this process. Therefore, studies such as great breakthroughs, inventions or the application of technological innovations are not addressed in Kaizen’s philosophy. Instead, it is necessary to target developments that will be achieved with less costly, demanding, pluralistic participation.\nIn Kaizen philosophy, man is very important. First of all, the human being is defined as the element that will solve the problem, not as one of the causes of the problem. People are expected to contribute to the solution of the problem rather than blaming each other, regardless of their duties and titles. Continuous improvement is the task of all employees, not only of the quality circle members. First, people should take care of their problems and find solutions to these problems in order to address organizational problems. If there are internal problems, it should be assumed that the existing problems are everyone’s problem and everyone is responsible for the problem. In this respect, it is not an issue in a company managed with the principles of Kaizen, which is unclear because everyone will have the problem.\nKaizen is human oriented, but should not be a, super odak employee who thinks, plans and implements these improvements. Kaizen denies individual work, underlining that all activities must be done with a team work. The team’s understanding of the Kaizen philosophy and the use of techniques makes it possible for everyone to gain the ability to solve problems after a while.\nKaizen application process consists of four main steps;\n- In this step the goals of recovery are determined. When determining a target, economic gains should not be targeted. Keep in mind that the goal is not more profit, but more quality.\n- The choice should be made as simple as possible, with little investment.\n- A team should be formed. Kaizen teams may be between two and four persons depending on the size of the targets.

Committee Member Keywords\n- contact metamorphism\n- metamorphic petrology\n- activity diagrams\nDate of Defense 1998-08-21 Availability unrestricted AbstractVery high temperature (>900 °C) contact metamorphism and metasomatism of aluminous schist xenoliths in the mafic to ultramafic Cortlandt Complex, New York, resulted in formation of bodies of unusual Fe- and Al-oxide-rich rock called emery. During contact heating, disequilibrium thermal decomposition of the protolith schists in one closely examined xenolith produced two end-member materials: a quartzo-feldspathic water-undersaturated melt which partitioned much of the silica and calcium and all of the alkalis of the original schist; and a highly aluminous fine-grained emery residuum which contained spinel, magnetite, ilmenohematite, sillimanite, and sporadically corundum. During cooling, melt within the xenoliths was injected as cm-scale veinlets into the silica-poor solid residuum. Local increase in silica activity resulted in progressive silication reactions of spinel-rich residuum to several silicates. A simple model of progressive silication would require that reactions should occur from lower to higher silica content of product silicates in stages, e.g., spinel ⇒ sapphirine (Si/O=0.10), sapphirine ⇒ garnet (0.25), garnet ⇒ orthopyroxene (0.28), rather than directly from spinel to higher-silica minerals which would overstep intermediate reaction steps. However, observed reaction textures indicate the latter more complex behavior in which spinel may have reaction rims of, or occur as inclusions within, any of the three silicate minerals.\nStatistical analysis of several samples has shown the mode to be the spinel-orthopyroxene reaction rim boundary although orthopyroxene is the highest-silica product mineral, based on Si/O ratio. Chi-square test results are significant and show that the textural relations observed among spinel, sapphirine, garnet, and orthopyroxene are dependent. Increased silica activity therefore cannot be the only factor controlling the reaction sequence.\nMicroprobe data has been collected in an attempt to correlate mineral compositions with the different textural occurrences. The effects of local equilibria appear to be the dominant factors in the overstepping of sequential reactions. Qualitative activity-activity diagrams proved useful for examining the effects of bulk composition on the relative stabilities of spinel and the three silicates, including variations in Fe/(Fe+Mg), bulk Mn and Zn contents, and minor local variation in oxygen fugacity. Matrix spinel compositions (i.e., those not modified by reaction to silicates) fall into two groups: a more magnesian one containing spinels with average Fe/(Fe+Mg) (Fe#) of 0.49 and a less magnesian one, average Fe# of 0.67. With regard to this bulk compositional effect, the more magnesian composition should reduce garnet stability due to the strong fractionation of Fe into garnet, thus favoring the reaction of spinel to orthopyroxene within silica-rich areas. In more aluminous areas, spinel will react to form sapphirine, then garnet, then possibly orthopyroxene. A less magnesian composition would expand the stability of garnet at the expense of sapphirine and, to a lesser extent, orthopyroxene.\nZinc has a subtle effect on mineral stabilities. Because Zn is strongly partitioned into spinel, higher zinc contents (concentrations in some spinels are as high as 14.9 mol% gahnite) may expand the stability of that mineral considerably. Consequently, spinel stability may increase relative to the three silicates, but this may be quite variable due to variable reaction stoichiometry and different reaction-boundary slopes in the activity-activity diagram. In general, spinels with the highest Zn content occur next to orthopyroxene (ave. 4.9 mol% gahnite in spinels) for which the stability appears to be only slightly affected by this increase in Zn. The greatest decrease in silicate stability is observed in sapphirine. Spinels adjacent to sapphirine contain no more than 1.3 mol% gahnite.\nThe effects of manganese and oxygen fugacity were also examined. Mn increases the stability of garnet due to strong partitioning of Mn into this mineral. It can be inferred using statistical and chemical data that this has some bearing on textural relations in garnet-bearing samples, but the lack of obvious Mn fractionation by other minerals examined makes it impossible to interpret the effects of Mn in the garnet-free samples. Calculated ferric-ferrous ratios in analyzed minerals were examined in an attempt to study the effect of oxygen fugacity on the stabilities of minerals. In the more magnesian compositions, which may correlate with slightly higher fO2 during reactions, spinels should react to form sapphirine, then possibly garnet or orthopyroxene with further silica activity increase. In lower-fO2 environments (perhaps those with higher bulk Fe#), spinel should react directly to form orthopyroxene. The coexistence of magnetite and ilmenohematite dictates T-fO2 conditions very nearly at those of the Hematite-Magnetite buffer. Minor fO2 variations that might have had an effect on silicate-forming reactions would only be recorded by small variations in magnetite and ilmenohematite solid solutions (ulvospinel and ilmenite contents, respectively). These data were not acquired in this study, however, so no definite conclusions could be made.\nFilename Size Approximate Download Time (Hours:Minutes:Seconds)\n28.8 Modem 56K Modem ISDN (64 Kb) ISDN (128 Kb) Higher-speed Access Thesis.pdf 1.42 Mb 00:06:34 00:03:22 00:02:57 00:01:28 00:00:07\nIf you have questions or technical problems, please Contact DLA.""]"	['<urn:uuid:eb8406b0-f788-4893-8d73-4b60a475c481>', '<urn:uuid:f301856d-521a-4485-a416-1f0e0c4840b6>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	7	40	1798

It damages the environment through mining operations that tear up land and remove mountains, while coal washing and transport contaminate rivers. When burned, coal causes acid rain and is the largest human contributor to the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Health-wise, it is one of the main sources of lung disease globally. The effects extend beyond individual electricity costs, particularly impacting those dependent on the coal industry and the most vulnerable populations.	['Get exclusive early access to exhibitions and select events. Find out more today!\nApril 12, 2018 – June 3, 2018\nReflections is a site-responsive installation that utilizes sculpture, light, film, sound, as well as performed and embodied text.\nAs a term, reflection refers to both imagery and perceptions. Here, these themes also evoke the allegory of Plato’s cave, where people turn their backs on reality to see the world as its shadows, as illusions. Instead, this installation stages a cavernous space as a site for sensitizing viewers to the reality of their built environment and broad environmental dilemmas. Coal revolutionized our contemporary reality and human history. Nonetheless, more than any other energy source process activity, the mining, washing, transporting, burning, and disposing of coal, damages the environment. This fossil fuel tears up land, removes mountains, contaminates rivers and causes acid rain. It is one of the main sources of lung disease globally and the largest human contribution to the atmospheric greenhouse effect. The impact of coal far exceeds that of our individual electricity bills. Indeed, coal’s expenses are not only monetary because its uses take a toll on all of us—most especially those dependent on the coal industry and the least privileged and most vulnerable among us.\nUnpacking the history of this exhibition site, Irini Miga invites us to contemplate the passage of time as we view the Chute Space. Her work adjusts our eyes to the idiosyncrasies of these surroundings as a former storage room for coal.\nOn the short Super8 film, Longevity Was Not a Priority in The Autonomous Region of Light, we encounter a still life with a burning candle in front of a poster depicting wild horses. Such props are evocative of Americana and the exhibition space’s past use as not only a coal chute, but also a place for fixing horse carriages. Connecting the depletion of our natural resources and the periled status of the coal mining industry, this work conjures vanitas, a genre of still life that centers on perishable goods and symbolizes human greed as well as the fleeting character of human life. Playing on notions of ephemerality, the grainy quality of the video casts a moment in the present as one that belongs to the past.\nA suspended wall with ceramic inserts, Marks and Dents Were Always Part of This Picture, outlines select contours of the guts of a brick surface. Nodding to the visual language of coal’s various manifestations, the inserts contain anthracite dust. A hole in the backside of the wall makes visible a faint flickering light reminiscent of burning raw material.\nHanging from the pipe, a suspended lamp sheds light onto a bowl with hand-sculpted ceramic gloves and rocks. This beaming assemblage, Contracted by Light, recalls the arduous task of collecting coal in dark mines while gesturing to the accidents there that have cost countless human lives.\nA mop stands alone as a domestic element. As a sculpture, You Talk the Language of The Soil, speaks to the labor of cleaning the space and the ever-present danger of wiping away the past.\nIn a broken and unannounced way, a performance activates text during the opening. Spoken through the mouths of youth, the sounds of words will live momentarily and fade. The space and its visitors will absorb the audible text. Mixing past, present, and future, these sonic elements will act as seeds for further consideration.\nMiga grew up in Greece, a country on the line between the perceived East and West, where the distant past, present, and desired future coexist; so for her, seeing things through a prism of constant symbiosis became a norm early on. As an immigrant artist living and working in the United States, she finds humble, anti-monumental gestures and giving value to the minor and otherwise neglected of immense importance. In her practice she creates constellations of traces that ask for close examination. Marks of performative actions and traces of leftovers form a distinct understanding of what spatial identity or marking of time could be. Miga is interested in the way that we navigate and perceive our environments; in the language of objects that surround our everyday reality; in the dialogues and shifting relationships of axes such as time, physical space, form and utility; sculpture and painting. The implications of the Chute Space’s history compelled Miga to creatively acknowledge complicated environmental challenges of the past and present.\nIrini Miga (b. 1981, in Larissa, Greece) lives and works in New York. She has studied at the Athens School of Fine Arts, London’s Central Saint Martins College, and received her MFA from Columbia University, New York on a Fulbright grant.

Start studying metaphysical poetry, carpe diem poetry who is a famous metaphysical poet what is one of andrew marvell's more famous works."", ""You can e-mail us for a new question and answer.\nAnswer: Metaphysical poetry refers to a type of very intellectual poetry that was common in the 17th century. This type of poetry was known for bold and ingenious conceits, subtle thought and frequent use of paradox as well as the directness of language. Metaphysical poetry, in an etymological sense, is poetry on subjects which exist beyond the physical world.\nIn other words, it is a type of poetry dealing with abstract or philosophical subjects such as love, religion, God, beauty, faith and so on. But in reality the poetry which comprises the ideas or aspects that – physical love leading to spiritual union or religious, argumentative presentation of emotion, terseness of expression, use of conceit and wit in profusion, skillful use of colloquial language instead of Elizabethan lucid diction with the abrupt opening can be considered to be metaphysical. Originally the term ‘Metaphysical Poetry’ was coined by John Dryden and later popularized by Samuel Johnson and the features of the school which unite the various authors are quite numerous. As well as making widespread use of conceit, paradox and punning, the metaphysical poets drew their imagery from all sources of knowledge particularly from science, theology, geography and philosophy. However, John Donne is the founder of the school of metaphysical poetry and the other practitioners of the type of poetry are Crashaw, Cowley, Denham, Davenant, Herbert, Marvell, Vaughan and Waller.\nThe most striking quality of Donne’s poetry is the use of metaphysical conceit which is a figure of speech in which two farfetched objects or images of very different nature are compared. It surprises its readers by its ingenious discovery and delights them by its intellectual quality. Such conceits are available in his poetry. Such a famous conceit occurs in the poem titled “A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning”. The conceit reads as:\n“If they be two, they are two so\nA stiff twin compasses are two;\nThey soul, the fixed foot, makes no show\nTo move, but doth, if th’ other do.”\nHere in the poem the two lovers are compared to the two feet of a compass. The lover is compared to the moving foot and the beloved to the fixed foot consecutively to show the ideal relationship between them. It is made clear that in this relationship the woman’s part is passive and her place is in the home, while the man’s duty is to move in the world of affairs. She stays in the centre apparently unmoving, but certainly as the outer foot moves around describing the circle, the inner foot moves too, revolving on the point which is the centre. The two, in fact, move in harmony and neither is unaffected by the movement of the other. At first sight such a comparison seems to be impossible but after the discovery of the underlying meaning it delights the readers.\nAnother leading feature of Donne’s poetry is his dramatic presentation that arrests the attention of the readers very quickly. Like other famous poets, Donne has the capacity of opening a poem abruptly adding a dramatic quality to the poem. As we find such abruptness in opening the poem “The Canonization”. The line goes as:\n“For God’s sake hold your tongue, and let me love,\nOr chide my palsy, or my gout,”\nUpon reading or hearing those opening lines, we can easily understand that the poem begins somewhat in the middle of a conversation. Now the more we advance, the more clear it becomes that why the speaker of the poem makes such a request to the unidentified listener.\nClosely related to the dramatic directness and abruptness of opening is Donne’s dexterous use of colloquial speech. This dramatic quality is strengthened by its colloquial tone. In the song: “Go and Catch a Falling Star” we can trace such a quality:\n“Go, and catch a falling star,\nGet with child a mandrake root,”\nOn perusing the two lines we will see that like many other poems Donne has employed colloquial language to make the poem more lifelike. From the lines it is clear that a conversation is going on between two people.\nThrough all the love poems of Donne, there runs a belief that physical passion is a good thing and he recognizes the claim of body side by side with the souls. His love poems enhance its attraction and novelty by blending physical, spiritual and mystical love. Although there is a complexity in the poem, “The Ecstasy” Donne deals twin aspects of love - physical and spiritual; love here is concretized through physical enjoyment of sex and then turns in its pure essence, spiritual. The setting of the two lovers provides the physical closeness by their love is enriched by the mutual understanding of their souls and like heavenly beings that influence the actions of men through manifestation. The soul must express themselves through the bodies. The greatness of the poem lies in reconciling the opposites – physical love and spiritual love, the physical aspects of love must precede the spiritual union. Donne’s poetry lies far reconciling dichotomy between psychical and spiritual shifting quickly from the physical to the spiritual fashion.\n“The Sun Rising” is another poem illustrating the peculiar blend of passion and thought, feeling and ratiocination. The delight of satisfied love is the feeling in the poem, but it is expressed in intellectual terms and not merely in an emotional tone. How well the fusion of feeling and thought is expressed in the finality of:\n“She is all States, and all Princes, I\nNothing else is.”\nPassion is conveyed in images which are erudite, logical and of an intellectual nature. In the poem, we again see Donne’s ratiocinative style, reasoning step by step towards his conclusion, which in this case, is that love is self-sufficient and unaffected by outside force.\nTerseness is another characteristic of all the metaphysical poets. It is true in the case of Donne in particular. And the use of such terseness results in obscurity. Such compactness is traceable in “Go and Catch a Falling Star”.\nLives a woman true, and fair.”\nIn the compact idea Donne wants to show that just as it is impossible to catch a falling star in the sky, so a woman with both honesty and fairness is rare to find out as they first seem to be honest but later they are found to be different.\nIn addition to that, the poems “The Canonization”, “Twicknam Garden”, “A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning”, “Go and Catch a Falling Star” and “The Sun Rising” in one or other way deal with the abstract idea which is most dominating feature of the metaphysical poetry and is a must for this type of poetry.\nDonne was the greatest of the metaphysical poets. In some of their poems he was equaled by Vaughan and Marvell and in religious poetry by Herbert. But the body of his work is poetry of a quality which, when compared with that of any other of these poets, is unsurpassed. When his images are understood in their function of communicating a state of mind, and his ideas in their power to give expression to emotion, Donne’s poetry is appreciated for its wit, beauty and perception. In conclusion, considering all the characteristics of Donne’s poetry as discussed above, Donne can be regarded as a true metaphysical poet. Although he was considered a minor poet till the 20th century, he is regarded as one of the major English poets by T.S. Eliot and other major modern poets.\nIf this site is helpful, please like the page.\nA Doll’s House. Agamemnon. A Passage To India Bacon's Prose Style. Doctor Faustus. Donne as a metaphysical poet.

25	compare david carpenter and dave koz saxophone careers	David Aaron Carpenter and Dave Koz have had different paths in their musical careers. Carpenter, born in NYC in 1986, is known for classical viola performance, winning prestigious competitions like the 2005 Philadelphia Orchestra Young Artists Competition and receiving an Avery Fisher Career Grant in 2010. In contrast, Dave Koz, born in 1963 in California, is a smooth jazz saxophonist who started as a rock saxophonist before transitioning to smooth jazz in 1989. He has released multiple albums through Capitol Records and even received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2009.	"['When a new recording of the Bartók Viola Concerto crossed my desk recently it immediately caught my attention. Begun in 1945 and left incomplete at the time of his death – actually it was just a few sketches – this was the composer’s final composition. Although in the words of Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians Bartók’s assistant Tibor Serly’s completion of the concerto “cannot be considered definitive,” it has always been a favourite of mine. Motherland (Warner Classics 0190295697693 warnerclassics.com) features young superstar violist David Aaron Carpenter performing concertos by Dvořák, Bartók and Walton, plus a number of concerted works by Kiev-born, New York City resident Alexey Shor (b.1970) with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.\nCarpenter, born in NYC in 1986, has had a remarkable career, winning the 2005 Philadelphia Orchestra Young Artists Competition, the Walter W. Naumburg Viola Competition the following year and an Avery Fisher Career Grant in 2010. His first recording, Elgar and Schnittke concertos, was praised highly in these pages in October 2009 by Terry Robbins, and two subsequent outings met with similar attention in Robbins’ Strings Attached column in recent years. With that in mind, I had no qualms about holding back Carpenter’s latest recording for my own collection. Of course I had to start with the Bartók, and I was immediately transported back to the heights I first scaled when introduced to this work by Yehudi Menuhin’s performance with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Antal Dorati’s direction half a century ago. We’ll likely never know just how much of this atypical work is Bartók’s and how much that of Serly. Strangely though, it is a much more original work than Serly’s own Rhapsody for Viola and Orchestra which is replete with borrowings from his master. Carpenter’s stunning performance reminds us why, its questionable pedigree notwithstanding, this concerto is a staple of the viola repertoire.\nThe first CD (of two) opens with Joseph Vieland’s transcription of Dvořák’s masterful Cello Concerto, to which Carpenter has added his own refinements. It is very effective, but as a cellist I can’t help but notice that the power and anguish of the cello’s upper register, its chanterelle range, is not equalled when the viola plays the same pitches. That being said, it is still a captivating performance, with the orchestra under Kazushi Ono in fine form. Especially noteworthy are the horn solos. The second disc begins with William Walton’s concerto, which was commissioned by Lionel Tertis in 1929. Tertis was not convinced and declined to premiere the work but later, in words of Andrew Morris “was good enough to admit his mistake.” Tertis said: “The innovations in [Walton’s] musical language, which now seem so logical and so truly in the mainstream of music, then struck me as far-fetched.” To our modern ears it seems hard to imagine this lush and romantic work being received as anything but a masterpiece.\nThere is more than an hour of music by Shor dispersed across the two discs, and frankly I don’t know why. The inclusion of his Seascapes, a four-movement work for viola and orchestra, would have more than sufficed. His motion-picture soundtrack sensibility makes even the Dvořák and Walton sound modern, and the 13-movement Well Tempered Chanson, a compendium of encores written for Carpenter, seems like just too much dessert. The Bartók, however, is worth the price of admission.\nSpeaking of film scores and people named Shor(e)… last year Canadian superstar film composer Howard Shore took time out from his day job to compose a celebratory cantata to honour Canada’s sesquicentennial. Sea to Sea/D’un ocean à l’autre was commissioned by the New Brunswick Youth Orchestra (nbyo-ojnb.com) and was first performed on July 2, 2017 at the Canada 150 Stage, Riverfront Park, Moncton. That performance featuring New Brunswick’s pride and joy, soprano Measha Brueggergosman, and the Choeur CANADA150 Choir was recorded and is now available from Leaf Music (LM217 leaf-music.ca). With bilingual lyrics by Elizabeth Cotnoir, the nine-minute work opens with a horn fanfare to set the stage and then launches into jubilant praise for our fair land. After the bombastic opening there is a contemplative middle section gently declaring “We hold a vision.” The final section is a return to the opening exuberance, this time en français. The CD single also includes two “radio edit” versions, just under three minutes each, one in English and one in French.\nThe latest project from the 2016 Canadian Folk Music Awards Best Instrumental Group of the Year – Andrew Collins Trio – is the cleverly named pair of CDs Tongue and Groove (andrewcollinstrio.com). The first is a departure for the band, with 11 tracks featuring lead vocals by multi-mando frontman Collins for the most part, with harmonies and occasional lead lines provided by bass player James McEleney. The third member of the trio, Mike Mezzatesta, keeps busy on guitar, mandolin, fiddle and mandola. It’s an eclectic collection of traditional “down homey” numbers, novelty songs, cover versions and a few originals. Of particular note are Collins’ own reworking of Marijohn Wilkin and Danny Dill’s Long Black Veil and Roger Miller’s The Hat. But for me it is the instrumental disc Groove that really shines. Replete with some of the finest bluegrass pickin’ you’re likely to find this far north, there’s also a mix of styles, including some very Django-like vibes to which the double strings of Collins’ mandolin give a new twist, a beautiful lullaby and a couple of fiddle tunes. Standouts include Poplar Bluff, Kentakaya Waltz, Badabada Ba Ba and Big Toaster.\nIt seems that every month we receive a dozen or more CDs from the Parma Recordings group, which includes the labels Ravello, Big Round, Asonica and, in this case, Navona Records. Although my current activities as an amateur cellist are focusing on string-only ensembles, quartets and at the moment a trio, for many years I also played with pianists in the traditional piano trio formation – violin, cello and piano. Beginning with the classics, Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn (Felix and Fanny), Schumann (Robert and Clara), but eventually moving into the 20th century with Debussy, Shostakovich and contemporary Canadians including Colin Eatock and Daniel Foley – both of whom will be familiar to readers of The WholeNote – I spent countless hours exploring the repertoire with friends. So I was quite interested when a new double CD from Trio Casals, Moto Bello (nv6156 navonarecords.com) arrived. The Moto series “represents a curated collection of contemporary music by living composers with the traditional instrumentation of the acclaimed Trio Casals.” The group’s acclaim began in 1996 at the Pablo Casals Festival in Puerto Rico, from which I assume their name derives. There are ten composers included in this two-disc package, none of whom were previously known to me. The repertoire runs the gamut of contemporary styles, from approachable melodic works, through minimalism to craggy modernist sensibilities, and although most utilize the full trio resources, there are several solo and duo pieces. Of particular note is Beth Mehocic’s Somewhere Between D and C# for solo cello, with its exploration of ambiguous resolution. L. Peter Deutsch’s Ocean Air is a lovely suite in three movements harkening back to the late 19th century. Giovanni Piacentini’s Ondine begins in quiet Debussy-like arpeggiation that gradually builds into a stormy tempest before calming to gentle seas again. Each of the ten composers brings an individual voice to the medium, making for a varied and satisfying program. The playing is convincing and committed throughout. I was especially impressed by how complete the package was: a simple folded cardboard cover containing two CDs and a 12-page booklet with composer bios and program notes. I only wish that there was more information about the trio itself, and that the composers’ names were more discernable – pale blue type on a blue background is hard to read.\nAnother Navona recording that arrived recently looked strangely familiar to me. The Eloquent Saxophone featuring Toronto (now Cobourg) saxophonist, professor and founding member of the pioneering band Lighthouse, David Tanner and pianist Marc Widner (nv6158 navonarecords.com). It’s a charming collection of mostly French repertoire from the early 20th century, but also including more recent works by American Leslie Bassett and Gene DiNovi – a saxophone ensemble piece achieved through overdubbing the various parts. The disc begins with another saxophone quartet, the aptly named Serenade comique by Jean Françaix. Although most of the works were written for the saxophone, there is an effective transcription of Debussy’s Syrinx (originally for solo flute) in a warm and thoughtful rendition. Widner is the perfect accompanist for this repertoire, whether playing original piano lines or, in the case of Paule Maurice’s Tableaux de Provence, subbing for an entire orchestra. Also of note is Charles Koechlin’s Etude No.VIII from a set of saxophone and piano studies that were not published until 1970, 20 years after the composer’s death. The credits tell us that the recordings were made in 1988 in Toronto, the multi-tracking at Axon Music Productions and the rest in Walter Hall. That’s when I figured out what was so familiar. I checked my file card catalog of LP recordings, and sure enough, I have the original vinyl version of this disc put out on Apparition Records. Even the cover art is the same. The brief performer bios have been updated nominally and the order of the tracks has been modified – it used to start with Syrinx – but with the exception of the program notes, unfortunately missing from the CD reissue, the recording is the same. It was a welcome addition to my collection three decades ago, and it is welcome again now.\nOne final note, an intriguing percussion-centric disc of music by Baljinder Sekhon. Places & Times (innova 988 innova.mu) is, in the words of the composer, “no ordinary album of percussion ensemble music. These compositions explore a wide spectrum of possibilities offered by the percussion family, from the aggressive noise of a cymbal on piano strings and peaceful meditations created by finger cymbals gently buzzing on a vibraphone, to the curious thump of a person falling on a bass drum.” The disc features three percussion ensembles: Los Angeles Percussion Quartet; McCormick Percussion Group and Line upon Line Percussion. Three of the tracks include soloists: Dave Gerhart, steel pan; Dieter Hennings, guitar and Eunmi Ko, piano. Musica Casera, a 12-minute track that features guitar holding its own against a battery of percussion instruments, through delicate passages and thunderous sections, is particularly captivating. Another highlight is Sun for three percussionists all equipped with similar outfits: one keyboard, one skin, one wood and one metal instrument. They all share access to a large cymbal in centre stage, presumably the namesake of the piece. Despite similar resources, the combinations provide a very broad spectrum of sound and range.\nWe welcome your feedback and invite submissions.

Dave has a brother, Jeff, who is also a musician, and a sister, Roberta. Although he is Jewish, Koz plays both Christmas and occasional Hanukkah songs at his concerts.  He attended William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, performing on saxophone as a member of the school jazz band. He later graduated from UCLA with a degree in mass communications in 1986, and only weeks after his graduation, decided to make a go of becoming a professional musician.\nWithin weeks of deciding to be a professional musician, he was recruited as a member of Bobby Caldwell\'s tour. Koz was originally a rock saxophonist before he moved to smooth jazz in 1989. For the rest of the 1980s, Koz served as a session musician in several rock bands, and toured with Jeff Lorber. Koz was a member of rock musician Richard Marx\'s band and toured with Marx throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, which was around the time he recurred as the guest saxophonist on the syndicated late-night talk show The Arsenio Hall Show. He also played in the house band of CBS\' short-lived The Pat Sajak Show, with Tom Scott as bandleader.\nIn 1989, Koz decided to pursue a solo career, and began recording for Capitol Records. His albums there include Dave Koz (his 1990 solo debut), Lucky Man, The Dance, and Saxophonic. Saxophonic was nominated for both a Grammy Award and an NAACP Image Award.\nKoz released his second album, Lucky Man, in 1993. During production of the album in 1992, Koz was approached by the producers of ABC\'s General Hospital to perform on the show after his track entitled ""Emily"", from his Dave Koz album, was used as part of the show\'s soundtrack that year. After his GH appearance, executive producer Wendy Riche commissioned Koz to write a new theme song for the soap. Koz took elements from the show\'s existing theme song, Jack Urbont\'s ""Autumn Breeze"", and merged the chorus notes into a brand new smooth jazz composition titled ""Faces of the Heart"". The new theme music made its debut on General Hospitals 30th anniversary show, which aired April 1, 1993, and remained as the show\'s title track until August 27, 2004. ""Faces of the Heart"" ended up as the third track on Koz\'s Lucky Man album.\nIn 1994, Koz began hosting a syndicated radio program, The Dave Koz Radio Show (formerly Personal Notes), featuring the latest music and interviews with who\'s who in the genre. Dave co-hosted The Dave Koz Morning Show on 94.7 The Wave, a smooth jazz station in Los Angeles for six years. He decided to leave the show in January 2007 and was replaced by Brian McKnight. In 2002, Koz started a record label, Rendezvous Entertainment, with Frank Cody and Hyman Katz.\nKoz has promoted annual Dave Koz & Friends Jazz Cruises since 2005.\nKoz is the host of a weekly half-hour television series named Frequency put on by Fast Focus. Koz interviews musicians on the show such as Earth, Wind & Fire, Jonathan Butler, and Kelly Sweet. At the end of each interview, he plays along with the musician, adding some of his saxophone riffs to one of their hit songs.\nKoz was also the bandleader on The Emeril Lagasse Show. The band, Dave Koz & The Kozmos, featured Jeff Golub (guitar), Philippe Saisse (keyboards), Conrad Korsch (bass guitar), and Skoota Warner (drums).  \nKoz hosts a weekly radio show on the Sirius-XM Radio Watercolors channel called ""The Dave Koz Lounge,"" which airs Sundays at noon ET.\nKoz plays a Yamaha silver alto sax (YAS-62S Mk. I) with a No. 7 Beechler metal mouthpiece, a Yamaha straight silver Soprano sax (YSS-62S) or a vintage Conn curved soprano sax with a No. 8 Couf mouthpiece, and a Selmer Mark VI Tenor sax with a Berg-Larsen 90/2 hard rubber mouthpiece. As for reeds, he uses a No. 3 Rico Plasticover. Koz occasionally plays keyboards and piano, with which he also composes his songs.\nOn September 22, 2009, Koz received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nIn October 2010, Koz performed ""Start All Over Again"" in a Desperate Housewives season 7 episode ""Let Me Entertain You"", alongside singer Dana Glover. In July 2012, he appeared on The Eric André Show, season 1 episode 7, and sat in with the house band.\nIn December 2014, he opened Spaghettini & the Dave Koz Lounge, a restaurant and live music venue located at 184 North Canon Drive in Beverly Hills, California with business partners Cary Hardwick and Laurie Sisneros, who own Spaghettini in Seal Beach. \nIn 2018, Koz collaborated with guitarist and regular Vulfpeck contributor, Cory Wong, on two tracks, ""The Optimist"" and ""Friends at Sea"". The two collaborated again in 2021 for the album The Golden Hour, including the single ""Today"". \nIn 2022, Koz collaborated with singer-songwriter Ben Rector on the track ""Supernatural"" from Rector\'s album The Joy of Music.\nIn an April 2004 interview with The Advocate, Koz came out publicly as gay.

26	interested in science labs under mountains where is largest underground research center in world located	The Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) is the largest underground research center in the world. It is situated below Gran Sasso mountain in Italy, about 120 km from Rome. The nearest towns are L'Aquila and Teramo.	"['Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso\nOverview of overground laboratories of LNGS\n|Research type||Particle physics, nuclear physics|\n|Director||Lucia Votano; Stefano Ragazzi (since October 2012)|\n|Location||L\'Aquila, Abruzzo, Italy|\n|Beyond the Standard Model|\nLaboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) is the largest underground research center in the world. Situated below Gran Sasso mountain in Italy, it\'s well known for particle physics research by the INFN. In addition to a surface portion of the laboratory, there are extensive underground facilities beneath the mountain. The nearest towns are L\'Aquila and Teramo. The facility is located about 120 km from Rome.\nPrimary mission of the laboratory is to host experiments that require a low background environment in the field of astroparticle physics and nuclear astrophysics and other disciplines that can profit of its characteristics and of its infrastructures. The LNGS is, like the three other European underground astroparticle laboratories, Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane, Laboratorio subterráneo de Canfranc, and Boulby Underground Laboratory, a member of the coordinating group ILIAS.\nThe laboratory consists of a surface facility, located within the Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park, and extensive underground facilities located next to the 10 km long Traforo del Gran Sasso freeway tunnel.\nThe first large experiments at LNGS ran in 1989; the facilities were later expanded, and it is now the largest underground laboratory in the world.\nThere are three main barrel vaulted experimental halls, each approximately 20 m wide, 18 m tall, and 100 m long. These provide roughly 3×20×100=6,000 m2 (65,000 sq ft) of floor space and 3×20×(8+10×π/4)×100=95,100 m3 (3,360,000 cu ft) of volume. Including smaller spaces and various connecting tunnels, the facility totals 17,800 m2 (192,000 sq ft) and 180,000 m3 (6,400,000 cu ft).\nThe experimental halls are covered by about 1400 m of rock, protecting the experiments from cosmic rays. Providing about 3400 metres of water equivalent (mwe) shielding, it is not the deepest underground laboratory, but the fact that it can be driven to without using mine elevators makes it very popular.\nSince late August 2006, CERN has directed a beam of muon neutrinos from the CERN SPS accelerator to the Gran Sasso lab, 730 km away, where they are detected by the OPERA and ICARUS detectors, in a study of neutrino oscillations that will improve on the results of the Fermilab to MINOS experiment.\nIn May 2010, Lucia Votano, Director of the Gran Sasso laboratories, announced that ""[t]he OPERA experiment has reached its first goal: the detection of a tau neutrino obtained from the transformation of a muon neutrino, which occurred during the journey from Geneva to the Gran Sasso Laboratory."" This finding indicates a deficiency in the Standard Model of particle physics, as neutrinos would have to have mass for this change to occur.\nAn effort to determine the Majorana/Dirac nature of the neutrino, called CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events), is scheduled to begin in 2012. The detector will be shielded with lead recovered from an ancient Roman shipwreck, due to the ancient lead\'s lower radioactivity than recently minted lead. The artifacts are being given to CUORE from the National Archaeological Museum in Cagliari.\nIn September 2011, Dario Autiero of the OPERA collaboration presented findings that indicated neutrinos were arriving at OPERA about 60 ns earlier than they would if they were travelling at the speed of light. This Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly was not immediately explained. The results were subsequently investigated and confirmed to be wrong. They were caused by a flawed optic fiber cable in OPERA receiver of the laboratory, resulting in late arrival of the clock signal to which the neutrinos\' arrivals were compared.\nIn 2014 Borexino measured directly, for the first time, the neutrinos from the primary proton-proton fusion process in the Sun. This result is published on Nature. This measurement is consistent with the expectations derived from the standard solar model of J. Bahcall along with the theory of solar neutrino oscillations as described by MSW theory. It can be regarded as a cornerstone for our understanding of the PP-chain that fuels our Sun.\n- Colosimo, Gabriele; Crespi, Mattia; Mazzoni, Augusto; Riguzzi, Federica; Jones, Mark; Missiaen, Dominique (14 April 2012), Determination of the CNGS global geodesy (PDF), p. 6, OPERA public note 132 v3\n- ""INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso Annual Report 2011"" (PDF). p. 4.

27	I'm planning a trip to Egypt with my 1-year-old and have a 12-hour layover in Cairo. What attractions can I visit near the airport, and what precautions should I take when traveling with a baby?	From Cairo International Airport, you can visit several attractions within a 1.5-hour drive. The Egyptian Museum is just 34 minutes away and offers extensive artifacts collections. The Al-Azhar mosque, a significant Islamic building from 970, is 53 minutes away. For a unique experience, the Khan Al Khalili market is 1 hour 20 minutes away, offering traditional souvenirs and dining options. However, with a baby, you should carefully plan your itinerary to avoid exhaustion and heat exposure. It's recommended to travel between October and April to avoid extreme heat, use air-conditioned transportation, and carry water and snacks. Always monitor your baby's temperature and avoid long walks in the sun. Make sure to pack a lightweight stroller and consider using a baby carrier for easier movement through the airport.	['Most travelers try to avoid layovers on their way to the final destination but that’s not always an option.\nLuckily, those whose flight plans include spending up to 2 days in Egypt on their way to another country have several alternatives to take advantage of the situation.\nThat’s because passengers with 6 to 48 hours can leave Egyptian airports provided they have a transit visa for Egypt.\nTwo days is enough to see some of Egypt’s top attractions if the itinerary is carefully planned. Some companies offer 1 or 2-day guided tours which are a good option for seeing as much of the area as possible in this short time frame.\nHowever, travelers with fewer than 6 hours between flights and those without a transit visa must remain inside the airport.\nWith plenty to see and do in close proximity to the country’s main international airports, transit visa holders can take advantage of 2 days in Egypt. Those who wish to spend longer than 48 hours in Egypt must apply for a tourist visa.\nForeigners with a layover at Cairo International Airport can find information below about what to see and where to stay close by. The top attractions near Luxor and Hurghada International Airports are also listed.\nWhat to Visit Near Cairo International Airport\nCairo International Airport is one of Egypt’s main ports of entry with more than 65 airlines operating domestic and international flights.\nBeing so well connected to other cities and countries, many foreigners catch connecting flights out of Cairo Int’l Airport.\nThere are many tourist attractions in close proximity to Cairo’s airport. To see and do as much as possible in 48 hours it’s advisable to hire a car.

It is a country rich with history, entertainment, and cultural attractions. However you need to make sure it is safe to go to Egypt and to follow safety guidelines before you make a decision to travel to there. This is even more important if you are going with family especially families with young kids or babies. We have been flying with babies and young kids for years and will put ll our learnt lessons here. You can also read more here about the recommended safety guidelines when planning to visit Egypt.\nI have learned a lot from my travels with family and I have made some mistakes that I can share with you here. First, here are the top tips to take into consideration when planning to travel with babies or toddlers:\n- Relax, enjoy your time, and don’t be over concerned\n- Make sure your baby or toddler is healthy and up to date with vaccinations before travelling. Premature babies and babies born with heart or serious health conditions are not ready to travel.\n- Ask others politely not to kiss or hug babies or toddlers\n- Do not breastfeed in public in Egypt if you don’t want too much attention or stares.\n- Avoid direct sun exposure and long walks with a baby or toddler\n- Use Uber or air-conditioned transportation to avoid long exposure to heat\n- When in Cairo, pick a quiet room in your hotel to help your baby sleep. Cairo is a noisy city\n- It is better to go between October and April to avoid extreme heat season\n- Consult your doctor or pediatrician before traveling and take recommended medications that you may need\n- Plan your itinerary so it is not too exhausting to your baby or toddler\n- Avoid Extreme adventures such as desert 4X4 long rides and camping or diving sea trips\n- Consult pharmacists in Egypt when needed. They can speak English and are usually very helpful\n- Consult your doctor for what powder and creams to take to protect your baby from the heat\n- Take some baby food and jars with you (but not too much). You can buy more locally.\n- Take a good quality lightweight foldable stroller and baby cot or buy it locally. You can donate before you leave if you do not want to travel with it.\n- Always carry some dry food, snacks, and water with you wherever you go.\n- Do not use baby harness. It is not culturally acceptable in Egypt\n- Check with your hotel to see if they have babysitting service for toddlers.\n- Your baby needs a birth certificate and a passport: Just saying if you don’t know already.\n- Be careful about mosquitos in Egypt. Get a mosquito net for your stroller, carrycot, or wherever your baby sleeps.\nIs It Safe to Travel with a Baby or Toddler to Egypt?\nThe Quick answer is: Yes. Egypt is a family and child friendly country. Egyptians are welcoming in general, but even more welcoming for families and children. Newborns usually require between 1 to 3 months to fully develop their immune system, so it is a good idea to check with a pediatrician if your baby is less than 3 months old.\nThe Flight to Egypt\nCheck with your airline or travel agent if your baby is less than 10 days old as some airlines may not allow newborns that young to fly. Try to book the shortest route if you can. Switching several planes and airports can be exhausting for babies and toddlers.\nYou may be on a 10+ hours flight to Egypt or you may be on a 5 or less hours away. In all cases it is a good idea to reserve the seat with more leg room to be able to handle a baby or move relatively easy with a toddler. Get a chair for your child if you can afford it as it a lot safer. It is also a good idea to take a pillow for a comfortable sleep for your toddler.\nTry to book your flight to sync with your child sleeping hours. This is not easy, but can be a big relief if available. Prepare your toddler to the trip by talking about planes, Egypt, and fun time to expect. Read stories about airplanes and Egypt. Let your toddler participate in preparing their bag.\nDuring Takeoff or landing, give you baby a pacifier, milk bottle, or breast feed your baby. Give your toddler something to chew or drink. This is to protect the ears and relief ear pain. Make sure you have additional set of clothes for you and your baby or toddlers as accidents happen and you may need to change. Take baby wipes and liquid bottles onboard. You will need those.\nCheck with your agent or airline on allowed baby strollers and carrycot or bassinet. Traveling with your spouse or friends will make life easier as they can help moving the luggage while you focus on your baby or toddler.\nI use noise cancelling headphones sometimes in airports and airplanes as sometimes announcements and other voices are relatively loud. Use baby carrier if possible at airports to free your hands for security checks, passport handling, and taking care of carry on luggage. Try to board as early as possible and ask on the plane if you can be seated next to an empty chair. You will be surprised that it is very much possible sometimes.\nComparison of infant travel policies between different airlines\n|Delta||An adult can carry one infant. If traveling with 2 infants then a seat must be purchased for the second one. Infants under 7 days old cannot travel without a letter from physician. Up to two years children can travel in lap with 10% of ticket cost or in a separate seat but a child seat need to be brought in for safety to be attached to plane seat.|\n|American Airlines||Under 7 days old infants need a from to be approved by physician to travel. If child will have a separate seat, a safety seat must accompany the child and be secured in child seat. Infants must be accompanied by an adult or parent. One stroller is allowed per ticket. Traveling with one parent requires consent from the other parent. A percentage of ticket fees will be paid for in lap infants (you need to call to get the rate).

One stroller per passenger ticket is allowed. Larger stroller may not be allowed on aircraft, so smaller lighter ones are recommended.|\n|Egypt Air||You need to request a bulkhead seat in advance and a carrycot (you may need to bring your own). Children must be held tight in lap during takeoff and landing. Infant must be at least 7 days old or older. For Premature babies or babies less than 7 days old a physician approval is needed and a physician or certified nurse need to accompany babies requiring medical attention. An adult can travel with two infants, but second infant or child must have a seat. Parents with 2 infants must be allocated cross aisle seats.

Car seats are allowed but require approval at least 7 days before flight.|\n|Cathy Pacific||Infant must be 7 years old or more. Infant can set in lap of guardian or adult (up to 24 months) and may also have a separate seat. One adult can accompany yup to two infants with one of them at least 6 months old and to have a car seat secured in a separate plane seat. Bassinets are available on most aircrafts but need to be requested during reservation. Car seats are allowed, but you may need to confirm model and suitability to your specific journey aircraft with Cathy Pacific.|\n|Turkish airlines||Infants must 7 days or older or otherwise will need medical clearance. Children up to 2 years old can travel in lap with a discounted rate, but they can also have their own seat at a special seat discount for children. Strollers are usually allowed up to aircraft gate. You can request infant food when booking and you can bring your own too. If travelling with more than one infant, the second one will have a separate seat ticket and must have a car seat attached to plane seat.|\n|Lufthansa||Most aircrafts will have changing tables and drinking water suitable for babies. Reserve bassinets at least 52 hours before flight. Children under 2 years old can sit in lap (for 10% of adult ticket fare) but can also have their own seat child rate. Strollers and car seats will be taken onboard when possible (some airports do not allow that so check with airline)|\n|AirFrance||Traveling with infants younger than 7 days is not recommended.

Older children require their own seats. Carrycots can be reserved in advance and car seats are allowed onboard for no extra fees.|\nThe above is a sample comparison between different airlines for infant flying conditions and facilities. In general, most airlines will have the following conditions and terms for infants and young children travel:\n-Infants and babies are allowed in lap up to two years old (except KLM – 1year old).\n-Strollers are allowed but it is recommended to have light foldable ones.\n-Car seats are generally allowed if you have a separate seat for your baby. It needs to be compatible with plane seats. Some airlines will allow a car seat on board even for in lap infants.\n-Most airlines will allow two infants with one adult but will require a separate seat for the second baby.\n-Bring your baby’s food and water onboard.\n-Most airlines will seat families together.\n-Most airlines will charge 10% of adult ticket fare for in lap infants. For a spate seat, you will pay child rate. Second child must be secured in seat with a car or child seat.\n-Bassinets and carrycots are usually available if requested with booking.\nThe packing list\nMy biggest advice here is: Don’t overpack. Make sure you take with you all the essential items, but do not over do this step. You can buy almost anything you need from Egypt and usually at a reasonable price. It is a balancing game. Here is a list of items I recommend\n- Your baby or toddler’s favorite toy or doll\n- Baby Carrier for walks with baby. I love the Ergobaby Carrier with Cool Air Mesh that is flexible, light, and suitable for the weather in Egypt.\n- Diapers, wipes, change pad, and change bag: You may not find change tables easily in public places across Egypt. Keep some diapers handy or on top of you packed stuff.\n- Noise Control headphones: Whether for airplanes or maybe some other places in Egypt. You will find that noise is very common across Egypt.\n- Diaper cream\n- First aid kit\n- Breast pump, bottles for milk water, and liquids as needed\n- Bottle brushes, utensils. Also a sterilizer to make sure you have clean bottles. Always use bottled water for your baby’s supplies.\n- Shoes and socks: Look for light weight comfortable simple shoes with not too much bells and whistles. Lace free shoes are easier. Take at least two shoes. For newborns, I wouldn’t really care about taking shoes at all.\n- Does your baby need some white noise to sleep? You can use any of those from YouTube or download some audio on your mobile. However some Egyptian hotels do not have good internet, so you can buy a white noise machine as an alternative.\n- Baby blanket (you may need it during flight)\n- Hats and caps. A compact pocket blanket can be useful anywhere. I always take one of those\n- Power adapters to operate your devices in Egypt. Egypt power outlets are usually 220 volts and 60Hz (North America devices is usually 110 volts and 50Hz). This converter can be handy.\n- A kettle can be very useful especially that some hotels do not have any option to heat water. This fordable kettle can work on both 110 or 220 volts.\n- A cooling bag can be really useful to keep your bottles and food at reasonable temperature as long as possible. You can buy some cooling gel or pads locally and keep it in the cooling bag.\n- Clothes for your baby and toddler: How much to take? Depends on how long you will be staying in Egypt and how frequent you will be able to wash clothes or send it to laundry. You can also buy more if needed from Egyptian markets and shopping malls especially if you are visiting Cairo.\n- Sunscreen: Ge a suitable cream for baby or toddler’s age. Not recommended for less than 6 moths.\nAt the Hotel\nIf you are staying at a hotel or a rented apartment plan for how you are going to warm your baby liquid or food bottles. Check with the hotel. Also ask about baby cribs at the hotel. If provided with one, inspect it carefully for safety.\nExpect your baby or toddler to have jetlag just like you. You may need couple of days to get your child used to new time zone. One way I do this is keeping my baby awake as long as possible to start syncing with local time and to get him tired enough to sleep longer hours.\nCheck with your hotel or landlord about the nearest hospital, clinics, or emergency numbers. You don’t want to be researching that when emergency happens.\nCheck for available laundry service. Take a tide spot removing stick or something similar for quick cleaning. Take a backup washing string and some laundry hanging pegs. I always use this washing bag in my travels whenever a washing machine is not close by or reachable. Check if your hotel has elevators and stroller friendly ramps (yes not every hotel in Egypt has those).\nGoing places with your baby or toddler in Egypt\nIf going to Egypt with toddler or a newborn, the biggest concern here would be the hot weather in Egypt. You need to carefully decide if the weather is suitable for an outdoor tour. Avoid mid-day hot hours.\nI know it may sound obvious, but never, ever leave your baby or toddler in a car not even for one minute!\nAlways monitor your kid’s skin temperature. A daily cool bath for your baby or toddler maybe a good idea to make up for the heat exposure. Be careful about changing temperatures between indoors and outdoors though.\nAlways check where washrooms are located in every place you go to. Keep toilet papers with you as it may not be available in some washrooms. Monitor your toddler or baby for dehydrations, heat stroke, or itchy skin (Prickly Heat). Always add or remove layers of clothes according to current weather and temperature.\nAlways stay close to your toddler when in swimming pools. Carefully check cribs or play areas in hotels to make sure it is safe. Felucca Nile rides may not be suitable for babies or toddlers. A Nile cruise is okay though.\nI would not recommend Going inside the pyramids with a baby or a toddler. Be careful at the pyramids area with all the traffic, horses and camels. Going to Egypt with a toddler can be a good unforgettable experience, but you need to be alert and to pay attention to your toddler’s whereabouts all the time.']	['<urn:uuid:4595123c-3856-48ca-bebe-a034c82dcf2e>', '<urn:uuid:01ce9669-98c1-45d3-8d28-828dd760633c>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	35	127	4218
28	What are the major technological objectives being pursued in the multi-state carbon dioxide research initiative?	The research aims to create innovative manufacturing processes to advance the capture and use of carbon through three cutting-edge technologies: capturing carbon dioxide in power generation, using carbon dioxide to store electrical energy, and converting carbon dioxide into high-value chemicals that can be used in the manufacture of other materials.	['NMSU participates in three-state project to develop technologies for CO2 capture\nLAS CRUCES – Meng Zhou, assistant professor of chemistry and materials engineering, leads a three-state collaborative project at New Mexico State University that aims to address the carbon dioxide-related challenges in the earth’s atmosphere and ocean due to past technological advances tackle century driven by the use of high carbon fossil fuels.\nThe result of global emissions poses a historical threat to the ecosystem and life on our planet and offers a historical economic opportunity to develop methods of capturing and utilizing carbon dioxide.\nThe Tri-State Research Institute of Manufacturing for Managing CO2 is a $ 6 million project shared by four universities in three states: University of Louisiana at Lafayette (project lead institution), New Mexico State University, University of New Mexico, and West Virginia University. The NMSU received $ 1.3 million for its contribution to the four-year project funded by the National Science Foundation as part of the established program to stimulate competitive research.\nThe proposed research goal is to create innovative manufacturing processes to advance the capture and use of carbon, and includes the development of three cutting-edge technologies that: capture carbon dioxide in power generation, use carbon dioxide to store electrical energy, and carbon dioxide in high-value chemicals that can be used in the manufacture of other materials.\nResearch at the NMSU will focus on the capture of carbon dioxide in power generation. Zhou’s research focuses on electrochemical storage and conversion devices such as fuel cells, supercapacitors and batteries. His research results, published in high impact journals, drew the lead institution’s attention to this project and led to the inclusion of the NMSU in this project.\nMore:NMSU Engineer Graduate Voted Most Promising Engineer\n“CO2 is an important issue, photosynthesis is highly dependent on the CO2 concentration, but too much CO2 in the air will cause problems like the greenhouse effect and extreme climate. It is important to capture the excess CO2 in the air and store it for use, ”explains Zhou. “The traditional way of condensing at low temperature is costly and tedious. I am interested in using the electrochemical device Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell to collect CO2 from exhaust gases from industrial plants and at the same time to produce electricity. “\nIts process results in high purity carbon dioxide (greater than 95%) that releases electrons that flow through an external circuit to form electricity. Zhou will develop, build and test an improved molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC).\nIn 2019, ExxonMobil signed a $ 60 million agreement with FuelCell Energy to use the molten carbonate fuel cell for carbon capture and power generation. However, several issues hindered the development of a molten carbonate fuel cell. The NMSU team aims to address these issues and improve overall cell performance by optimizing the structure, selecting advanced catalysts, and synthesizing suitable electrode materials. Students and PhD students as well as postdoc researchers are actively involved in this project.\nOther NMSU participants in the project are Hongmei Luo, professor of chemical and materials engineering and deputy research dean, whose research interests lie in the design, manufacture and use of nanomaterials and surface modification in energy systems. She is an experienced administrator and will be part of the management team.\nDelia Valles-Rosales, NMSU Professor of Industrial Engineering, has extensive experience in manufacturing research, teaching and public relations, particularly in the energy sector, and will scale the molten carbonate fuel cell from the laboratory level to the industrial level. She will lead the education and public relations work.\nThe NMSU team is also actively involved in other research interests at other universities: Zhou will contribute to the reactor design; Luo will work on the surface treatment of electrodes; Valles-Rosales will take part in the scaling and modeling.\nIn addition to technological development, the participating organizations commit to training and developing internationally competitive scientists by offering cutting edge science and solid educational experience. Research and educational skills are essential to give the next generation the tools and skills they need to be successful in industry and science over the long term.\nMore:El Paso had 126 days of increased air pollution in 2020\nThe three countries involved in the project, all of which have high per capita carbon footprints, have recently invested in a number of nationwide initiatives or received significant outside investments to address the carbon challenges. The research program will benefit from close interaction with industry and collaboration with national research centers, including the National Energy Technology Laboratory and the Idaho National Laboratory.\nThe accumulation of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere poses a tremendous challenge, but these researchers claim, “If it is well managed, it also presents a historic opportunity: The capture and use of CO2 is arguably the greatest economic opportunity for the next hundred years, also known as “Industry of the Future”\nLinda Fresques is a writer on Marketing and Communications for New Mexico State University and can be reached at 575-646-7416, [email protected]']	['<urn:uuid:ef169b78-4219-4b3a-b3b4-f38466691557>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	15	50	825
29	villi structure absorption digestion mechanisms	Villi are finger-like projections in the small intestine adapted for efficient absorption through several features. They have numerous microvilli providing large surface area, many capillaries to maintain concentration gradients, thin walls for short diffusion distance, and abundant mitochondria for energy provision. The absorption process involves both passive diffusion of amino acids and monosaccharides, and active transport requiring ATP for nutrients like glucose and sodium ions. Additionally, specialized fat absorption occurs through micelles formed with bile salts, which are then absorbed into lymph capillaries called lacteals.	['Animal cells have:\n- Nucleus - controls all activities of the cell and contains the genes\n- Cytoplasm - a liquid gel in which most of the chemical reactions take place\n- Cell membrane - controls the passage of substances in and out of the cell, e.g lets glucose and mineral ions into the cell and lets out urea and hormones\n- Mitochondria - where oxygen is used and most of the energy is released during respiration\n- Ribosomes - where protein synthesis takes places\nPlant cells have:\n- Cell membrane\n- Cell wall - made of cellulose that strengthens the cell and gives it support\nMany but not all plant cells have:\n- Chloroplasts - found in the green parts of the plant and contain chlorophyll which absorbs light energy to make food by photosynthesis. Root cells do not have chloroplasts because they are underground and do not photosynthesise.\n- A permanent vacuole - space in the cytoplasm filled with sap to keep the cells rigid to support the plant.\nPicture of animal and plant cells\nFlagella - a long protein strand which is used by bacteria to move around.\nBacteria...good or bad?\nBacteria is useful to people because it is used:\n- to make foods such as yoghurt and cheese\n- in sewage treatment\n- to make medicines\n- as decomposers in food chains and webs\n- in natural cycles such as the carbon and nitrogen cycles\nBacteria is damaging to people because:\n- it can cause diseases\nYeast reproduce by asexual reproduction. This involves a a new yeast cell growing out form the original cell to form a separate yeast organism.\n- Specialised to survive for a long time, even when there is little oxygen available.\n-When yeast cells have plenty of oxygen they use aerobic respiration. They use oxygen to break down sugar to provide energy for the cell. ==> carbon dioxide and water produced as waste products\nWhen they have little oxygen they can use anaerobic respiration. When yeast cells break down sugar in the absence of oxygen ==> ethanol and carbon dioxide produced as waste products.\n- To make bread\n- To make alcoholic drinks\n- In the production of antibiotics e.g penicillin\nIf something is specialised it is adapted to suit its function. e.g Root hair cells\n- Found close to tips of growing roots, help the plants take up water and mineral ions more efficiently ==> close to the xylem tissue which carries water and mineral ions up into the rest of the plant.\n- The root hairs increase the surface area for water to move into the cell\n- Has a large permanent vacuole that speeds up the movement of water by osmosis from the soil across the root hair cell.\nDiffusion is the spreading of the particles of any substance in solution, or particles of a gas from a region where they are of a high concentration to a region with a lower concentration.\nThe greater the difference in concentration the faster the rate of diffusion.\nOsmosis is the diffusion of water from a dilute solution to a more concentrated solution through a partially permeable membrane that allows the passage of water molecules.\n- Two solutions with the same concentration are isotonic\n- If 2 solutions have different concentrations, the more concentrated solution is hypertonic and the more dilute solution is hypotonic.\n- If a cell is placed in a solution hypertonic to its cell contents, water will leave the cell. Animal cells shrivel and plant cells plasmolyse (cell membrane and cytoplasm pull away from cell wall).\n- If a cell is placed in a solution hypotonic to its cell contents, water will enter the cell. Animal cells swell and burst and plant cells become turgid.\nActive transport is when substances are absorbed against a concentration gradient. This requires the use of energy from respiration.\nActive transport enables:\n- plants to absorb ions from very dilute solutions, e.g by root hair cells\n- sugar may be absorbed from low concentrations in the intestine and from low concentration sin the kidney tubules.\nAdaptations for exchanging materials\nThere are many adaptations to make the process of exchange more efficient. The effectiveness of an exchange surface area can be increased by:\n- Having a large surface area that provides a big area over which exchange can take place\n- Being thin, which provides a short diffusion path\n- Having an efficient blood supply; this moves the diffusing substances away and maintains a concentration gradient\n- Being ventilated to make gaseous exchange more efficient by maintaining steep concentration gradients\nDescribe and explain how the villi are adapted to\nVilli - The finger-like projections from the lining of the small intestine which increase the surface area for the absorption of digested food into the blood\nD - Has many microvilli: Ex - Provides large surface area\nD - Many capillaries: Ex - Maintains concentration diffusion gradient\nD - Have a thin wall/ capillaries are near the surface: Ex - Short distance for food to travel\nD - Many mitochondria: Ex - provide energy', 'Chapter 16: DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION\nAll the living organisms require the presence of energy to do various functions of life. They get this energy from the food they eat. Food is also needed for growth and development of the body. Nutrition is defined as, the substance in total from which an organism derives its energy to do work and other materials for its growth, development and maintenance of life.\n“The breaking down of complex and insoluble organic substances such as carbohydrates, proteins and fats into simpler and soluble substances like glucose, amino acids and fatty acids respectively so that they can be easily absorbed into the body is known as digestion. This is a hydrolytic process and is carried out by various enzymes.”\nAlimentary or Digestive system:\nAlimentary canal is a tube present in all higher animals starting from mouth and reaching up to anus. Various glands located on its wall produce digestive juices that help in the process of digestion. Two glands namely liver and pancreas are also associated with it. They also produce the digestive juices. The digested food is also absorbed into the alimentary canal and undigested and indigestible food is passed out of the body through anus.\nMammalian Alimentary System:\nIn man the total length of alimentary canal is about 21 feet and consists of the following parts:\nMouth leads into a buccal cavity. The opening of the mouth is provided with lips. At the floor of the buccal cavity a muscular tongue is present. It helps in the ingestion, mastication and swallowing of food. It has got taste buds on its surface. Most of the mammals possess teeth on both the jaws. They are present in the cavity or socket of gums (thecodont dentition). The number and types of teeth vary in mammals. In man, there are 32 teeth of four different types namely incisors, canines, premolars and molars. This type of dentition is known as heterodont dentition. Their number can be represented by the dental formula: In each half of jaw;\nUpper jaw I(2); C(1); PM(2); M(3)\n----------------------------------------------- = 32\nLower jaw I (2); C (1); PM (2); M (3)\nThe incisor teeth are chisel-shaped and have sharp cutting edges. Canines are dagger-shaped and pierce the food. They are very large and well developed in predatory animals. Premolars and molars are broad and strong crushing teeth. Thus the incisors are used for biting; the canines for tearing the food; and premolars and molars for grinding the food. With the help of the teeth, tongue and jaw movements, food is chewed and mixed with saliva in the mouth.\nThere are three pairs of salivary glands namely parotids, submaxillary (submandibular) and sublingual glands. Their secretion is collectively known as saliva that is poured into the buccal cavity. Saliva usually contains enzymes and mucin. The enzyme present in saliva is known as ptyalin that helps in the digestion of carbohydrates; while mucin helps to lubricate the food for swallowing.\nThe mouth leads to a funnel-shaped pharynx, which communicates with a long muscular tube called oesophagus. The oesophagus opens into a muscular sac like structure called as stomach. In man, it is somewhat J-shaped and occupies the left side of the abdomen. The stomach opens into the small intestine. The stomach has many glands on its wall. Stomach wall produces gastric juice, which chiefly contains HCl, mucin and two protein digesting enzymes – rennin and pepsin. The muscles of the stomach wall churn and mix the food with gastric juice. Stomach through its pyloric region opens into small intestine. It is differentiated into three regions viz., duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Duodenum is U-shaped and gets the common bile duct and pancreatic duct from the gall bladder and pancreas. Jejunum is longer and more coiled. Ileum is the last part of small intestine and opens into the large intestine. Its wall has numerous long, finger-like projections called villi, which enhance absorption. Small intestine is the main region where digestion and absorption of food occurs. It has large number of tubular glands that produce the intestinal juice containing a number of enzymes, which digest various types of food. Digestion of different nutrients is completed in the small intestine by the action of pancreatic juice, intestinal juice and bile juice. The end products of digestion are then absorbed from the small intestine.\nThe small intestine opens into the large intestine. It is comparatively much shorter and wider than the small intestine. It does not have villi. It is also differentiated into three regions: caecum, colon and rectum. Caecum is a small pouch-like structure and its main part is vermiform appendix. However, caecum is very well developed in herbivorous animals like horse and ass. The colon is longest and has four parts; ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and pelvic colon. The pelvic colon opens into the rectum. Rectum is the last part of large intestine. Both in colon and rectum most of the water is reabsorbed back while the undigested food is removed from the body as faecal matter through anus. This is known as Egestion.\nGlands associated with alimentary canal:\nPancreas: It is located in between the loops of duodenum. It is the second largest gland of the body. It secretes pancreatic juice that contains large number of digestive enzymes for digesting starch, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. The pancreatic juice is released into the pancreatic duct, which joins with the common bile duct.\nLiver: It is the largest gland of the body lying immediately below the diaphragm in the right upper part of abdomen. The cells of the liver (hepatic cells) produce bile juice that contains bile pigments and bile salts. These bile salts help in the digestion and absorption of fats. Bile juice does not contain any enzyme. Bile juice flows out of the liver through hepatic ducts forming the common bile duct that opens into the duodenum (when the food is present in the duodenum). When there is no food in the duodenum, then bile juice is stored in the gall bladder. The gall bladder is a small elongated, muscular sac below the liver. When the food comes into duodenum, it contracts to release the bile juice.\nDigestion of Carbohydrates:\nCarbohydrates are of three types: polysaccharides, disaccharides and monosaccharides. During the process of digestion both poly-and disaccharides are broken down to monosaccharides and in this form they can be absorbed into the body. Some of these complex carbohydrates are starch and cellulose, present in cereal grains, potato, fruits and tubers; sucrose present in cane sugar; lactose present in milk etc. Enzymes that act on carbohydrates are collectively known as carbohydrases.\nIn the mouth cavity, the food is mixed with saliva. It contains an enzyme called salivary amylase or ptyalin. Salivary amylase acts on starch and convert it into maltose, isomaltose and small dextrins or `limit dextrin’(disaccharides). Chewing and mastication of food increases the action of salivary amylase on starch by increasing the surface area of food on which the enzyme acts. About 30 percent of starch present in food is hydrolysed in the mouth. The action of salivary amylase continues for sometime even in the stomach but soon HCl present in the gastric juice destroys the entire enzyme.\nStarch --------------> Maltose + Isomaltose + Dextrin\nPancreatic juice and intestinal juice also contain carbohydrates digesting enzymes. Pancreatic juice contains pancreatic amylase that acts on starch to digest it into maltose, isomaltose and dextrin. Intestinal juice contains number of carbohydrates like maltase, isomaltase and sucrase and lactase. Maltase and isomaltase act on maltose, isomaltose and dextrins and convert into glucose; sucrase acts on sucrose to convert it into glucose and fructose; and lactase acts on lactose to convert it into glucose and the galactose.\nStarch ------------> Maltose + Isomaltose + Dextrin\nMaltose + Isomaltose + Dextrin ------------> Glucose\nSucrose ------------> Glucose + Fructose\nLactose -----------> Glucose + Galactose\nOnly human being can digest lactose present in the milk. But with advancing age, they also cannot digest milk. This is because less of lactase is produced. In them, lactose remains undigested and gets fermented in the intestine producing gases and acids. This results in intestinal disorder and diarrhoea. So these persons must consume curd or yoghurt (sweetened curd) as lactase is fermented to lactic acid in them. This will not pose any digestive problem to them.\nMany of the herbivorous animals can digest cellulose by the microorganisms (bacteria and protozoa) present in their alimentary canal. These microbes ferment cellulose into short chain fatty acids such as acetic acid and propionic acid. These acids are then absorbed and utilized by the animal. This is, thus, an example of symbiotic digestion. Microbes may be present in the rumen and reticulum part of stomach (cow and buffaloes); or in the large intestine (horse and donkeys).\nDigestion of proteins:\nProteins are complex organic compounds made up of single units called amino acids. In the process of digestion, proteins are broken down to amino acids. Enzymes that hydrolyze protein are collectively known as proteases or peptides. Many of these enzymes are secreted in their inactive form or proenzymes. These inactive enzymes are converted to their active form only at the site of action.\nProtein digestion starts in the stomach. The gastric glands of stomach produce a light coloured, thin and transparent gastric juice. It contains hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen. The H+ ions present in HCl converts pepsinogen into pepsin. The presence of HCl makes the medium highly acidic so that pepsin can act on proteins to convert them into peptones. HCl also helps to kill bacteria and other harmful organisms that may be present along with the food. Calf gastric juice contains another milk coagulating protease, called rennin. It is secreted as inactive pro-rennin. In the presence of HCl, the inactive prorennin is converted into their active form, i.e., rennin. Rennin acts on the casein protein of milk and converts it into paracasein, which in the presence of calcium ions forms calcium paracaseinate (curdling of milk). The function of rennin is then taken over by pepsin and other milk-coagulating enzymes. Adult cows or human infants do not produce rennin.\nBoth pancreatic juice and intestinal juice are poured into small intestine. Pancreatic juice contains trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, carboxypeptidases, lipases, amylases, DNAases and RNAases. All these enzymes of pancreatic juice can act only in the alkaline medium. This change in the medium of food, from acidic to alkaline, is done by the bile juice. Therefore, bile juice acts on the food before the action of pancreatic juice. In the intestinal lumen, pancreatic and intestinal juices mix together. Then a protease of intestinal juice, called Enteropeptidase or Enterokinase acts in coordination with pancreatic proteases. This enterokinase converts inactive trypsinogen into active trypsin. In predatory animals, trypsins can hydrolyse fibrinogen of blood into fibrin leading to blood coagulation. But it is unable to bring about coagulation of milk. The inactive Chymotrypsinogen is activated to chymotrypsin by trypsin. Chymotrypsins can hydrolyse casein into paracasein, which then coagulates to form calcium paracaseinate. But it acts in the alkaline medium. Chymotrypsin acts on other proteins and converts them into peptides. Carboxypeptidase hydrolyses the terminal carboxyl groups from peptide bonds to release the last amino acids from the peptides thus making the peptide shorter.\nThe intestinal juice contains aminopeptidases and dipeptidases; and enterokinase or enteropeptidase. Out of these enterokinase activates the trypsinogen. Aminopeptidase hydrolyses the terminal amino group from peptide bonds to release the last amino acid from the peptides thus making the peptide shorter. Dipeptidase acts on dipeptides to release the individual amino acids.\nDigestion of fats:\nFat digestion starts only when the food reaches the small intestine. It starts with the action of bile juice from liver. Bile juice contains bile salts, which are secreted by the liver in the bile. Bile salts break down the bigger molecules of fat globules into smaller droplets by reducing the surface tension of fat droplets. This process is known as emulsification of fats.\nLipase is the enzyme that acts on emulsified fats. It is present both in the pancreatic juice and intestinal juice. Lipase converts emulsified fats into diglycerides and monoglycerides releasing fatty acids at each step. At the end of digestion, all fats are converted into fatty acids, glycerol and monoglycerides.\nDuring the process of digestion proteins are changed to amino acids, carbohydrates to glucose, fructose and galactose, fats to fatty acids, glycerol and monoglycerides. These end products of digestion are finally absorbed in small intestine. So absorption can be defined as a process by which nutrient molecules are taken into the cells of the body. For this purpose, intestine has vast surface area of absorption by the presence of numerous villi. Further, this area is increased by microvilli present on the free surface of epithelial cells.\nPassive absorption: When the nutrients are absorbed by simple diffusion, then it is known as passive absorption. Various amino acids and monosaccharides diffuse into the blood capillaries of villi. This is dependent on the fact that these nutrients are more in concentration in the intestine than in the cells. Further, these molecules are small and water soluble. All the amino acids and monosaccharides are not absorbed in this way.\nWater is absorbed from the intestine to the intestinal cells and finally to the blood by the process of osmosis. This occurs when the solute concentration in the blood is higher (hypertonic). Thus, whenever any solute is absorbed from the intestine, it also results in the absorption of water.\nActive absorption: This process occurs against the concentration gradient, i.e., nutrients may be more in intestinal cells than in the lumen of intestine. It requires the expenditure of energy i.e., ATP. Various nutrients like amino acids, glucose, galactose, Na+ ions can be absorbed by active transport. After their passive absorption, they are completely absorbed by active transport. For the active absorption of Na+ ions, a mechanism of sodium pump operates in the cell membranes.\nMicelles in fat absorption/Role of bile juice in the absorption of fats:\nAs the fatty acids and glycerol are insoluble in water, the intestine cannot directly absorb them. So they cannot reach the blood stream directly. Instead, they are passed into lymph capillaries of the villi called lacteals. Digested fats are first incorporated into small, spherical droplets called micelles with the help of bile salts and phospholipids in the intestinal lumen. In the lacteals, fats are resynthesised into very small fat molecules called chylomicrons. An obstruction in the bile duct may prevent the entry of bile juice into the small intestine (obstructive jaundice) as a result unabsorbed fats are removed from the body along with the faecal matter. Thus bile plays an important role in the absorption of fats.\nBalanced diet: To maintain normal functioning of our body, we need varieties of food so that all the systems are well maintained. A diet, which contains adequate amount of all the essential nutrients, is known as balanced diet. It varies according to age and occupation. A balanced diet should have the following three qualities:\n· It must be rich in various essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals and some amino acids.\n· It should provide enough raw materials needed for the growth and development, repair and replacement of cells, tissues and organs of the body.\n· It should provide the necessary energy required by the body.\nDisorders of Digestive System:\n1. Jaundice: The liver is affected; skin and eyes turn yellow due to the deposit of bile pigment.\n2. Vomiting: It is the ejection of stomach contents through the mouth and controlled by the centre in the medulla oblongata.\n3. Diarrhoea: Abnormal bowel movement and the faecal discharge with more liquidity, which leads to dehydration.\n4. Constipation: the feces are retained within the rectum due to irregular bowel movement.\n5. Indigestion: food is not properly digested leading to a feeling of fullness due to inadequate enzyme secretion, anxiety, food poisoning, over eating nd spicy food.']	['<urn:uuid:ba0bd600-ef2e-48e9-acfc-e0620b7f4eeb>', '<urn:uuid:0433d0c0-6c1a-4c2e-a6de-2c67c5adaa76>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	5	85	3496
30	how many adults in usa met criteria generalized anxiety disorder gad 2016	According to estimates, in the USA alone about 3.1% of adults met the criteria for GAD in 2016.	['To feel anxious at times is normal, and all people experience it now and then. However, showing extreme, unreasonable, and constant anxiousness and fear about things is a psychiatric illness, medically termed as an anxiety disorder.\nAnxiety disorders include obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and so on. The most common anxiety disorder is generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Many people are affected by more than one anxiety disorder concurrently, known as comorbidity. Surveys have shown that GAD is the most comorbid of anxiety disorders.\nThe coexistence or overlap of disorders increases the complexities of diagnosis and treatment for both the psychiatrist and the patient.\nImage Credit: Rudall30 / Shutterstock\nComorbidities of GAD\nThe most common comorbidities of GAD are major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and substance use disorder (SUD), due to the similar symptoms of these disorders.\nGAD and Major Depressive Disorder\nGAD presents with uncontrolled and persistent worry about a range of things like job, family, and financial status. It is a kind of floating condition, where the person drifts from one worry to the next without end in such as way that it has an impact on their normal activities. MDD, often simply referred to as depression or clinical depression, is a serious mood disorder that also affects normal life. Patients with anxiety from a very young age, displaying low self-esteem, pessimism, and severe stress is accompanied by perpetual feelings of sadness or loss of interest over a long duration of time (more than 2 weeks in order for a diagnosis to be made).\nPatients at both initial and severe stages of GAD have episodes of depression (MDD). Longitudinal studies have found variations in the appearance of MDD in patients with GAD. In these studies, (a) one-third of patients showed signs of GAD leading to MDD; (b) one-third had symptoms of MDD leading to GAD; and finally (c) one-third of them had the onset of both GAD and MDD simultaneously. More than 70% of patients with lifetime GAD are also found to have lifetime MDD. Studies of twins have revealed that the same genetic factors of risk have a hand in both GAD and MDD. However, whether the patient develops GAD or MDD first depends on how they react to the environmental stressors in their life.\nGAD and Bipolar Disorder\nFormerly called manic depression, bipolar disorder is characterized by extreme mood variations, from high to low; at high, the patient is over-exultant, while at low he may harbor suicidal thoughts for no particular reason. It has been found that 51% of patients with BD have another anxiety disorder, which actually worsens the illness. Due to this comorbidity, BD patients tend to have:\n- Younger age of onset\n- Lower quality of life\n- Lower chance of recovery\n- Increased risk of substance abuse, and, most importantly\n- Greater lifetime suicidal tendencies\nThe average period of euthymia (normal positive state of mind) in BD with comorbid GAD is found to be less than half of that in patients with BD alone. Surveys have shown suicide attempts of 62% and 53% in BD and current and lifetime GAD comorbidity patients, respectively, as opposed to 22% in patients with BD alone.\nImpulsiveness tends to be heightened in BD and current GAD patients, even after adjustments are made for age, gender, and presence of other comorbid anxieties.\nGAD and Substance Use Disorder\nResearch studies have shown a significant link between patients of GAD and substance use or abuse. Most people with GAD are unaware of their illness and try to ease their anxiety by self-medication using alcohol or drugs.\nOne-third of individuals with GAD are victims of SUD, though they are mostly known to use and not abuse substances. A mutual pattern exists between these two disorders, which follow three pathways:\n- Anxiety leading to substance use\n- Substance use/abuse leading to anxiety\n- Genetic risks that are central to both GAD and SUD.\nA survey carried out in the USA had an odds ratio of 9:5 for dependence on drugs in the presence of GAD.\nIn spite of the extremely high rate of comorbidity, only half of the patients with GAD receive treatment, suggesting that the other half is probably resorting to self-medication. According to estimates, in the USA alone about 3.1% of adults met the criteria for GAD in 2016. More women are said to be affected by GAD, though the reason for this is unknown.\nPsychiatrists are still at crossroads as to how they should approach treatment considerations, and whether to treat each disorder separately or in parallel? Should treatment for one be completed and then the next one started? Future research on the standard clinical care for comorbidities of anxiety disorders should be undertaken to explore this issue further.']	['<urn:uuid:ee65fe3a-5e3e-4065-bc88-92402e870199>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	12	18	798
31	In geometry class, what's meant by supplementary angles?	Two angles are said to be supplementary angles if their sum is 180 degrees.	['There are certain elementary statements, which are self evident and which are accepted without any questions. These are called axioms.\nAxiom 1: Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another.\nDraw a line segment AB of length 10cm. Draw a second line CD having length equal to that of AB, using a compass. Measure the length of CD. We see that, CD = 10cm.\nWe can write it as, CD = AB and AB = 10cm implies CD = 10cm.\nAxiom 2: If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.\nSuppose we have two line segments AB and DE of equal length. Add BC to AB and add EF to DE. If BC = EF, then AC = DF.\nAxiom 3: If equals are subtracted from equals, then the remainders are equal.\nSuppose we have two line segments of equal length. Remove BC from AC and EF from DE respectively. If BC = EF, then AB = DE.\nAxiom 4: Things which coincide with one another must be equal to one another.\nThis means that if two geometric figures can fit completely one in to another, they are essentially the same.\nAxiom 5: The whole is greater than the part.\nTake a container of water. Remove some water from it. Will the remaining volume of water the same as the original volume?\nGeometric postulates – Axioms, Postulates and Theorems\nPostulates in geometry are very similar to axioms, self-evident truths, and beliefs in logic, political philosophy and personal decision-making.\nThey are as follows:\n- A straight line may be drawn from any given point to any other.\n- A straight line may be extended to any finite length.\n- A circle may be described with any given point as its center and any distance as its radius.\n- All right angles are congruent.\n- If a straight line intersects two other straight lines, and so makes the two interior angles on one side of it together less than two right angles, then the other straight lines will meet at a point if extended far enough on the side on which the angles are less than two right angles.\nAxioms, Postulates and Theorems – EXERCISE 3.1.2\n1. What are undefined objects in Euclid’s geometry?\nPoints, line, plane are the undefined objects in Euclid’s geometry.\n2. What are the difference between an axiom and a postulate?\nAxioms are elementary statements , which are self evident and which are accepted without questions\nPostulates are statements which are particular to Geometry and accepted without question.\n3. Give an example for the following axioms from your experience:\na) If equals are added to equals , the wholes are equal.\n4 + 2 = 5 + 1 ( equals)\nAdding 3 both sides.\n4 + 2+ 3 = 5 + 1 + 3 ( adding equals)\n9 = 9 ( whole is equal)\nb) The whole is greater than the part .\nOur hard is not part of our body. It is smaller than the body.\n4. What is the need of introducing axioms?\nGreek mathematicians while developing geometry as a pure deductive science. They had to depend on certain primitive notions like points, straight lines, planes and space. But this was not enough to deduce everything . They had to set up certain statements, whose validity was accepted unquestionably thus there was a need of introducing axioms.\n5. You have seen earlier that the set of all natural numbers is closed under additional (closure property). Is this an axiom or same thing you can prove?\nLines and Angles – Axioms, Postulates and Theorems\nSuppose we have a ray OA on a plane with end point O. With the same plane end point. Consider another ray OB in the same plane. We observe that OB is obtained from OA through suitable rotation around the point O. We say OB subtends an angle with angle OA. The amount of rotation is the measure of this angle.\nWe use numerical measurement called degree to measure angles. We use the notation a˚ to denote a degrees. The rays OA and OB are called the sides of the angle and O is called the vertex if the angle. The angle subtended by the rays OA and OB is denoted by ∠AOB.\nWe know a geometrical instrument called protractor which is used to measure the angles.\nWe Know, different types of angles:\nStraight line angle, right angle, acute angle, obtuse angle, reflex angle, complete angle, adjacent angle, complementary angles and supplementary angles.\nLet us recall one by one,\nTwo angles are said to be supplementary angles if their sum is 180˚. Similarly, two angles are said to be complementary if they add up to 90˚\nTwo angles are said to be adjacent angles, if both the angles have a common vertex and a common side.\nWhile measuring the lengths are segments of the angles we observe the following rules:\nRule 1: Every line segment has a positive length. (The length of the line segment AB is denoted by AB or |AB|.)\nRule 2: If a point C lies on a line segment |AB|, then the length of |AB| is equal to the sum of the lengths of |AC| and |CB|; that is AB = AC + CB.\nRule 3: Every angles has a certain magnitude. A straight angles measures 180°\nRule 4: If OA, OB and OC are such that OC lies between OA and OB then ∠AOB = ∠AOC + ∠COB\nRule 5: If the angle between two rays is zero then they coincide. Conversely, if two rays coincide, the angle between them is either zero or an integral multiple of 360°\nNote: While measuring the angles, if the angle is measured anti-clock-wise, it is positive. If it is measured clock-wise, then it is negative.\nAxioms, Postulates and Theorems – EXERCISE 3.1.3\n1. Draw diagram illustrating each of the following situation:\na) Three straight lines which do not pass through a fixed point.\nb) A point and rays emanating from that point such that the angle.\n∠SPR acute angle\n∠RPT acute angle\n∠QPT acute angle\nc) Two angles which are not adjacent angles, but still supplementary.\nd) Three points in the plane which are equidistant from each other.\n2.

32	What was the fundamental weakness in Japanese naval strategy that led to their decline in air combat effectiveness by early 1943?	The Japanese failed in their air crew training program and lacked foresight on how to handle wartime attrition of experienced air crews. By early 1943, less than 18 months after the war began, the quality of Japanese pilots had deteriorated to such an extent that Japan could never recover.

As I transfer information over, I will post the new additions here for your quick reference!\nDo You Zuiho?\nThe Zuiho build in 1:100 has been completed and looks great! Coupled with this build is the reference page dedicated to the Zuiho Class.\nTo see the Zuiho Reference Page, click here.\nTo see the Zuiho Build pages, click here.\nTo see the completed Zuiho, click here.\nBattleships, Carriers and Subs! Oh my!\nEver woken up in the middle of the night wondering what the ship-horse-power of the Kuma class of light cruisers was? Ever wonder what the Hiragana was for the battleship Fuso? Ever wonder which ships were sunk during the first half of June in 1943? Well, wonder no more; this site has all of that information and more.\nBy 1930 the Japanese were quickly coming to the realization that they could never be on par with the American and British navies with regards to number of ships. Not only were the naval treaties of the time hamstringing the Japanese expansionist dreams, but the potential industrial might of the United States and the vast natural resources available to the United Kingdom via the British Empire left Japan a distant third on the world stage on all things navy.\nThe Japanese faced another very real problem: manpower. When performing war plan scenarios with different nations, the principal four belligerents (UK, USA, China, USSR) vastly out stripped the Japanese in population as well: potential sailors, soldiers and airmen. The Japanese, with their naval designs, sought to counter these two very real and insurmountable limitations with the “bigger and better” mindset.\nIt was during the 1930’s that the keels of some exceptional ships were laid down; from the super destroyer Shimakaze, to the super battleships of the Yamato class, to the super light cruisers of the Mogami class, to the super submarines of the I-400 class; the Japanese indeed practiced the art of designing the biggest and best ships in the World.\nOne integral area that the Japanese were globally on par with, but did not excel in, was Aircraft Carriers. The design of their aircraft carriers in the 1930’s was impressive, but the same could be said for the USN and the RN carriers of the time. Each nation took different ideas and incorporated them into the design of their carriers. The Japanese and Americans actually seemed to learn the same things in the 1930’s and their carriers were quite similar with regards to protections and size. The Japanese however were truly the first to plan and execute wartime operations with the concentrated firepower afforded by groupings of up to 6 large aircraft carriers at a time (Pearl Harbor, Indian Ocean).\nUnfortunately, for all the time and effort put into the design of these fantastical vessels the Japanese were short sighted on one key component and it proved their ultimate downfall. It is not directly correlated with their ship designs, but rather how ships of any class were at the utter mercy of air power. Air power, and more specifically, attack aircraft, would wreck havoc on all nations navies during the course of the war. The reader may quip, “But the Japanese excelled at naval air power, and even land based air power, in the early stages of WWII”. I agree with this sentiment wholeheartedly. Where the Japanese failed more than nearly any other nation in that conflict, and saw the fortunes of war turn against them within the first 12 months of fighting, was in their air crew training. One can excuse them for holding on too long to aircraft types that became more and more outclassed as the war progressed (examples: Mitsubishi Zero or the KI-43), but their lack of foresight of how they would cope with the inevitable wartime attrition of their experienced air crews is inexcusable. By early 1943 (less than 18 months after hostilities opened) the quality of the Japanese pilot had deteriorated to such an extent that Japan could never hope to recover. Couple this reality with the new aircraft the Allies were fielding and the survival rate of green Japanese pilots was atrocious and untenable. Mid-1944 brought the sobering reality to Japan as they unofficially formed the first suicide squadrons during the defense of the Philippines. These Kamikaze squads became official and, alarmingly, were the most successful component of Japanese air power in the waning months of the war: They just needed to train the pilots to take off, follow a lead plane and point their plane at a ship – a far cry from training a fully capable pilot in the late 1930’s.\nIt is understood that the Japanese had to be beaten back to their shores and brought to task for their aggression. Most historians agree that the minute the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor that they had lost the war. They did not have the manpower or natural resources to continue to fight the Americans, let alone the British in late 1944 and the Russians in mid-1945. They took every step they could with the design and deployment of the majority of their naval vessels and it shows in hindsight when side by side comparisons are made today. One can only speculate on how much longer the war would have dragged on and how many more people would have perished if the Japanese had redesigned their air crew training before the outset of hostilities with the Allies. If they had adopted a more American approach to training.']	['<urn:uuid:9d45251f-5c53-4f0a-a685-037510ce2df0>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	21	49	940
33	As someone studying racial equity in the arts, how do cultural institutions support underrepresented communities?	Cultural institutions support underrepresented communities in several ways. The Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art (MAC) runs programs like 'MAC in el Barrio' that commissions multidisciplinary artist residencies in communities to give voice to marginalized social sectors and support social justice processes. They also provide work opportunities for artists through commissioned projects and workshop facilitation. Similarly, many institutions offer internship programs specifically designed for students of color, such as the Getty Marrow Undergraduate Internship Program, which supports underrepresented students in museums and visual arts, and programs like MAIP that place students of color in prestigious advertising agencies.	['Flamboyan is working closely with twelve arts organizations on the island to preserve, amplify, and sustain the arts in Puerto Rico with an additional round of grantees to be announced this summer. This series will spotlight all twelve Arts Fund grantee organizations.\nRevitalizing Through the Arts: Meet Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art\nThe Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art (MAC) is a vibrant space where islanders and visitors alike can come to connect with others to appreciate art and performances. The Museum not only houses an impressive collection of art, it also brings artists and people together. Ten days after Hurricane María struck the island in September of 2017, the Museum opened its doors to the community to bring people together for the first time since the storm. It makes art part of the daily lives of the communities it serves.\nFounded in 1984 in collaboration between artists and philanthropists, the MAC has been instrumental in the preservation, documentation and promotion of art produced since 1940 in Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, Latin America and its diasporas. Throughout the year, the Museum organizes thematic exhibitions of its collection while presenting temporary exhibitions of local and foreign artists; it offers a varied program of multidisciplinary activities like concerts, film screenings and theater shows to poetry and contemporary dance.\nTo find out more about this dynamic museum, continue reading below.\nWhat’s the story behind the creation of the Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art?\nThe MAC was founded and incorporated as a nonprofit organization on October 1984. All its collections belong to the people of Puerto Rico. The vision of the artists was fundamental when creating the museum and it was conceptualized as a place to foster multidisciplinary experiences open to all art and contemporary culture expressions.\nAfter its incorporation, the MAC offered its services in public spaces like Plaza Las Américas (a mall) until Sacred Heart University (Universidad del Sagrado Corazón) gave the museum a provisional space at its Magdalena Sofía Barat building. The MAC was able to develop its programs further from there for the next 15 years. After years of looking for a permanent space for the MAC, the government conceded the museum the use of the historic Rafael M. Labra building on October 2002.\nCan you describe part of the work the Museum does?\nAs published in an article by the Mellon Foundation, the Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art is conceived as a hybrid institution: a space of production and creation as well as of research, exhibition, and conservation. The museum’s leadership believes that an interdisciplinary focus is essential for a museum dedicated to contemporary art and that our audiences should participate directly in the process of art to consolidate their contemporary art education, as contemporary art is characterized by its emphasis on process and on the construction and exhibition of artworks and interventions.\nFor these reasons the MACPR has been actively commissioning art since 2009. Through their intra- and extramural residency programs such as Taller Vivo (Live Workshop) and El MAC en el Barrio (MAC in the Barrio), we have given continuity to our commitment to act as an observatory of new aesthetics and to encourage the systematic study and analysis of convergent artistic disciplines. Through both these programs as well as through our exhibition and education programs, we consistently (in spite of limited funding) provide work opportunities for artists through commissioned projects and by engaging them as workshop facilitators, speakers, and more.\nMAC in el Barrio, an initiative now in Santurce, Río Piedras, Guaynabo and Cataño, commissions multidisciplinary artist residencies developed in communities to “give voice to marginalized social sectors using art as a fundamental support mechanism for social justice processes”. The museum organizes exhibitions and an educational program (art seminars for teachers, workshops for students and the general public). MAC also acts as a respected venue for various forms of performing arts (music, dance, theater) and performance art – currently hosting a two-year performance art incubator for 20 artists in collaboration with Northwestern University. It has a longstanding partnership with its neighboring school and incorporates university students through independent projects. Among other projects, MAC has an interest in launching a sustainable cultural tourism initiative that fairly represents communities and benefits artists and community members (training, jobs, etc.).\nWhat was the reality of the Museum after Hurricane María and before receiving the Flamboyan Arts Fund grant?\nAs expressed to the Mellon Foundation by Marianne Ramírez Aponte, MAC’s Executive Director, “in the weeks after Hurricane Maria, the MAC became aware that it had moved beyond the role of an unusual art institution with intensive community engagement programming or a storage location for important artworks and archives. It had become a home—a community center and major resource for those seeking aid after the storm. It was a center for relief distribution and a place where people gathered to fill out FEMA forms. It offered an Artist Emergency Fund providing financial assistance. It offered programming to students who had lost their academic routines because of power outages and destruction caused by the hurricane, as well as art therapy and other services for families and seniors.”\nHow is the Museum using the funds it received?\nThe MAC is currently using the funds to repair the building, buy a power generator, cover operational costs, acquire more human resources and giving grants to independent/individual artists.\nThis post concludes our 12 part series on our inaugural Arts Fund grantees!

34	Is Buddhist temple food in Kyoto part of sustainable tourism?	Buddhist temple food (shojin ryori) in Kyoto aligns well with sustainable tourism principles. The traditional vegetarian cuisine, available at temples like Tenryu-ji's Shigetsu restaurant, offers visitors an authentic cultural experience while being environmentally conscious. This fits into the broader concept of responsible tourism, where visitors can explore local culture in a sustainable way, moving beyond typical tourist attractions and contributing positively to the destination. It represents an alternative to overtourism by focusing on cultural preservation and sustainable practices.	"[""With strong Buddhist traditions and local specialties like tofu and Kyo-yasai (Kyoto vegetables), Kyoto has some excellent vegetarian restaurants. Here is essential information on vegetarian dining in Kyoto and a list of great vegetarian restaurants in Kyoto.\ntemple dinner © _foam\nKyoto is the home of most of Japan’s main Buddhist sects (which are, in theory at least, vegetarian). Kyoto is also famed for its tofu and its distinctive locally grown vegetables (known as Kyo-yasai). Thus, Kyoto is a pretty good place for vegetarians.\nHowever, there is one important thing to note: If you do not eat fish or fish products, your choices will be limited. That is because a lot of Japanese cooking is based on dashi (broth made with bonito flakes). Fortunately, many high-end places can usually prepare a broth made only from kombu (kelp) if you request in advance via a hotel concierge or private tour operator.\nIn addition, vegans and pescatarians can eat shojin ryori (traditional Buddhist temple cuisine) without any problem and these meals are likely to be among the most elaborate and interesting vegetarian meals you’ve ever had. See my separate page on Vegan Kyoto for more info and a list of recommended Kyoto vegan restaurants.\nThe following is a list of some of my favorite vegetarian restaurants in Kyoto. Where gluten-free and vegan dishes are available, I note that as well.\nThis cramped little restaurant in the middle of downtown Kyoto is the go-to choice for many of Kyoto’s vegetarians. They do occasionally serve meat in some of their dishes, but there’s always a full vegetarian choice available for the day’s lunch or dinner set. Vegan dishes are also available. The food is generally locally sourced and organic. It’s highly recommended.\nTosuiro will open your mind to the full potential of tofu. Here, they elevate tofu cuisine to an art form. Even non-vegetarians will find the food here to be delicious. The set meals involve a flight of varied and filling tofu dishes. Highly recommended! Note that the broth used here contains bonito flakes (ie, fish). If you want to avoid all animal products, you will have to skip the dishes that contain broth.\nThis downtown tofu and yuba specialist serves delectable set meals at a very reasonable price. The fare is filling and nutritious.\n- Falafel Garden\nA great vegetarian restaurant in northern Kyoto, Falafel Garden specializes in the eponymous falafel, but there’s plenty more on the menu to keep things interesting.\n- Shokudo Terasu\nVegetarian ramen?! It sounds like a contradiction in terms, since ramen almost automatically implies a meat-based soup. But, this fantastic eatery in Southern Higashiyama (within walking distance of downtown), serves a delicious ramen with a soy milk-based soup. Note that the broth used here contains bonito flakes (ie, fish). If you want to avoid all animal products, you will have to skip the dishes that contain broth.\n- Mumokuteki Café\nThis popular vegetarian eatery in the middle of downtown serves a wide variety of vegan and vegetarian dishes. The bilingual menu lists all the information you need to know to choose a dish. The lunch sets are filling and are a good value.\nJust down the hill from Ginkaku-ji Temple, Omen is one of our favorite restaurants in Kyoto. They serve some of Kyoto’s best udon noodles. The noodle broth has bonito flakes in it, but several of their a la carte dishes are pure veg.\nTosca is a friendly restaurant that serves healthy and delicious Japanese-style vegetarian and vegan food. It’s within walking distance of Ginkaku-ji and other sights in Northern Higashiyama.\nKerala is one of the best Indian restaurants in Kyoto, and its downtown location make it the perfect place to fuel up while doing some shopping.\n- Yudofu Sagano\nYodofu Sagano is a great place to try that great Arashiyama Buddhist specialty: yudo (chunks of tofu simmered in broth).\nInside the grounds of Tenryu-ji Temple, Shigetsu is a great place to try traditional Japanese Buddhist cuisines, also known as shojin-ryori.\nYoshuji is the nicest place to eat in Kurama, full stop. You can choose from sets of Buddhist vegetarian cuisine or simpler bowls of noodles.\nA short walk east of downtown, Choice is a haven for vegan and gluten-intolerant diners. They serve a wide and varied menu of tasty dishes, including excellent lunch sets. There’s a full English menu.\nFor information on gluten-free dining in Kyoto, see our Gluten-Free Kyoto page.\nKyoto Vacation Checklist\n- Check Kyoto accommodation availability on Booking.com - usually you can reserve a room with no upfront payment.

It’s no surprise that popular cities are a tourist’s haven, but places like Phuket and Venice which were once remote and rural have now become packed with picture-taking and souvenir selling just as bad. So, what is this “overtourism”, and how detrimental has our travelling become?\nYou may have heard the word flung about in news articles and it had a steep increase of interest on Google towards the end of 2017; “overtourism” refers to saturated areas of the world where the influx of tourist crowds has become so bad that they disturb the local community and environment.\nMany cities throughout 2018 have had to address the overcrowding with some form of limitation to the area. Take the romantic getaway of Venice for example, where the mayor called for segregation between locals and tourists on a weekend in May this year by redirecting sightseers form the popular streets and certain areas only available to residents. But this isn’t the first time Venice has had to make restrictions to tourists, when travellers were warned about “sitting fines” in September 2017 of a fine up to 500 euros.\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock\nOne of the problems with the industry is the exotic, luxurious ideal sold to travellers. Maya Bay in Thailand – which was once featured as a paradise destination in 2000 film The Beach – was reaching visitors of up to 5000 a day back in June 2018 and saw a closure of four months to disperse the demand. Similarly, in the Philippines, the island of Boracay was reopened with strict limits on the tourism to regulate the excess population; restrictions were implemented such as no drinking and removal of casinos and beach vendors. Even all water sports were banned.\nNot just the utopian paradise attractions are in danger of overtourism, the cultural and historical landmarks of cities bring in an excessive interest too. UNESCO World Heritage listings are often a child of overtourism because the historical connotations of the name automatically attract travellers – creating a catch 22 situation where environmental protection by UNESCO creates a consequential damage through human curiosity. Although managed and planned before being listed, there is a lack of funding and implementation to ensure that overtourism isn’t a consequence of this title.\nBut can this problem be solved? If we filter tourism out to more remote places, surely this is just going to fill up the smaller, less-known adventures and make them just as full. Even if this overtourism averts travellers to far-flung escapes, many places which are unexplored can be dangerous. The city of Kyoto in Japan has been trying to ease off peak times from travellers who are putting themselves in danger with treacherous hikes and treks to get that perfect selfie.\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock\nThere is one answer to this. Responsible tourism. A very simple answer to a big problem in the travel industry. To be able to responsibly travel is for us visitors to consider what the wider impacts are, and whether it can be made positive. Moving away from the typical landmarks and exploring cultures in different areas allows tourism to become more sustainable. With the uprise of ‘ecotourism’ and sustainable travel, it has become more accessible to travel without leaving a big mark.\nSo next time you’re searching out the best hotspots on the next destination on your bucket list, crowded tourists and unsustainable impacts might not be so hot after all.']"	['<urn:uuid:806f8e49-79bd-4196-ad47-768802ab5bff>', '<urn:uuid:0e32f915-afcc-4b01-90be-d5b2ec97b540>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	10	78	1458

Nutritionally, they should focus on plant-based foods, which contain antioxidants that protect DNA and control cell growth. For exercise, aerobic activity is particularly beneficial, as it can help reduce the harmful effects of chemotherapy on the cardiovascular system. Studies show that cancer survivors who exercise during treatment may have better survival prospects and improved quality of life. Exercise also helps ward off depression among cancer survivors.	"['Cancer Prevention And Recovery\nThe following article, a collaborative effort, was written for educational purposes and to raise awareness. If you or someone you know has been diagnosed with cancer, read on.\nCANCER DIAGNOSIS – WHAT TO DO NEXT\nContributed by Beth McNeil Editor/Writer in Cancer Studies and Research:\nGetting a diagnosis of cancer can be devastating, but it’s important to know what the diagnosis means, as well as what to do next for the best outcome. Consider getting a second opinion to be sure of the diagnosis. Then when you have a realistic idea of the prognosis, it’s time to consider treatment options and what to expect.\nSome cancers come with a difficult prognosis, meaning the cancer is complicated to treat and the survival rates are low. Any late stage cancer, or in other words, a cancer that has metastasized falls into this category. Some specific types are also a challenge to treat and cure. Mesothelioma, a lung cancer caused by exposure to asbestos, falls into this category. It is rarely curable, and the survival rates are low. However, an early cancer diagnosis has the potential of being treatable, as well as the possibility of a hopeful prognosis. Some types of cancers are more likely to be cured with treatment including melanoma, prostate, testicular and thyroid cancers.\n“ Keep it natural. For prevention and recovery it’s best to avoid extremes in food, whether in preparation or ingredients. Foods should be as close to their natural state as possible without additives or preservatives. With so many allowable additives in our foods (over 10,000, yikes!), the Enviromental Working Group or EWG’s Dirty Dozen Guide to Foods Additives makes it easier to navigate what to avoid.""\nCANCER PREVENTION AND RECOVERY A List of Do’s and Don’ts\nReported by Laura Crotty\nWhile research towards effective treatments continue, we are closer than ever to cracking the code on cancer. The ongoing development of treatments such as Immuno-Oncology, which uses the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, are promising.\nAlthough we have no control over advancements towards a cure, research supports the following lifestyle and dietary practices, both within our control, to be associated with prevention and #recovery.\nTIPS FOR CANCER PREVENTION AND RECOVERY:\n- MAINTAIN A HEALTHY WEIGHT: Although studies have shown a possible link between certain foods and #cancer #prevention it is important to keep in mind that one of the best, medically proven things one can do to reduce cancer risk is to maintain a healthy weight. Consult with a healthcare professional on which type of exercise program is best for you.\n- AVOID INFLAMMATION: For those suffering from chronic inflammatory conditions, it is best to seek treatment sooner than later. A study from MIT confirms a longstanding theory why inflammation and cancer are linked. In a report by Anne Trafton for MIT News she states “In these chronic inflammatory conditions immune cells produce highly reactive molecules, which can damage DNA. Inflammation also stimulates cells to divide. The simultaneous DNA damage and cell division during inflammation can lead to cancer because dividing cells are more vulnerable to mutations caused by DNA damage”. One of the things that people can do with chronic #inflammation right now is to avoid exposures that would be problematic; for example certain foods that lead to DNA damage could be avoided (cured meats, deep fried foods) states Bevin Engelward MIT Professor of Biological Engineering and Deputy Director of the MIT Center for Environmental Health Sciences.\n- KEEP IT COLORFUL: While attending culinary school years ago, I was lucky to have the opportunity to study under Annemarie Colbin the author of The Book of Whole Meals and Food and Healing. Both critically acclaimed works are helpful resources for those interested in health-supportive foods. Annemarie always taught ‘the more color the better’ when selecting foods; utilized in treatment and prevention programs, apply this strategy when planning your meals. Aim for five colors on your plate. Color (natural) in food means a variety of vitamins and minerals are present, which increases the variety of health-supportive nutrients you are nourishing your body with.\n- KEEP IT NATURAL: For prevention and recovery it’s best to avoid extremes in food, whether in preparation or ingredients. Foods should be as close to their #natural state as possible without additives or preservatives. With so many allowable additives in our foods (over 10,000, yikes!), the Enviromental Working Group or EWG’s Dirty Dozen Guide to Foods Additives makes it easier to navigate what to avoid. Optimally choose foods that are #organic and free of processing (tip: stick to the outer aisles in the grocery store to avoid temptation). Use cooking methods that are gradual, gentle such as braising, stewing and lightly sauteing. Avoid deep-frying or using a microwave. Use saltless seasonings and fresh herbs and spices whenever possible.\n- INCORPORATE MORE PLANT-BASED FOODS INTO YOUR DIET: The American plate is changing. According to The American Institute for Cancer Research two-thirds of your plate should consist of plant-based foods rounding out the remaining 1/3 with animal protein. Karen Collins, MS, RD states ‘plant foods probably offer protection in a number of ways. They provide thousands of phytochemicals, which are natural plant compounds. Many are antioxidants, which seem to protect and repair our DNA. Some antioxidants appear to affect cancer cells, controlling how they grow or spread. The vitamins and minerals in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and beans also help produce and repair DNA and control cell growth’.\nTHINGS TO AVOID WHILE IN RECOVERY:\n- ALCOHOL: When the body metabolizes alcohol, it produces acetaldehyde, a chemical compound that may damage DNA, which can lead to cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute, if you drink it is recommended to do so moderately if at all while in recovery. Moderate drinking is defined as one drink/day for women and up to two drinks/day for men. If you drink more on a regular basis the risk for developing cancer can increase incrementally, depending on the amount of alcohol consumed.\nAccording to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a standard alcoholic drink in the United States contains 14.0 grams (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol. Generally, this amount of pure alcohol is found in:\n- 12 ounces of beer\n- 8-9 ounces of malt liquor\n- 5 ounces of wine\n- 1.5 ounces, or a ""shot,"" of 80-proof distilled spirits (liquor)\nChart Published By: The National Cancer Institute\n- STRESS: Effective coping strategies to deal with stress can greatly improve your quality of life by supporting a healthy lifestyle as well as relieving symptoms that are related to treatment. The support of friends and family, counseling, relaxation techniques (meditation) and exercise are effective methods to reduce stress.\n- SUGAR: Although sugar is not directly linked to increased risk for developing #cancer, it’s empty calories may lead to obesity, which is. “The average American consumes 89 grams of sugar per day, which is two to three times the recommended amount; cutting added sugar is an easy way to slim down and reduce your risk for cancer” says Crystal Langlois, RD, LD Director of Nutrition at The Cancer Treatment Centers of Americas hospital in Atlanta.\n- HOT BEVERAGES: The IARC or the cancer agency of The World Health Organization has identified very hot beverages, drinks that are 149 degrees Fahrenheit, as a probable carcinogen and probably causes cancer. It is important to note that in the U.S. coffee, tea, hot chocolate and other hot beverages are usually drunk at a lower temperature and therefore do not pose a risk.\nThe following soup is an quick and easy way to incorporate the power of plant-based foods into your diet. My recipe, inspired by Gourmets 1963 Cream of Mushroom Soup, offers a plant-based version, however the use of butter instead of olive oil gives this soup a wonderful full-bodied richness. Mushrooms have long been valued for their healthful benefits. “Some of the most immunosupportive agents come from mushrooms, and this is one of the reasons why they’re beneficial in both preventing and treating cancer” states Dr. Mercola a board certified Osteopathic physican and surgeon. Certain mushrooms are more medicinal than others ‘the compound lentinan in shiitake mushrooms has been found to increase the survival rate of cancer patients’ Mercola states as evidenced in this study. When consuming mushrooms it’s best to use organic to avoid pesticides and/or other chemical additives.\nCream of Mushroom Soup\nInspired by Gourmets 1963 recipe for Cream of Mushroom Soup\n-1 cup of shallots, minced\n-3 Tablespoons of butter or olive oil\n-4 T all-purpose flour\n-4 cups vegetarian or regular chicken broth\n-1/2 pound of organic shiitake mushrooms, coarsely chopped\n-1/2 pound of white button mushrooms, coarsely chopped\n-1/2 Tablespoon vegetable seasoning salt\n-1/2 Tablespoon umeboshi vinegar\n-hard crusted bread\nSaute the shallots in butter. Add the flour and stir for 4-5 minutes until fragrantly ‘toasty’. Add the stock, one cup at a time whisking to blend. Bring to a simmer, adding the salt. Add the mushrooms and simmer for 30 minutes. Puree the soup in a blender; taste and adjust the seasonings to your liking (pepper can be added here as well as the seasoned salt). Pour into 4 small sized serving bowls and garnish with a sprig of parsley. Serve with a generous slice of hard crusted bread.\nYield: 4 Servings', 'Gretchen M.

You are also an Elite Trainer with the International Sports Sciences Association, a personal trainer, a specialist in Fitness Therapy, and a Hall of Fame Athlete, to name only a few of your qualifications. How did all this come about for you? How did you get your start in Scuba fitness?\nA: Curiosity. As a fitness professional since 1996 and a diver since 2001, I was naturally curious about fitness for diving. Initially, I set out for my own satisfaction to source and summarize scientific research in order to formulate basic exercise protocols specific to scuba diving. In the process I discovered the need for a greater awareness of the importance of physical fitness and health among divers. This particularly included a clear understanding of how much and what type of exercise is individually most beneficial in life and for sport diving. My earliest general recommendations were to adopt the exercise and nutrition protocols of the American Heart Association and the American College of Sports Medicine. Since then I have worked to bridge the worlds of diving and fitness by developing specific exercise programs and nutrition guidelines that address the health of the diving community and improve diving performance. These specifics include dispelling myths, writing articles and publishing workouts that are inspired by diving experiences, and translating research and answering questions about fitness and health from divers. Fortunately, I enjoy writing and have been presented opportunities to share my passion for diver health. Interestingly, although I have many published articles now, the very first workout I developed for divers, ‘Are you scuba fit?’ was recently published for the first time in X-Ray Mag.\nQ: Obviously being fit is important for divers. We frequently read of fatal diving accidents where the diver in question was overweight or out of shape or not diving within their limits. This may seem like an obvious question, but do you believe these type of fatalities can be reduced by divers being more fit and having a regular fitness program?\nA: Yes. When discussing how to prevent diving deaths, we always have to consider the events of the dive along with the unique combination of proper training, the health of the individual diver, and the stresses of the underwater environment. For the most part, we rarely know all of the circumstances surrounding a dive fatality. What we do know is that a review of Divers Alert Network annual reports revealed that the most prevalent medical conditions reported by divers are heart disease/cardiovascular illness, high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, smoking, asthma and allergies. For example, in the 2008 DAN report that summaries data from 2006, DAN investigated 75 dive fatalities in the United States and Canada. According to the report, 73% of the victims were overweight or obese (using BMI), 38% had a history of heart disease and 28% had cardiac related conditions at the time of their demise. The case studies also include high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, asthma, and the use of allergy medications. If we step back for a broader view, what we see is divers who died actually had the medical conditions that are reported by the dive community. First and foremost, ScubaFit® is designed to address and improve the health of every diver. Secondly, the FitDiver® program helps improve diving performance. Hopefully, this combination makes a positive difference. Exercise is the great equalizer and scuba diving is a great motivation. Physical activity helps prevent, reverse and/or manage high blood pressure before it leads to heart disease, cardiovascular illness, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, asthma, and allergies, aids in smoking cessation, and so much more. Participation in a balanced fitness program can improve the overall condition of the body with increased strength, flexibility, aerobic capacity, and helps maintain a healthy body composition. Divers of all ages can improve diving performance, add longevity to their scuba lifestyle and live healthier, happier lives.\nQ: What role does diet play in a diver fitness program? Should divers watch what they eat?\nA: Yes. Nutrition is an important element of every fitness program. For divers, nutrition first addresses health and then performance. Greater success comes from understanding how to fuel the body for the tasks at hand and then eating accordingly. A beginning exercise for monitoring how much food to eat is to look ahead three hours and determine what type of physical activity is planned. If a diver is planning to sit at a desk their meal might be smaller than it would if they were going for a bike ride. The type of food is as important as the quantity. On diving days, and depending on the type of diving, divers can actually eat and drink to fuel diving activities and aid in optimal physiological responses. Diving has a unique set of energy expenditures that provide guidelines for carbohydrates, protein and fat intake. The good news is that the ratios for diving also work for fat loss so divers can sometimes combine their nutrition goals.\nQ: Explain your ScubaFit® Diver Course. What does that involve and why is it important for divers to take it?\nA: The ScubaFit® Diver Course is a fitness and nutrition certification for divers. The course takes 8-10 hours to complete, includes a 50-page manual and a workbook. A combination of lecture and practical application, divers learn what fitness for diving means, they evaluate their current health and fitness status, relate it to the type of diving in which they participate, and gain an understanding of where and how they can safely enter into a fitness program. Divers are provided with the tools to move forward on their own and/or seek assistance from their physician, fitness professional or other support. Nutrition and hydration for diving is also part of the course. Divers already participating in a regular fitness program, athletes, and those injured or with orthopedic challenges learn how to tailor their training toward performance or rehabilitation. To keep all divers motivated with workouts beyond the beginner level and for variety, I have developed a series of FitDiver® mobile fitness applications.\nQ: You’re not a doctor, of course, but what regimen do you recommend for divers with high blood pressure? Is it an acceptable risk for divers?\nA: Aerobic exercise has the greatest immediate positive effect for high blood pressure followed by changes in diet. However, divers with high blood pressure will want to “ease-in” to exercise under the supervision of a physician. Considering the benefits of aerobic exercise, the known prevalence of high blood pressure in the diving community and the stresses of the underwater environment, aerobic exercise is the first fitness priority for divers. Here is a link to my article Heads Up: Considerations for Divers with High Blood Pressure, published in Alert Diver U.S. and Asia-Pacific. If controlled properly, moderate high blood pressure does not compromise fitness to dive. If blood pressure remains high despite treatment or if it is erratic, diving should be avoided. It is most important for divers to know that exercise can prevent, reverse and help manage high blood pressure.\nQ: You have worked with divers who are cancer survivors. What benefits have they seen?\nA: My personal observations are consistent with the American Institute of Cancer Research (AICR) findings that, “Physical activity is an essential part of good health. People who are active over a long period of time are at lower risk for many types of cancer. For cancer survivors, studies suggest that exercise is beneficial in improving quality of life and long-term prospects for survival.” AICR goes on to report that ”Cancer survivors, especially those diagnosed with early-stage prostate and breast cancer, are at heightened risk of cardiovascular disease years following their diagnosis. The condition is caused by chemotherapy and other cancer therapies that can damage the cardiovascular system. Recent research suggests that cancer patients who participate in a structured exercise program during chemotherapy (a practice commonly prescribed to heart patients) may reduce the harmful effects of chemotherapy on the cardiovascular system, and therefore may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, years after treatment.” Particularly worth mentioning is the finding that exercise helps to ward off depression among cancer survivors.\nQ: In your opinion, is Body Mass Index (BMI) a useful tool for divers to measure their fitness?\nA: No. Body Mass Index (BMI), a formula of height and weight, was developed in the 1800’s by Arthur Quetelet to classify sedentary individuals and was not intended to measure fitness. It became recognized in the U.S. in 1972 as a result of a paper written by Ancel Keys on population studies. In 1998 the National Institutes of Health modified (lowered) BMI guidelines reclassifying 25 million Americans from healthy to overweight. Using BMI guidelines one in every four adults in the U.S. are obese and another 2/3 are considered overweight. BMI also penalizes individuals with more lean body mass. For example, Kobe Bryant at 6’6” and 220 pounds is classified as overweight, lean Shawn Merriman of the San Diego Chargers at 6’4” and 265 pounds is classified as obese, and the totally ripped body builder Jay Cutler at 5’9” and 265 pounds is classified as morbidly obese. Most divers who want to lose weight actually need to lose body fat and many need to not just keep the muscle they have but train for more. Research states that younger, slimmer, or more aerobically fit divers produced fewer bubbles compared with older, fatter, or poorly fit divers. Calculating body composition is the best way to track relative change, determine if the exercise and nutrition program is working or being adhered to, and find motivation with measurable results. In presentations to dive instructors I discuss how important it is to avoid misjudging. While there are obvious outward visual signs of unhealthy lifestyles in divers, forming opinions of physical fitness for diving using external appearance alone can lead to overlooking serious health problems in many divers. Physical fitness for diving is best determined by the lifestyle, activity level and medical condition of the individual diver. It is prudent to think about what you cannot see when evaluating physical fitness for diving.\nQ: What is a ‘scuba fit’ diver?\nA: A ‘scuba fit’ diver is a diver who practices a healthy lifestyle with regular fitness and good nutrition. These good habits are performed with an understanding of the health benefits of exercise and its potential to reduce the risks and injuries associated with the stresses of the underwater environment and enhance performance for scuba diving activities.\nFitDiver: [fit-di-ver] – a person who strives and achieves the required level of fitness in order to stay underwater for long periods of time and adapt to the elements presented. www.fit-diver.com\nQ: Is there an upper age limit for diving, or does it depend on the diver’s fitness level?\nA: I am not aware of any upper age limit for diving. The current life expectancy in the United States is more than 78 years. A diver certified at 20 years of age has the potential for more than 50 years of scuba diving. During this diving lifespan many biological changes will occur. Beginning in early adulthood all body systems begin to lose capacity; muscle strength decreases, cardiovascular capacity diminishes, and body composition changes. Clearly, illness should not be confused with aging, however, changes in the body due to aging are of great concern when combined with illness, injury or a sedentary lifestyle. There are many theories of aging, but only physical activity is wholly agreed to reverse the effects of aging. As with diving and any activity, there are risks associated with exercising. Fortunately the benefits of a fitness lifestyle far outweigh the risks associated with exercise and greatly reduce the risks associated with diving. As the body ages, workouts can be modified to minimize risk and maximize results. A fitness lifestyle may extend biological health by as much as 20 years. The sooner divers begin a physical fitness program the greater the benefits and all divers can improve their health at every age.']"	['<urn:uuid:1ce13956-b011-4e73-b14d-761833b0dfec>', '<urn:uuid:02dc4ab5-8424-446f-b924-6c0e73143804>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	9	79	4174
36	How do scientists detect tiny particles at both the Large Hadron Collider and RHIC, and what kinds of discoveries have they made at these facilities?	At the Large Hadron Collider, scientists use detectors like the Compact Muon Solenoid to record collisions and track particles, which led to finding evidence of the Higgs boson. At the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), researchers use the STAR detector to study collision fragments, which allowed them to discover the heaviest known antimatter containing an anti-strange quark - marking the first entry below the traditional Periodic Table.	"['This is what a physics party in front of a Compact Muon Solenoid detector looks like. When do we get hoverboards?\nNotre Dame\'s theologians might still be searching for a better understanding of God, but some of Notre Dame\'s physicists recently announced they got pretty close. They found evidence of the God Particle.\nResearchers at the 17-mile long Large Hadron Collider (LHC), an atom-smasher that helps scientists analyze subatomic particles, found the Higgs boson\'s shadow and its footprint. In the world of subatomic physics, that\'s pretty close to finding a particle.\nAn international team of nearly 2,000 scientists announced Wednesday that they had found scientific evidence from two different experiments that the so-called Higgs boson particle exists. They can\'t point to it just yet, primarily because it\'s a subatomic particle, and subatomic particles are really really small.\nUnlike, say, a new species of elephant, subatomic particles are smaller than atoms, so they\'re hard to point to.\nColin Jessop, Notre Dame professor and ND-CMS Grand Pooh-Bah.\nBefore researchers could find the Higgs boson, however, they needed a way to detect the subatomic particles that come flying out of a high-speed atomic collision. That\'s where the Notre Dame researchers came in.\nColin Jessop, a professor of physics, led a Notre Dame team in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment - ND CMS for short. The ND CMS team, which includes over 25 faculty, researchers, students and technicians, helps researchers record the collisions at the LHC.\nJessop\'s CMS team developed the experiment from its beginning, even helping to build parts of the detector and operating it once the experiment switched on.\n""We are closely involved with the search for the Higgs boson,"" Jessop told ND Newswire.\nThe Notre Dame team also has a nationally-recognized program called QuarkNet that allows high school students and teachers to contribute to the research of the Notre Dame group.\nWhen the Higgs boson turns into two photons (the thick red lines), the CMS detector is there to tell about it. Physics!\n“Essentially every local high school has contributed in some way to our research program, so I hope that our local community beyond just Notre Dame will feel like they are part of this work too,” said Jessop.\nPhysicists (including Peter Higgs, who loaned his name to the particle) predicted the existence of the Higgs boson in the mid-sixties. The Higgs boson is highly important in the world of theoretical physics, but it matters in the real world simply because the Higgs boson is the particle that gives everything else mass. When Manti Te\'o launches himself into some poor running back, you can bet that running back feels a lot of mass colliding with him. The Higgs boson is, very simply put, what makes that happen.\nTo become an expert on subatomic quantum physics and impress all your friends:\n- WSBT-TV reporter Kelli Stopczynski interviews Notre Dame researchers and explains the Higgs Boson!

Dr. Zhangbu Xu, a physicist at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory, where the 2.4-mile circular “atom smasher” is located, will share this discovery with a wider audience at this year’s meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).\nWHEN: Friday, February 18, 2011, 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time\nWHERE: Washington, D.C., Convention Center, Room 207B\nBACKGROUND: All ordinary nuclei are made of protons and neutrons (which in turn contain only up and down quarks). The standard Periodic Table of Elements is arranged according to the number of protons, which determine each element’s chemical properties. There is also a more complex, three-dimensional chart that conveys information about the number of neutrons, which may change in different isotopes of the same element, and a quantum number known as “strangeness,” which depends on the presence of strange quarks. Nuclei containing one or more strange quarks are called hypernuclei. For all ordinary matter, with no strange quarks, the strangeness value is zero and the chart is flat. Hypernuclei appear above the plane of the chart.\nThe diagram above is known as the 3-D chart of the nuclides. The familiar Periodic Table arranges the elements according to their atomic number, Z, which determines the chemical properties of each element. Physicists are also concerned with the N axis, which gives the number of neutrons in the nucleus. The third axis represents strangeness, S, which is zero for all naturally occurring matter, but could be non-zero in the core of collapsed stars. Antinuclei lie at negative Z and N in the above chart, and the newly discovered antinucleus (magenta) now extends the 3-D chart into the new region of strange antimatter.\nLast year, members of the STAR detector collaboration at RHIC published evidence of a form of strange antimatter with an anti-strange quark — an antihypernucleus — making it the first entry below the plane of the 3D chart of nuclides, laying the first stake in a new frontier of physics.\nCollisions at RHIC fleetingly produce conditions that existed a few microseconds after the Big Bang, which scientists believe gave birth to the universe as we know it some 13.7 billion years ago. In both nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and in the Big Bang, quarks and antiquarks emerge with equal abundance. Nuclear collisions are unique and distinct from elementary particle collisions because they deposit large amounts of energy into a more extended volume. In contrast to the Big Bang, the small amount of energy in nuclear collisions produces negligible gravitational attraction, which allows the resulting quark-gluon plasma to expand rapidly and to cool down and transition into a hadron gas, producing nucleons and their antiparticles.\nAt RHIC, among the collision fragments that survive to the final state, matter and antimatter are still close to equally abundant, even in the case of the relatively complex antinucleus and its normal-matter partner featured in the present study. In contrast, antimatter appears to be largely absent from the present-day universe.\nThe STAR team has found that the rate at which their heaviest antinucleus is produced is consistent with expectations based on a statistical collection of antiquarks from the soup of quarks and antiquarks generated in RHIC collisions. Extrapolating from this result, the experimenters believe they should be able to discover even heavier antinuclei in upcoming collider running periods. The most abundantly produced antimatter next in line for discovery is the antimatter Helium-4 nucleus, also known as the antimatter α (alpha) particle.\nDr. Xu, a member of the STAR collaboration, will describe the discovery of the first antimatter hypernucleus, the models which can describe the production mechanism and the abundance of these antimatter nuclei, and the remaining heaviest antimatter nucleus to be discovered in the foreseeable future at RHIC.\nThe STAR collaboration is composed of 54 institutions from 13 countries. Research at RHIC is funded primarily by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science, Office of Nuclear Physics, and by various national and international collaborating institutions.\n2011-11236 | INT/EXT | Newsroom']"	['<urn:uuid:6492a4d0-3a06-4628-b319-c4ff31c23812>', '<urn:uuid:082d02da-22a5-49ab-8289-507189f142cb>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	25	67	1259
37	I'm trying to save money on my wheat farm. Would looking for leftover nutrients in deeper soil layers help me reduce fertilizer costs?	Yes, testing deeper soil layers can lead to significant savings. Tests have shown substantial amounts of nitrogen as deep as 48 inches - from 78 to 210 pounds per acre. Savings could range from $10 to more than $100 per acre, depending on the crop need and the amount of residual nitrogen available.	['What is in this article?:\n- Expensive fertilizer becoming bigger part of wheat production budget\n- Deficiencies can be costly\n- Phosphorous makes a difference\n• Farmers need to fine-tune operations to make certain their fertility programs are as efficient as possible.\n• Options should include annual soil tests, deep sampling, proper placement, proper timing and proper rate to mesh with intended crop use.\n• Farmers also may want to look at organic fertilizer sources, such as chicken litter, but should be careful about non-traditional products that may not come with unbiased testing.\nPROPER FERTILITY is an important consideration for a good wheat crop and with current high fertilizer prices growers need to make certain they apply nutrients efficiently and economically.\nDeficiencies can be costly\nDeficiencies can be costly. McFarland said nitrogen may be the most challenging to manage since it changes and transforms after application and may be lost to soil leaching or into the atmosphere.\n“We recommend a split application for wheat,” he said. “That way we make certain we have nitrogen available at peak demand and also minimize the potential for losses from heavy rainfall or other climate factors. Split applications also give us an opportunity to judge crop conditions and potential before we top-dress so we can apply the most effective and most economical rate.”\nRate and timing also depend on crop use. Demand may be different for wheat intended for grain, grazing or as a dual purpose crop. Yield potential and available moisture also affect fertility rate.\nMcFarland said farmers should look deeper for residual nitrogen, especially if they planted and fertilized a crop last year and drought prevented typical production. “Nitrogen is very soluble and moves in the soil profile, so we recommend farmers sample deeper than the zero to six-inch depth they usually pull from.”\nNitrogen that has moved deeper into the soil profile is still available to the crop. Tests have shown substantial amounts of nitrogen as deep as 48 inches — from 78 to 210 pounds per acre, McFarland said. “At just 24-inch depths, we still find significant amounts of nitrogen available. With the current price of fertilizer, that may represent a significant savings.”\nHe said farmers who use residual nitrogen can decrease typical application rates by the amount identified and produce equal yields. “But farmers have to measure it to know how to adjust rates.”\nSavings could range from $10 to more than $100 per acre, depending on the crop need and the amount of residual nitrogen available. “And that’s just for nitrogen; other nutrients are also found at depth. We recommend farmers consider deep sampling, especially if they put out fertilizer last year and had no crop to utilize it.”\nFarmers will have to pull two samples, one from the usual zero to six-inch depth to determine nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium calcium, magnesium, sulfur, micronutrients, and pH. They’ll need to take a second sample from zero to 18 or 24 inches to determine residual nutrient levels with depth.\nHe also suggested farmers use N-rich strips in season to judge the proper amount of top-dress nitrogen. N-rich strips consist of narrow strips laid out in the wheat field with each strip receiving a different rate of pre-plant fertilizer. Strips are fertilized with increasing rates of nitrogen (for example zero, 40, 80, and 120 pounds per acre) up to the maximum rate for the expected yield.\nProducers evaluate each strip to determine between which increments there is no difference in plant growth. They use the last discernible improvement to establish top-dress rate. If the last strip to show a yield advantage is 80 pounds per acre, and the grower applied 40 pounds per acre at planting, he needs to top-dress his field with 40 pounds to bring the total to 80 pounds.']	['<urn:uuid:9f16ab7d-2b83-442f-a27e-d1cf1695a9cb>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	23	53	630

Particular therapy drugs are developed to minimize these symptoms, that makes it less complicated to quit the substance abuse.\nRemaining in Therapy in Togiak Alaska.\nSome therapy drugs are used to assist the mind adjust slowly to the lack of the over used medication. These medications act slowly to ward off medicine desires as well as have a relaxing result on body systems. They could aid clients focus on therapy and also other psychiatric therapies related to their drug treatment.\nScientific research has actually taught us that tension, hints linked to the medication experience (such as people, places, things, as well as state of minds), and exposure to medicines are the most common triggers for regression. Drugs are being established to hinder these triggers to assist people receive recuperation\nHow do behavioral therapies treat drug dependency?\nBehavioral treatments assist involve people in substance usage condition therapy, customizing their mindsets and actions connected to substance abuse and raising their life skills to deal with difficult conditions as well as environmental hints that might cause intense yearning for medicines and also punctual another cycle of uncontrollable usage. Behavior modifications could additionally boost the effectiveness of medicines as well as aid people remain in therapy longer.\nHow do the very best therapy programs assist patients recover from the prevalent impacts of dependency?\nWhen individuals enter treatment for a compound usage disorder, dependency has actually usually taken over their lives. The compulsion to get medications, take medicines, as well as experience the effects of medicines has actually dominated their every waking moment, and also abusing medications has actually replaced all things they utilized to enjoy doing. It has interrupted exactly how they function in their household lives, at the office, and in the area, and also has actually made them more probable to suffer from various other severe health problems. Because addiction could impact numerous aspects of a person’s life, treatment needs to attend to the needs of the whole individual to be successful. This is why the very best programs integrate a range of corrective solutions right into their extensive treatment regimens.\nAcquiring the ability to stop abusing drugs is just one component of a lengthy as well as complex healing process.\nTherapy counselors might select from a food selection of solutions for meeting the particular medical, emotional, social, trade, and also lawful requirements of their patients to promote their recuperation from dependency.|When individuals go into therapy for a material usage disorder, dependency has actually often taken over their lives.\nDue to the fact that addiction can impact so several facets of a person’s life, therapy should deal with the demands of the entire individual to be effective. Treatment counselors may select from a food selection of solutions for meeting the particular clinical, emotional, social, trade, as well as lawful needs of their people to promote their recovery from addiction.', 'One out of 12 Americans struggled with addiction in 2014, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), and one of the common side effects of drug addiction is drug dependence. When someone uses drugs regularly, some of the brain’s chemistry is altered. Chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, that send signals around the central nervous system to tell the body how to react to stress, when to feel pleasure, and work to control emotions are disrupted. This causes both physical and emotional fallout. The body can get used to the drugs being in its system with chronic and repeated use, and parts of the brain may even be rewired from regular drug abuse.\nPer the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), addiction is a brain disease wherein regions of the brain and its circuitry are impacted. When drugs are processed out of the body, levels of some of these neurotransmitters are impacted, and the brain may struggle to rebalance them, resulting in withdrawal symptoms and drug cravings.\nDrug withdrawal symptoms can vary depending on the type of drug abused. Some drugs, like stimulants (cocaine, methamphetamine, and prescription ADHD medications) for example, may have more intense emotional withdrawal symptoms. For others, such as with opioids (heroin and prescription painkillers), drug withdrawal can be extremely uncomfortable physically, mirroring a bad case of the flu. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines (prescription tranquilizers and sedatives) and alcohol can be so intense, it can include potentially life-threatening symptoms, Psychology Today warns, and detox should not be attempted without professional help. These drugs should not be stopped “cold turkey” after dependence has formed; they are usually tapered off slowly under the supervision of a trained professional. Drug withdrawal symptoms are optimally managed through a medical detox program as part of a comprehensive addiction treatment plan.\nCommon Physical and Psychological Symptoms of Drug Withdrawal\nDrug withdrawal symptoms can range from potentially fatal seizures to mild nausea and gastrointestinal upset. They often cause opposite reactions than those associated with the drug. For example, benzodiazepine drugs like Xanax and Valium are intended to reduce nerve firings and calm the body’s stress response by enhancing levels of the naturally occurring sedative gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA. Functions of the central nervous system, like body temperature, blood pressure, respiration, and heart rate, are depressed under the influence of these drugs. When benzos are then processed out of the body, a rebound effect can occur as levels of GABA dip and central nervous system functions speed up as a result. Grand mal seizures are potential side effects of benzodiazepine drug withdrawal, which The Journal of the Oklahoma State Medical Association warns can lead to coma or even death.\nIn general, common physical withdrawal symptoms include:\n- Abdominal cramps\n- Irregular heart rate\n- Problems with breathing\n- Nausea and stomach upset\n- Changes in body temperature\n- Heightened or lowered blood pressure\n- Changes in appetite and potential weight fluctuations\n- Chest pain\n- Alterations in pupil dilation\n- Back, joint, bone, and muscle pain\n- Muscle tension\n- Muscle weakness\n- Decreased sex drive\n- Decreased motor coordination\n- Runny nose and/or congestion\n- Muscle spasms\n- Sluggish movements\n- Teeth chattering or grinding\n- Involuntary eye movements\n- Increased sensitivity to pain\n- Rashes or skin irritations\n- Bloating and increased flatulence\n- Numbness or tingling in hands, feet, fingers, & toes\nDrug withdrawal encompasses both physical and emotional symptoms. Levels of serotonin and dopamine, some of the neurotransmitters that help to regulate moods and induce feelings of happiness, are impacted by drug abuse and dependence. During drug withdrawal, the body may be depleted of dopamine and/or serotonin, leaving individuals feeling irritable, moody, depressed, anxious, paranoid, disoriented, apathetic, tense and on edge, excitable, restless, and jumpy. People may have difficulties feeling pleasure from normal things. They may also feel detached from themselves or suffer from psychotic side effects like hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not actually there) or delirium. Nightmares, vivid dreams, and sleep disturbances are also common.\nAggression, hostility, and violent outbursts may also accompany drug withdrawal. During drug withdrawal, individuals often have trouble thinking straight and concentrating, and short-term memory functions may be impaired. Emotional lows, crying for no reason, drug cravings, and mood swings are common, as the brain struggles to restore healthy levels of its mood-regulating chemicals.\nIndividuals may be at a higher risk for suicidal thoughts, ideations, or actions during drug withdrawal, making medical detox and professional help all the more necessary.\nConcerned about treatment costs?

The longer a person has used the drug in question, the more severe the dependency. The method in which it was abused, the amount used at a time, and polydrug (using more than one drug at time) abuse can all influence drug dependency. Biological factors, such as metabolism, age, gender, and any medical or mental health conditions, also play a role in the intensity of drug withdrawal. Genetics and personal or family history of addiction also factors in. Environmental aspects, like home life and exposure to trauma and stress, can be involved in the level of drug dependence and therefore the significance and duration of the withdrawal side effects. The more dependent on a drug a person is, the more intense and longer withdrawal is likely to be.\nDrug withdrawal begins as soon as the drug stops being active in a person’s body. This can be different depending on the drug involved. Typically, opioid withdrawal begins about 12 hours after the last dose (closer to 30 hours for longer-acting opioids like methadone), the National Library of Medicine (NLM) reports. Stimulant drugs like cocaine are usually fast-acting and wear off quickly, so withdrawal symptoms may start sooner.\nFor most drugs, withdrawal symptoms typically peak within the first few days of stopping use and then start to gradually lessen over time. Acute withdrawal usually refers to the bulk of a person’s withdrawal symptoms and tends to follow this general timeline, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) publishes:\n- Marijuana: 5 days\n- Alcohol: 5-7 days\n- Opioids: 4-10 days\n- Stimulants: 1-2 weeks\n- Benzodiazepines: 1-4 weeks\nAfter acute withdrawal, symptoms usually start to taper off, although sometimes people may suffer from protracted withdrawal. Protracted withdrawal syndrome can include ongoing drug cravings, sleep and mood disturbances, irritability, physical pain, decreased energy levels, and difficulties with memory and the ability to think clearly. Protracted withdrawal may continue for several weeks or even months without professional help.\nThe presence of co-occurring mental health disorders simultaneously with drug dependence and addiction can complicate and exacerbate withdrawal symptoms. When co-occurring disorders are present, integrated and comprehensive care models work to manage the side effects of both disorders at the same time, as each disorder may contribute to the other. Drug withdrawal symptoms can be successfully managed with the help of medications and a high level of supportive care that is provided through a medical detox program.\nIt’s Never Too Late to Get Help']	['<urn:uuid:65e8bbb6-5cb9-48f1-ba6b-bb10a7fbd884>', '<urn:uuid:cd520888-a432-4e63-903b-e601cf80565a>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	16	69	2103

After performing bench press, follow with compound rowing to ensure balanced work of agonist and antagonist muscle groups. This is crucial because most rotator cuff injuries result from muscle imbalances, where anterior muscles (pecs, internal rotators, anterior deltoid) become tight and shortened while upper back muscles become weak and elongated. The training should follow specific protocols for different goals: muscular endurance for scapular muscles, and varying routines for other muscle groups based on specific needs.

The distance between the two acromioclavicular joints are considered 1x biacromial width.\nb) Having the trainer assist the athlete to lift the bar from bracket, is what is called a “Mandatory handoff”, and will prevent shoulder subluxion, and dislocation.\nc) Incline Bench pressing should be avoided\nd) Supine and decline bench press should be systematically alternated every other training session that involves chest work.\ne) Be certain of proper form. The barbell should be lowered slowly to sternum, 2-3 inches superior of xiphoid process. Press bar upwards, in line with shoulders, and maintain a “five point” contact throughout the entire lift.\nPosterior shoulder stability:\na) The athletes hand spacing should be increased to be 2x biacromial width. This angle will allow better structural approximation of the humeral head in the glenoid fossa, and decreases the strain on the posterior soft tissue.\nb) Perform a mandatory handoff.\nc) Perform this lying in the supine position only, no incline or decline pressing.\nSlap lesions (superior labrum antero-posterior lesions), glenoid labrum and bicep anchor damage:\na) Same guidelines as anterior stability.\nb) The athletes grip should be varied from underhand to an overhand grip on alternate days. This will decrease the micro-traumatic injuries and stress on the long head of the biceps tendon.\nc) The overhand grip removes the bicep tendon from beneath the acromion by internally rotating the humerus, but due to the full pronation of forearm, it stresses the attachment of the long head of the biceps.\nd) The underhand grip places the long head of the biceps tendon (supination) in a preferred position to decrease the stress on the tendon, but places the long head of biceps tendon beneath the acromion, allowing it to impinge.\ne) Overhand and underhand grip should not be used in same day and should follow a periodization protocol.\nThe barbell shoulder press starts with hand spacing slightly wider than shoulder width. Starting position is when bar is at the anterior portion of the deltoids, and sternoclavicular joints, and it is pressed overhead. Behind the neck shoulder press should be avoided all together due to the physiological effects of this movement, until full function is achieved. It should be replaced with posterior deltoid specific exercises, such as rows, rear deltoid raises, and dumbbell rows.\nThe barbell shoulder press starts with shoulder abduction, in the “high 5 position” and external rotation. This position places significant strain on anteroinferior glenohumeral ligaments. It also stresses the cervical region, by placing the head into excessive flexion, and stressing the rotator cuff through the impingement mechanism. The high 5 position is when the athlete has their palms pronated outward, facing away from them, at about chin level, with the arms in the saggital plane.\nModification of movement\na) A functional isometric program is implemented within the confines of a power rack, and performed by athletes that are required to perform overhead movements.\nb) Two sets of pins are set up in rack. One to support the weight, and one to limit range of motion starting at 60 degrees of shoulder flexion and one at 120 degrees. This provides minimal torque in external rotation and provides significant glonohumeral joint approximation.\nc) An isometric hold of 5-10 seconds is held per repetition at each angle, and 6-10 repetitions performed at each of the three 60, 90, 120 degrees.\nd) Be sure to watch for resistance training machines with excessive high five positions, and internal rotation. Machines that typically have safe positions are Nautilus, Hammer Strength, and Hoist Roc-it strength machines.\nLAT PULL DOWN:\nThis exercise involves a combination of movements in the saggital plane (flexion/extension), and the coronal plane (adduction/abduction). The bar is pulled from overhead to the base of the neck to the first thoracic vertebrae or just inferior of the clavicle .The behind the neck pulldown should be avoided for similar reasons as the behind the neck shoulder press. Pulling the bar behind your head and forward tilting chin to far anterior, can create excessive compression in the shoulder complex and cause transient brachial plexus nerve impingement (TBPNI). Transient upper extremity paralysis after completion of behind the neck pull downs is typically noticed in the hands first.\nModification of movement\na) Start with the upper body in a 30 degree reclined position, with bar inline with xiphoid process.\nb) Handgrip should be 1.25-1.5 biacromial width.\nc) This position prevents athlete from being in high five position, and increases the activation of the shoulder adductor and scapular retractor muscles which assist in stabilizing the humeral head throughout the movement.\nd) Raise bar slowly upward, and increase elbow flexion as much as possible, just before scapular elevation occurs. Otherwise this can cause instability in the glenohumeral joint.\ne) For the reverse grip pulldown, the hands are placed at 1x biacromial width, and the start and end positions are performed in the same manner.\nRemember these are modifications for competitive athletes for these three particular movements, and after the completion of physical therapy. They must also be done under the supervision of a sports medicine professional. If the athlete experiences acute pain while performing these exercises, then they should stop, and consult their physical therapist, due to the fact that they may not yet, be ready to perform these particular motions.\nJon Torerk, CSCS', 'Proper muscle balance is essential in order to prevent injuries and to enhance athletic performance. Common sport-related injuries such as rotator cuff tendonitis or bicepital tendonitis are due to overuse/improper muscular balance. These injuries are common in certain sports, but are also common to the everyday wheelchair user.\nA high percentage of athletes in throwing sports (baseball, shot put, discus, etc.) and other sports such as wheelchair track, swimming, and paddling report shoulder pain and/or injury and some studies estimate that up to 75% of manual wheelchair users will develop shoulder pain during their lifetime. The impact of a shoulder injury can be devastating for both the athlete and the wheelchair user impacting performance, functional mobility, and independence.\nRotator cuff tears, degenerative changes, and other pathologies about the coracroacromial arch are commonly found in wheelchair users with symptomatic shoulder pain. These degenerative changes occur from repeated microtraumas when the joint space between the humeral head (upper arm) and the acromioclavicular (A/C) shelf decreases to the point where repeated contact occurs on the same area on the supraspinatus tendon. The position and the repetitive loading of the shoulder joint with use in sports and for propulsion most likely contribute to these changes.\nMuscle Imbalances: Most rotator cuff injuries are due to muscle imbalances of the shoulder. Shoulder strength and muscular length/ROM imbalance can cause impingement of the soft tissue structures of the acromiohumeral space. Wheelchair users are even more susceptible to muscle imbalances. Nearly every motion and all repetitive motions are anterior working the pecs, shoulder internal rotators, anterior deltoid, etc. These anterior muscles become tight and shortened while the upper back muscles become weak and elongated. You can see these imbalances in the postures of chronic wheelchair users. A typical posture is rounded shoulders with mild thoracic kyphosis and forward head. This posture is even more accentuated by non-supportive wheelchair back that is stretched out accommodating this poor posture.\nPreventative Strategies through Strength Training\nIt is important that athletes and wheelchair users perform stretches to the anterior musculature while strengthening the upper back, posterior shoulder, and scapular muscles.It is not uncommon for athletes to skip these muscle groups in favor of spending more time on strengthening the prime-movers specific to one’s sport or general fitness exercise. These include bench press and bicep curls.Performing exercises on the stomach or by being flexed forward in a wheelchair so that one can work the upper/lower trapezius, posterior deltoid, and rhomboids. A focus should also be on the external rotators of the shoulder. By restoring muscle balance, the acromiohumeral space can be preserved minimizing the pressure on the rotator cuff.\nThe upper trunk and shoulder girdle are the foundation of the upper extremities. With a solid foundation from which to move off of, the upper extremity (shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand) will show greater power, endurance, and efficiency as well as having a reduced chance of injury.\nOrder of Exercises\nOne strategy to promote muscular balance is the push-pull routine. After performing the bench press, follow up with compound rowing. By working the agonist and then by turning around and working the antagonist (the opposite muscle group(s)), you are assured not to overwork one muscle group and will increase strength in all of the movements possible at a joint.\nExercise Program Design\nWith use of the appropriate training load, the number of sets and repetitions govern the goal and outcome of the exercise program. Sets and repetitions can be set up for muscular endurance, muscular strength, and muscular power routines. Core muscles such as the scapular and pelvic girdle musculature are best trained via a muscular endurance routine. Other muscle groups can follow any of the above mentioned routines based on specific goals and activities required for sport or activities of daily living. Below is a table with general recommendations for the three routines.\nThe consequences of shoulder injury to the athlete and the wheelchair user can be devastating. Preventative measures can greatly assist in minimizing overuse injuries to the shoulder maintaining independence and enhancing performance.']	['<urn:uuid:e1284b42-75d0-44e2-8a2e-cc517b3f480b>', '<urn:uuid:36c820de-237f-455c-8ddd-9f9a7705a4f3>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	6	102	1782
42	How do strategic planning and competency development compare in value creation?	Both strategic planning and competency development are crucial for value creation, but they operate differently. Strategic planning involves developing 3-5 year plans with clear goals like product development, international expansion, or cost rationalization, which helps companies execute better. On the competency side, businesses need to develop specific expertise in their niche rather than trying to excel in all areas, and must continuously assess whether they need to develop new competencies or acquire them through mergers to maintain competitiveness in the global marketplace.	['By Tyler Newton, contributor\nMany institutional investors are convinced that the days of easy money are over in private equity. Managers need to distinguish themselves through their ability to add actual operating value to the underlying portfolio companies.\nPrivate equity firms are generally active board members of their portfolio companies. Nearly every investment firm spends a great deal of time monitoring the tactical performance of their portfolio companies: Performance vs. budget, sales pipeline analysis, cash flow monitoring, margin assessment, capital structure optimization, valuation, etc. The tactical performance of a company is important, of course. Ultimately, however, as an investor and board member, a private equity investor’s role should be more strategic than tactical. It is easy for investors to get lost in the tactical minutia and forget to ask themselves the big strategic questions.\nThe following are five key strategic questions private equity investors should ask themselves about each of their portfolio companies — or prospective portfolio companies — at least every 3 to 6 months.\n1. What is the company’s core strategic plan? Investors need to evaluate tactical performance within the context of strategic goals. The lifecycle of a company or operating division is basically a series of 3- to 5-year strategic plans. The plan may be to develop a prototype product and win some key first customers. It could be to expand internationally, scale revenues and cash flow or expand the product set into adjacent markets. It could be to manage the transition from a growth to a value orientation by rationalizing the cost structure, or to successfully transition a company from a corporate spinoff to a standalone entity. It could be to narrow the company’s focus to a core set of products in a declining market. There are numerous core strategies that are potentially appropriate 3- to 5-year plans for a private equity or venture-backed company. Investors must also consistently evaluate whether the strategic plan remains appropriate if there have been changes in the portfolio company’s operating and competitive environment. Companies that clearly identify their core strategic plan almost always execute better than those that do not.\n2. Are we the right owners to execute on the strategic plan? This is perhaps the hardest question for investors to ask themselves, but it is fundamental. Private equity firms are generally pretty good at screening deals that don’t fit their strategies at the time of acquisition but they don’t always recognize when the strategic environment has shifted post-investment. A growth equity firm with a company that has shifted into slow-growth maturity; a company in a consolidating industry that would better off as a product or division of a larger company; a company embarking on a new 5-year product strategy with an investor near the end of their fund life…\nThese are all situations in which the right decision may be to seek a new owner. Sometimes answering this question requires admitting relative defeat on a certain investment but that is preferable to spending years working on a portfolio company that is outside a firm’s investment strategy.\n3. Does the company have the right CEO to execute on the strategic plan? Most private equity investors are good at figuring out when a CEO is underperforming. It’s more difficult to determine whether a good CEO is in the wrong role, particularly if the core strategy has changed. Sometimes a company needs an entrepreneurial visionary, other times it might need an operational “Mr. Fix-It.” Sometimes a company may need a turnaround specialist, other times it may need a sales and marketing expert. A visionary’s talents are not appropriate for a turnaround strategy, nor should a sales and marketing guy be focused primarily on operational efficiencies.\n4. Is the company earning an appropriate return on invested capital? The key unit economics of the company’s products must be earning more than a sufficient return on invested capital. The ROIC methodology varies by industry (a mature product manufacturer needs to monitor different metrics than a growth-stage online software company, for example), as does the cost of capital. No matter what the stage of business, however, at some point the core business must be able to profitably generate revenue. There is no point investing in revenue growth if the unit economics won’t work.\n5. Is the company gaining market share? If the unit economics are working, a company must assess its total addressable market and its share within that market. If the competition is growing more quickly (while also earning sufficient returns on invested capital), then the investor must figure out why and help look for solutions. It could be a sales and marketing execution problem, or a product problem. It may be a market power problem that can only be fixed by pivoting to a different or more specialized niche. If a company is having difficulty gaining market share in a certain market, then it has to question how long it should remain in that market.\nInvestors with the discipline to consistently ask these five strategic questions will have a framework to evaluate a company’s tactical performance, which in turn will enable the investors to create more portfolio company value. After all, creating portfolio company value is what private equity investors are paid to do.\nTyler Newton is a partner and research director at Catalyst Investors, a growth private equity firm focused on tech-enabled services. He is based in New York City and blogs at www.tylernewton.com.', 'One of the great challenges of investing in the resources industry is that assets can take a long time to produce payoffs. This task is only compounded by the reality that there are many uncertainties in the market.\nFor example, computing the needed expenditures to achieve desired cash flows can be complex. Then there is the certainty that most value is produced by Brownfield expansions, which can be terribly difficult to estimate. One final complication is that the commodity market is cyclical, and people aren’t the best at estimating value within the period.\nStanway, Hart, and Taylor of Virtual Consulting recommend that investors apply a set of principals to their decision making. The economists John Galbraith, Robert Hagstrom, and Howard Marks have derived the following rules for successful investments:\n- Mining is a cyclical business. Minerals are limitless, but supply will inevitably lag behind demand. This triggers periodic asset price spikes. Investors need to ignore psychological biases and buy when the market is down.\n- Value is much more than operating costs. It is instead the sum of a business’s capital, operating costs, and revenue. Value and risk must also be considered when computing capital.\n- In order to prosper, investors need to be patiently opportunistic. Leadership needs to be agile and open to new opportunities as they emerge.\n- Both successful and threatened businesses are generally inward looking. This can be counter productive, because external methods that challenge the status quo can be profitable. Leadership needs to be willing to experiment.\n- Leadership needs to be aware of shifting business models. Existing models become obsolete over time and leadership should investigate new models. For instance, Xerox invented the GUI but stayed with copiers.\n- Management cannot be a slave to the expectations of institutional investors. The bottom line can be a myopic lens for business, and cause leadership to miss cyclical downturns. Successful business strategies will stagnate over time.\n- Executive focus on cost reduction and productivity will ultimately be self-defeating. Management needs to continuously explore new value adding and growth opportunities.\n- Strategy is as much about competency as choosing direction. High-risk Greenfield operations are not risky with the right expertise.\n- Commercial excellence will only take industries so far. Significant business valuations can be accomplished by merging with companies with a sharper focus.\n- Too many companies fall into the trap of practicing expertise in all areas. With all the competition in a global marketplace, this is a losing strategy. Successful corporations specialize in a specific niche to stay competitive.\nCorporate leaders should be prepared to ask themselves three questions about their enterprise:\n- Where does the business have a competitive advantage or how can an advantage be achieved?\n- What competencies need to be developed within the existing business strategy?\n- Is the enterprise prepared to develop new competencies to stay competitive or can it be acquired in merger?\nCritically thinking through these 3 questions will enable you to develop the right strategy to lead to long term outcomes that weather market fluctuations.']	['<urn:uuid:d2a0c506-6cf5-4bff-a4d5-7baa674cd8a3>', '<urn:uuid:1283f512-103d-4aa5-9d54-5cec9cad2f64>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	11	82	1408
43	As someone studying TV series endings, I'd like to know how True Detective and Eastenders differ in their narrative closure approaches?	True Detective follows an anthology format where each season tells a complete new crime story with different characters, while Eastenders uses an open narrative structure with no definitive ending, continually running with multiple ongoing storylines and cliffhangers to keep viewers engaged.	['The trick to appreciating True Detective is understanding that it’s being sold as something quite different from what it actually is. The show promoted in HBO’s splashy ads and trailers is a dark, pulpy thriller—one that will presumably have twists and turns aplenty as lead actors Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey face off with bad guys. But True Detective turns out to be an unwieldy contraption built out of spare parts from Justified, Hannibal, and Michael Mann’s complete filmography. There are occasional thrills, but they’re subordinate to the philosophical musing.\nThis can prove enervating in the series’ early going. True Detective is taking the American Horror Story series-of-miniseries model and applying it to the crime genre, meaning that each season will follow one new crime story with a brand new cast of characters. But as has been the case with other “one case per season” shows—like The Killing and The Bridge—the storytelling simply turns into a very drawn-out version of something one might see on a CBS procedural. Methodical to a fault, True Detective spends a lot of time following Harrelson and McConaughey’s characters as they go from one lead to another, slowly tracking down a killer who has killed at least one young woman in a brutally ritualistic fashion. At times, particularly in the first couple of episodes, this can seem incredibly ponderous, straining for meaning it can’t achieve.\nAfter a while, one thing becomes clear: The case, such as it is, isn’t the point. Creator Nic Pizzolatto, a novelist who’s written all eight episodes of the first season, is using a dark mystery to tell a story about masculinity—its meaning, its rituals, and its place in a world that has less and less time for its hypocrisies and bullshit. The story could have sold copies of the pulp magazine that bore the same name as the show. But at the same time, Pizzolatto is crafting a story about the weight of this sort of investigation; the way that staring at the evils human beings are capable of for too long can leave scars deep down in the psyche. Often, the big, thrilling events that might be the centerpiece of another cop show—a shootout, say—are shunted off to the side of a story or elided entirely in favor of more prosaic pursuits, like narrowing down a lead, or driving around in a police cruiser and talking about the meaning of life.\nPizzolatto’s smartest choice is to filter the story through several layers. The framing device for the story is that the characters are called in to discuss this particular case—the files were destroyed in a hurricane—in 2012, meaning they have to rely on shaky memories of the ’90s. Once he’s fully established this device, Pizzolatto has fun with the notion of the future interrogating the past, drawing out questions of how the characters got from point A to what appears to be point Z, given how hollowed-out they are. There are moments when the narration in the future works at deliberate cross-purposes to the story in the past, creating narrative tension that ebbs but never entirely disappears.\nNot everything Pizzolatto tries works. There’s a definite sense in some episodes that the writer is simply throwing everything he has at the wall and seeing what sticks; and the questions raised about the nature of masculinity are the sort that TV has been interrogating endlessly since the days of Andy Sipowicz, thank you very much. Particularly in early episodes, there’s a sense that this is something like Homicide: Life On The Street’s pulpier cousin, yet it refuses to go full-pulp and simply give in to thrill-a-minute storytelling, which leaves both halves of the series’ conception feeling threadbare. It’s fine to do a story like this and focus on the philosophical, rather than the physical, but the philosophical concerns need be more original and pressing than they are here. At times, there’s a sense of the late-night, dorm-room rap session to the show—the characters talk about the existence of God or the role of a man while their cars glide through the night and foreboding music handpicked by T. Bone Burnett burbles on the soundtrack.\nYet True Detective has so many aces in the hole that even when it tests the viewer, it comes out on the winning side. Chief among those aces are Harrelson and McConaughey, who are proof positive that 90 percent of a good TV show is casting. McConaughey, in particular, is riveting as raw nerve Rust Cohle, a guy whose unorthodox thoughts and troubled history make him an uneasy fit in the show’s Louisiana setting. Harrelson’s Martin Hart is a character who stays very much inside the box, but both the show and Harrelson make that into a strength as it picks at his frayed edges. Both McConaughey and Harrelson are playing slightly against type, and it’s clear how much both actors enjoy getting to do something different. The scenes where the two of them simply sit and talk are consistently involving. The cast also boasts Michelle Monaghan as Martin’s wife, and while her role is more thankless, she invests it with spirit.\nFinally, the series features the direction of Cary Joji Fukunaga, who most recently directed a thrilling feature adaptation of Jane Eyre. Fukunaga’s work matches the actors’ performances beat for beat, creating a degraded, terrifying environment for them to unravel in, while also boosting the weaker portions of Pizzolatto’s scripts by layering in the swampy mood. In the series’ fourth episode—the best HBO sent out to critics—there’s a long tracking shot that’s one of the most impressive technical achievements in TV direction history, yet it calls so little attention to itself that it’s easy to miss it happening, even as it unfolds around the viewer. Fukunaga proves to be the flavor that ties this stew together, and his work makes True Detective sing, instead of collapsing into a pile of dark drama clichés.\nThe world didn’t really need another series about desperate men in desperate times turning to desperate measures, but the format of True Detective creates anticipation for everything to come. The series can be ponderous and ever so slightly banal, but it’s also sure-footed and thoughtful when it counts. And in its top-notch talent, it creates a great template HBO and Pizzolatto can build on, not only in the back half of this season but also in the years to come. True Detective might be finding itself in the first half of its first season, but few processes of discovery are so enthralling to watch.\nCreated by: Nic Pizzolatto\nStarring: Woody Harrelson, Matthew McConaughey, Michelle Monaghan, Michael Potts, Tory Kittles\nDebuts: Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern on HBO.\nFormat: Hour-long crime drama\nFour episodes watched for review', 'Linear Narrative: A story that is told from the start to the end in chronological order. There are no side stories or diversions that break up the main timeline. An example is the movie “The Blues Brothers”\nNon-Linear Narrative: Where the story can have any order it wants. This can include things such as spin offs, side stories, flashbacks and special episodes for a specific character. A good example of this are the “Star Wars” movies.\nFlashbacks: Flashbacks are used within a story to show a characters back story or to remind the watcher of something that happened long ago within the series that is relevant to the current plot. The transitions into these flashbacks can be anything from a bright light to a dream sequence. Another common transition is when the camera zooms into the characters face and/or eyes. An example of this would be the television series “My Name is Earl” where the whole plot is followed by past events.\nSingle Strand Narrative Structure: This narrative is when the movie and/or television series is based on one story line. This can however be based on one or more main characters as long as it focuses on the same story line. This is the most common structure of filming. An example of a movie that does this is Harry Potter where the story follows him and his friends.\nMulti Strand Narrative Structure: This is the narrative that has several story lines going on at the same time with several different characters. This is more commonly seen in soap operas such as Eastenders or television series that have a lot of characters such as Game of Thrones.\nClose Endings: A closed narrative is when it reaches its conclusion with no possible sequel within that story line. Once the main story line is completed then that is the story over. The only way the story can continue is if it is a spin off with a different character that was introduced within the main story of the original series. A good example of this is “Breaking Bad” where the main character died closing the series, however had a spin off show called “Better Call Saul” that displayed events before the main story of Breaking Bad.\nOpen Narrative Structure: This is where a show has no start, middle or end; it is just a continuous story that often ends an episode with a cliffhanger to keep the watcher interested and curious. This is commonly found in soap operas such as HollyOaks.\nBreaking Bad is a television series that run from 2008 – 2013 lasting 5 seasons. The story follows Walter White, a chemistry teacher, who is working two jobs to maintain for his wife and disabled son. It is soon discovered that Walter has lung cancer and his medical treatment will put his family in serious debt when he inevitably dies. As Walter doesn’t want that, he bumps into his former student Jesse Pinkman who is a drug dealer. He decides to team up with Jesse and secretly cook meth to pay for his medical bills. However the road isn’t so easy as his brother in law works for the police force which cracks down on drug crime, plus all the power hungry drug dealers that conflict with Walters business.\nBreaking Bad uses the linear narrative structure telling the story from start to finish. However there are a few cases of flashbacks within some episodes to get some detail and back story behind some characters and some scenes that start with the ending first, then goes back in time leading to the events of the ending. It finishes with main character dying with many others leaving the story by the end, causing it to have a closed ending.\nBreaking Bad has the genres of crime, drama and thriller according to IMDb’s profile. This television series is rated 18+ meaning it is meant for a more mature adult audience as it had many scenes with drugs, violence, death, sex and a more mature language. According to YouGov, the most common audience within the UK that watches Breaking Bad are males aged between 25-39 and based mostly in central Scotland.\nBreaking Bad Image: Anon, (2017).

The show follows a small community of characters that live within the east end of London living their every day lives with added drama and conflicts between the characters with endless story lines, relationships and tales.\nEastenders uses the multi strand narrative structure, where there are several story lines happening at the same time within the show between several characters. Sometimes these stories can conflict with each other or blend into a bigger story line where they somehow link. Soaps don’t usually use flashbacks, however there are moments within these stories where a character can talk about something that happened within their past that was never shown on television. By doing this it can open up new stories, plot twists and even new characters that can get involved within the story line. The story is forever going as well as it is a serial, with no ending in sight. The way it keeps its viewers interested and keep coming back is by having most, if not all, episodes end on a cliff hanger with open stories where anything can happen.\nThe genre of Eastenders according to IMDb’s profile categorises it as a crime, drama and romance. It is for the audience of the ages 12 and up due to the adult styled stories and real life issues that get bought up within some of the stories. Eastenders shows violence, crime, passionate romance scenes as well as alcohol, drugs and smoking not making it ideal for a younger audience which could try and imitate characters they saw on television in real life. According to YouGov, the audience that watches Eastenders the most within the Uk are females aged between 25-39 mainly based within London.\nEastenders Cast 2016 Image: Anon, (2017).

This drama follows Casey, a teenage girl, who is living out any teenagers worst nightmare of having their privacy reviled to the world online. A hacker hacks her computer when she wants revenge on her ex-boyfriend for tweeting a personal mean tweet about her but then things start to get a bit strange when the hacker starts to threaten her. The hacker states that he hacks to help the victims of cyber-bullying. It is then shown that the hacker isn’t out to help Casey, but to show her that she is the bully. If Casey does not comply with the hacker, her personal photographs will be leaked and her life will be over.\nThe story is a single strand narrative structure as it has a beginning and an ending, in fact the whole drama is based in real time and is an hour long event making it a linear narrative as well. There are no flashbacks within the drama, however there are videos throughout the show that reflect on past events which are used against the main character as a blackmail. As this is one story, it does have an ending making it have the structure of a closed narrative, yet, the way it ended it could be continued from another persons perspective due to the openness of the topic.\nThe genre of this single drama according to IMDb’s profile, it is classified as a drama, mystery and thriller. The drama has the rating of 15+. Throughout the whole drama it uses mature language of cursing and teases provocative images of young adults but doesn’t show anything. There is also a showing of drugs being overdosed and an emotional suicide story that is emotionally damaging.

44	what is lagos state urban population growth rate and impact on housing infrastructure and living conditions	Lagos State has an urbanization rate of about 5.8% per annum and has grown to over 22 million residents today. This rapid growth has led to significant housing challenges, including a housing deficit of more than 17 million units. Most of the population consists of poor rural migrants living in informal and slum settlements, facing high infrastructure costs, habitat fragmentation, water and air pollution, and reduced quality of life. The urbanization has increased land values and rental costs, which many poor migrants cannot afford. These informal settlements are often demolished for urban development, usually without compensation or alternative living arrangements, leading to resident displacement.	['Urbanization has been a key force of economic development throughout Nigeria and the world. Rural-urban migration provides access to employment and business opportunities, good healthcare, education, communication, transportation, and security. Globally, 55.3% of the world’s 4.2 billion people lived in urban areas in 2018.\nBy 2050, that percentage is projected to reach 68% according to a United Nations report.1 Nigeria’s urban population already makes up over 50% of its +200 million population; it is expected to add 189 million urban dwellers by 2050.\nRural migrants are flocking to urban centres. This is particularly the case in Lagos State, Nigeria’s economic and industrial hub. Its urbanization rate is about 5.8% per annum; it was ranked the 18th largest city in the world in 2018.\nHowever, the urban planning and development policies driving Lagos’s megacity aspirations are disconnected from the livelihood realities of the majority in the state. It is important that Lagos places a higher priority on housing in its overall development plan, as most of its population are poor, rural migrants and slum dwellers.\nLagos State: Case Study\nLagos has grown from a tiny fishing village in the late 15th century to a state of more than 22 million residents today and is the most populous city in Nigeria. It occupies 3,577 km2 making it the smallest state in the country by landmass. 21% of Lagos is wetlands consisting of creeks, lagoons and rivers.\nIts concentration of industry, commerce and administration of capital, labour and technology accounts for over 60% of Nigeria’s activities. It has experienced a much faster growth rate than any other urban centre in the country.\nIn 1985, it was ranked the 31st largest city in the world, with a population of 5.8 million; in 1990, the population increased to 7.7 million, making it the 22nd largest city in the world. The metro area population of Lagos was roughly 13.5 million as of 2018, making it the 18th largest city in the world.\nLagos has been a powerful generator of national economic growth, contributing over 30% of Nigeria’s gross domestic product (GDP). The development goal of the state is to become ‘a model African megacity’ and a global economic and financial hub that is safe, secure, functional, and productive.\nHowever, the urban development policies and regulations driving this megacity aspiration are disconnected from the realities of the majority.\nFor the most part, people in Lagos are poor, rural migrants who live in informal and slum settlements with high infrastructure costs, habitat fragmentation, water and air pollution and reduction in overall quality of life.8 Urbanization tends to increase land values and subsequently rental costs which poor migrants, the majority of Lagos’s population, often cannot afford.\nThese settlements are often targeted for demolition under the cloak of urban development, which in most cases comes with no compensation or alternative living arrangements10, leading to the displacement of the dwellers.\nThere is already a housing deficit of more than 17 million units.11 Meanwhile, Lagos Affordable Public Housing (LAPH), an ongoing private-public partnership, intends to construct 20,000 affordable housing units within five years (2017-2022).\nHowever, the scope of delivery is either not known or masked in a muddle. Given that many of these sub-par residential settlements require significant renewal investment, the shortage of decent affordable housing presents a good opportunity for prospective private sector players to improve the capacity of the construction sector to address these needs.\nThe architectural design should drive affordable solutions and provide economies of scale through which large-scale production could be optimized. In addition, government intervention is needed in Lagos state to provide subsidized credit, cooperative housing and social support programs.\nLessons from Brazil and Egypt\nA close examination of Brazil and Egypt provides important insights about the urban development process and policy with greater emphasis on housing. Both countries have large populations (approximately 211 million in Brazil and 100 million in Egypt in 2019), and both were long classified as “over-urbanized” countries.\nBrazil and Egypt had similar challenges with predominantly informal and slum settlements in the urban cores several decades ago. Nevertheless, the two countries have had success in implementing appropriate urban development frameworks, such as community-based and city-wide upgrading programs, private-public partnerships and an elaborate national housing policy.\nBrazil, for instance, rebuilt its urban governance policy to accommodate the participation of all urban dwellers in decision-making processes, which played a decisive role in affirming the sociopolitical right to adequate housing.\nThe ‘City Statute’, a 2001 federal law that governs urban development, explicitly requires the participation of residents in the urban planning process.\nIn addition, Brazil’s social housing program, Minha Casa, Minha Vida (My House, My Life) launched in 2009, in combination with the Growth Acceleration Program for Slum Upgrading effective from 2007, is a notable example of housing development in the country.\nThese programs primarily target low-income groups and slum dwellers. At the same time, there are curative and preventive measures to develop the prevalent inadequate housing conditions in slums and minimize both the growth of existing ones and the emergence of new ones.\nA robust policy of initial subsidy grants and enhanced housing credits, benefiting from steady economic growth and a well-focused social agenda for Brazil, culminating in the success of these initiatives.\nThe low prevalence of slums in Egypt reflects its long-term political commitment to slum upgrading, slum prevention and housing alternatives for the urban poor.\nThe Egyptian government’s initiative of slum upgrading, which began in Hai El Salam, Ismailia in 1978, is a pioneer in international best practice. The strategy that was used in this context was to allow the slum dwellers to upgrade their houses incrementally.\nIn Lagos state, it is worth exploring this instance of self-redevelopment of a slum with minimal government interference, particularly in view of the limited resources available to the government.\nIn Egypt, non-governmental initiatives for slum upgrading were also implemented in the 2000s through influential non-governmental organizations. They introduced valuable pilots for the on-site redevelopment of homes for the slum dwellers as an alternative to the predominant approach of local governments resettling slum dwellers in new remote locations.\nAs the region became more developed, the initial poor-quality homes were completely replaced by high-quality, well-designed dwellings over time.\nHow Lagos can integrate the complex realities of the majority into its development goal\nInvestment in upgrading programs:\nImplementing citywide, slum-upgrading programs that can improve the housing conditions and the quality of life in existing slums in Lagos is a first and crucial step for the state government to achieve urban modernity.\nJust like Egypt, the Lagos state government should allow self-redevelopment of slums with financial support where needed and in so doing, offer the slum dwellers the prospect of contributing a significant share of domestic capital formation through self-built housing.\nComprehensive development plans:\nSecondly, urban development plans need to be modified around citizen participation, which could be adopted by the local government councils. The transparency in the planning process is central to promoting urban development in Lagos.\nFor instance, in approaching affordable housing delivery in a large city like Lagos, multiple housing delivery outlets are required. This will be difficult to implement without the participation of urban dwellers.\nEveryone in urban centres is affected by the problem of urban slum growth. It, therefore, should be the responsibility of both the public and private sectors to create innovative methods, like mixed-use and low-income housing, for decent affordable homes for the residents of the state, especially those within the low-income bracket.\nAlso, policies enabling investment in quality housing, such as a real estate finance support scheme, should be considered by the state government in order to prevent the rise in slums and informal settlements in the future.\nUrban areas are considered to have multifaceted roles in nations. They are at the centre of a nation’s technical advancement and economic growth as seen in Lagos state. That is why populations will continue to move to urban settings. Thus, the Lagos state government and development agencies should focus on adapting to the trend of urbanization.']	['<urn:uuid:fe96b1d2-8409-413d-b3d2-534ea323e4cd>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	16	104	1332
45	I'm interested in police careers - what's the salary and injury protection like for officers?	Police officers earn an average annual salary of $65,400 nationally. For workplace injuries, they receive enhanced workers compensation benefits including higher permanency payments (paid at 2/3 of weekly wage vs 1/3 for regular workers), presumptions for heart disease/hypertension, coverage while using patrol vehicles off-duty, and coverage during secondary employment. As public safety employees, they get second-tier payment rates even for awards under 75 weeks.	"['Maryland Police officers are provided additional benefits under Workers Compensation Statutes and case law\nMaryland police officers are provided numerous benefits in addition to those provided for the ordinary employee. Maryland workers compensation laws provide extended benefits, and rightfully so, under the public safety rules which include increased permanency payments, presumptions of law, coverage for secondary employment jobs, and coverage while using patrol vehicle while off duty.\nHigher Permanency rates and Settlement Value for Maryland Police Officers\n2nd Tier Permanency Rates\nPolice are provided 2nd tier permanency rates in cases that would ordinarily be paid out at first tier rates because they are defined as public safety employees under Md. Labor & Employment § 9-628. Second tier rates are ordinarily paid on awards by the Workers Compensation Commission of greater than or equal to 75 weeks. First tier awards are paid out for any award under 75 weeks. In the event a Maryland police officer receives an award by the Commission of less than 75 weeks the police officer will still be paid at the second tier rate. The tier rates vary depending on the year of the injury but are determined by the employees wages as well as the state average weekly wage.\nFirst tier payments are to be paid at 1/3 of the employees average weekly wage. The 1/3 must not exceed the rate set by statutory code. Some Examples:\nSecond tier payments are to be paid at 2/3 of the employees average weekly wage but must not exceed 1/3 of the state average weekly wage. Some Examples:\nPolice Officers, and all public safety employees, can usually look past the first tier rates as vary rarely will these amount apply to their workers compensation awards. The only instances in which public safety employees will receive first tier rates is if their average weekly wage was low enough to indicate first tier money.\nAn example comparing a public safety employee award to non public safety award can provide aid in understanding how the tier system would apply in a real life scenario.\nInjured worker A was hurt while working as a landscaper. He was earning $1,000 a week. In 2016 he twisted his knee in a hole and received 6 weeks of physical therapy. He seen by the insurance company doctor and provided a rating of 5% to his leg. He was seen by the Claimants doctor and received a 20% to the leg.\nInjured worker B was hurt while working as a patrol officer. He was earning $1,000 a week. In 2016 he twisted his knee chasing a suspect in the street. He also received 6 weeks of physical therapy, was rated and received a 5% by the insurance doctor and a 20% by the Claimants doctor.\nBoth A and B attended a workers compensation hearing and were both awarded a 15% which calculates to be 45 weeks of payment.\nA will be paid for 45 weeks at $172 equaling an award of $7,740\nB will also be paid for 45 weeks but at second tier rate for 2016 of $343. Equaling $15,435.\nSettlement Value in Police Officers Workers Compensation Cases\nIn some cases Police Officers may enjoy a higher settlement amount than the ordinary injured Maryland worker. This is directly related to the public safety tier payment system. If a police officer is expected to receive an award of less than 75 weeks then he will be able to use the public safety permanency rates to negotiate a higher settlement than a non public safety employee would receive.\nSettlement value of the Police Officers’ case may not be affected by the higher tier payments in the event that the expected award would be 75 weeks or more. At 75 weeks or more all injured employees receive second tier payment rates as long as their average weekly wage is high enough.\nPresumptions of law enjoyed by Police Officers\nIn addition to the increased permanency awards Police Officers, as public safety employees, are provided presumptions of law regarding certain occupational diseases namely heart disease and hypertension. The statutory language in §9-503 states police officers is “presumed to be suffering from an occupational disease that was suffered in the line of duty and is compensable under this title if: (i.) the police officer…is suffering from heart disease or hypertension AND (ii.) the heart disease or hypertension results in partial or total disability.\nWHAT THE PRESUMPTION MEANS: In the ordinary workers compensation case, or general civil lawsuit, the party seeking benefits has the burden of production and persuasion. Otherwise said, the party seeking something must prove their case with evidence and argument. When a legal presumption exists the burden on the person seeking benefits is almost completely removed. It is assumed that Police Officers who have developed heart disease or hypertension developed the disease because of their job. With the presumption at play the Officer would have to prove they have hypertension or heart disease, and they were a police officer.\nWHAT THE PRESUMPTION DOES NOT MEAN: Police Officers will not effortlessly be awarded workers compensation benefits if they develop hypertension or heart disease. Even though there is a presumption, the Employer or Insurer have the right to rebut the presumption. If a proper rebuttal is provided then the Officer should choose to put on further evidence of support of his case because at any given time the Commissioner (workers comp judge) may be persuaded to rule in favor of the insurance company.\nCOMMON REBUTTAL DEFENSES include the last injurious exposure, the statute of limitations, and causes unrelated to employment.\nLast Injurious Exposure is a defense raised by an employer in an attempt to shift the liability for an occupational disease away from the employer and to another employer or source. Under Maryland law benefits are to be paid by the employer for whom the injured worker was working at the time they were last exposed to the hazard. Stress has been determined the hazard causing heart disease in police officers. An example of last injurious exposure at play would be; a retired Police Officer could file a claim within one year from their retirement. If in that year they worked part time for another employer the liability of the heart disease may be shifted to the new employer. If successfully argued the Police department would be excused from liability and the claim against them lost. The officer would still have the option to file a claim against the post retirement employer but a presumption may not be involved.\nStatute Of Limitations is one of, if not the most difficult defense to overcome in workers compensation cases. If the claim form for heart disease, hypertension, or any other occupational disease is not filed within 2 years from the date the Officer was disabled, had knowledge he was disabled as a result of working as an Officer. While the Statute of Limiations is difficult to overcome, there are numerous exceptions and waivers that may apply in any particular case. As always it is best to consult an experienced Maryland workers compensation attorney.\nCauses Unrelated to Employment are brought up in almost every workers compensation case. Some examples include prior injuries, arthritis, obesity, and age. In heart disease and hypertension cases the unrelated causes may be brought up by the defense in an effort to blame the disease on a preexisting condition. The goal of the defense is to focus on other causes of heart disease and hypertension such as smoking habits, drinking habits, obesity, diet, lack of exercise, or prior medical finding s of high cholesterol and blood pressure.\nPolice Officers are likely covered under workers comp if off duty but driving their patrol vehicle\nIf an employer provides an automobile to an employee they are covered under Maryland workers comp laws if involved in an accident driving to work, coming home from work, or using the car for work purposes.\nPolice Officers enjoy this benefit but are also covered while driving their patrol car for what most would consider strictly personal use. In Montgomery County vs. Wade, 345 Md. 1 (1996) the Court of Appeals, which is Maryland’s highest court, ruled that a County officer was entitled to workers compensation benefits when she was injured in an automobile accident while driving her patrol car to her mothers house.\nPertinent factors in this case were:\n- Montgomery County policy is to allow Officers to use the Personal Patrol Vehicle (PPV) for personal gain.\n- County policy was that Off duty officers using a PPV must carry a handgun, handcuffs, and department credentials, monitor the radio, respond to calls if no response would reflect unfavorably on the department.\n- The County benefits from this program by at the very least providing a visual deterrent to criminal activity.\n- The use of the PPV was indeed incidental to her roll as a patrol officer.\n- At any given moment she may have had to act in her official capacity.\n- Dual purpose doctrine applies in this case because Officer Wade was furthering the departments business purpose while using the PPV on a personal errand.\nWhile each and every workers compensation case is subject to a different fact pattern and different arguments police officers who operate their patrol car for personal use should know they may very well be entitled to workers compensation benefits.\nMaryland Police Officers are likely covered by workers compensation when working secondary employment\nThe Court of Appeals ruling in the Montgomery County vs. Wade case provides solid support for the argument that when an officer works for a secondary employer, commonly referred to as moonlighting, the officer would be covered under the Departments workers compensation policy. Of course there is often room for argument based on the particular facts of any given case, however I am of the opinion that more often than not the police officer would be covered under the departments Workers Comp policy.\nFactual analysis in determining whether the departments comp policy would cover the Officer acting as a security guard should begin with whether or not the officer was in anyway furthering the departments purpose. Was there a police presence by the officer working in security- was he in uniform, using patrol car, carrying weapon, mace, monitoring radio or acting as he typically would act while on duty?\nAnalysis should also consider whether he was permitted by the department to moonlight. Did the Police Officer have to first obtain permission from the department, did he follow the proper protocols, and did he violate any rules? Also of substantial significance is whether or not the department encouraged police officers to work side jobs. If the department encourages their officers to moonlight than they likely are receiving some benefit.', ""State Trooper: Career Guide\nEach state has a force of state troopers dedicated to traffic safety and the enforcement of motor vehicle laws. State troopers have the authority to ticket, and even arrest, individuals who violate state and federal law. Their specific working title depends on the state in which they work and they may be referred to as state highway patrol, highway patrol, or state patrol.\nCareer Description, Duties, and Common Tasks\nState troopers enforce vehicle safety laws on the area's highways and interstates, respond to accident scenes, conduct accident investigations, prepare court reports, and testify in court. Other common tasks include public education, heavy motor vehicle law enforcement (such as semi-trucks and other shipping or large capacity vehicles on state highways and interstates), and public safety. In rural areas or areas with small police forces, state troopers are often the backup for local and county officers. Depending on performance in their positions, troopers may enjoy such advancement opportunities as senior trooper, captain, lieutenant, and sergeant. State police officers work for the state.\nSteps for Becoming a State Trooper\nState troopers are uniformed and sworn law enforcement officers. The minimum requirement for a position with the state police includes being at least 21 years of age and the possession of a high school diploma or GED, but many states recommend that candidates for trooper school have an associate's degree or higher. To become a state trooper, you can expect to undergo a process similar to the following:\n- Attend a degree program and/or gain experience in a related field.*\n- Apply for an open position with the state police.\n- Be interviewed for the position.\n- Complete a physical examination, drug test, polygraph exam, and background investigation.\n- Complete a state trooper training academy.\n- Be hired as a state trooper.\n- Continue on-the-job training once hired.\n*Check with the specific requirements of the state trooper job for which you are applying for educational requirements.\nState Trooper Job Training\nTraining depends on the state in which the newly hired state trooper works. Rhode Island, for example, requires that all newly hired state troopers successfully complete a 24-week training academy. Recruits in that state must live on the training academy's campus each week from Sunday evening to Friday evening. Each day runs from 6 AM to 10 PM and troopers can expect a rigorous schedule that includes physical fitness training, classes, demonstrations, and lectures. State police must generally pass the training academy to maintain employment.\nOther Helpful Skills and Experience\nProspective state troopers should have a strong grasp of basic math and should be able to communicate effectively both verbally and in written form. Sound judgment, the ability to perform in stressful situations, and self-control are all essential to the success of a state police officer. Previous law enforcement or military experience may be beneficial. State troopers must be self-motivated, have good communication skills, and have the ability to work in all weather conditions. They must also be in good physical condition and have the ability to work alone or with others.\nPossible Job Titles for This Career\n- Highway Patrol\n- State Highway Patrol\n- State Patrol\n- State Police\n- State Trooper\nState Trooper Salary and Job Outlook\nState trooper salaries vary depending on the state in which they work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the average annual salary nationally is $65,400 for police and sheriff's patrol officers.1 The BLS estimates 7% job growth for police and detectives from 2016 to 2026.2 Promotions through the ranks are possible for qualified officers. However, since state trooper agencies only tend to grow in tandem with state population growth, higher ranking positions usually do not open until senior officers retire.\nState Trooper Requirements by State\n- California Highway Patrol\n- Florida Highway Patrol\n- Georgia State Patrol\n- Illinois State Police\n- Michigan State Police\n- Missouri State Highway Patrol\n- New York State Police\n- North Carolina Highway Patrol\n- Ohio State Highway Patrol\n- Texas Highway Patrol\nInterested in a career similar to a state trooper? Check out these related careers:\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQuestion: How important is education when seeking a position as a state patrol officer?\nAnswer: While most states only require a high school diploma or GED, an associate's degree or a bachelor's degree in criminal justice or a similar field may give candidates an edge during the hiring process.\nQuestion: What kind of hours do state troopers generally work?\nAnswer: State troopers typically work a 40 hour week, although overtime may be required. Schedules depend on the state for which the patrol officer works. State police in New York state, for example, work 12-hour shifts for 14 days each month. Night and weekend shifts are common, especially for junior officers.\nQuestion: What benefits do state police generally receive?\nAnswer: Again, benefits may vary on a state-by-state basis. However, benefits may include health insurance, life insurance, retirement, and paid time off.\n- National Association of Police Organizations: A national coalition of police associations and police units, dedicated to education, advocacy, and political action.\n- International Union of Police Associations: A professional organization dedicated to assisting police officers and state troopers with education, communication, and earning better pay.\n- National Troopers Coalition: A nonprofit organization for state troopers across the United States, assists state trooper associations with helping their members get the best salaries, benefits, and working conditions.\n- The American Association of State Troopers: A national fraternal organization for state troopers.\n1.

46	red planets temperature near hr 8799	The four red planets orbiting HR 8799 have 'lukewarm' temperatures of about 1000 Kelvin (1340 degrees Fahrenheit). These planets are unusually red, meaning they emit longer wavelengths of light than other celestial objects with similar temperatures. Scientists suggest this could be due to significant but patchy cloud cover on the planets. Additionally, these warm, red planets are described as unlike any other known object in our universe.	"['Researchers have conducted a remote reconnaissance of a distant planetary system with a new telescope imaging system that sifts through the blinding light of stars. Using a suite of high-tech instrumentation and software called Project 1640, the scientists collected the first chemical fingerprints, or spectra, of this system\'s four red exoplanets, which orbit a star 128 light years away from Earth.\nA detailed description of the planets -- showing how drastically different they are from the known worlds in the universe -- was accepted Friday for publication in The Astrophysical Journal.\n""An image is worth a thousand words, but a spectrum is worth a million,"" said lead author Ben R. Oppenheimer, associate curator and chair of the Astrophysics Department at the American Museum of Natural History.\nOppenheimer is the principal investigator for Project 1640, which uses the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory in California. The project involves researchers from the California Institute of Technology, NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Cambridge University, New York University, and the Space Telescope Science Institute, in addition to Oppenheimer\'s team at the Museum.\nThe planets surrounding the star of this study, HR 8799, have been imaged in the past. But except for a partial measurement of the outermost planet in the system, the star\'s bright light overwhelmed previous attempts to study the planets with spectroscopy, a technique that splits the light from an object into its component colors -- as a prism spreads sunlight into a rainbow. Because every chemical, such as carbon dioxide, methane, or water, has a unique light signature in the spectrum, this technique is able to reveal the chemical composition of a planet\'s atmosphere.\n""In the 19th century it was thought impossible to know the composition of stars, but the invention of astronomical spectroscopy has revealed detailed information about nearby stars and distant galaxies,"" said Charles Beichman, executive director of the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology. ""Now, with Project 1640, we are beginning to turn this tool to the investigation of neighboring exoplanets to learn about the composition, temperature, and other characteristics of their atmospheres.""\nWith this system, the researchers are the first to determine the spectra of all four planets surrounding HR 8799. ""It\'s fantastic to nab the spectra of four planets in a single observation,"" said co-author Gautam Vasisht, an astronomer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nThe results are ""quite strange,"" Oppenheimer said. ""These warm, red planets are unlike any other known object in our universe. All four planets have different spectra, and all four are peculiar. The theorists have a lot of work to do now.""\nOne of the most striking abnormalities is an apparent chemical imbalance. Basic chemistry predicts that ammonia and methane should naturally coexist in varying quantities unless they are in extremely cold or hot environments. Yet the spectra of the HR 8799 planets, all of which have ""lukewarm"" temperatures of about 1000 Kelvin (1340 degrees Fahrenheit), either have methane or ammonia, with little or no signs of their chemical partners. Other chemicals such as acetylene, previously undiscovered on any exoplanet, and carbon dioxide may be present as well.\nThe planets also are ""redder,"" meaning that they emit longer wavelengths of light, than celestial objects with similar temperatures. This could be explained by significant but patchy cloud cover on the planets, the authors say.\nWith 1.6 times the mass and five times the brightness, HR 8799 itself is very different from our Sun. The brightness of the star can vary by as much as 8 percent over a period of two days and produces about 1,000 times more ultraviolet light than the Sun. All of these factors could impact the spectral fingerprints of the planets, possibly inducing complex weather and sooty hazes that could be revealed by periodic changes in the spectra. More data is needed to further explore this planetary system\'s unusual characteristics.\n""The spectra of these four worlds clearly show that they are far too toxic and hot to sustain life as we know it,"" said co-author Ian Parry, a senior lecturer at the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge University. ""But the really exciting thing is that one day, the techniques we\'ve developed will give us our first secure evidence of the existence of life on a planet outside our solar system.""\nIn addition to revealing unique planets, the research debuts a new capability to observe and rapidly characterize exosolar systems in a routine manner, something that has eluded astronomers until now because the light that stars emit is tens of millions to billions of times brighter than the light given off by planets. This makes directly imaging and analyzing exoplanets extremely difficult: as Oppenheimer says, ""It\'s like taking a single picture of the Empire State Building from an airplane that reveals the height of the building as well as taking a picture of a bump on the sidewalk next to it that is as high as a couple of bacteria.""\nProject 1640 helps scientists clear this hurdle by sharpening and darkening a star\'s light. This technical advance involves the coordinated operation of four major instruments: the world\'s most advanced adaptive optics system, which can make millions of tiny adjustments to the device\'s two 6-inch mirrors every second; a coronagraph that optically dims the star but not other celestial objects in the field of view; an imaging spectrograph that records 30 images in a rainbow of colors simultaneously; and a specialized wave front sensor that distinguishes between residual starlight that sneaks through the coronagraph and the light from planets, allowing scientists to filter out background starlight more effectively.\nAltogether, the project has produced images of celestial objects 1 million to 10 million times fainter than the star at the center of the image, with only an hour of observations. It is also capable of measuring orbital motion of objects.\n""Astronomers are now able to monitor cloudy skies on extrasolar planets, and for the first time, they have made such observations for four planets at once,"" said Maria Womack, program director for the Division of Astronomical Sciences at the National Science Foundation. ""This new ability enables astronomers to now make comparisons as they track the atmospheres, and maybe even weather patterns, on the planets.""\nResearchers are already collecting more data on this system to look for changes in the planets over time, as well as surveying other young stars. During its three-year survey at Palomar, which started in June 2012, Project 1640 aims to survey 200 stars within about 150 light years of our solar system.\n""The variation in the spectra of the four planets is really intriguing,"" said Didier Saumon, an astronomer at Los Alamos National Laboratory who was not involved in this study. ""Perhaps this shouldn\'t be too surprising, given that the four gaseous planets of the solar system are all different. The hundreds of known exoplanets have forced us to broaden our thinking, and this new data keeps pushing that envelope.""\nCite This Page:']"	['<urn:uuid:3fa47f21-605e-4276-a88a-8ec7f7e9f14f>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	6	67	1157
47	meditation space acoustic treatment requirements	Meditation spaces require precise acoustic engineering beyond standard soundproofing. At Inscape Meditation Center, they discovered that over-soundproofing actually caused discomfort, requiring an acoustics engineer to add white noise for more comfortable silence. For meditation spaces, uniform building code requirements may not be adequate - materials need high sound transmission class (STC) ratings. The space must manage both external noise sources and internal sounds while maintaining an environment where people can be aware of themselves in various meditation positions.	"['Posts tagged with ""Wellness"":\nFifty years ago, the term wellness—if it was used at all—essentially meant “not sick.” Then, throughout the ’80s and ’90s, the rise of gym culture and workplace wellness snowballed into an explosion of fitness boutiques in the early aughts. In city centers and upscale suburbs today, specialized fitness boutiques such as SoulCycle, PureBarre, Barry’s Bootcamp, and FlyWheel are nearly as ubiquitous as Starbucks. Combined with the rapid expansion of “health” branded grocery stores, an uptick in haute athletic wear, and a plethora of juice and smoothie companies, not to mention the surrounding media buzz, wellness has become not so much a trend as a booming industry.\nHotel conglomerates took note about a decade ago, assuming that the same kale-juice-chugging travelers frequenting SoulCycle and Whole Foods would want to stick to their wellness routines on the road. In 2010, Wyndham acquired TRYP, a subset of hotels that offers amenities like in-suite fitness equipment, healthy snacks, and an “energetic fitness center.” In 2012, Las Vegas’s MGM Grand introduced 41 “Stay Well” rooms featuring wellness amenities such as aromatherapy and air purification systems and access to Cleveland Clinic programs for “sleep, stress, and nutritional therapy.” In 2014, InterContinental Hotels Group launched EVEN Hotels with six locations in Norwalk, Connecticut; Rockville, Maryland; Times Square, Midtown East, and Brooklyn, New York; and Omaha, Nebraska. EVEN Hotels not only boast athletic studios, but also in-room personal training, group classes, and the Cork & Kale™ Market and Bar for healthy snacks. The branding, though aggressively green-washed, is apparently successful: Six more EVEN Hotel properties are slated to open in the next few years.\nIn 2017, fitness companies flipped the script. Luxury fitness brand Equinox recently announced it will open its first hotel in New York’s Hudson Yards development in 2019 with plans to open a second location in Los Angeles soon after. Equinox operates nearly 80 clubs in nine cities in the United States, with additional locations in Toronto and London, with approximately one million members overall. Although sources wouldn’t disclose which architects worked on initial designs, the revealed rendering shows a massive tower, expected to be home to a 60,000-square-foot “super gym” with indoor and outdoor pools in addition to the hotel.\nEquinox isn’t alone. Chicago’s Midtown Athletic Club, a tennis-and-fitness center established in 1970, is adding a 55-room boutique hotel on top of its facilities. Evanston, Chicago–based DMAC Architecture spearheaded the design of the addition and the redesign of the existing structure to create a 575,000-square-foot complex that will have 15 indoor tennis courts; four pools (including one that converts to an ice rink in winter); one full-size basketball court; several studio fitness spaces for yoga, Pilates, boxing, and spinning; locker rooms; retail and dining options; outdoor and lounge recreational spaces; as well as other hotel amenities such as meeting and banquet rooms, deluxe suites, and a penthouse presidential suite. “Rather than being 98 percent hotel with 2 percent amenity, [the Midtown Athletic Club] will be 96 percent amenity and 4 percent hotel,” said Dwayne MacEwen, founder and principal of DMAC architecture. “There are three floors of primary club space, with the third being an all-glass in-between space with the lobby, and the hotel component occupies floors four and five,” he explained. MacEwen emphasized that the prevailing design directive is to create something “intimate and choreographed,” eschewing a “big-box-gym atmosphere.”\nDesigning for wellness rather than merely fitness or hospitality involves a careful consideration of social and nonsocial areas. MacEwen and his team crafted specific spaces for conversation, like the monumental staircase on the second floor; spaces for solidarity, like the meditation room; and spaces for “being together, alone,” like the lounge. “We didn’t want to over program any one room—when you do that no one hangs out there—but we wanted to create an emotional impact through our use of materials, sense of compression, lighting, and wayfinding,” he said.\nThis strategy continues through the exterior of the landmarked building: The Midtown Athletic Club is located at a busy intersection in Bucktown, and MacEwen was cognizant of its impact on the neighborhood. “People choose to live in the city for a reason,” he said, “so we wanted to give something back to the urban street experience. It is more like an urban island oasis; you feel like you are a part of the city because you can see the traffic and feel the energy, but there is a solitude and quietness to it as well.” The Midtown Athletic Club hotel and renovation is set to be complete early this summer.\nAs hotels increase the amount of fitness and wellness offerings on deck, boutique fitness brands also feel obligated to provide key hospitality tenets—most importantly, forging a community with and among their members. Principal Chad Smith of Desbrisay & Smith Architects in New York has been working with boutique fitness brand Barry’s Bootcamp since 2012, both designing its studios and contributing to its branding. It is no coincidence that the tagline on the Desbrisay & Smith Architects website is “causing communities.” “We look at the organization of the space, as well as its touch and feel, and explore how the patrons come together and what happens before and after a workout,” Smith explained. This isn’t just “Kumbaya” feel-good vibes. “Boutique fitness companies want their communities to form a gang, not only because it has material impacts on their health and wellness, but [because] it increases retention so the businesses make more money.”\nThere is no singular approach when it comes to organizing spaces that make people feel as though their intraclub relationships are springing up organically. When Smith worked on CrossFit company I.C.E.’s New York location, he started by examining where and how clients interacted. “In CrossFit, people hang out and talk to each other in the workout space, so we wanted it to be chic and luxurious, very Manhattan,” he said. “Basically we thought, ‘If you had to pick a classic New York space to work out in, something that’s durable and glamorous, what would you choose?’ The obvious answer is Grand Central Station, so we picked up on its material cues, such as brass and dark blue paint.” But behind these sleek walls and floors, there is a lot going on: sound isolation, floating, spring reinforced acoustic floors, and superinsulated windows and walls.\nNot only are these technological elements crucial for spaces like Barry’s Bootcamp, where 25 people run on 25 treadmills simultaneously within a mixed-use building, but they are also needed for when people sit completely still.\nMeditation centers—that is, places where people go to sit and experience a guided meditation—are still new to the built wellness environment. When designing the Inscape Meditation Center in Manhattan, Archi-Tectonics founder Winka Dubbeldam spent months focusing on a seamless experience for clients. “It demands a different type of precision,” she explained. “If you meditate in all kinds of positions—walking, sitting, lying down—then you are very aware of yourself and the space around you. A few things became quite apparent. I wanted to create a continuum, an immersive environment: Walls and ceilings become one in the Dome; there is clean purified air; there is perfect sound and lighting. All the senses are soothed.”\nInscape has two meditation rooms: The Dome room is a large ellipse, while the Alcove room is smaller and wrapped in textural cloth. Both rooms feature color therapy lights, a smooth transition between the ceilings and walls, and carefully curated sound. “When we first soundproofed the space, we over-perfected it,” Dubbeldam said. “It was too soundproof! It actually hurt my ears. So we had an acoustics engineer come in and soften it and add a small amount of white noise to achieve a more comfortable silence.” The lighting was designed to avoid any pinpointed spots of light; rooms are equally lit, each with a soft horizon line around the Dome room where distracted meditators can focus their gazes and regain their senses of calm.\nTo achieve this level of design, Dubbeldam created a full-scale prototype in a warehouse in Brooklyn and meditated in it with Inscape founder Khajak Keledjian, who also founded the clothing boutique Intermix. “I see design as a process, a series of tests to achieve moments of precision,” Dubbeldam said. “It looks super simple, but it takes massive amounts of design and engineering. I really feel like that is where architecture should go, and, in our case, is going.”\nEvan Bennett of New York–based Vamos Architects concurs.“Environments are shifting dramatically as technology shifts,” he explained. Bennett recently completed Honeybrains, a concept cafe in New York’s NoHo district that serves up information on brain health alongside healthy food options and a honey-focused retail section. Owned by two siblings—one who worked in neurology—the cafe features circadian lighting by Ketra disguised in a clever ceiling-light baffle. “We were careful not to have direct lighting, but instead created a honeycomb pattern that could reflect light off of the interior paneling,” Bennett said. “It lets us hide the track lighting, the AV system, and a projector up there as well.” Bennett admits that spending 30 to 40 minutes in a circadian-light-controlled system might not have major effects on one’s health, but he believes in Honeybrain’s mission to become a platform for discussing brain health and the possibilities of design that straddles the intersection of health and technology.\nThough the wellness trend will play itself out and change over time, people-centric, health-focused design will endure in hospitality architecture. Combined with our current propensity toward mixed-use spaces and advanced technology, building boundaries will continue to blur—not only between hotel and gym, but across industries of all kinds.\nWant more on wellness? Read how it\'s influencing the workplace too.', ""Sound — it shapes how people perceive the world, and plays a vital role in communications and education. Schools depend on designers and architects to understand the science of sound — acoustics — and to do a good job of managing sound within a structure. But today's world and the structures being built can make this task challenging.\nBackground noise is one obstacle affecting acoustics. It can come from a variety of sources inside and outside a space. Even a vacant building is not silent. Computers, copiers, lights, vending machines and refrigerators contribute noise. The noisiest offender often is heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment.\nThe HVAC system's effect on a building's acoustics may be overlooked during design because the systems are already a significant building cost, and schools are reluctant to direct higher percentages of budgets away from areas that do not benefit student learning directly. A silent HVAC system can be designed, but it is an intentional design. Silencing the system involves specially insulated equipment, heavier units to deaden fan noise and larger ductwork to permit the easier flow of air.\nActivities in adjacent spaces also can contribute to background noise: exterior sources such as nearby roads, railroads or industries, and internal sources such as other classrooms, band rooms and offices.\nThe big space challenge\nIn addition to managing background noise, acoustic designers must consider another key contributor to the acoustics challenge: reverberation. Reverberation is the time it takes for sound to fade or decay in a space. Large rooms where people congregate present a considerable acoustic challenge.\nA typical college student center has dining and food-preparation areas, as well as general space where students congregate, so there's a lot of noise generated by both people and machinery. In a space like this, sound-absorbing material is important with consideration to maintaining the space's aesthetics and durability. Sound-absorbing materials often are part of the decor of the space, adding colors and textures to create inviting spaces.\nIt's also important to look at sound transmission with regard to adjacent spaces. For example, offices that are near large, open spaces not only have to be protected from unwanted sound entering, but also must keep sound — and private conversations — from escaping.\nSound transmission across these boundaries must be controlled through proper construction of the walls and openings. Walls should be extended to, and sealed to, the structural deck, and insulation placed in the ceilings. Staggering studs and the use of sound-attenuating insulation also will help block sound. When special attention is paid to walls and ceilings, then doors, windows and electrical outlets often become the weakest elements through which sound will still pass. The careful arrangement of these elements in a space plan, such as staggering door openings in a hallway, isolating noisy spaces such as gymnasiums, and ensuring that electrical outlets are not placed back-to-back, can help. Uniform building code (UBC) requirements may not be adequate to block sound — or optimize acoustics — in any space. If blocking sound is a key concern, consider the need for all materials in a space to carry a high sound transmission class (STC) rating, or insulation quality.\nOften, large spaces have conflicting acoustical needs. A chapel or performance hall, especially where there will be classical music, needs a “live” acoustical quality. That means the room must be designed so sound can reverberate. However, reverberation can interfere with speech intelligibility — long reverberation times can cause a speaker's words to be muffled, so that one word cannot be distinguished from another. An ideal space for speech has low reverberation, called “dead” or “dry.”\nReconciling these acoustical opposites often is done with sophisticated sound systems. A space designed as a live space can incorporate a well-designed sound system to create the sound clarity needed for quiet events or speeches. Because the number of attendees also can affect acoustics, consider using absorptive seating to maintain a consistent acoustical environment.\nSchool gymnasiums usually are large, rectangular boxes with hard-surface walls, floors and ceilings. The elements make a highly reverberant space where teachers can have a difficult time making themselves heard — even when students are paying attention.\nThe most common solution is to add sound-absorbing material to the space, like acoustical block for walls or a layer of sound-absorbing panels over hard walls. Sound-absorbing materials installed on non-parallel surfaces will lower reverberation and make a space quieter. For good speech intelligibility in these larger rooms, sound designers will recommend installing a wall absorber with high sound absorption on the rear wall. Also popular is acoustical decking, which is a type of under-ceiling with perforations and sound-absorbing material. Selecting durable acoustic materials that will withstand the impact of kicked and thrown balls is a key consideration for multipurpose rooms used for sports.\nFirst things first\nMistakes with a room's acoustics happen when a facility's design does not account properly for the acoustics. Sound-design experts start by thinking about the acoustics of a space before any lines are drawn on paper. They consider the intended use of each room or area, and determine an acceptable reverberation time and design. This information is shared with the building designers to create the design of individual rooms, as well as where each room should be situated within the facility.\nEven spaces with similar uses may need different reverberation times and different materials to handle the sound. For example, band rooms and choral rooms sometimes are given the same acoustical treatment, but this may lead to problems with volume and speech intelligibility.\nMultipurpose rooms are an economic reality in many schools. The best approach is to determine the most common use and to design the reverberation time for those needs. Most often, the need for quality, intelligible sound for instruction is paramount, so here the multipurpose spaces may be designed as “dead” spaces, and hard surfaces can be brought in when a higher reverberation is required.\nAlthough cost containment is a reality in building projects, skimping on acoustics almost always costs more in the long term. Spaces that are not designed properly for their uses may be retrofitted; however, the cost to do so often is higher, and the results rarely are what they could have been if accommodated for during design. An acoustic treatment may be suitable for the present application, but the constantly changing uses in a facility can quickly change the picture.\nSterner, PE, is president of High Construction Company, Lancaster, Pa.

48	What kills aardvarks and how do wealth differences affect survival?	Aardvarks die from the indirect effects of climate change - when heat and drought kill the termites and ants they depend on for food and water. Regarding wealth differences, poorer people are more vulnerable to climate change impacts, particularly in developing countries where 99% of climate change casualties occur, due to their limited resources and adaptive capacity.	['The aardvark, a highlight for anyone on a game-viewing African safari, will become increasingly rare as the world warms and dries, and the consequences go well beyond a decline in aardvark safari encounters.\nAccording to researchers studying this elusive mammal, sometimes classed as one of the “Shy 5”, in South Africa’s Kalahari Desert, aardvarks prove to be highly susceptible to the warmer and drier climates that are predicted for the western parts of southern Africa, in the future. During the study of a number of aardvarks by researchers of the Brain Function Research Group at the University of the Witwatersrand, all but one of the study animals – as well as other aardvarks in the area – died because of a severe drought, with air temperatures much higher than normal and very dry soil in the area.\n“While unusual now, those are the conditions that climate change is likely to bring as the new normal,” said Professor Andrea Fuller, the Research Group’s director.\nDr Benjamin Rey studied the aardvarks as part of his postdoctoral studies. Along with his colleagues, he used the new technology of “biologgers” (miniature sensors attached to computer chips and implanted into the aardvarks by wildlife veterinarians), to study the activity patterns and body temperatures of aardvarks living in the Kalahari. The researchers were not to know that during the year of their study there would be a severe drought, which led to the death of the study animals.\n“It is not because the aardvark’s body can’t take the heat, but that the termites and ants that they rely on – not just for food but also for water – can’t take the heat and aridity of changing climates,” said Rey.\nAardvarks usually sleep during the day in burrows that they have dug, and emerge at night, to feed on ant and termites, using their long, sticky tongues to sweep up thousands of insects. However, during the drought, the termites and ants, on which the aardvark depends for body energy, were not available.\n“As a result, the aardvarks’ body temperatures fell precipitously at night. The aardvarks tried to compensate by shifting their search for ants and termites from the colder night to the warmer day, so that they would not have to use energy to keep warm, but that was not enough to save their energy stores,” said Dr Robyn Hetem, a co-worker on the study. “We believe the aardvarks starved to death.”\nThe aardvark progressively became skinnier and bonier. They even tried sun-basking to save energy, but many ultimately died. Their body temperatures dropped to as low as 25°C just before they died.\nRey says that this curious-looking creature – described as having the snout of a pig, the ears of a rabbit and the tail of a kangaroo – is much more than just a curiosity to be checked off a bucket list.\n“Many species of African birds, mammals and reptiles use the burrows dug by aardvarks to escape cold and heat, to reproduce, and to avoid predators. They can’t dig these burrows themselves. Without aardvarks, they would have no refuge. Worryingly, they could face the same fate as the aardvark.”\nClimate change in southern Africa affects animals through the direct effects of increasing air temperatures and aridity. Wild dogs, for example, reduce hunting activity as temperature increases. But the indirect consequences of heat and aridity may be more pervasive. Disappearance of aardvarks, and with them the burrows that they dig, will have knock-on effects for many other animals.', 'Disparities in exposure to climate change risk and vulnerability\nDisparities in exposure to climate change risk and vulnerability, including variations in people’s location, wealth, social differences (age, gender, education), risk perception\nDetailed examples of two or more societies with contrasting vulnerability\nVulnerability refers to the degree to which people or the things they value are susceptible to, or are unable to cope with, the adverse impacts of climate change. Thus, vulnerability determines how severe the impacts of climate change might be. There are three dimensions of vulnerability to climate change: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.\nExposure is the degree to which people and the things they value could be exposed to climate variation or change;\nSensitivity is the degree to which they could be harmed by that exposure; and\nAdaptive capacity is the degree to which they could mitigate the potential for harm by taking action to reduce exposure or sensitivity.\nThe expression “things they value” not only refers to economic value and wealth, but also to places and to cultural, spiritual, and personal values. In addition, this expression refers to critical physical and social infrastructure, including such physical infrastructure as police, emergency, and health services buildings, communication and transportation networks, public utilities, and schools and daycare centers, and such social infrastructure as extended families, neighborhood watch groups, fraternal organizations, and more. The expression even refers to such factors as economic growth rates and economic vitality. People value some places and things for intrinsic reasons and some because they need them to function successfully in our society. Some groups of people are inherently more vulnerable to climate change than others. The very old or very young, the sick, and the physically or mentally challenged are vulnerable. Disadvantaged groups, such as minorities, those with few educational opportunities, or non-English speakers are more vulnerable than the majority, better-educated, English-speaking population. Women, who typically spend more time and effort on care-giving to parents, children, and the sick than men do, are more vulnerable because that care-giving exposes them more to the impacts of climate change. More vulnerable groups often combine these categories, such as the poor—who can be old, minority, non-English speaking, and female, for example. Another example of a particularly vulnerable group is the single-mother household, which can be headed by a poor woman of color who is responsible not only for caregiving, but also for providing the family income.\nThe concept of resilience is important to understanding adaptive capacity to climate change. Resilience refers to the ability of a human system to withstand contemporary shocks and to anticipate and plan for future shocks. Resilient systems have the ability to learn from past experiences and to use that knowledge when confronting problems. Systems with high adaptive capacity are therefore resilient and able to reconfigure themselves to deal with climate change. Systems with low adaptive capacity are much less resilient and much more vulnerable to climate change.

49	I've heard Keemun tea is quite special - what awards or recognition has Imperial Keemun tea received in international competitions?	Imperial Keemun won gold at the International Exposition in Panama in 1915. In the same year, it became world renowned and was actually preferred over Darjeeling in taste tests conducted by the leading tea companies of that time.	['Country of Origin: China\nRegion: Anhui Province\nShipping Port: Shanghai\nGrade: Imperial Keemun Mao Feng Sacred Garden\nAltitude: up to 5000 feet above sea level\nManufacture Type: Orthodox\nCup Characteristics: A high quality Keemun with a winey, juicy, clean\ncup. Thick reddish liquor has bouquet evoking an orchid character.\nInfusion: A reasonably thick reddish liquor.\nIngredients: Luxury black tea\nThis Keemun is a particularly fine example of a winey Keemun -very often\nreferred to as the “Bordeaux or Burgundy of Tea”. The tea has a thick\nrich liquor that has an orchid like fragrance -a fragrance that some say\ncan be enhanced with milk. This grade has tightly rolled leaves that\npromote a deep rich concentrated flavour - in fact when properly stored\ntakes on a deeper winey and mellow character. This is the third highest\ngrade of Keemun that is available, (the two top grades are Hoa Ya A and\nHoa Ya B), and is only made during March and April growing months after\nwhich the leaf and cup quality are not sufficient to meet the Imperial\nMao Feng grade.\nThe name Keemun comes from Qimen County in southern Anhui province,\nwhere almost all the mountains are covered with tea bushes. Qimen County\nproduced only green tea until the mid 1870’s. Around that time a young\nman in the civil service lost his job. Despite being totally heartbroken\nand completely embarrassed by his shame, he remembered what his father\ntold him - ‘A skill is a better guarantor of a living than precarious\nofficialdom’. Following this advice, the young man packed up his courage\nand his bags to travel to Fujian Province to learn the secrets of black\ntea manufacturing. Upon his return to Qimen in 1875 he set up three\nfactories to produce black tea. The black tea method was perfectly\nsuited to the tealeaves produced in this warm moist climate with\nwell-drained sandy soil. Before long, the superb flavor of Keemuns\nbecame very popular around the world. In fact, it is reported that the\nQueen of England counts upon Imperial Keemun Mao Feng as one of her teas\nDespite its relatively short history (for a Chinese tea!) Keemun became\nworld renown by 1915 and in taste tests conducted by the leading tea\ncompanies of the day, was preferred over Darjeeling! 1915 also marked\nanother milestone in Imperial Keemun’s storied history - it won gold at\nthe International Exposition in Panama. Even though in recent years tea\nconnoisseurs have taken more to Assams and Ceylon black teas, Imperial\nKeemun Sacred Garden remains ‘king of the black teas”.\nHot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling\nboil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the\nboiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes\naccording to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea).\nMilk and a dash of sugar help capture the complex nature of this tea,\nbut it is also perfectly acceptable to consume this tea ‘straight-up’.']	['<urn:uuid:8463aebc-801d-4111-8c82-25e2f0ce8168>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	20	38	504
50	I'm trying to make my home internet connection faster for gaming. Someone told me about QoS settings on my router - what is this and how can it help me?	QoS (Quality of Service) is a router feature that helps improve connection quality for specific applications like games, video streaming, and VoIP. When QoS is enabled, you can set priority levels for different applications. For example, you can set online games to 'high' priority, which means the router will prioritize bandwidth for gaming connections, reducing lag while playing. Applications with lower priority will have to wait if the connection exceeds your network bandwidth limit. Most routers have some form of QoS available, and you can customize the priority settings by adding, editing, or deleting applications.	['The WiFi transmitter (also known as a router) seems to have become an indispensable technology in every family. They make internet access more convenient because the connecting wires are removed.\nHowever, if you are new to using them for the first time, you will encounter a lot of confusion in installing it correctly as well as ensuring security.\nFor that reason, this article will bring you all the information and instructions that will help you to set up and access your router.\nHow to access Your Router from the Internet?\nAccess the web interface of the router\nThe first thing you must do is to access the installation interface via the web browser. To access, simply enter the router’s IP address into the address bar of the web browser then press the Enter key.\nNetwork and Sharing Center interface\nIf you still have the router manual when you buy it, you will find the router’s default IP address on it.\nIf not, you can easily find this information by opening the Control Panel, click View network status and tasks under the Network and Internet section. Then click on the WiFi network icon you are connecting.\nWait, there one more thing\nClick on the Detail button and look at the address on the right of the “IPv4 Default Gateway”.\nThat is the router’s IP address, you enter this address in the address bar of your web browser. Finally, you press Enter to access the web page of the settings page.\nAccess the IP address\nAfter entering the router’s IP address into the browser address bar, you will be asked to register the login account.\nThere are also some routers that provide some status information before entering an account, but in general, you will have the correct account name and password to access the internal installation screen.\nThis login step will help you avoid being accessed by the rest of the network and making changes you don’t want.\nAccount names and passwords are also often included with the user guide included with the router.\nRouter network interface\nHowever, if you don’t have a manual, you can ask websites like routerpasswords.com. This website provides a list of usernames and passwords for different types of routers.\nTo find the right account, you need to give this website the serial number of the router.\nConfiguration for the router\nAfter entering the correct username and password, you will be able to access the web interface of the router. Here you can change your own settings. There will be many different parts for you to set up, and remember that after making a change you need to press the Apply or Save button to save the settings.\nFor example, you can go to Wi-Fi or Wireless to change the password or rename the network. When you configure your internet connection, most routers will automatically detect your internet connection settings from the modem. You can adjust internet-related settings, such as DHCP or DNS, with no specific instructions from your telecommunications company that may lead to disconnection.\nTo set up your preferences, you should click on the different parts of the settings page to find out the functionality of that page.\nFor example, the Access Restrictions section on Linksys routers will help you manage the internet access of each machine in the network, which is a useful tool in case you want to control your children’s internet usage as well as others in your system.\nAnd there are many options that you can access on your router\nWhat is a router?\nA router is a device for transferring data packets over an inter-network and terminals through a process.\nThe router is a device that has a separated LAN ports structure (can have 1 or more LAN ports), or include a wifi antenna (antennae).\nThe main function\nThe router’s main functions are to send network packets between two or more networks, from one to many final destination points from the router.\nOverview of the operating process of the router.\nIn simple words\nFrom the router, you can directly plug Lan cable to the computer, or use the WiFi wave issued by it.\nIf the router wants to broadcast WiFi or pass signal packets (i.e., internet signals) to us, the router must be attached to the modem.\nThe modem here can be a 1-port modem, 4-port modem, 1-port wifi modem or 4-port wifi modem and this modem will connect to the Internet connection of the network.\nAnd you may wonder\nHow to connect the router to the modem?\nWhen you connect the router to the modem, the router sends to the modem the internet connection information so that the computer can connect to its network.\nYou must ensure that both the modem and router have an electrical cable plugged in.\nFirst, you plug one of the network cable into your modem, then plug others into the port on the router labeled “Internet,” “WAN,” or “WLAN.” Labels will vary depending on the type of router you have.\nSecond, you install the software. Depending on the router brand and the different structures, you may or may not receive the software installed on the computer.\nThis software is usually an interface to connect to routers and adjust settings, although it is not required.\nAnd finally, you connect your computer to the router. You can do this either via an Ethernet cable or via Wi-Fi.\nConnect the router to your modem and computer\nIf this is the first time you set up your routers, you need to connect your computer via Ethernet to be able to configure the wireless network.\nTypically, Ethernet ports on routers are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. but any ports without the “WAN,” “WLAN,” or “Internet” labels will still work. Then you connect the left cable to the Ethernet port on your computer.\nSee also: Best Wifi Router For Home\nSome helpful information that you can set up on the router\nView list of devices in the network\nDepending on the type of router you can see this list on the general status page or the wireless section. For instance, you can use the Linksys router is listed in the DHCP Client Table section of the Status page.\nChanging channel Wifi\nChanging channels can help you speed up when using WiFi. Tools like Wi-Fi Analyzer for Android or inSSIDer for Windows will help you find the best wireless channel you can use to access WiFi.\nChange channel wifi\nSetting up a wireless network\nIf you have a Wi-Fi enabled router, you can set up a wireless network so other devices can access your wifi.\nYou open the Wireless section of the router’s configuration screen, which is usually listed under Basic installation or wireless setup.\nLocate the input box labeled “SSID” which is the name of your network and what people see when they try to connect to your home network.\nName your SSID with something unique so that you will recognize the network when you need to connect. Make sure that the box labeled “Enable SSID Broadcast” is selected to broadcast the signal.\nSome settings such as channels and modes may remain default unless you are troubleshooting or specific issues.\nSecure your wireless network\nMost modern routers support a variety of wireless encryption. Use WPA or WPA2 to ensure that your network lock will still not be unlocked.\nYou must choose a combination of letters and numbers to make the password stronger. Users will need to enter this password on their devices or computers when connecting to the wireless network.\nSet the router to repeater\nA repeater is a primary tool that helps you increase the coverage distance of a WiFi network. In case you have a redundant router while you want to increase the coverage area, you can use this redundant router as a repeater.\nQoS (Quality of Service)\nQoS is a feature that helps users to increase connection quality for some specific needs or applications such as applications for streaming video, games, and VoIP.\nMost routers have a particular type of QoS available, and some manufacturers also have network devices that sell their own router versions with advanced QoS settings.\nWhen QoS is enabled, most routers have the option to focus on bandwidth for applications and a higher priority connection type (priority is usually partially installed and allows users to customize, add /edit/delete).\nFor instance, Warcraft – a famous strategy game is set to priority at “high”; It also means that the router will favor the bandwidth for connections to/from the Warcraft application (reducing lag when the game is running).\nTherefore, lower priority applications will have to wait for a connecting network if the connection currently exceeds the limit of your home network bandwidth.\nVoIP applications are often set to the highest priority to ensure conversation quality.\nDynamic DNS (DDNS): Dynamic DNS\nDDNS is a reasonably common function in today’s routers. When using DDNS, users can assign dynamic IP public of the router in particular and their home network in general to a domain name.\nHowever, in addition to enabling DDNS on the router, the most important part is that you must register the DDNS service with the domain provider that supports this function.\nIntermediate DNS providers usually implement DDNS services and target a group of customers with a tight economy.\nIn addition to having many long and cheap trial services, many of these free intermediary DNS services support DDNS to make it more convenient for users with affordable needs.\nSome services can be listed as DynDNS, No-IP, DNSdynamic, and freeDNS.\nRegistering a free domain name is no longer strange and confusing. Therefore, all you need to do is to see if the place you register supports DDNS and check if the router supports DDNS or not.\nThe configuration is also quite simple around declaring DDNS deployment on any router interface. Once the system is made successfully, accessing the remote router when you are away from home or accessing the website, the small file server you install at home will become much more comfortable.\nHow to access the Router when you forget the password\nSometimes in a busy life, you may not be able to remember the password to access the router, so you need to access to enter the original name or wifi password or reset the router to default.\nYou just follow the instruction below.\nFind the default username and password\nMost manufacturers now have the default username and password behind the router, so when you type the default password and can’t access it, you should reset your router to restore it.\nCurrently, most of the manufacturer’s password has defaulted to admin and the password is also admin.\nUsername and Password of Admin\nBut you may have one problem\nYou still cannot access the router when you sign the password that the manufactures gave. In that case, you should reset your router.\nReset the router\nYou look at the back of the router will have a small hole named “reset,” then you get a small object and click to restore the router’s default to the original.\nReset button in modem\nNote that if you do not know the configuration settings of the router, you should not click on the reset because your wifi name data and password will be lost and reset from the beginning.\nKnow to access the router is very helpful if you may get trouble with your Wifi connection on some days.\nWe hope that all the information above is enough for you to comprehend the way to access your Router correctly.

51	I'm interested in Harry Potter-inspired sports - how do Jugger and Quidditch compare in terms of their basic gameplay and scoring system?	Jugger and Quidditch are quite different team sports. In Jugger, five players per team compete, with four players fighting each other using padded weapons like swords. The fifth player (Qwick) tries to move a skull into the opponent's endzone, but can only advance when enemy fighters are 'killed'. Points are scored for skull touchdowns. In Quidditch, seven players per team compete while holding brooms between their legs. Points are scored by Chasers throwing the Quaffle through hoops (10 points) and when Seekers catch the Snitch (30 points). Quidditch uses multiple balls (Quaffle, Bludgers, Snitch) and has specialized positions (Keepers, Chasers, Beaters, Seekers), while Jugger uses just the skull and has fighters plus the Qwick.

52	I'm new to night walleye fishing and wondering what kind of lures I should buy. What are the best crankbaits to use when trolling for walleye at night?	The essential crankbaits for night walleye trolling include the Rapala Husky Jerk 12 and 14, Rapala No. 18 Minnow, the Smithwick Perfect 10, and the Yo-Zuri Crystal Minnow series. Since most night walleye fishing happens near the surface, shallow diving stickbaits (what bass anglers call jerkbaits) work best. If you need to fish deeper, you can add a one ounce Off Shore Tackle Snap Weight about 20-25 feet ahead of the lure to increase the diving depth by about one-third.	['Captain Terry Kunnen of TKO Charters caught this monster walleye\nnight trolling using crankbaits and Off Shore Tackle Side-Planer boards.\nThe best boat for night walleye trolling is one that has a place for everything and everything is in that place. On a night walleye fishing adventure just take the necessary gear and nothing else. Keeping things simple is the best way to be successful and avoid frustrations when fishing after dark.\nWhen fishing in the dark an angler is going to need some dependable lighting options. The cockpit lights in most fishing boats aren’t adequate to perform important tasks like tying on fishing lures or monitoring the lead lengths on a line counter reel.\nMost anglers use an LED head lamp for these purposes. I keep mine, plus a spare, stored in the glove box of the boat along with plenty of spare batteries.\nAdding LED rope lighting around the gunwale of the boat is a good way to flood light onto the floor of the boat and provide enough ambient light for tasks like hooking up planer boards, unhooking fish from the landing net, setting lines, etc.\nTo really light up the night, anglers might want to consider more powerful LED lighting options. Cisco Fishing Systems produces the Sur-Lok Boat Lighting System that mounts to risers which slide into their track system. These lights can literally be mounted to any flat surface in the boat, turning night into day. Like everything produced by Cisco these lights are high quality and made right here in America. For more details on these very cool lights for night fishing, visit www.ciscofishingsystemsltd.com.\nWhen the sun sets walleye go on the prowl. Trolling\ncrankbaits after dark is one of the best ways to target\ntrophy walleye that get conditioned to feed\nmore at night than during the day.\nLike most open water trolling applications a good fiberglass or graphite/fiberglass composite trolling rod matched up to a dependable line counter reel and 10 to 12 pound test monofilament line is the right set up for night walleye trolling.\nMy set up consists of a 8.5 foot telescopic rod that fishes nicely when extended and fits neatly into my rod locker when telescoped down. A 20 size line counter reel works best for walleye fishing and I can’t express enough the importance of running premium fishing lines designed with trolling in mind.\nI fish 12 pound test Maxima in the Ultra Green color and have found this line to be tough as nails when fishing around rip rap and dealing with the abrasion created by putting a planer board on the line and taking it off countless times. Maxima is very popular among steelhead fishermen who know how tough this line is, but for the most part walleye anglers have not discovered this super premium line choice.\nNight walleye trolling is a game placed with crankbaits and the brands/models of lures that routinely produce fish is an amazingly short list. Most night walleye fishing takes place at or near the surface so shallow diving stickbaits or what bass anglers refer to as jerkbaits are among the best choices.\nThe list of “must have” stickbaits for walleye trolling include the Rapala Husky Jerk 12 and 14, Rapala No. 18 Minnow, the Smithwick Perfect 10 and the Yo-Zuri Crystal Minnow series of baits. Obviously other stickbaits on the market will catch walleye, but this “short list” are the baits the hard core fishermen carry every time on the water.\nIn some situations it might be necessary to fish a little deeper than these stickbaits naturally dive. The depth of these lures can easily be increased by adding a one ounce Off Shore Tackle Snap Weight to the line about 20 to 25 feet ahead of the lure. A one ounce weight will add about 1/3 to the natural diving depth of a floating/diving style crankbait. In other words a bait that dives 15 feet without weight will reach about 20 feet when a one ounce weight is used.\nNotice the planer boards in this picture. They have been\nequipped with strips of reflector tape which makes them highly\nvisible when night trolling. Other anglers prefer to tape a cyalume\nstick to the flag of their boards when night trolling.\nThe Xi5 also features the GPS navigation powers of the Pinpoint Auto-Pilot System which makes it easy to follow a compass heading and keep the boat traveling in a desired direction hands free. Even better, once a few fish have been caught and the location of those fish saved as waypoints on a Lowrance HDS sonar/GPS unit, the Xi5 can be programmed to duplicate a precise trolling track. Thanks to the Xi5 it possible to troll from waypoint to waypoint like a beagle following a rabbit track!\nThis amazing technology is made possible by combining the GPS features of the Xi5 electric motor with the Sonar/GPS capabilities of any Lowrance Generation Two or Three HDS units. Essentially the electric motor and sonar/GPS unit are communicating using a system called Gateway, that allows the electric motor to be controlled using a foot control, a key fob and also using the touch screen on Lowrance HDS units.\nCatching walleye by trolling after dark is about finding fish, but it’s just as important to stay on those fish once they are found. With the Gateway System it’s easy to duplicate a productive trolling pass time and time again.\nBOARDS ARE BEST\nAn angler can long line his favorite crankbaits out the back of the boat and catch a few night time walleye. Incorporating in-line boards like the famous Off Shore Tackle OR12 Side-Planer is the fast track to night trolling success.\nIn order to see these boards in the dark and detect strikes, anglers use some ingenious tricks. Ordinary cyalume sticks sold at dollar stores are a good value and they also make a great board light option when taped to the flag of an OR12 Side-Planer. The typical cyalume stick lasts for six or eight hours and provides plenty of light to easily monitor boards in the dark.\nAnother option is to purchase Coast Guard approved reflector tape and place a few strips on the board flag. This tape will reflect even the subtle light produced by a boat’s bow and stern lights and also head lamps.\nAnother little known trick is to set the bait clicker function on the trolling reels and then to back off on the reel drag until just enough tension in the drag is achieved to hold the boards in place while trolling. When a fish is hooked, the extra pressure on the line causes the line to slip a little and the bait clicker gives an audible clue as to which rod/reel combination has hooked a fish.\nWHERE IS THE ACTION\nWalleye can be caught at night anywhere these fish are found. In-land lakes, impoundments, rivers and of course the Great Lakes are all great places to try your hand at “night shift” walleyes.']	['<urn:uuid:1a26a0ae-6694-4101-a72d-1361a3bed8b8>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	28	80	1170
53	I'm curious about how different Japanese regions celebrate their spiritual traditions. What are the unique features of the traditional Kagura dances in Takachiho, and what makes Kamuy Lumina's approach to spiritual storytelling different?	The Takachiho Kagura dances feature performers who embody various deities through the use of distinctive masks, representing characters from Japanese legend such as Takemikatsuchi and Futsunushi. The performances include energetic dances accompanied by traditional drums and flutes, with the famous story of Amaterasu and Amenouzume being a central element. The ritual begins with the preparation of Yorishiro (three decorated bamboo stems) to summon the deities. In contrast, Kamuy Lumina takes a modern approach to spiritual storytelling by creating an interactive journey where visitors become part of the narrative. Using technology like light displays, soundscapes, and video projections, it tells the story of how the Kamuy (gods) have stopped sending animals to humans due to their lack of respect for the land. Visitors use 'Rhythm staffs' to participate in the story alongside characters like the Owl and Jay Bird, making it a more participatory and technologically enhanced spiritual experience.	"['“We don’t perform as deities – rather, we become deities,” says Mr. Tsuchimochi, the manager. “Once a year, we invite the deities and enjoy one night together. When they dance, people are possessed by the deities.”\nThe Takachiho district of Kyushu is said to be the place where Niniginomikoto, the deity of heaven found in Japanese legend, descended to govern the world. A magnificent Kagura festival is held from November through to February in Takachiho, where deities of the district are invited to a building called “Kagurayado”. Thirty-three dances (which are held overnight, from the evening to the next morning) are dedicated as gifts to the deities.\nYokagura in Takachiho starts with the preparation of a landmark called “Yorishiro” in order to summon the deities. Three tall bamboo stems are set up and decorated outside the house. This divine ornament is called a “Yama”. The deities will descend there and be invited into the Kagura building. The sacred stage where the Kagura dance is performed is called the “Kouniwa”.\nAfter dark, Kouniwa, the Kagura stage prepared in Mr. Sakai’s house, which has been selected as the Kagurayado, is filled with the fervor of the audience. Soon the Shikisanban dance is started in order to invite the deities and to cleanse the place, which is also regarded as important in the other traditional Japanese dances, such as Noh. A deity now appears. It has a bright red face, big nose and long blonde hair, and has started to dance energetically. The strong rhythm of drums and flutes makes the audience more and more excited.\nThe deities of Japanese legend appear one after another. Unique masks represent the individual characteristics of the deities: Izanagi and Izanami, the male deity and female deity who created the country, Takemikatsuchi, Futsunushi, the deity of battle, Oyamatsumi, the deity of the mountain, and Owatatusmi, the deity of sea, are all dancing throughout the night.\nIn the morning, the place is full to capacity ahead of the appearance of Amenouzume, one of the most popular female deities. According to Japanese legend, the female deity of sun, Amaterasuomikami was tired and hid in a cave called Amanoiwato. Her hiding in the cave caused the whole world to be plunged into darkness. The deities were bewildered and asked the female deity Amenouzume to perform a funny dance in front of the cave in order to entice her out. Amaterasu was interested in what was happening outside and peered out from the cave. Tajikarao, the deity of power, then moved the door to let Amaterasu out, thus bringing light back to the world. This is the famous Japanese story of the sun’s return. The dance by the female deity Amenouzume is said to be the first performing art in Japan. When the dances are finishing, the outside world is well on into the morning. Next is the climax of the stage performance: plays to let the deities start their return to heaven.\nPlaying with the male deities and female deities on this midwinter night was truly a wonderful experience. It was as if the ancient and the modern, the sacred and the human, were all mingling and together creating new energy of life. Even after the show, the rhythm of the drums and the sound of the flutes in Kagura continued to reverberate in my mind.\n*Yokagura in Takachiho: Performed every year from November to February, in about 20 stages.\n*Reservation is necessary to join Yokagura. (English and Japanese)\nAdmission is free for participants, but as a rule you will need to bring two bottles (approx. 3.6 liters, costing about 3,000 yen) of sake (shochu) as a gift to the deities. (Sake can be purchased at the liquor shop in Takachiho town.)\nTakachiho-Town Tourist Association\nTakachiho Town Office, Commerce, Industry and Tourism Section\n*Events catering to tourists who want to see Takachiho Kagura are performed frequently.\nSightseeing in Takachiho\nBeautiful scenery and mysterious tourist spots can be found in Takachiho district, the town of Japanese myths.\nThis beautiful canyon has oddly-shaped rock outcroppings formed by molten lava and cliffs. The beautiful Manai waterfall conveys the vigor of the great outdoors, and the environment has been protected since ancient times. The best way of enjoying the waterfall is on a tour with rental boats.\nAmanoiwato Shrine and Amanoyasugawara\nAmanoiwato is enshrined as the cave where Amaterasuomikami entered in Yokagura. Nearby is the mysterious location of Amanoyasugawara, the site of the “Amanoiwato” legend.\nTakachiho Shrine is the center of many shrines in Takachiho district. A huge cedar tree called Meotosugi can be found here. It is said that you will be happy if you circle the tree three times while holding the hand of a person you love.\nFrom Kunimigaoka hill, you can enjoy a view of Takachiho district, the land of myths and deities. The sea of clouds visible on early autumn mornings is a particular highlight.\nFamous Kagura in Japan\nHayachine-kagura: Ohasama-cho, Hienuki-gun, Iwate Prefecture\nThe sacred Mt. Hayachine is situated in the Hanamaki district of northern Japan. Hayachine-kagura began here with mountain worship and was designated as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. Here, you can enjoy the spectacular Japanese culture of myths and old proverbs.\nHanamatsuri of Okumikawa: Toei-cho, Kitashitara-gun, Aichi Prefecture\nThis festival takes place every year from November to March across 12 places in each area. In this mystic festival, the spirits that have gone underground in midwinter are “reborn”. The main feature is the “Oni no mai” (dance of Japanese ogres), where the audience and ogres enjoy a dance together.\nShimotsuki Matsuri in Tohyamago, Shinshu: Minamishinano and Kamimura, Iida City, Nagano Prefecture\nThis festival takes place in December across 12 places in each area. This fantastic ancient festival, which is held in the foot of the Southern Japanese Alps, inspired the concept of Hayao Miyazaki’s film “Spirited Away”. In the festival, people purify themselves with the boiled sacred water of deities and pray for happiness and a good harvest.\nSnow festival of Niino: Anan-cho, Shimoina-gun, Nagano Prefecture\nThis festival takes place annually at Izu shrine on January 14th, and it is the origin of Japanese performing arts. In this festival, the embodiments of the deity called “Saihou” appear in succession. The festival continues through until the morning, its sleepy, cold and smoky environment illuminated by torches.\nIse-daikagura: Masuda shrine, Tayu, Kuwana City, Mie Prefecture\nIn the 18th century, during the Edo era, pilgrimage to sacred places called Isemoude was popular. In order to congregate the pilgrims, Japanese lion dances called “Shishimai” were performed at the Grand Shrines of Ise and Atsuta.

54	japan urban development success story natural cooling techniques residential area	In the Miyazakidai area in Kanagawa, Japan, a development project successfully incorporated natural cooling techniques. The project preserved existing forest and evaluated geographical features. Research showed that after three years, residents stopped using their air-conditioners during summers, demonstrating the effectiveness of micro-climate design. The project received recognition through CENTURY series homes winning the Good Design Award.	['[Vol. 1] An important part of environmental design for residential areas involves predicting temperature changes by simulating wind flows. Conventional environmental design practices used to primarily depend on the designers’ experience and intuition. Misawa Homes Institute of Research and Development Co., Ltd. (MHIRD) has implemented the micro-climate design concept, which considers the effects of both the climate and the natural features of each site. In micro-climate design, thermal fluid analyses are performed using computer simulations that result in high-performance residential house designs with enhanced living comfort. MHIRD was one of the first in industry to recognize the significance of including natural environmental conditions in the simulations. Dr. Yukari Hirayama (Picture 1), Chief Researcher at the MHIRD Environmental Energy Center, describes the role of simulations as a means to help create comfortable residential houses and cities of the future.\nMisawa Homes Co., Ltd. is one of the largest developers of residential homes in Japan. They design, manufacture, build, and sell homes. MHIRD also undertakes research and development to improve their products. One important theme they have been researching is micro-climate design. Micro-climate design strives to produce a comfortable indoor environment throughout the year by taking advantage of the natural environment, climate and geographic features of the site. ‘Micro-climate’ is limited to the house and climate of the surrounding area. Some design concepts include using garden landscaping to change wind directions and prevent direct solar radiation. Software Cradle’s scSTREAM CFD software is the computational analysis tool used in the evaluation and design phases.\nPrior to introducing scSTREAM 20 years ago, MHIRD asked Software Cradle to develop a function for analyzing the indoor thermal distribution as a function of outdoor environmental conditions. “The core challenge of promoting micro-climate design is how to combine the latest computational technology with conventional approaches that utilize wind and sunlight. We began using scSTREAM when we realized that temperature and air flow must be considered to properly evaluate the degree of comfort,” explains Dr. Hirayama.\nMHIRD conducted measurements and post construction evaluations in collaboration with the Tokyo Institute of Technology. These were performed in the Miyazakidai area along the Den-en-toshi railway line in Kanagawa, Japan. One of the goals of this particular development project was to leave the forest as untouched as possible. Much of the planning involved evaluating characteristics of the existing green and geographical features. From research performed after tenants moved in, MHIRD found that residents stopped using their air-conditioners during the summers after three years. The positive effects of micro-climate design were also verified for the thermal radiation environment. To highlight the qualitative importance of micro-climate design, MHIRD started actively promoting residential houses with high natural ventilation efficiency using the slogan: ‘House with - 3.5 °C effective temperature’.\nMHIRD adopted scSTREAM as the standard analytical tool to evaluate micro-climate designs for the development of CENTURY, a series of residential houses that ultimately received Good Design Award. MHIRD implemented a passive design that was well suited for the climate and natural features of the site while providing the flexibility to locally adjust the micro climate. MHIRD divided the entire nation into small climatic zones and prepared an operations manual for micro-climate designed buildings, which covers the micro climate of each zone. For the development of Marina East 21 Midorihama, a large residential area in Urayasu-shi (Chiba, Japan), Dr. Hiryama recalls: “As the wind from the sea is strong in the area, we wanted to make use of it, but we also realized the need to take shelter from it if we were to provide a comfortable living environment. We implemented designs that let the winds pass over the roofs of houses by appropriately locating hedge, trees and houses as a windbreak.” MHIRD started using ThermoRender, developed by A&A Co., Ltd., during this project and have continued using it, along with scSTREAM, to evaluate the effect on effective temperature.\nThe concept of micro-climate design was implemented in a large scale for the development of M-Smart City Kumagaya (Saitama, Japan), which is planned to be completed in 2017. Kumagaya-shi in Saitama prefecture (Picture 2) is known for severely hot weather during the summer. With the desire to transform Kumagaya-shi into “a refreshing town,” micro-climate design has been implemented to take full advantage of wind flows while minimizing thermal radiation for the design of town sections and residential houses. The town section layout is designed to let mild breezes pass through green areas in the park, the ‘cool spot’, which lowers the effective temperature.\nMHIRD also introduced ‘passive cooling technology’, which releases heat by water evaporation. Water retentive interlocking blocks are used for walkway and parking. The effect on surface temperature was evaluated by changing material properties on ThermoRender. Before introducing ThermoRender, designers had to manually input calculated surface temperatures to the computational model when performing the air flow analyses. “In 2015, ThermoRender and scSTREAM were coupled and now evaluation is much faster and easier than we even initially expected,” says Dr. Hirayama.\n|Main businesses||General research on residential home and living, evaluation, and system development services|\n|Head office||Suginami-ku, Tokyo (Japan)|\n|Representative||Haruo Sato (President and CEO)|\nThis article is also available in pdf.\nSimulating Human Comfort of Heated Environment and Smoking Room\nUsing Fluid Analysis Capabilities to Improve Marine Propeller Efficiency and Stay Ahead of International Competition\nA Mechanical Engineering Consulting Company that Provides Design, Test and Analysis Services\nAssisting Architectural Designs with a Variety of Simulations Using scSTREAM\nContact us from the inquiry form below for any inquiry regarding this article.']	['<urn:uuid:0c30ddca-41d1-4fb4-981d-e7a070e09673>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	10	56	912
55	brahma boons hiranyakashipu revenge narasimha	Hiranyakashipu sought revenge against Vishnu for killing his brother Hiranyaksha. Through severe austerities, he received boons from Brahma making him nearly immortal, with specific conditions about how he could not be killed. However, Vishnu ultimately appeared as Narasimha (half-man, half-lion) and killed him by carefully working around these conditions - at twilight, on his thighs, using fingernails as weapons, on a threshold.	['“Lord Brahma said: O son of Kashyapa Muni, please get up, please get up. All good fortune unto you. You are now perfect in the performance of your austerities, and therefore I may give you a benediction. You may now ask from me whatever you desire, and I shall try to fulfill your wish.” (Shrimad Bhagavatam, 7.3.17)\nHe’s a bad guy, after all. The other side is the embodiment of sattva-guna, the mode of goodness. The species are created by him, giving meaning to the name Vidhata. Goodness, passion and ignorance – combine in different proportions to generate the 8,400,000 different species.\nBrahma was there at the beginning. He received transcendental wisdom through the heart, after properly meditating. Empowered by Vishnu, he subsequently went to work creating. He is the original father of every living being. Every person is thus related to him, and by extension to one another.\nWith such an amazing pedigree, how did Brahma not foresee the effects of his boons? Hiranyakashipu worshiped properly, but there was ill-intent. There was a score to settle, revenge for the death of his brother Hiranyaksha at the hands of Vishnu in the incarnation of a boar.\n1. Not in his role\nBrahma agreed to give Hiranyakashipu whatever was asked because of the role. Brahma is a kind of deputy, a manager of the material creation. The manager receives his tasks; duties appointed by a higher authority. If there is good or bad that results, the consequences attach to the top executive, not the deputy.\nTherefore Hiranyakashipu was able to procure amazing boons like immunity from death in so many situations. Immortality was off the table since Brahma himself doesn’t possess it. Despite living for an unfathomable length of time, there eventually comes an end. The soul inside travels to a different body.\n2. Like a business transaction\nHiranyakashipu knew what he was doing. Vishnu is the origin of both material and spiritual worlds. He is the personal side to God, the detail behind the abstract. He is the source of the brightest light that is Brahman. He is the person from whom the expansion known as Supersoul comes.\nThe king could have worshiped Vishnu and received immortality and whatever else he wanted. The problem is that Vishnu is not obliged to give anything to anyone. A person can try to worship him in the manner of a business transaction, but success is not guaranteed.\nWith Brahma and other demigods, sufficient payment is the only requirement. That is in the form of austerity and penance, and Hiranyakashipu reached a level that deserved appreciation. Catching Brahma’s eye is not easy, but Hiranyakashipu knew how to do it.\n3. Material benedictions don’t mean that much\nThe subsequent terror and destruction could have been predicted. It didn’t take a genius to know that Hiranyakashipu was a Daitya by both spirit and birth. His kind were not inclined towards real dharma. They didn’t appreciate righteousness. Surely they expected to be respected by others, though not extending the same in their dealings.\nBrahma and other demigods are not implicated in the use of the boons they hand out because material accumulation is not really that important. It is an illusion to consider fame, power, strength and wealth to be the height of an existence. It is the work of maya, fooling the individual into taking something temporary as real and permanent.\n4. A higher purpose to fulfill\nHiranyakashipu‘s example is recorded in shastra for a reason. It is an example of the heights to which a person can ascend in a material mindset. Despite having the entire world afraid of him, the now-powerful king was not satisfied. His senses were not under control, and so the mind was like a chariot trying to travel in many directions simultaneously.\nThere was a higher purpose to fulfill. From receiving these benedictions, the king created a situation that warranted a Divine appearance. It was a special form. Not the boar that dealt with his brother previously, this time it was a half-man/half-lion. While annihilating the miscreant king, the saintly son named Prahlada was protected. Brahma’s grace was a catalyst to this amazing pastime, and so the deputy shares in some of the accolades of that celebrated moment.\nWhy Brahma to demon to give,\nSo that terrorizing force to live?\nCould not the future foresee?\nSince in mode of goodness is he.\nLike a business transaction made,\nBoon after sufficiently paid.\nMaterial not so important in end,\nAlso caused Narasimha to descend.\nCategories: the four', 'In Narasimha Avatar, Bhagwan Vishnu incarnates himself as a semi-man,semi-lion in this world. This is the most fearsome avatar of Bhagwan ever known to mankind. Bhagwan Vishnu had to take this threatening avatar as the situation of that time was totally different.\nBhagwan respects his Bhakts, Demigods and their bhakti and take avatars to fulfill their wishes.\nWhile the Bhagwan’s incarnation was to create fear in Asuras, the Bhagwan also wanted to provoke fear in the Devas which is not so obvious when sage Narada expounded on Narasimha Avatar. The Bhagwan later vanquished the fear in the Devas as well. He didn’t reveal it to anyone. Sage Narada learnt from his father Brahma that the Bhagwan incarnated as Narasimha to create fear in the Devas and also destroy it later when he expounded on Srimad Bhagavatam to Sage Narada which is described below the in the form of shloka and description.\nIn his previous avatar as Varaha, Bhagwan Vishnu killed the Rakshas (Asur) Hiranyaksha. The brother of Hiranyaksha, Hiranyakashipu, wanted revenge on Vishnu and his followers. He undertook many years of austere penance to take revenge on Vishnu. Brahma thus offers the demon a boon and Hiranyakashipu asks for immortality.\nBrahma tells him this is not possible, but that he could bind the death of Hiranyakashipu with conditions. Hiranyakashipu agreed:\n“O my Bhagwan, O best of the givers of benediction, if you will kindly grant me the benediction I desire, please let me not meet death from any of the living entities created by you. Grant me that I not die within any residence or outside any residence, during the daytime or at night, nor on the ground or in the sky. Grant me that my death not be brought about by any weapon, nor by any human being or animal. Grant me that I not meet death from any entity, living or nonliving created by you. Grant me, further, that I not be killed by any demigod or demon or by any great snake from the lower planets. Since no one can kill you in the battlefield, you have no competitor. Therefore, grant me the benediction that I too may have no rival. Give me sole authority (like Bhagwan) over all the living entities and presiding deities, and give me all the glories obtained by that position. Furthermore, give me all the mystic powers attained by long austerities and the practice of yoga, for these cannot be lost at any time.”\nBrahma said, “Tatha asthu” and vanished. Hiranyakashipu was happy thinking that he had won over death.\nThe Birth of Divine Soul Prahlad\nOne day while Hiranyakashipu performed austerities at Mandaracala Mountain, his home was attacked by Indra and the other devatas. At this point the divine sage Narad intervenes to protect Kayadu, whom he describes as ‘sinless’. Following this event, Narad takes Kayadu into his care and while under the guidance of Narad, her unborn child (Hiranyakashipu’s son) Prahlad, becomes affected by the transcendental instructions of the sage even at such a young stage of development. Thus, Prahlad later begins to show symptoms of this earlier training by Narad, gradually becoming recognised as a devoted follower of Vishnu, much to his father’s disappointment.\nUnsuccessful Attempt to Kill Vishnu Bhakt Prahlad\nOnce Holika, sister of Hiranyakashipu, tried to kill Prahlad because he was worshipping the enemy of Daitya-Kul, so she sat on fire taking Prahalad on her lap. She was granted a boon from Bhagwan Shiv that she would remain unaffected by Agni(fire). But by the grace of the supreme personality of Godhead,Bhagwan Vishnu she burnt into ashes while Prahlad remain unaffected.\nHiranyakashipu furious at the devotion of his son to Vishnu, as the god had killed his sister. Finally, he decides to commit filicide but each time he attempts to kill the boy, Prahlad is protected by Bhagwan Vishnu’s maya.\nWhen asked, Prahlad refuses to acknowledge his father as the supreme Bhagwan of the universe and praises that Hari is all-pervading and omnipresent. Hiranyakashipu points to a nearby pillar and asks if ‘his Narayan’ is in it:\n“O most unfortunate Prahlad, you have always described a supreme being other than me, a supreme being who is above everything, who is the controller of everyone, and who is all-pervading. But where is He? If He is everywhere, then why is He not present before me in this pillar?”\nPrahlad then answers, He was, He is and He will be, he is present everywhere, in every being, in me and in you as well. Hiranyakashipu, unable to control his anger, smashes the pillar with his mace, and following a tumultuous sound, Vishnu in the form of Narasimha appears from it and moves to attack Hiranyakashipu. in defence of Prahlad.\nIn order to kill Hiranyakashipu and not exclude the boon given by Brahma, the form of Narasimha is chosen. Though Bhagwan Narayan could have killed him the other way but to keep the boon of the demi-gods respectful he acquire that avatar. Narasimha is neither one of these as he is a form of Vishnu incarnate as a part-human, part-lion. He comes upon Hiranyakashipu at twilight (when it is neither day nor night) on the threshold of a courtyard (neither indoors nor out), and puts the demon on his thighs (neither earth nor space). Using his sharp fingernails (neither animate nor inanimate) as weapons, he disembowels and kills the demon.\nDescription in Shloka Narasimha Avatar\ntrai-vishTaporu-bhayaha sa nrsimha-rUpam\ndaityendram Asu gadayAbhipatantam ArAd\nUrau nipAtya vidadAra nakhaih sphurantam (Srimad Bhagavatham 2.7.14)\n“The Bhagwan’s anger is depicted in the eyebrows which is clearly evident in the exposition of the Virat Purusha of the Bhagwan, akin to how Surya and Chandra are verily the eyes and mind of the Bhagwan, the DigDevathas are the Bhagwan’s ears, the Ashwini Kumaras are the Bhagwan’s nose and the eyebrows represent the Bhagwan’s anger. The Bhagwan tweezed his eyebrows to show his anger and so he purposely took the face of a lion, since the face of a lion depicted his anger perfectly.\nWhen Brahma expounded on Narasimha Avatar, the incarnation happened on the fourteenth day, Narasimha Chaturdashi and hence it is the Bhagwan’s fourteenth incarnation. Pradosha kalam is when Thrayodashi happens in the evening and Chaturdashi and during the Pradosha Kala is when the Bhagwan’s incarnation as Nrisimha happened. The Bhagwan was waiting for a moment to crush Hiranyakashipu and slayed him very quickly. Bhagwan Brahama compares this to Varaha avatar, where the Bhagwan did not kill Hiranyaksha very quickly. The Bhagwan carried his club [Gada] with him and hit Hiranyakashipu with it and then placed him on his laps and tore him apart with his hand finger nails [karajaha].\nJayadevar beautifully portrays the Bhagwan’s hand as a lotus and fondly admires the nails that grew out of the lotus in his Ashtapadi and says that the Bhagwan cut as under Hiranyakashipu who was akin to a bee- daLitha hiraNyakasipu thanu brungam.\nThe Bhagwan used his toe nails to let Ganga flow through them in Vamana Avatar – “padanakha neerajanitha jana pAvana”\nThe Bhagwan was seething in anger and no one was able to quench his anger. Prahlad then went and sat on his lap and started singing praises on the Bhagwan to see if the Bhagwan would calm down but were futile efforts.\nWhen Prahlada sang the glory of his SadGuru the Bhagwan was immediately pleased –\n“Yevam janam nipathiotham prabhavAhi koOpe,\nKAmabhi kAmamanu ya prapathan prasangAth,\nKruthwA AthmasAth surarshinA bhagwan gruhEtha,\nSoham kadham nu visruje thava bruthya sevAm” (Srimad Bhagavatam 7.9.28)\nOne should always sing the divine glories of Sadguru in the sanctum sanctorum of the Bhagwan. When in the presence of a Guru, one should sing the glories of the Bhagwan. At that very moment, the Bhagwan’s anger instantly subsided. Prahalda sings the glories of his Guru and he brought out the pitiable state of the people citing him as an example [NaichanusandhAnam]. He degraded himself in bringing out the greatness of something else. Prahlad said that he was in a bottomless pit called Samsara and with the compassion of his Guru, Sage Narada, he was attracted to him. Prahalad extolled the greatness of the Guru and the Bhagwan’s anger was abated immediately.\njnAnam tad etath amalam duravApam Aha nArAyaNa narasakhaha kila nAradAya\nekAntinAm bhagavata tad akincanAnAm pAda aravinda rajasA Apluta dehinAm syAt [Srimad Bhagavatam 7.6.27]\nWhen Prahalada instructed the Asura kids he extolled the glories of Sadguru. He instructed them that it is extremely difficult to get pure and pristine knowledge and dispassion [Vairagyam] and that it was the very advice given to Sage Narada by the Bhagwan himself. Having said that, Prahlada exhorted them to surrender unto the holy feet of a realized soul which is also not very easy and so he says, surrender unto the dust from the holy feet of Mahatmas and cover the entire body with that dust which is sure to bestow one with knowledge and dispassion. The reason being when one is blessed with bhakti, both Jnana and Vairagya follow suit.']	['<urn:uuid:f9bb481e-6807-4c3c-bac8-edf38793e50c>', '<urn:uuid:dec4e73d-5e41-487d-b8d0-93bf4c91ede6>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	5	62	2260
56	How do alternative and mainstream economies interact with marginalization?	Alternative and mainstream economies have complex relationships regarding marginalization. The drum and bass music industry demonstrates how marginalized groups can survive and even thrive within capitalism without complete separation from it, though their empowerment remains fragile. Similarly, in professional settings like law, marginalized groups face systematic discrimination while still operating within mainstream systems - women lawyers report having to provide more evidence of competence and navigate careful balances between assertiveness and perceived aggression. Both contexts show that while marginalized groups can use economic systems for resistance and advancement, they face persistent challenges from uneven power relations and implicit biases that shape their experiences within these systems.	['توانمندسازی شکننده : اقتصاد فرهنگی پویا درام بریتانیا و موسیقی گیتار باس\n|کد مقاله||سال انتشار||مقاله انگلیسی||ترجمه فارسی||تعداد کلمات|\n|5411||2008||10 صفحه PDF||سفارش دهید||9920 کلمه|\nPublisher : Elsevier - Science Direct (الزویر - ساینس دایرکت)\nJournal : Geoforum, Volume 39, Issue 5, September 2008, Pages 1647–1656\nThis paper discusses the dynamic cultural economy of British drum and bass (D&B) music, which emerged out of Britain’s rave culture in the early 1990s. We suggest that D&B offers insight into more general issues regarding the relation between alternative cultural economies and capitalism. We examine relations between D&B and the mainstream capitalist economy and argue that D&B calls attention to the possibility for alternatives to conventional capitalist relations to survive and possibly thrive without pursuing separation from capitalism. We also theorize D&B as a vehicle towards empowerment regarding the industry segment vis-à-vis the mainstream music industry and also regarding D&B’s practitioners, many of whom can be understood as marginalized discursively and/or materially. However, D&B empowerment is fragile, due in part to technological changes that threaten practices that have helped cultivate innovativeness as well as communal relations. The empowerment of alternative practices is fragile not only for D&B as an industry segment, but also from the vantage point of internal power relations – notably with respect to differences along axes of gender and generation/age. Our conclusions indicate the broader significance of the paper for critical social theory and propose how new research might build on our dynamic view of D&B’s cultural economy.\nInterest in alternative economies has been noticeable in recent years in Geography (e.g. Gibson-Graham, 2006 and Leyshon et al., 2003). Yet ideas about the meaning of “alternative” or “diverse” differ considerably. “Different” may not necessarily signify a just economy (Pollard and Samers, 2007), thus drawing attention to issues of internal power relations. Further, scholars of alternative economies have different views as to whether “alternative” signifies separation from capitalism (a post-capitalist economy) (Gibson-Graham, 2006), a dominance-dependence relation with capitalism (Lincoln, 2003), or a temporary retreat from mainstream life that nonetheless mimics or becomes assimilated into the mainstream economy (e.g. Crewe et al., 2003). In this paper, we develop a relational position, recognizing the relation (not separation) between alternative, counter-cultural lifeways but also problems of marginalization and uneven power relations both within alternative economic spaces and between these spaces and mainstream capitalism. We offer a case study of a small segment of the music industry, drum and bass (D&B), which broadly construed represents a counter-cultural movement that reflects discursive and material marginalization; crucially, has survived and in some ways thrived as part of the capitalist system. We conceptualize D&B as a “cultural economy” because we recognize the mutual constitution (hence, the false separation) of culture and the economy (Gibson, 2003, Gibson and Kong, 2005, Massey, 1997 and Ray and Sayer, 1999). From our vantage point, economies are inherently cultural entities that entail symbols and identities of economic actors as well as materiality; looking for culture in the economy requires examining much more than the so-called “culture industries”, which bracket off certain economies as cultural and implicate others as not cultural (see critiques by Ettlinger, 2004 pp. 26–29; also Ettlinger, 2007). In Section 2 of the paper, we show that the strength of D&B, a small counter-cultural segment of the music industry within the capitalist system, is very much linked to specific technological practices and their interrelated spatiality. We also shed light on the ways in which D&B has been a vehicle to fragile empowerment for many of its practitioners and, by adopting a relational approach,1 we examine complex power relations between D&B practitioners and the mainstream capitalist economy. Our argument is that D&B speaks to debates in Geography regarding “alternative” economies because it calls attention to the imperfect and nuanced relations between alternative and mainstream economies. Shifting focus to power relations within D&B, we then explain in Section 3.1 of the paper that the “alternativeness” of this cultural economy from its origins through the present has always been gender biased – an indication that being radical does not necessarily ensure equality or social justice. Furthermore, in Section 3.2, we follow Leyshon’s (2003) illumination of technological change as the “scary monster” of the music industry by analyzing how generational differences among D&B practitioners complicate technological changes that have prompted significant restructuring of power relations and also have begun to threaten D&B’s survival. In our conclusions in Section 4 we consider how the case of D&B can shed light on the study of groups that experience subordination (Escobar, 1995, Mitchell, 2002 and Said, 1978). Although subordination has been connected to a “politics of becoming” (Gibson, 2001), our overriding sense of the literature is that such groups typically are portrayed as “becoming” in discursive but not really in material terms – that is, as unable to undergo significant material change. We call attention to the interrelation of the material practices and discursive representations to highlight uneven and changing power relations among those who are subordinated. We advance a view of D&B as a subaltern economy evolving within capitalism, whilst also entailing uneven and changing power relations internally. D&B music emerged in the early 1990s from Britain’s rave culture. Raves are late- or all-night events in which young people listen and dance to a wide range of electronic music (Redhead et al., 1997 and Thornton, 1996). Late 1980s and early 1990s rave-style music drew upon, and then helped bring into being, a wide range of musical forms. Whereas the influences included ‘1970s disco, early 1980s synth-pop, Euro-pop, Hi-NRG and the black electronic house/techno of Detroit and Chicago’ (Brown, 1997, p. 76), the offspring of Britain’s rave scene includes genres such as trance, happy hardcore, UK garage, grime and D&B. The latter blends the above musical influences with Jamaican reggae and ragga. The result is a highly visceral, exhilarating style of music consisting of thunderous bass-lines and frantic drums. D&B is performed by DJs and MCs (who add ragga-style lyrics) in raves or nightclubs all over Britain but especially in England and increasingly beyond British shores in the rest of Europe, Japan, North America, Brazil, or Australia. It has a dedicated following of “D&B headz” or “junglists” who buy records, attend events, and perhaps eventually proceed to make D&B themselves.2 The development and growth of D&B has entailed the creation of a small industry, which has survived despite relying on relatively low record sales of between 1000 and 5000 units. It is a marginal player in the broader music industry but large enough to provide numerous opportunities for those involved to earn a modest living. On the production side of the industry, there are music producers making music for sale in vinyl, CD or MP3 format and many others who earn by DJ’ing. Then there are rave promoters, web site managers, and pirate radio station entrepreneurs as well as managers of D&B artists (handling bookings, arranging travel, payments and so on). There are also people who are involved in multiple areas of D&B: producing music, DJ’ing, running record labels, promoting events, and operating web sites. Many D&B practitioners pursue a diversified portfolio of activities, often occupying overlapping positions in multiple sectors of the industry. Our case study is almost exclusively confined to D&B in Britain. Although D&B is made, played, and consumed elsewhere in the world, the industry’s largest, oldest, and most prestigious record companies are based in Britain.3 Britain is also the industry’s “mass market”, especially with regards to frequency of D&B events. DJs have greater earning potential in Britain, which in turn means that non-British DJs or producers have a strong material incentive to establish their credentials in Britain and be booked to play there; the uneven geography of D&B reproduces unevenness. Further, the industry’s “elite” DJs – those who command the highest fees for DJ’ing and have the most cultural capital by virtue of their position in forging D&B’s history – are British.4 Finally, Britain remains the place within which new music tends to circulate, not least because having their music played in Britain provides unsigned producers with a stronger chance of signing to one of the British D&B record companies. A case study on D&B in Britain enables us to examine the dynamics of D&B in the place in which it emerged and endured and from which it has diffused to other places. We use secondary data – such as the major book on D&B, Brian Belle-Fortune’s (1999)All Crew Muss Big Up, and interviews of D&B actors published in the only two D&B magazines (Knowledge and Atmosphere), as well as interviews in a variety of commonly used web sites, which are the main form of communication at this point in time – to illuminate what we believe are the pertinent elements of D&B’s cultural economy. Our strategy was to collect published interviews with D&B DJs and producers and analyze them for insights about the D&B cultural economy. Research on music need not be confined to primary data collected via ethnographic methods, although there are excellent examples of ethnographic studies (e.g. Cohen, 1991, Finnegan, 1989 and Pini, 2001). We recognize the importance of acknowledging limitations of secondary data, notably that we have used answers to interview questions that we did not ask and on which we could not follow up; further, we are not in a position to examine the multiple texts apparent in an interview (e.g. body language and the like). Nevertheless, we believe we have sufficient secondary data to engage the issues that concern us here. As we write, a crisis is developing in D&B. Specifically, the scope for the industry to continue providing opportunities may be severely curtailed by the “scary monster” (Leyshon, 2003) of technological change in the form of MP3 file formats and peer-to-peer file sharing networks such as Limewire or SoulSeek. Downloading has begun to affect record sales; some D&B record companies have had to cut back on staff, others have had to find new ways of making a living. New types of players have emerged on the scene; some older players have left the industry. In short, a process of economic restructuring is occurring, the outcome of which is far from certain. We examine this critical moment in the development of D&B by positioning it relative to the rest of the music industry and capitalism more generally. We do this in part by calling attention to D&B’s “dub plate culture” which, as we elaborate in the next section of the paper, is a specific approach to the production–consumption relation, and signifies a particular type of cultural economy. We argue that dub plate culture has been critical for the growth and survival of D&B, and moreover, it offers its practitioners at least a partial vehicle of empowerment and resistance to the capitalist economy, which subjects them.\nنتیجه گیری انگلیسی\nIn conclusion, we suggest that the materials presented here have general significance for how marginalization and subordinated people – subalterns – are understood in critical social theory. We follow revisionist interpretations of subalternity that refuse circumscribing subalterns by “third world” boundaries and historical periods and recognize similar processes of marginalization and subordination occurring across time and space (Mufti and Shohat, 1997). Subordination in any context occurs in countless ways and at a wide range of scales. In the case of British D&B, we have discussed how D&B is in part constituted by and in part draws from class-based subordination among many of its practitioners, and we have called attention to subordination along gender and generational lines within the industry as well as uneven power relations between D&B as an industry and mainstream capitalist segments. More generally, our exploration of the D&B cultural economy calls attention to the possibility of marginalized actors making use of the capitalist economy as a vehicle towards change, even if such change is imperfect and uneven among D&B practitioners. Upscaling from individual actors to whole industry segments, British D&B’s cultural economy is akin to a “subaltern industry” – a phrase that might seem an oxymoron in the context of rather bleak portrayals of subalterns as outside of, or blocked from benefits from, mainstream capitalism (e.g. Escobar, 1995, Mitchell, 2002 and Rahnema and Bawtree, 1997). D&B occupies a subordinate position relative to the mainstream capitalist economy whilst nonetheless manipulating the system and drawing benefits from it. We have examined D&B via a relational approach, that is, we have focused on relations between individuals, groups, and industry segments and how those relations have come together in D&B’s emergence and fragile survival. We have highlighted power relations within D&B and between it and other capitalist segments. Our approach reveals processes of subordination as well as resistance at multiple scales. Thinking about subjection in a relational sense prompts questions that point towards a more general research agenda regarding how the economy might be used as a vehicle of resistance to subjection. For example, research might turn to cases of marginalized groups practicing economic power in diverse production contexts (in places and across space) and as a form of resistance against, or constructive action for, social change. The case of gang life in US cities (Venkatesh, 1997) highlights the scope that exists for recognizing that marginalized groups can use the economy to meet political aims. The “place” of alternative culture, moreover, is of such great importance to the reputation of some cities that it would be worthwhile examining not just how city governments seek to protect the symbolic capital of their (sub)cultural economies (Shaw, 2005), but also how those involved in (re)producing (sub)cultures protect their economic niche in the city. Recent research on street vendors struggling to remain in gentrified Mexico City illustrates how marginalized groups use mobility to tease the police into exhaustion and hence retain their economic niche in space–time (Crossa, 2006). D&B suggests that relational spaces of resistance are not confined to colonialism in earlier times or colonized places (Busteed, 2005, Featherstone, 2004, Featherstone, 2005, Lambert, 2001 and Lambert, 2005), contemporary practices of resistance in the so-called “global south” (Escobar, 2001 and North and Huber, 2004), or the urban ”frontiers” of resistance to neoliberalism in Seattle or Genoa (Leitner et al., 2007). As with oppression (Young, 1990), resistance has numerous “faces”. Opposing the state or capital are well known forms of resistance; but from a relational perspective, we suggest that using the economy can be another significant, although often overlooked, practice of resistance.', 'On April 29, 2019, I moderated a panel discussion for the State Bar of Wisconsin’s Diversity Counsel Program titled “Closing the Gender Leadership Gap.” The following statistics were shared at the program. According to a study by the American Bar Association, “A Current Glance at Women in the Law,” half of the students graduating from law school with a J.D. are women. Yet, only 22.7% of law firm partners are women, 22% of state court judges are women, and 26.4% of Fortune 500 general counsel positions are held by women. A significant barrier for women in the workplace is implicit bias. After serving on this panel, I was curious to explore how the concept of implicit bias might contribute to the gender leadership gap in the legal profession.\nImplicit bias is the term that describes how the subconscious mind categorizes people. The concept was first developed by psychologists Mahzarin Banaji and Anthony Greenwald in the 1990s. Through the use of implicit association tests (“IAT”) Banaji and Greenwald evaluated the time it took for a participant to categorize concepts such as family or career with gender. The quicker the applicant could categorize concepts, the stronger the implicit association. The most frightening aspect of implicit bias is that a person may be consciously opposed to gender discrimination but may unknowingly discriminate against women due to an implicit bias that exists only in the subconscious mind.\nStudies suggest that implicit bias may play a role in explaining why men are systematically preferred for positions over women. For example, a Yale study demonstrated a statistically significant preference for men in the field of science. The study involved sending a fictional resume to 100 faculty members at top universities. The only difference was that 50 fictional students were named John, while the other 50 fictional students were named Jennifer. Even though the candidates had identical experience and qualifications, faculty members were more likely to find John competent and were more likely view him as a suitable candidate for lab positions. Furthermore, faculty members were more likely to mentor John and would offer him a higher salary than Jennifer. Another, study by Cecilia Rouse and Claudia Goldin demonstrated woman’s chances of advancing through the preliminary rounds of orchestra auditions increased 50 percent when a screen blinded the judges from knowing her gender.\nThese and other studies suggest that a wide array of professions, including the legal profession, are systematically discriminating against women in the hiring process. It is unlikely that the universities and orchestras explicitly prefer male candidates to their female counterparts. The more plausible explanation is that those in the position of selecting candidates have unknowingly allowed implicit bias to affect hiring decisions.\nSimilarly, male preference in promotion decisions can result in devastating ripple effects over time. A study using computer simulation to generate the real world effect of gender bias suggests that the consequence of even a 1% bias favoring promotion of men at early career stages could result in men holding 65% of leadership positions downstream. The same study demonstrated that a 5% bias favoring the promotion of men at early career stages resulted in men holding 71% of leadership positions downstream. Thus, “by taking into account the relative scarcity of very senior-level positions in organization as well as the weight accorded early career performance, a little bias hurt women a lot.” As I enter my ninth year of practice, I am grateful for my past and current mentors, who recognize my competence, challenge me, and afford me great responsibility. Yet, as I progress through my career, the frequency with which I encounter women litigators at my level of practice diminishes.\nAs a 2016 ABA study, “You Can’t Change What You Can’t See” explained, women and people of color face challenges in the workplace not experienced by white men. For example, most people commonly associate lawyers with white men. Lawyers who don’t fit into that category report having to set forth more evidence of competence to be accepted. Women of color often face the greatest challenge in this and other arenas.\nAnother particularly difficult challenge women face is learning to strike a balance between being assertive and being viewed as overly aggressive or shrill. As the 2016 ABA study concluded:\nboth women and people of color have been invited into today’s legal workplaces, but the kinds of behaviors white men exhibit in order to get ahead are less likely to be accepted from other groups. Instead, women and people of color are more likely than white men to report that they are expected to be ‘worker bees’ who keep their heads down but do not seek the limelight.\nFor litigators, such as myself, this task can become daunting when dealing with a difficult witness during trial. Jury decisions are often influenced based upon their general like or dislike of counsel. For women, it’s a thin line between strong advocacy and being unlikable.\nThe effects of implicit bias will not be mitigated overnight. The first step is to recognize its existence. When selecting this topic, I decided to take an IAT on gender. The test asked me to group concepts such as salary or wedding with male or female names such as John or Emily. I took the test three times, and three times the test revealed that I have a strong association of men with the concept of career and women with concept of family. As a career woman, a feminist, and a progressive, I was shocked by the results. While controversy exists over the efficacy of IATs, if Banaji and Greenwald are right, then I am implicitly gender biased. In their book, “Blindspot: Hidden Biases of Good People,” Banaji and Greenwald speak at length about the tension people feel when their implicit biases do not reflect their consciously held beliefs. Most people, such as I, are disturbed to learn about their hidden bias against groups to which they belong. In fact, participants often question the validity of the tests when confronted with undesirable results.\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to retrain our brains and reverse the effect of implicit bias. Bypassing bias is sometimes possible through blinding, such as erecting a screen between candidates and judges in the orchestra studies. However, the ability to manipulate circumstances in this manner is not always possible. The most practical solution is to remain objective when interacting with evaluating others. When determining whether to hire a candidate, consider concrete strengths and weaknesses and stay away from gut decisions. Consider structuring performance evaluations on objective versus subjective standards. Remain mindful of who you choose to mentor, who you choose to give meaningful projects to, and why you have made those choices. Most importantly, consistently question yourself. Did I make that judgment on merit, or is there something else going on? If we all ask these questions, we can take a step toward mitigating implicit bias.']	['<urn:uuid:95c0281f-36a3-47d6-a6f1-d439bc7c36d2>', '<urn:uuid:964c4738-c9f7-4826-b6ec-ae55d913ed86>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	9	106	3539

58	I'm doing research on mobile individuals' social integration. What factor appears to be particularly important for the social integration of people who are spatially mobile?	The composition and density of personal networks appear to be particularly important for the social integration of mobile individuals.	['Gender, mobility and vulnerabilities – IP6\nThis programme explores the effects of spatial mobility on the reconfiguration of gender vulnerabilities. It studies and compares different forms of spatial mobility (expatriation, migration, residential change, educational mobility) in order to establish their links to vulnerability processes. Resources may be mobilized to deal with mobility challenges. They can be of a material, relational or cognitive nature, implying the need to study vulnerability as distinct from social exclusion or precarity.\nIP6–Gender & mobility identified two gaps:\n- Clarification of “self-initiated expatriation” (represented as temporary and reversible) and “onward” or circulatory migration (viewed as durable and unidirectional).\n- Introduction of a spatial dimension into the analysis of critical events, chronic stressors and coping mechanisms from an intersectional perspective.\nAre there meso-level patterns of accumulated gender dis/advantages over the life course?\nMid-range institutional environments and notably occupational cultures probably mediate the accumulation of gendered and intersectional disadvantages across the adult life course. This project explores the potential plurality of gender norms in different professional contexts. “Gender scripts” describe the ways in which occupational norms and structures (at the meso-level) can influence elements of the societal-level “gender regimes”. In fact, the notion of “gender regime” is not satisfactory enough for understanding the experiences of individuals who do not conform to social norms (e.g. mothers who work full-time in Switzerland, or illegal migrants who hold down jobs). Another hypothesis is that occupational settings provide unequal opportunities for individuals to adopt practices that are in conformity to, or in contradiction with, the normative foundations of the Swiss societal “gender regime”. (see also the DAISIE research project.)\nHow does transnational mobility influence spillover effects between life domains, particularly when individuals are confronted with potentially competing gender norms at different points in their trajectory?\nThis question enables to further explore the importance of “mobility skills” or “motility” for resisting vulnerability processes. This study investigates whether the increased unpredictability and desynchronization of gendered life courses is exacerbated by spatial mobility. The potential conflicts between the societal (gender regime) and the occupational (gender script) levels may reveal the “misleading” nature of a number of normative expectations. A particular focus is on what extend men and women perceive boundaries across life domains and whether or not they anticipate strains and resources being transferred from one domain to another.\nWhat is the interrelation between spatial mobility and the accumulation, conversion and reactivation of reserves across time, gender and generations?\nThis study investigates the role of spatial mobility as a source of vulnerability, but also as a reserve for individuals to accumulate, store and reactivate at particular points in their life course. The main hypothesis is that mobility is a starting point from which the life courses of those concerned will progress in divergent directions according to their origins and accumulated resources. The composition and density of personal networks appear to be particularly important for the social integration of mobile individuals.\n- UNIL: Farinaz Fassa\n- UNIGE: Marylène Lieber\n- HES-SO: Claudio Bolzman, Milena Chimienti\n- EPFL (LaSUR): Vincent Kaufmann\n- FORS: Boris Wernli\n- Geneva Graduate Institute: Grégoire Mallard\n- UNIL: Pierre Bataille, Soline Blanchard, Isabel Boni-Le Goff, Alexandre Camus, Marylou Cler, Lavinia Gianettoni, Jacques-Antoine Gauthier, Valeria Insarauto, Jean-Marie Le Goff, Angèle Mendy, Marc Perrenoud, Thierry Rossier, Nathalie Rougier, Carole Christe\n- UNIGE: Karine Duplan, Eduardo Guichard\n- EPFL (LaSUR): Guillaume Drevon\n- FORS: Michèle Ernst Staehli\n- UNI Fribourg: Xavier Salamin, Flavia Cangià\n- University of Edimburg : Gil Viry\n- UNIL: Pierre Benz, Robin Casse, Annelise Erismann, Marie Sautier\n- UNI Fribourg: Nathalie Mancini-Vonlanthen']	['<urn:uuid:511d54ce-7bc9-4e73-8731-1e08cd111ce6>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	25	19	591
59	As a yoga instructor focusing on breathing techniques, I notice many students struggle with proper relaxation. What are the key principles of yogic breathing for relaxation, and how do specific breathing patterns like 4-7-8 help reduce anxiety?	Yogic breathing emphasizes nasal breathing techniques and focuses on exhalation rather than inhalation to cleanse lungs and eliminate toxins. The practice teaches proper breathing through the nose, using the full capacity of the lungs and diaphragm movement. When done correctly, the abdomen and ribcage expand on inhalation as the diaphragm moves downward. For anxiety reduction, the 4-7-8 technique is particularly effective - it involves breathing in for 4 seconds, holding for 7 seconds, and exhaling for 8 seconds. This pattern helps reduce anxiety, assists with sleep, and manages cravings. When practicing this technique, it's important to maintain the correct ratio rather than focus on exact seconds, and it should be done while sitting or lying down to prevent dizziness.	['Tip # 32: Inverted V – Sun Salutation, posture #8\nExhale, tucking your toes under and raising your hips to come into the inverted V. Do not move your hands or feet as you come into the position.\nTip # 31: Arch your chest – Sun Salutation, posture #7\nInhale as you slide your body forward and bring your hips down to the floor. Arch your chest forward and tilt your head back. Slightly bend your elbows into your body.\nTip # 30: Lower Chest to the floor – Sun Salutation, posture #6\nExhale. Lower your knees to the floor and your chest straight down between your hands, without rocking your body. Bring your forehead to the floor (a beginner may need to lower the chin instead).\nTip # 29: Push-up Pose – Sun Salutation, posture #5\nRetain the breath. Bring your left foot back, next to your right foot. Keep your spine straight and do not let your head or hips drop.\nTip # 28: Leg Back – Sun Salutation, posture #4\nInhale as you stretch your right leg back as far as possible and bend your right knee, lowering it to the floor. Stretch your head and look upward. Your hands should stay in the same position throughout the movement.\nTip # 27: Bend Over – Sun Salutation, posture #3\nExhale as you stretch forward and bend down into the third Sun Salutation position. Bring your hands down to the floor, and place them next to your feet, with the palms downward. Your hips should be kept as high as possible. If necessary, bend your knees so you can touch the ground. Tuck your forehead in toward your knees.\nTip # 26: Arch Back – Sun Salutation, posture #2\nInhale and stretch your arms up over your head. Arch your back so your hips come forward, and stretch as far is comfortable.\nTip # 25: Prayer pose – Sun Salutation, posture #1\nStand up straight with your feet together and your arms by your sides. Take a deep breath, and then exhale while bringing your palms together at chest level.\nTip # 24: Purpose of the Sun Salutation\nThe Sun Salutation is a 12-part warm-up exercise. It limbers up the body and mind in preparation for the ensuing yoga session. Each of the 12 positions brings a different vertebral movement to the spinal column and is tuned to the inhalation or exhalation of the breath, thereby instilling a feeling of balance and harmony. The positions follow one after the other, making this Salutation graceful to perform. Attempt to do at least six sequences at the start of every session.\nTip # 23: Neck Exercises\nRelax your neck by combining these four exercises. Sit cross-legged and practice each set of neck exercises at least three times.\n1. Back and forth. Drop your head back gently and then slowly drop it forward\n2. Side to side. Tilt your head to the right shoulder, to the center, and to the left.\n3. Turn your head. Turn your head to look over each shoulder in turn.\n4. Circling. Inhale as you rotate your head to one side, exhale to the other.\nTip # 22: Eye Exercises\nExercising the eyes releasing any buildup of tension and aids relaxation. When practicing, keep your head still and move only your eyes.\na. Stare at your thumb in front of you, then look into the distance, Relax and repeat\nb. With eyes wide, look from side to side 10 times, then up and down 10 times and then diagonally 10 times.\nc. Finally, after rolling your eyes in circles in both directions, cup your hands over your eyes for 30 seconds and relax.\nTip # 21: Kapalabhati\nThis exercise, using rapid breathing, is believed to be such a powerful cleanser that the face literally “glows” with good health. Before beginning the exercise, relax by taking a few deep breaths. Perform 25 rapid “pumpings” in each round. Relax between rounds by breathing deeply. Try to do three rounds.\nTip # 20: Alternate Nostril Breathing\nWhen you are comfortable with single nostril breathing (tip #19), begin alternate nostril breathing, where you practice retaining the breath for a count of 16. The action of alternate nostril breathing is physical, but the greatest benefit is the calmness and lucidity of mind that results. Try to perform at least 10 rounds daily for best results.\nThe steps to be observed are:\n1. Inhale through the left nostril to a count of four\n2. Close nostrils and hold breath to a count of 16\n3. Exhale through the right nostril to a count of eight\n4. Inhale through the right nostril to a count of four\n5. Close nostrils and hold breath to a count of 16\n6. Exhale through the left nostril to a count of eight\nTip # 19: Single Nostril Breathing\nThe object of practicing Yogic breath discipline, or “Pranayama”, is to increase physical and mental health. You can practice the breathing exercises on their own or integrate them into your program of Yoga Asanas. Sit comfortably in a cross-legged position, with your spine and neck straight, but not tense.\nHold your head erect and gently close your eyes. Use the fingers of the right hand to close off each nostril in turn. Hold them in a position called “Vishnu Mudra”. For “Vishnu Mudra”, extend the thumb, ring finger, and little finger of your right hand and fold down your other two fingers into your palm. Rest the left hand on your left knee.\nBreathe through the left nostril. Close right nostril with thumb, and inhale through left nostril to a count of four. Exhale to a count of eight. Repeat 10 times. Breathe through the right nostril. Close left nostril with the two end fingers, and inhale through right nostril to a count of four. Exhale to a count of eight. Repeat 10 times.\nTip # 18: Full Yogic Breath\nPlace one hand on your lower ribcage and one on your abdomen. Breathe in, trying to fill the lowest part of your lungs, then the middle, and then the top. Feel your chest and abdomen expand.\nTip # 17: Sitting Properly\nAdopt this posture for the breathing exercises in Tips 18 to 21. Sit cross-legged, aligning your head, neck, and spine. Keep your shoulders straight but relaxed. If you are a beginner, sit on a cushion. This lifts the hips and makes it easier to keep the back erect.\nTip # 16: Abdominal Breathing\nLearn to breathe efficiently. Lie flat on your back, placing one hand on your abdomen. Start to inhale deeply, feeling your abdomen rise; then feel it fall as you exhale. Breathing slowly and deeply brings air to the lowest part of your lungs and exercises your diaphragm.\nTip # 15: How The Lungs Work\nOn an inhalation, your diaphragm (situated below the lungs) moves downwards. Air you breathe in through the nose is drawn down the trachea to the lungs, which are protected by the ribcage. If you are breathing properly, the abdomen and ribcage will expand as you inhale. On an exhalation, your diaphragm moves upwards, compressing the lungs and pushing air out of them. The air passes back up through the trachea and out through the nostrils.\nTip # 14: The Importance Of Proper Breathing\nBreathing gives life. Without oxygen no human cell can live for more than a few minutes. Many people use only part of thier full breathing capacity, taking in about one third of the oxygen that thier lungs could use. This leads to stress and fatigue. The yogic breathe discipline teaches you to breathe through the nose, to accentuate exhalation rather than inhalation, to cleanse the lungs and eliminate toxins. These techniques increase your physical and mental health.\nTip # 13: Balancing Both Sides Of The Body\nMany of our regular daily habits tend to emphasize the use of one part or side of the body. To achieve a healthy and harmonious balance, it is important to keep all parts of the body equally strong and flexible. Yoga exercises make each group of muscles work equally on the left and right sides of the body to achieve equilibrium.\nTip # 12: Know Your Body’s Capablities\nBefore you begin your yoga asanas, it is important to recognize your body’s capabilities. Never force your body into a posture or try to go beyond your limit. Remember, yoga is not a competitive sport. Progress may be slow, but with time your body will become flexible. Ease yourself gently into each position and when you are holding a pose, check the body to see if you can feel tension building up anywhere. If you do, consciously try to relax that tension using the breath.\nTip # 11: Each Session: How Long?\nFor maximum benefit, you should set aside about 90 minutes. When you are busy, try a shorter session with fewer asanas. It is very important not to feel rushed, and to allow time for relaxation between poses. You can always perform the breathing exercises at a later stage.\nTip # 10: When & Where To Practice\nTry to practice yoga everyday. At the same time, be gentle. Do not force yourself. A yoga session should be a joy. Set aside a time when you will not be disturbed and you will not have to rush. Morning practice helps loosen up stiff joints after sleep. Evening practice releases the tensions of the day. Whenever you practice yoga, avoid eating for at least two hours beforehand.\nTip # 9: What You Need\nYou do not need special equipment to practice yoga. Although you can buy foam yoga mats, a towel on a carpeted floor will do just as well. For practicing indoors, you will need an open space, clear of furniture. The room should be comfortably heated and free of disturbances.\nTip # 8: The Importance Of A Teacher\nWhether you are learning yoga singly or in a group, it is always best to be supervised by a qualified teacher. A teacher will demonstrate how to ease your body gently into and out of the yoga postures and, most importantly, how to breathe correctly when holding a balance. He or she will ensure that you do not strain your limbs, and will help you to align your body in the asanas.\nTip # 7: Positive Thinking & Meditation\nMeditation is a state of consciousness. When practicing meditation, you must first learn how to calm the mind, and focus your mental energy inwards. Meditation can help to relieve stress and replenish your energy. If it is practiced on a daily basis, you will also find it will enable you you to think more clearly and positively, and to be at peace with yourself.\nTip # 6: Proper Diet\nThe recommended diet for a student of yoga is a simple and wholesome vegetarian one, made up of natural foods that are easily digested. It keeps the body vital and healthy, and the mind calm and free from restless thoughts. Processed and tinned foods are to be avoided when possible.\nTip # 5: Proper Relaxation\nThe release of tension through relaxation is vital to keep the body healthy. Begin and end each session of yoga asanas with relaxation, and relax between postures. This allows the released energy to flow freely.\nTip # 4: Proper Breathing\nMost people use only a fraction of thier breathing capacity. Proper breathing focuses on nasal breathing techniques to unlock energy and vitality. Breathing exercises concentrate on exhalation rather than inhalation, to cleanse the lungs of stale air and to eliminate toxins from your body.\nTip # 3: Proper Exercise: Yoga Asanas\nThe aim of proper exercise is to improve suppleness and strength. Each posture is performed slowly in fluid movements. Violent movements are avoided as they produce a build-up of lactic acid, causing fatigue.\nTip # 2: Check With Your Doctor\nYoga asanas can be practiced by young and old alike. While there is no one who should be excluded, check with your doctor before you begin a course if you suffer from a medical condition or have any doubts.\nTip # 1: What Is Yoga?\nThe word “yoga” means “union”. Yoga is a form of exercise based on the belief that the body and breath are intimately connected with the mind. By controlling the breath and holding the body in steady poses or “asanas”, yoga creates harmony.\nYoga practice consists of five key elements: proper breathing, proper exercise, proper relaxation, proper diet, and positive thinking and meditation. The exercises, or asanas, are designed to ease tense muscles, to tone up the internal organs, and to improve the flexibility of the body’s joints and ligaments.', 'Take a deep breath in. Now let it out. You may notice a difference in how you feel already. Your breath is a powerful tool to ease stress and make you feel less anxious. Some simple breathing exercises can make a big difference if you make them part of your regular routine.\nBefore you get started, keep these tips in mind:\n- Choose a place to do your breathing exercise. It could be in your bed, on your living room floor, or in a comfortable chair.\n- Don’t force it. This can make you feel more stressed.\n- Try to do it at the same time once or twice a day.\n- Wear comfortable clothes.\nMany breathing exercises take only a few minutes. When you have more time, you can do them for 10 minutes or more to get even greater benefits.\nFind below list of breathing techniques for you to practice:\n- One-minute Breathing\n- Simple Breathing\n- 4-7-8 Breathing Technique\n- Alternate Nostril Breathing (Nadi Shodhana)\n1. One-minute Breathing\nBreath and productivity go hand in hand. Incorrect breathing not only reduces your productivity levels; it can also lead to an increase in your heart rate, the same way sleep apnea quickens the pulse as the body struggles to take in oxygen.\nYoga breathing techniques offer a practical solution. Yoga has become a common form of stress management and exercise for overworked executives, and you can practice yogic breathing exercises without going to a yoga class.\nTRY THIS 1-MINUTE BREATHING EXERCISE TO BOOST BLOOD OXYGEN AND PRODUCTIVITY\nProfessional yoga therapist Felice Rhiannon uses this one-minute breath practice whenever she’s feeling frazzled or restless. It is a centering activity based on a slow inhalation and an incremental increase in the length of exhalations.\n- Inhale to the count of two\n- Exhale to the count of two\n- Inhale to the count of two\n- Exhale to the count of three\n- Inhale to the count of two\n- Exhale to the count of four\n- Inhale to the count of two\n- Exhale to the count of five\nRepeat several times, then return to your normal breathing. Your improved breathing will help regulate the oxygen flow in your blood, making you more alert. With a sharper focus, you can stay on task and make fewer mistakes, saving you time in the long run.\n2. Simple Breathing\nYes, it seems obvious, but not all breaths are created equal. A great, simple breathing exercise for calming both the nervous system and the overworked mind is a timed breath where the exhale is longer than the inhale. When your exhale is even a few counts longer than your inhale, the vagus nerve (running from the neck down through the diaphragm) sends a signal to your brain to turn up your parasympathetic nervous system and turn down your sympathetic nervous system.\nThe sympathetics command your fight or flight response, and when they fire, your heart rate and your breathing speed up, and stress hormones like cortisol start pumping through your bloodstream, preparing your body to face a threat. If the threat is, “A lion is chasing me and I need to run away,” this is helpful. If the threat is, “I am late to work” or, “I’m so upset with my mom,” this is not particularly helpful, and in fact it can be damaging – when cortisol is elevated for too long or too frequently it disturbs all the hormonal systems of the body.\nThe parasympathetics, on the other hand, control your rest, relax, and digest response. When the parasympathetic system is dominant, your breathing slows, your heart rate drops, your blood pressure lowers as the blood vessels relax, and your body is put into a state of calm and healing.\nPutting your body in a parasympathetic state is easy. Pick a count for your inhale and a count for your exhale that is a little longer. I like starting with 2 counts in, and 4 counts out, with a one count pause at the top of the inhale and a one count pause at the bottom of the exhale.\nStep by step instructions:\nTo begin, sit still and tall somewhere comfortable. Close your eyes and being breathing through your nose.\nThen, inhale for a count of two… hold the breath in for a count of one… exhale gently, counting out for four… and finish by holding the breath out for a count of one. Keep your breathing even and smooth.\nIf the 2-4 count feels too short try increasing the breath lengths to 4 in and 6 out, or 6 in and 8 out, and so on. But if longer breaths create any anxiety there is no need to push yourself. The most important thing is that the exhale is longer than the inhale, not the absolute length of the breath.\nSet a timer and breathe this way for at least five minutes! You will see a difference in your mood.\n3. 4-7-8 Breathing Technique\nThe 4-7-8 breathing technique, also known as “relaxing breath,” involves breathing in for 4 seconds, holding the breath for 7 seconds, and exhaling for 8 seconds.\nThis breathing pattern aims to reduce anxiety or help people get to sleep. Some proponents claim that the method helps people get to sleep in 1 minute.\nThere is limited scientific research to support this method, but there is a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that this type of deep, rhythmic breathing is relaxing and may help ease people into sleep.\nIn this article, we look at how to perform this breathing technique, why it might work, and apps that could help.\nWhat is 4-7-8 breathing?\nThe 4-7-8 breathing technique requires a person to focus on taking a long, deep breath in and out. Rhythmic breathing is a core part of many meditation and yoga practices as it promotes relaxation.\nDr. Andrew Weil teaches the 4-7-8 breathing technique, which he believes can help with the following:\n- reducing anxiety\n- helping a person get to sleep\n- managing cravings\n- controlling or reducing anger responses\nDr. Weil is a celebrity doctor and the founder and director of the University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine.\nHow to do it\nBefore starting the breathing pattern, adopt a comfortable sitting position and place the tip of the tongue on the tissue right behind the top front teeth.\nTo use the 4-7-8 technique, focus on the following breathing pattern:\n- empty the lungs of air\n- breathe in quietly through the nose for 4 seconds\n- hold the breath for a count of 7 seconds\n- exhale forcefully through the mouth, pursing the lips and making a “whoosh” sound, for 8 seconds\n- repeat the cycle up to 4 times\nDr. Weil recommends using the technique at least twice a day to start seeing the benefits sooner. He also suggests that people avoid doing more than four breath cycles in a row until they have more practice with the technique.\nA person may feel lightheaded after doing this for the first few times. Therefore, it is advisable to try this technique when sitting or lying down to prevent dizziness or falls.\nThe total number of seconds that the pattern lasts for is less important than keeping the ratio. A person who cannot hold their breath for long enough may try a shorter pattern instead, such as:\n- breathe in through the nose for 2 seconds\n- hold the breath for a count of 3.5 seconds\n- exhale through the mouth for 4 seconds\nAs long as a person maintains the correct ratio, they may notice benefits after several days or weeks of doing 4-7-8 breathing consistently one to two times a day.\nAccording to some advocates of 4-7-8 breathing, the longer and more frequently a person uses the technique, the more effective it becomes.\nThere is limited clinical research to support these claims about 4-7-8 breathing or other breathing techniques. The evidence is limited to anecdotal reports from satisfied users.\nHow it works and benefits\nThere is some evidence to suggest that deep breathing techniques have a positive impact on a person’s anxiety and stress levels.\nFor example, a 2011 review article in Health Science Journal identifies some of the potential health benefits of deep breathing techniques, particularly for deep breathing from the diaphragm. These possible benefits include:\n- decreased fatigue\n- reduced anxiety\n- reduced symptoms of asthma in children and adolescents\n- better stress management\n- reduced hypertension\n- reduced aggressive behavior in adolescent males\n- improved migraine symptoms\nStudies suggest that 6 weeks of practicing pranayamic breathing, or breathing that focuses on controlling breath movement, may have a positive effect on a person’s heart rate variability, which correlates with stress, and also improve cognition and anxiety.\nThere is an association between certain breathing techniques, such as 4-7-8 breathing, and other relaxation techniques. Some people couple this breathing with the following practices:\n- guided imagery\n- progressive muscle relaxation\n- repetitive prayer\n- yoga, tai chi, and qigong\n- mindfulness meditation\nThe most common uses of 4-7-8 breathing are for reducing stress and anxiety. With frequent use, it reportedly becomes more effective in helping a person manage their stress levels.\nThis improvement is in contrast to anti-anxiety drugs, which tend to lose some of their effectiveness over time as the body adjusts to them.\n4. Alternate Nostril Breathing (Nadi Shodhana)\nNadi Shodhana, or “alternate nostril breathing,” is a simple yet powerful technique that settles the mind, body, and emotions. If you’re feeling stressed, follow these steps to help you find your center.\nNadi Shodhana, or “alternate nostril breathing,” is a simple yet powerful technique that settles the mind, body, and emotions. You can use it to quiet your mind before beginning a meditation practice, and it is particularly helpful to ease racing thoughts if you are experiencing anxiety, stress, or having trouble falling asleep.\nThere are several different styles of Nadi Shodhana, but they all serve the purpose of creating balance and regulating the flow of air through your nasal passages. In fact, the term Nadi Shodhana means “clearing the channels of circulation.”\nBenefits of Alternate Nostril Breathing\nWith just a few minutes of alternate nostril breathing, you can restore balance and ease in the mind and body. Sometimes when we feel frazzled or find ourselves doing too many things at once, it’s because energetically, we are out of alignment. This breath is great for restoring that necessary balance.\nIn addition to calming the mind and reversing stress, alternate nostril breathing also:\n- Improves our ability to focus the mind\n- Supports our lungs and respiratory functions\n- Restores balance in the left and right hemispheres of the brain, and clears the energetic channels\n- Rejuvenates the nervous system\n- Removes toxins\n- Settles stress\nWhether you’re nervous about a project or presentation, anxious about a conversation, or just generally stressed out, Nadi Shodhana is a quick and calming way to bring you back to your center. If you find it difficult to settle into your meditations, try moving through a few rounds first, then remain seated and shift directly into stillness; this should help to ground you before meditation.\nNadi Shodhana Practice\nNext time you find yourself doing too many things at once, or you sense panic or anxiety begin to rise, move through a few rounds of alternate nostril breathing. It’s a great way to hit the reset button for your mental state.\n- Take a comfortable and tall seat, making sure your spine is straight and your heart is open.\n- Relax your left palm comfortably into your lap and bring your right hand just in front of your face.\n- With your right hand, bring your pointer finger and middle finger to rest between your eyebrows, lightly using them as an anchor. The fingers we’ll be actively using are the thumb and ring finger.\n- Close your eyes and take a deep breath in and out through your nose.\n- Close your right nostril with your right thumb. Inhale through the left nostril slowly and steadily.\n- Close the left nostril with your ring finger so both nostrils are held closed; retain your breath at the top of the inhale for a brief pause.\n- Open your right nostril and release the breath slowly through the right side; pause briefly at the bottom of the exhale.\n- Inhale through the right side slowly.\n- Hold both nostrils closed (with ring finger and thumb).\n- Open your left nostril and release breath slowly through the left side. Pause briefly at the bottom.\n- Repeat 5-10 cycles, allowing your mind to follow your inhales and exhales.\nSteps 5-9 represent one complete cycle of alternate nostril breathing. If you’re moving through the sequence slowly, one cycle should take you about 30-40 seconds. Move through 5-10 cycles when you’re feeling stressed, anxious, or in need of a reset button.\nTip: Consistency is helpful, so try to match the length of your inhales, pauses, and exhales. For example, you can start to inhale for a count of five, hold for five, exhale for five, hold for five. You can slowly increase your count as you refine your practice.\nWhich apps can I use for practicing these breathing techniques?\nPeople who are interested in trying breathing techniques but unsure of their ability to self-regulate may wish to use an app to help them. People can find apps for various devices in the Apple and Google Play stores.\nFor example, Mindfulness Breathing is a free app for Apple products, which helps people practice all of these breathing techniques. Overall, the app has good reviews from people who have installed it. It also includes a feature to set reminders to use it regularly during the day.']	['<urn:uuid:0b3c27e1-6c42-4ff5-bece-453513d5b055>', '<urn:uuid:0259ab52-9dba-41fa-b699-1183004ecfc9>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	37	119	4425
60	Can you tell me about how shipping and trade connections actually made Newfoundland more vulnerable during conflicts in history?	Indeed, while Newfoundland developed extensive trade linkages with multiple regions including England's West Country, Ireland, New England, the Chesapeake, the West Indies, the Azores, Spain, Portugal, France and the Netherlands, these very connections made the island an obvious target during times of war. These extensive international connections, while beneficial for trade, effectively made Newfoundland more susceptible to attacks during conflicts.	"[""The Effects of War on Early Settlement\nThere was hardly a decade in the 17th century when Newfoundland was safe from the effects of European war, whether directly in the form of open conflict, or indirectly in the form of interruptions to the Mediterranean market for saltfish.\nSir George Calvert, Lord Baltimore, cited the huge expense of fighting the French privateer de la Rade as one of the reasons for abandoning of the Colony of Avalon in 1629. The English Civil War of the 1640s did encourage Newfoundland trade with the recently-founded colonies of New England, but the struggle between the Royalists and Parliamentarians for control of the West Country ports created uncertainty for the fishing trade and consequently for the fledgling settlements of the English Shore. After the Parliamentary victory in 1649, the Newfoundland proprietor Sir David Kirke suffered, as a royalist, first under the Commonwealth and then under the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell, which soon followed. The Protectorate itself fell into a naval war with the Dutch, which resulted in the loss of many of the ships engaged in the Newfoundland fishery.\nWar with the Dutch\nA second war with the Dutch resulted in an attack on Newfoundland in 1665. The Dutch had a longstanding interest in the region, having run a sack or cargo trade since the late 16th century. Admiral De Ruyter plundered St. John's, although he decided not to follow his orders to burn the town because, he later claimed, of its poverty. In 1673 the third Dutch War prompted a serious attack on Ferryland and other settlements. Archaeological investigation at the site of the Colony of Avalon indicates that the impressive waterfront property at the Pool Plantation was shelled and burned, although houses may have been left standing.\nBritish and French Warfare\nThe close of the 17th century saw protracted war between Britain and France, wreaking economic and social destruction in the northern colonies between 1688 and 1713. The French attacked Ferryland in 1694, where Captain William Holman organized a successful defence, building a fort uncovered in recent excavations. A force of French-Canadians and Native warriors under de Brouillan and d'Iberville returned in the winter of 1696/97 to devastate most of the English Shore. The war destroyed the native planter gentry, who were taken prisoner and held for ransom at Plaisance (Placentia). Although settlement in most communities was briefly extinguished, planters petitioned for help in returning to their own harbours and settlement was quickly restored. At the same time they had suffered great losses and would suffer again, as open conflict with the French flared in Newfoundland intermittently until the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.\nThe destruction of the English Shore at the turn of the 18th century makes Newfoundland's early English settlements look impermanent: they were, after all, suddenly eclipsed. Yet fisher folk from the British Isles occupied dozens of small communities between 1621 and 1696 and built a society whose linkages tied Newfoundland not only to England's West Country and Ireland, but also to New England, the Chesapeake, the West Indies, the Azores, Spain, Portugal, France and the Netherlands. It was, unfortunately, these very linkages which made the island an obvious target in times of war.""]"	['<urn:uuid:9aa6ac16-0b42-4fec-ac20-b6b499e0ee92>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	19	60	534
61	What benefits do digital food safety monitoring systems provide?	Digital food safety monitoring systems provide consistency, transparency, and quality improvements while increasing efficiency and cost savings over time. They store data in the cloud for instant management access and make FDA inspections easier by allowing direct database retrieval of two years of records, eliminating the need to sort through paper files.	['Whether driven by regulatory factors or brand protection, the food industry has adopted advanced monitoring and management technologies to maintain and support modern day food safety cultures and operations within companies. This type of technology utilizes checklists and sensors designed to monitor and gather data. Typically, these are built into handheld devices that store collected information in the cloud. The stored data is instantly accessible for management to monitor. Additionally, the FDA demands that two years worth of records be on hand during an inspection. Instead of sorting through copious piles and ﬁle drawers of paper, the information can be pulled directly from the database and presented to the inspectors.\nIn an effort to improve the operation, food companies should adopt new processes to be proactive and ditch the old days of manually tracking and recording temperature data. Utilizing this type of technology ensures consistency, transparency and quality. Not to mention the increase in eﬃciency and savings over time.\nPerhaps the most powerful technological methodology to implement is using the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve processes in the supply chain. How is IoT relevant for a food safety strategy? In an integrated approach to food safety, IoT temperature sensors dispersed throughout the cold and hot food chain, coupled with a food safety/task management system for taking HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) required food safety temperature measurements, provides unprecedented visibility and traceability, for an end-to-end food safety strategy for grocery stores or restaurants. It’s worth noting that customers are not necessarily looking for an IoT solution when they start the process for acquiring a solution for monitoring coolers/freezers or grills, but for an automated temperature monitoring system whose data is cloud-based and just so happens to be available via the internet.\nData from IoT sensors dispersed through the food chain is continually collected and analyzed to ensure temperatures do not exceed pre-deﬁned limits. These limits are based upon HACCP guidelines. The collected data is then subsequently stored electronically for a period speciﬁed by the user, typically up to two years from the collection date per FSMA regulations. If a temperature measurement falls outside pre-deﬁned limits, an alert via text or SMS can be sent to the end-user for corrective actions. Recent developments in IoT have also coupled active monitoring with predictive analytics to determine appliance health.\nShould an issue occur in the food chain, food safety data would then be correlated with transactional data to not only deﬁne when a limit was exceeded, but to potentially trace the impact to the consumer or in- store sales/proﬁtability. Additionally, high or low sales of a speciﬁc item could also be equated to how the item is prepared.\nUtilizing checklists that guide operational eﬃciency, powered by IoT technologies is not only limited to food safety. The capabilities of IoT can be deployed for task management or facilities maintenance practices such as entry/exit applications, facility maintenance/sweep logs, CO2 sensing (beverage and condiment), customer queue length for ordering or check out and incident reporting—when the documentation of an incident is required should a customer or employee incur an injury within the facility.\nThe implementation of comprehensive end-to-end food safety and task management strategy utilizing remote monitoring based upon IoT promises to provide businesses with a new cornerstone for building a comprehensive and preemptive food safety and facilities plan. By meeting the strict requirements of HACCP regulations, companies can continually reduce operational expenses, decrease waste and potentially predict events that could aﬀect the food chain and subsequently the consumer. An integrated approach to food safety utilizing a food safety/task management system with IoT can positively inﬂuence all consumers within the restaurant, grocery and food chain realms.']	['<urn:uuid:daee02e5-a496-4c83-a41e-8824082c73e8>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	9	52	612
62	What were the real-world tests done on the RBT-5 rocket tank?	The TT-250 underwent testing from 1931 to 1932, with short range tests between 300 and 1800 meters conducted at a scientific research test site in Leningrad and near Kuzminki. By late 1933, two rockets were mounted on a BT-5 tank (renamed RBT-5). The rockets were placed in launching bins on the turret, with vertical guidance through a geared mechanism and horizontal guidance via turret rotation. The system had a maximum elevation of 48° allowing engagement up to 1500 meters using an electric firing mechanism.	"['The TT-250 is a large caliber high explosive rocket that is used on the RBT-5 event vehicle. The TT-250 is one of the most dangerous weapons in War Thunder with the ability to cause major damage or destroy almost any armoured vehicle that is hit by it. It is limited by only having two of them present on a BT-5 hull, as well as having very awkward aiming and flight characteristics. Although they are a rare sight, TT-250 can bring great rewards to those who are able to use it wisely and a swift end to those on the receiving end.\nThe rocket, or ""tank torpedo,"" was developed in the early 1930s as a potential armament for armoured vehicles. It was selected to be placed on a BT-5 and the arrangement of having two placed into launchers on the turret was selected, creating the RBT-5. Tests were conducted from around 1933 to 1935 but the project was ultimately cancelled to the limited use of the vehicle. This would not be the last time that the Soviet Union attempted to create a ""rocket tank,"" although it was certainly one of the earliest pursuits.\nVehicles equipped with this weapon\nTell us about the tactical and technical characteristics of the bomb.\nThe TT-250 has the capability to destroy any tank in the game, even those that are large and very heavily armoured. The direct high explosive damage dealt on impact is enough to instantly destroy a Maus, so any other tank stands little chance of survival. There is a degree of splash damage, although it is generally only effective against small and lightly armoured vehicles. Any direct hit to a tank is very likely to destroy whatever it hits.\nComparison with analogues\nThe TT-250 is largely unlike any other rocket in the game, and thus effectively has no direct analogues. However, there are other rockets that are used in a similar manner, only not to the same degree of effectiveness.\n- M13 Rocket - The M13, used on the BM-13N, has similar constraints as the TT-250 such as a minimum elevation that is a positive angle. The BM-13N does have 16 rockets although they only have around 5 kg of explosive mass, which can still devastate lightly armoured vehicles, but will struggle to defeat large tanks and may need multiple rockets to disable or destroy them.\n- S-24 Rocket - The S-24, found on several Soviet fixed and rotor-wing aircraft, has a similar weight (235 kg) to the TT-250. However, it has far less explosive mass (25.5 kg) which requires a direct hit on a vehicle to inflict damage.\n- Tiny Tim Rocket - The Tiny Tim, used on American fighters and attackers, is an example of a large diameter rocket (298 mm) intended for demolition / anti-shipping use. While the explosive power of the Tiny Tim is only about half (63.5 kg) of the TT-250, it has a semi-armour piercing warhead which does allow for significant damage or total destruction against a target if directly hit.\nUsage in battles\nDescribe situations when you would utilize this bomb in game (vehicle, pillbox, base, etc)\nPros and cons\n- Incredible destructive power which can destroy nearly any vehicle with a direct hit\n- Splash damage capable of inflicting severe damage on lightly armoured vehicles with a near miss\n- Minimum elevation of launcher prohibits direct fire, giving a minimum range of nearly 0.25 km\n- No guidance system and only two rockets available, meaning that aiming is both very difficult and missing is extremely punishing\nDuring the development of the BT-5 high speed tank, there were various other projects aimed at modifying and improving the BT-5 in different ways. Some were implementing underwater and swimming devices to the tank, switching out the engine for a diesel with 300 HP, and there was an idea to create a ""rocket tank."" Carried out under the direction of the Office of Motorization and Mechanization of Red Army (УММ РККА), these tests were often just single designs testing out a new concept and observing the successes and failures of each idea. Work on the BT-5 experiments began in October 1933 and an engineer was tasked with fitting a 250 kg ""tank torpedo"" (TT) to the BT-5. The main idea was to be an effective weapon against enemy heavy tanks and breaking through heavily fortified areas.\nThe TT-250 was first tested from 1931 to 1932, where short range tests between 300 and 1800 meters were conducted at a scientific research test site in Leningrad and at a training ground near Kuzminki. Following the testing, it was decided to mount them onto a tank. By the end of 1933, the idea of having two of these mounted as an additional armament to the BT-5 was realized and the new name of RBT-5 was given to this design. The rockets were placed into launching bins on either of the turret, with vertical guidance being performed by a geared mechanism from inside of the turret and horizontal guidance being provided by the rotation of the turret. Maximum elevation of the launcher was 48° which allowed targets to be engaged up to 1500 meters away with an electric firing mechanism. The rocket was 420 mm in diameter and 1805 mm in length and consisted of a 130 kg warhead with a secondary charge of 13.5 kg weight in the tail. Fuses from aerial bombs were used to detonate the rocket on impact or at a time delay, and the head of the rocket had an armoured cap to protect it.\nThe project was ultimately cancelled due to the limited range and low chance to hit a target, along with the added vulnerability of the RBT-5. Work was performed on 100 kg and 300 kg variants although these were also eventually cancelled. Out of the failure of the TT-250 and the RBT-5 came the idea of mounting RS-132 rockets to the BT-5, but this too was only an experiment.\nAn excellent addition to the article would be a video guide, as well as screenshots from the game and photos.\nLinks to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:\n- reference to the article about the variant of the weapon;\n- references to approximate analogues by other nations and research trees.\n- Pavlov, M, Zheltov I., and I.

63	How does household Treasury investment relate to recession risks?	US households have significantly increased their Treasury holdings from less than $1 trillion to around $2.5 trillion, reaching the highest level in 25 years since the Federal Reserve began rate hikes. This increased investment comes as the U.S. and other major economies are heading toward what is expected to be a shallow, mild-to-moderate recession. During the first half of recessions, core bond returns like U.S. Treasuries typically show positive performance, while high yield bonds, equities, and commodities usually experience negative returns.	"['The US Treasury market, valued at approximately $25 trillion, has witnessed a substantial increase in investments from US households since the Federal Reserve initiated its rate hikes last year. This surge in household holdings, from less than $1 trillion to around $2.5 trillion, represents the highest level in 25 years, according to Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management (NYSE: APO ).\nThe 10-year Treasury yield , a key influencer of the US economy, recently peaked at nearly 4.5%, the highest since late 2007. This increase significantly affected Wall Street, triggering a sell-off in major technology stocks and other rate-sensitive sectors following hints from the Federal Reserve of potentially maintaining higher policy rates for an extended period.\nOn Friday, however, the 10-year Treasury yield slightly retreated to 4.4%, offering some relief to the stock market. Despite this minor respite, equities faced substantial weekly losses. The consumer discretionary segment of the S&P 500 index declined by 5% over the week, indicating investor apprehension that companies offering nonessential items such as luxury goods, vehicles, and vacations could be impacted by an economic downturn.\nShares of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: AMZN ), both part of this year\'s ""Magnificent Seven"" group of high-performing stocks, also suffered losses this week. Tesla\'s shares fell over 7%, while Amazon\'s shares decreased by approximately 6.7%.\nIncreasing borrowing costs pose a risk not only to consumers but also to large corporations needing to repay significant debts in the upcoming years. Consequently, older securities with lower coupons are now seen as less valuable.\nRising yields have erased annual gains across a wide section of the bond market. The benchmark Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate index is forecasted to yield a -0.6% return this year and -14.4% over a three-year period, according to FactSet data. The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, which tracks the Bloomberg index, was down 2.1% for the year through Friday.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

While financial market volatility is likely to persist, we believe the case for bonds is stronger than it has been in years, bolstered by significantly higher starting yields and bonds’ strong track record during economic downturns.\nBond yields have risen sharply in 2022 as the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks have hiked interest rates in an effort to tame inflation. Historically, starting yields have had a powerful correlation with bond returns, and today’s yields may offer investors both improved opportunities for income generation as well as greater downside cushion. The especially pronounced rise in shorter-dated bond yields means investors can find attractive coupons without taking on the greater interest rate risk inherent in longer-duration bonds.\nAmid the current environment of inflation uncertainty, geopolitical risk, and potential economic contraction, we explore some reasons why bonds could offer better value compared with equities or cash.\n1) Recession appears likely\nA recession involves a significant, widespread decline in economic activity that lasts more than a few months, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Recessions are typically characterized by decreases in productivity, business profitability, and spending by both businesses and consumers, with the latter notable given consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), according to Fed data. (For details, please see our recent publication, “Recessions: What Investors Need to Know .”)\nAs the Fed, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England continue to pursue contractionary monetary policy, we now view a shallow, mild-to-moderate recession as our base case in the U.S. and other large developed markets such as the euro area and the U.K. There is risk that these downturns could be steeper.\nThe first half of a recession is typically marked by a decline in economic activity from a late-cycle peak. During this phase, core bond returns (i.e., U.S. Treasuries and investment grade securities) have historically been positive, while returns for high yield bonds, equities, and commodities have typically been negative (see Figure 1).\n2) Outlook for equities is uncertain\nFollowing losses in 2022, major stock indices may face further difficulties into next year if early recessionary headwinds gather force, as illustrated in the chart above. Continued concerns about inflation, and whether policy tightening may lead to or accelerate a downturn, could challenge equity markets in the coming months, with potential downside risks to corporate earnings estimates and margin expectations. We still see downside risk to the S&P 500 and other key equity indices from current levels (for more on our views on equities, see our latest Asset Allocation Outlook, “Risk-Off, Yield-On”).\n3) Improved opportunities in bonds\nWhile the outlook for other investments appears clouded, bonds look more attractive than they have in years, especially for income-seeking investors, given the broad repricing in 2022.\nFor example, the yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note, which was just above 0.7% at the start of 2022, was about 4.5% in late November. That creates an incentive to stay invested in the market, and a platform to seek attractive income even in low-risk, short-dated government bonds.\nInvestors can then look to augment that yield – without taking on substantial credit or interest rate risk – by venturing into other high-quality areas of public fixed income markets. Sectors that we currently find attractive include municipal bonds (specifically for U.S. investors), U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and the debt of banks and companies with strong investment grade credit ratings. U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) also offer a means of hedging against inflationary risks. Other areas we like include structured credit, which in some cases has been trading at historically cheap levels, and short-dated credit, which may offer attractive all-in yields.\nAlthough yields could still rise further, we think the steepest part of the increase may be behind us. Bonds are poised to offer increasingly attractive real – or inflation-adjusted – yields if central banks are able to get inflation back closer to their target levels over the next couple of years. Furthermore, bonds may reassert their traditional role as a source of portfolio diversification if a slowing economy causes equities to slump, potentially smoothing the ride for investors.\nWe still expect volatility to persist across markets through year-end and potentially into 2023. But with the attractive valuations and higher yields available across fixed income sectors today, investors who have been struggling just to play defense this year may have increasing cause for optimism.\nLearn more about PIMCO’s approach to active fixed income management .\nMarc P. Seidner is CIO Non-traditional Strategies.\nThe ""risk-free"" rate can be considered the return on an investment that, in theory, carries no risk. Therefore, it is implied that any additional risk should be rewarded with additional return. All investments contain risk and may lose value.\nPast performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results.\nInvesting in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise, and low interest rate environments increase this risk. Reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. Bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. Inflation-linked bonds (ILBs) issued by a government are fixed income securities whose principal value is periodically adjusted according to the rate of inflation; ILBs decline in value when real interest rates rise. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are ILBs issued by the U.S. government. The credit quality of a particular security or group of securities does not ensure the stability or safety of the overall portfolio. Commodities contain heightened risk, including market, political, regulatory and natural conditions, and may not be appropriate for all investors. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions. Diversification does not ensure against loss.\nStatements concerning financial market trends or portfolio strategies are based on current market conditions, which will fluctuate. There is no guarantee that these investment strategies will work under all market conditions or are appropriate for all investors and each investor should evaluate their ability to invest for the long term, especially during periods of downturn in the market.

It is one of the few Roman structures that remains intact today and was the third named curia within the comitium.	['One of the most iconic places of the city that would transport you directly to the ancient times of the Roman Empire and many other historical events that took place in the Metropolis is, without a shadow of a doubt, THE ROMAN FORUM.\nHence, the centre of Rome has been declared UNESCO “World heritage” in 1980.\nIf you are planning to visit the Roman Forum, here below you will find a guide with all the tips that you need to know so you won’t miss a thing.\nTable of contents\n- What is the Roman Forum?\n- What can I visit at the Roman Forum?\n- Roman Forum Map\n- Tips when visiting the archeological area at the Forum\nWhat is the Roman Forum?\nThe Roman Forum was the centre of the whole Empire. It was the core of the Ancient Rome, as it was the place where all public, economic and religious activities took place, in other words, everything would happen at the ancient Roman Forum.\nTogether with the Colosseum, it is one of the most attractive sights to visit in the eternal city, as you can still experience the magnitude of the Roman empire.\nWhat can I visit at the Roman Forum?\nHere you have a list of roman forum rome ruins that you shouldn’t miss:\n- Arch of Septimius Severus: It was erected in the year 203 A.D, honouring the Roman Emperor Severus and commemorating all his victories.\n- Arch of Titus at the Roman Forum: This roman masterpiece was built shortly after the death of the emperor Titus.\n- Via Sacra: It was the main road in the ancient Rome, where the most important religious procession and festivities took piece. According to legend, it is called Via sacra (sacred road) because it was where Romulus and Titus Tazio made peace, as Romulus and Titus had already sign a peace agreement after the rape of the Sabine Women.\n- The basilica of Maxentius: it’s construction started under the reign of the emperor Maxentius and finished with Constantine I, it is one of the most important building of the Roman Forum as it was destined to administering justice and designed as well as a place for imperial receptions.\n- The basilica Julia: Named after Julius Caesar who built it in 54 B.C. It was destroyed by a fire but rebuilt and enlarged for Augustus in 12 D.C\n- The Basilica Emilia: It’s the only civil basilica from the republican times that, even though it was destroyed many times, we still can find in the Roman Forum.\n- The temple of Saturn: It was built between 501 and 498 B.C. It is one of the most important, ancient and well-preserved constructions that we can find at the Roma Forum.\n- The Temple of Dioscuri: Built in the V century B.C. From the ancient structure it is remained its three columns, on of the most characteristic elements of the Roman Forum.\n- The house of Vestals: it was the official residency of the vestal virgins of Rome who were entitled to protect Vesta’s holy fire.\n- The Curia Julia: it is the third named curia within the comitium, that was used as a Senate house. It is also one of the few roman structures that remain intact.\n- The orator’s tribune: it is where the most important speeches in the history of Rome took place.\n- The temple of Julius Caesar: Its construction started in 42 B.C, by Augustus after the senate deified Julius Caesar after his death.\nRoman Forum Map\nAs you can see on the map, the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill have two different entrances. With your roman forum ticket you can also visit the Colosseum.\nTips when visiting the archeological area at the Forum\nThe best way to discover the Roman Forum is booking a guided tour with skip-the-line access. If you decide to go without a professional guide you will probably miss many important monuments.\n- Respect the temples and monuments.\n- Wear comfortable clothes and shoes.\n- In the Roman Forum there are just few places with shade, so it is very important you carry a bottle of water with you and a hat to protect yourself from the sun.\nWe hope you enjoy your stay in lovely Rome!\nIf you want visit the Palatine don’t miss this post.']	['<urn:uuid:17d2ffc6-a2ff-4095-80a2-d4e07d373c68>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	8	33	725
65	How many people's phone data was used in this research?	The researchers used cell phone data from 7 million people to form a picture of a social network. They only used numerical information such as the number, frequency, and timing of calls and texts, without accessing conversation content or identifying information like phone numbers.	['A project on the dynamics of social networks at the University of Notre Dame’s Interdisciplinary Center for Network Science and Applications (iCeNSA) has found a link between cell phone usage and relationship strength.\nThe study is a collaborative effort, led by Notre Dame faculty members from the College of Arts and Letters, the College of Science, and the College of Engineering. Principal investigators are Mark Alber, Vincent J. Duncan Family Professor of Applied Mathematics; Nitesh Chawla, associate professor of Computer Science and Engineering; Associate Professor David Hachen and Assistant Professor Omar Lizardo from the Department of Sociology; and Zoltán Toroczkai, associate professor in the Department of Physics.\nToroczkai and his students worked on the modeling aspects while Chawla and his group focused mainly on data mining and prediction. Hachen and Lizardo both studied the number and frequency of calls and text messages to explore reciprocity—the way people respond to each other—and how it emerges over time.\n“If I called you a lot and you didn’t call me a lot, that’s an imbalanced relationship,” Hachen says. “It turns out that’s extremely important. We now believe what’s really important in networks is not the formation of ties—which is important—but instead the persistence or the dissolution of ties.”\nAccording to Hachen, this social network research is unique because in addition to identifying ties between people, it also investigates how strong or weak those ties are.\nThe researchers used cell phone data—numerical information such as the number, frequency, and timing of calls and texts—from 7 million people to form a picture of a social network. Neither the content of conversations nor any information such as phone numbers, which could have led to the identification of individuals, were used in the study.\nThat social network gave the researchers an idea of how many friends a caller has in addition to how many people the caller interacts with and the strength of those ties. Combined together, that information even enabled them to predict future behaviors.\nTo study relationship strength, researchers also looked at who initiated contact and how frequently it occurred, discovering that ties that are more reciprocal are more likely to remain intact. However, if there is an imbalance, ties will most likely dissolve.\n“If you have 20 friends, and I have 20 friends, we can achieve a balance,” Hachen says. “If I have 20 friends and you have two, you’re more likely to try to call me a lot more.”\nThat exemplifies one key distinction between social and physical networks: in social networks a person tends to connect with others who connect as much as they do, whereas physical networks like air transportation systems must connect major hubs with many regional airports because to connect major hubs only to each other breaks the system.\nLizardo says the type of data affects social network research. A decade ago, he says, most data came from interviews that required people to remember friends and provide subjective information.\nNow, the ability to gather information about peoples’ actual behavior rather than memories about their behavior means that researchers can make more accurate observations. Interviews often reveal only strong ties, yet weak ties are very important, too. Behavioral research reveals both.\nThe next step for the sociology group is to add another layer of data–attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors from surveys.\nThe team has also begun working on another cell phone project that will provide 250 Notre Dame freshmen with smart phones. The study aims to address questions such as whether ties influence people’s behavior or whether people choose to form ties based on existing similarities.\nLearn More >\n- Department of Sociology\n- David Hachen faculty page\n- Omar Lizardo faculty page\n- Interdisciplinary Center for Network Science and Applications\n- Nitesh Chawla faculty page\n- Zoltán Toroczkai faculty page\n- Mark Alber faculty page\nOriginally published at newsinfo.nd.edu.']	['<urn:uuid:1c33d4e7-32a0-4099-a469-b2e8ae150e97>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	10	44	639

A second important responsibility involves the monitoring of a manufacturing facility so that contamination does not ruin a product. This specialty, called environmental monitoring, is critical in the following areas: food production, drug manufacturing, and consumer goods manufacturing.\nEnvironmental monitoring has high importance in the manufacture of sterile drugs, such as vaccines that are injected into the body. One such company that trains environmental monitoring companies is Learntrail, a learning management system company. These types of drugs have zero tolerance for the presence of a contaminant because of the severe health effects that a microorganism can cause in the bloodstream. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration enforces strict regulations on how sterile drugs must be made and monitored. Sterile drug manufacturing requires the use of clean rooms, which are designed to keep out all extraneous microorganisms.\nThe main difference is that baseline monitoring takes place before manufacturing begins, so that a microbiologist understands the normal background amount of microorganisms in a facility. In clean rooms, this background level must be reduced to zero before any drug manufacturing can begin. In other industries, a low level of microorganisms can be tolerated as a background level. When the manufacturing process begins, the microbiologist starts collecting data on microorganisms present; this step represents the primary component in environmental monitoring.\nIdentification of the microorganisms provides three important pieces of information: (1) identification of microorganisms that are always present in the manufacturing environment, (2) identification of microorganisms that sometimes occur in very large numbers, and (3) presence of pathogens. Microbiologists must make decisions on each of these occurrences about how they affect a consumer\'s health risk from the product. In 2003, the microbiologist Johanna Maukonen described situations common in manufacturing: ""Microorganisms in food and industrial environments are distributed unevenly; and there is a great variation in the cell density and composition of microbial population over space and time. Typically, the microbial cells are located in the surfaces of the food matrix and process equipment; and the cell density and species distribution may vary in different parts of a food product."" In short, industrial microbiology is seldom a static situation.\nIndustrial microbiology is the most diverse area within the science of microbiology. Industrial microbiology encompasses every specialty within the science, and it has contributed new technologies throughout its history. Industrial and basic microbiology complement each other in examining the role of microorganisms and the services microorganisms can provide to humans.\nThe industrial biochemical engineer Peter Michels and the chemist John Rosazza wrote for the Society of Microbiology News, in 2009, ""The astonishing diversity of microbial natural products reflects the enormous range of metabolic chemistry that microorganisms have at their disposal."" In that light, the number of industries that use microbial activities may be far below the full potential that microorganisms offer. Industrial microbiology can be expected to grow several-fold in the near future.\nIndustrial microbiology has increasingly made use of bioengineering to create new microbial products, or microorganisms with useful traits. For example, the pharmaceutical industry works closely with biotechnology, an industry that grew out of bioengineering. Biotechnology also contributes to bioremediation, enzyme production, and the microbiology products industry. Many microbiology product companies specialize in making biosensors, probes, immunoassay kits, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing instruments.']"	['<urn:uuid:240a7402-5093-4c1e-bac0-2f3c20b5e225>', '<urn:uuid:fb3f7968-10e5-4689-8910-2e88efef1ce7>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	5	58	1052
67	what differences exist between shark finning definition and general hunting trophy effects on animal populations	Shark finning and trophy hunting affect animal populations differently. Shark finning specifically refers to removing fins at sea and discarding the shark, which prevents tracking which species are caught and hinders fisheries management. Trophy hunting, on the other hand, affects animal populations by systematically removing the most mature members, which can adversely affect the gene pool, reduce average size of future generations, and alter behavior patterns. For example, trophy hunting has diminished the size of Kodiak bears and made them avoid their normal salmon runs due to fear of humans.	"['For supporters of animal rights, hunting for trophies is one of the worst kinds of violations. The animal rights viewpoint starts with the premise that animals deserve to live out their natural lifespan just like humans. From that standpoint, killing any animal for sport is morally offensive: It deprives animals of their right to life, and their deaths serve no justifiable purpose. The offense is compounded when some of the animals killed by trophy hunters are from rare or endangered species.\nSome methods of obtaining exotic or outsized trophies are far from sportsmanlike. Proponents of ethical hunting and animal welfare both condemn the practice of canned hunting -- breeding animals in captivity to be killed by hunters in enclosed spaces. South Africa is one of several countries that have banned the practice, but it still continues [source: Environmental News Service]. Practices like canned hunting are considered by some as abuse of wildlife.\nSome scientists say that systematically hunting the most mature members of an animal population can adversely affect its gene pool. This will reduce the average size of future generations and threaten the ability of the species to thrive in its habitat. Researchers claim repeated hunting over many years has gradually diminished the size of the Kodiak bears of Alaska. Furthermore, hunting has altered the bears\' behavior in a cause-and-effect manner. Because the bears have grown so frightened of humans, they are more likely to forego their normal salmon runs, thus undermining their own nutrition and health. Killing off the adult males of any species may decrease the survival odds of the surviving young. It may also destabilize the population by creating a shortage of males. If females are also targeted, hunting can mean the loss of the survival knowledge that mother bears pass on to their offspring [source: Nilsson].\nDespite the arguments, trophy hunting is sure to continue around the world. How do you feel about it? Is trophy hunting good, bad or somewhere in the middle? Now that you have the facts, you can join in on the debate that is sure to continue for generations to come.\nRelated HowStuffWorks Articles\nMore Great Links\n- African Sky.

It’s probably the most talked about and emotive problem and it’s certainly the most common search on this website. But after years of talking about shark finning, surely things have moved on. Why is it still an issue after all these years? The truth is, the picture is changing. With partners across the world, we’ve been at the centre of fisheries reform for over 20 years. Thanks to awareness-raising campaigns and governmental conservation commitments, there’s been significant progress in shark conservation and fisheries management. So, what’s the current state of affairs? What is shark finning? Shark finning applies to the practice of removing fins at sea and returning the fin-less shark to the water. This is a highly wasteful practice. And it's a major barrier to effective fisheries management. Fins can’t be easily identified on their own. So, when finning occurs, we lose valuable information on which species have been caught. But it’s worth noting that not all shark fishing involves finning. Removing fins from the shark and bringing fins and carcass to port is NOT classed as finning, neither is removing fins once ashore. Has it been banned? Finning has been banned by many major fishing nations (including the EU) and by all of the international high seas management bodies (RFMO’s). It’s estimated that about 70 individual nations have adopted finning bans and that number continues to grow. Finning bans vary between nations but generally take one of two forms: Full Utilisation – this is where fins may be removed at-sea but body and fins must be brought ashore for sale and use. The weights of fins and carcasses should be within an accepted ratio. Under these types of bans, fins can be stored separately from the body before being brought ashore. In some cases they may even be “landed” in different ports. This can make the bans very difficult to enforce. Fins Naturally Attached – this is a stronger measure which requires that fins remain attached to the body until brought to land. These bans have been hard-fought. For example the adoption of the strengthened EU finning ban in 2013 was the culmination of a 6 year campaign by the Trust working as a partner in the Shark Alliance. The campaign gained a huge amount of public support from across Europe. Its success represented a massive step forward for shark conservation. What’s the problem then? There are 2 main problems; There are loopholes in the full utilization approach. Unscrupulous fishermen can exploit the fin to carcass ratio to continue finning for part of their catch. This not only increases overall catch but also complicates management. Illegal fisheries ignore bans and best practice. Here there are issues of detection and enforcement which undermine all efforts to control finning and manage shark fisheries. This is why we continue to push for universal adoption of Fins Naturally Attached (FNA). It ends all at-sea fin removal, eases enforcement and aids science-based management. Our Stop Shark Finning Campaign targets the universal adoption of FNA. And aims to reduce IUU fisheries and ensure enforcement of shark fisheries control measures. You can find out more about our work on high seas fisheries through the Shark League. Should we ban shark fin? The important thing to bear in mind is that banning finning is not the same as banning fins. For all the reasons above, we're absolutely opposed to finning as a wasteful practice that prevents responsible management of fisheries. But, in theory, it’s possible to have finning bans enforced, fisheries being appropriately managed and still have shark fins coming to market. Simply banning the sale of fins doesn't stop shark finning nor does it reduce the overall mortality of sharks. What should I do about Shark Fin Soup? We believe that positive change is possible and that we should be able to envisage a future where cultural traditions can sit alongside environmental sustainability. This might seem a long way off but we have to hold it as a long-term goal. In the meantime it’s unlikely that you’ll encounter responsibly sourced shark fin soup and so shark fin should be avoided. If you’re concerned about a restaurant or retailer selling shark fin or any other shark product, then ask them about their sustainable seafood policy. If they can’t satisfy you that they're sourcing responsibly then make an alternative choice and politely let the management know about your views. With continued support for sustainable products, retailers and restaurants will seek out supply chains that can satisfy their customers. What are the Shark Trust doing now? We have to keep pushing for sustainably managed fisheries aligned with responsible trade and consumption.

68	I own a business in the US and we're about to sell our office building - since we're the ones selling, do we still need to deal with tax withholding even though the buyer is foreign?	In cases in which a U.S. business entity disposes of a U.S. real property interest, the business entity itself, rather than the transferee, is the appropriate FIRPTA withholding agent.	['FIRPTA Withholding- Withholding of Tax on Dispositions of United States Real Property Interests\nFIRPTA Withholding authorizes the U.S. Government to tax foreign persons (transferors) on dispositions of their real property interests within the United States.\n“Disposition” is defined under FIRPTA to mean a disposition for any purpose of the Internal Revenue Code. This includes, but is not limited to a sale or exchange, liquidation, redemption, gift, or transfers. Under the Act, persons purchasing U.S. real property interests from foreign persons, certain purchasers’ agents, and settlement officers are required to withhold 15% (10% for dispositions occurring prior to February 17, 2016) of the amount realized on the disposition. Note that special rules govern dispositions of foreign corporations.\nIn the majority of cases, the person/entity purchasing the real property interest (transferee/buyer) is the withholding agent. Transferees that fail to provide for FIRPTA Withholding, or that do so incorrectly, may be help liable for the tax. In cases in which a U.S. business entity disposes of a U.S. real property interest, the business entity itself, rather than the transferee, is the appropriate FIRPTA withholding agent.\nUnited States Real Property Interest\nA U.S. real property interest is an interest (other than as a creditor) in real property or certain personal property that is associated with the use of real property, which is located within the United States and/or the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nA U.S. property interest also encapsulates an interest (other than as a creditor) in any domestic corporations unless it is established that the corporation was not, at any time, a U.S. real property holding corporation during the shorter of either (1) the period during which the interest was held or (2) the 5-year period ending on the date of disposition (applicable periods).\nAn interest in a corporation is not a U.S. real property interest if:\n- The corporation did not hold any U.S. real property interests on the date of disposition;\n- All U.S. real property interests held by the corporation at anytime during the shorter of the applicable periods were disposed of in transactions in which the full amount of any gain was recognized; and\n- For dispositions dated after December 17, 2015, the corporation (and any predecessor of the corporation) was not a Regulated Investment Company (RIC) or a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIC) during the shorter of the applicable periods during which the interest was held.\nRates of FIRPTA Withholding\nThe transferee must deduct and withhold tax on the total amount realized by the foreign person on the disposition. The rate of FIRPTA withholding is generally 15% (10% for dispositions dated prior to February 17, 2016). The amount realized is the sum of:\n- The amount paid, or to be paid (principal only);\n- The fair market value of other property transferred, or to be transferred; and\n- The amount of any liability assumed by the transferee, or to which the property is subject, immediately before and after the transfer\nIf the property transferred was owned jointly by U.S. and foreign persons, the amount realized is allocated between the transferors based on the capital contribution of each transferor.\nA foreign corporation that distributes a U.S. real property interest must withhold a tax equal to 35% of the gain that is recognized on the distribution to its shareholders.\nA domestic corporation must withhold FIRPTA tax on the fair market value of the property distributed to a foreign shareholder if:\n- The shareholder’s interest in the corporation is a U.S. real property interest; and\n- The property distributed is either in redemption of stock or in liquidation of the corporation.\nFor distributions prior to February 17, 2016, the corporation generally must withhold 10% of the amount realized by foreign person. For distributions after February 17, 2016, the withholding rate increases to 15% of the amount realized.']	['<urn:uuid:f9b035f1-6ecd-497d-88d8-7da7ae9e2c1a>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	36	29	635
69	competitive strategy five forces explain	The five competitive forces that determine a product's strategic position are: 1) Entry - how easily others can enter the market and what barriers exist, 2) Threat of substitution - whether other products can easily replace yours, 3) Bargaining power of buyers - how much leverage customers have over pricing, 4) Bargaining power of suppliers - how much control suppliers have over you, and 5) Rivalry among current competitors - the intensity of competition in your market. These forces help determine a company's ability to achieve strong market position and earn above-average profits.	['Adapted from “The Wall Street Journal Guide to Management” by Alan Murray, published by Harper Business.\nThe serious study of strategy is usually credited to “Competitive Strategy,” a landmark book published in 1980 by Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter. The book deals with strategy at a high level. It’s about charting a clear course for your company, rather than individual units of the company, with the CEO playing the role of commander-in-chief. But the analytical tools that Mr. Porter develops in the book are useful for anyone involved in trying to bring a product or service to market.\nIn the classical economist’s view of the world, numerous players in a market compete against each other, driving prices down and quality up, and keeping profits modest. In Mr. Porter’s view, strategy is all about escaping that model of “perfect competition,” and instead creating a strong position for your product or service that allows it to garner outsized profits.\nHe cites five key competitive “forces” that will determine the ability of your product or service to achieve a strong strategic position:\n1. Entry. How easy is it for others to enter your market? Do newcomers face significant barriers, or do they expect sharp retaliation from existing competitors? Barriers to entry can include economies of scale, a highly differentiated product, large capital requirements for new entrants, large costs for customers to switch, limited access for newcomers to distribution channels, and government regulations or subsidies.\n2. Threat of substitution. Are there other products and services that can easily be substituted for yours? Consider, for instance, what the rise of corn syrup did to the sugar industry, or what the iPod did to the CD business.\n3. Bargaining power of buyers. Are a small number of buyers responsible for a large portion of your sales? Do their purchases from you represent a large portion of their costs? Can they easily switch suppliers, or go into your business themselves? Is your product relatively unimportant to the quality of their product or service? If the answer to these questions is “yes,” the buyer has significant leverage over you and your pricing.\n4. Bargaining power of suppliers. Do you have multiple suppliers? Are there substitutes you can use? Is it easy to switch suppliers? Are you a relatively important customer? Is their product a relatively unimportant input for you? In this case, a “yes” answer means you have significant bargaining power over them.\n5. Rivalry among current competitors. How intense is the rivalry among the firms you compete with? This will also affect your ability to sustain profits.\nIn coping with these five forces, Mr. Porter argues there are three generic strategies a firm can take to create superior profits:\n– Overall cost leadership. If you keep your costs lower than anyone else’s, you can sustain profits. This was the strategy of computer maker Dell Inc., for instance, or of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\n– Differentiation. If you can create something that is valued as unique – think Mercedes automobiles, or Apple computers – you can succeed in making more money than others in the industry.\n– Focus. By focusing on the unique needs of a particular group of buyers, a particular geographic region, or a particular segment of the product line, you may be able to earn above-average returns.\nPorter argues that it is critical that companies make clear strategic choices about their approach. The worst position, he argues, is to be “stuck in the middle,” without either clear price leadership, a clearly differentiated product, or a distinct focus.']	['<urn:uuid:47196848-69ec-4830-8bc5-b31042b79bbe>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	5	93	592

As you have seen these past two days, this district – a district I am so privileged to represent – has an incredibly rich tradition of military service. I want to thank you for the leadership you have shown on the issue of veterans’ mental healthcare and for hosting this field hearing here today. I am also grateful that Representative Massie, a strong supporter of our military and our nation’s veterans, has taken time out of his schedule to be here. Congressman Massie, thank you.\nTo the witnesses on our panels, to each person in the audience, and, especially, to every veteran present today: thank you for joining us. It is important for us all to be engaged in this issue if we are going to truly improve the care our veterans receive.\nThis field hearing is an opportunity to bring Congress to Cincinnati. I’m pleased that the Subcommittee on Health will hear directly from the veterans, the family members of veterans, the service officers, and the community providers of this region. They will provide a valuable perspective on the common barriers to mental healthcare that our veterans face.\nThe veterans of Southern and Southwest Ohio are a diverse group. They were raised on farms, in urban high-rises, and in suburban neighborhoods. But they share a common bond: they made the voluntary commitment to serve our nation. Only one percent of Americans have served in uniform. Their accomplishments have been amazing and truly unmatched by the rest of the world. As a veteran of the war in Iraq and a member of the Army Reserve, I have witnessed the heroism of my fellow veterans and have deep respect for them.\nWe can never repay them for their sacrifice, but we can honor it by ensuring that they and their families receive the care that they deserve. In Ohio, we have a robust system of Veterans Service Commissions that serve our veterans with zeal and dedication. I am grateful to have the representatives from commissions in three different counties present to testify today.\nThere is growing recognition that we must develop better treatment for the “invisible wounds” that veterans bring home, including depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, and traumatic brain injury. These wounds affect veterans of all our past wars, but the veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom face unique mental health challenges. Because of technological advances, more soldiers are surviving physical combat injuries, but they present disproportionate neurological and psychological wounds. Studies suggest that one in five veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has PTSD. A decade of war with frequent and extended deployments has made it more critical than ever before to create a quality mental healthcare system for our veterans.\nThere are many challenges in our current system that do not allow veterans to get the care they need. Sometimes, veterans are simply unable to access care: they have difficulties in scheduling timely appointments or the office is simply too far away. Other times, veterans are unwilling to ask for or accept help. Each veteran has unique struggles and needs, and we need a mental health care system that is able to provide effective, individualized care.\nToday, we will discuss how the Department of Veterans Affairs can better improve its approach to and delivery of mental healthcare.\nTruly effective care, however, will extend beyond the VA: it will require the involvement of veterans’ families and their communities, including veterans service organizations, community healthcare providers, and faith organizations.\nEach of us has a role to play in improving veterans’ access to mental healthcare.\nAgain, thanks to each of you for being here for this important discussion.']	['<urn:uuid:d06e3e84-6ede-43bd-9978-a106a3ebe34a>', '<urn:uuid:7c6465a0-e5fa-430b-8f88-a13dd8069691>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	7	58	1332
72	what is meant by job complexity in jobs	Job complexity refers to the extent to which tasks on a job are complex and difficult to perform. Jobs with complex tasks require using numerous high-level skills and are more mentally demanding and challenging, which typically leads to positive motivational outcomes for workers performing them.	"[""Job knowledge characteristics\nMotivational Impacts of knowledge characteristics On Workers\nKnowledge characteristics are classified as motivational characteristics and reflect the kinds of knowledge, skill, and ability demands that are placed on an employee Opens in new window as a function of what is done on the job (Morgeson & Humphrey, 2006).\nWhile knowledge characteristics may relate to positive work attitudes and work behaviors, the associated cognitive demands can negatively affect older workers' wellbeing (Humphrey, Nahrgang & Morgeson, 2007).\nBecause increased age is often associated with a general decline in cognitive function, one might hypothesize that jobs that are high in these types of demands might present challenges for older workers and lead to negative outcomes.\nHowever, while older adults often experience a loss in fluid intelligence, they usually experience an increase in crystallized intelligence. Thus, Morgeson and Humphrey’s knowledge characteristics likely interact differently with age, depending on the extent to which they require fluid or crystallized intelligence.\nIn the remainder of this entry, we pay attention to four kinds of knowledge characteristics.\n1. Job Complexity\nJob complexity Opens in new window refers to the extent to which the tasks on a job are complex and difficult to perform (Campion, 1988). Although originally conceptualized as an aspect of mechanistic job design, Edwards, Scully, and Brek (2000) found that complexity is a distinct factor.\nBecause work that involves complex tasks requires the use of numerous high-level skills and is more mentally demanding and challenging, it is likely to have positive motivational outcomes for workers performing it (See Job Complexity to learn more).\n2. Information Processing\nThe amount of information processing Opens in new window needed at work reflects the degree to which a job requires attending to and processing data or other information. Some jobs require higher levels of monitoring and active information to process than others, such as air traffic controller (Wall & Jackson, 1995).\nSimilar to job complexity, high levels of information processing requirement may be motivating, as successfully accomplishing them signals possession of higher levels of job-related abilities and skills.\nHowever, workers in mid and late careers may be at a disadvantage when facing high levels of information processing requirements, because usually their cognitive abilities are not at developmental peak any more due to the normal aging process (Learn more here).\n3. Problem Solving\nProblem solving Opens in new window reflects the degree to which a job requires unique ideas or solutions and reflects the more active cognitive processing requirements of a job (Jackson, Wall, Martin, & Davids, 1993).\nProblem solving involves generating unique or innovative ideas or solutions, diagnosing and solving nonroutine problems, and preventing or recovering from errors.\nAs such, it is conceptually related to the creativity demands of work and is a natural extension to the information demands of a job (Shalley, Gilson, & Bum, 2000).\nOn the one hand, workers in their mid and late career may have accumulated sufficient experience and knowledge that could guide them quickly to solutions for problems encountered in their jobs.\nOn the other hand, if problem solving imposes high demands of information processing, then this type of job will be more challenging for older workers than their counterparts who are in early career stages.\nOlder workers’ success in these types of jobs is likely to depend on the extent to which their experience can compensate for the need for information processing. In other words, if older workers could quickly locate several prominent solutions based on their experience, then the need to go through all possible solutions becomes less relevant.\nSpecialization Opens in new window reflects the extent to which a job involves performing specialized tasks or possessing specialized knowledge and skill. This notion of specialization Opens in new window was first identified by Campion (1988).\nSpecifically, as opposed to the breadth of activities and skills inherent in task and skill variety Opens in new window, specialization reflects a depth of knowledge and skill in a particular area.\nCompared to younger counterparts who are in early career stages, older workers in mid and late careers typically enjoy knowledge advantages in dealing with highly specialized jobs.\nIn addition, to maintain satisfactory performance on highly specialized jobs, a life-long learning Opens in new window orientation is a must. As such, older workers who are open to learning and new experiences are most suitable for these type of jobs.""]"	['<urn:uuid:f92d5171-d178-4bcc-acb9-aab62a19ce4e>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	8	45	726
73	As a materials scientist, I've been wondering what the target elongation percentage is for strain-hardening concrete with short fiber reinforcement under normal conditions?	Strain-hardening short fiber reinforced concrete (SHCC) should achieve a tensile elongation of more than 5% under quasi-static load.	['In order to achieve highly ductile, extremely energy-absorbing material and structural behavior under impact stress, new material concepts and reinforcement types have to be developed. The basis of this development is strain-hardening short fiber reinforced concrete (SHCC) with a tensile elongation of more than 5% under quasi-static load as well as flat and spatial reinforcement structures from continuous fiber bundles (A1/I Development and evaluation of 3D reinforcing structures for structural strengthening against impact loading). The combination of textile structures and short fibers (hybrid fiber reinforcements) is also very promising (A3/I Development and characterization of hybrid-fiber reinforced composites for structural strengthening against impact loading). A goal-oriented design of the new composites’ properties under high strain rates is to be achieved by fundamental, multiscale, experimental and theoretical-numerical interdisciplinary investigations. The characterization of the new materials with predominantly anisotropic material behavior requires the design and implementation of new highly dynamic test and measurement techniques (A4/I Experimental characterization of the mechanical behavior of anisotropic and strain-hardening composites under impact loading, C1/I 3D measurement techniques of fracture processes). The experimental work will proceed together with the development of new numerical approaches such as the multiscale simulation of the anisotropic damping behavior of fiber reinforced concrete under impact in the fine mesoscale (B1/I Multi-scale simulation of the anisotropic damping properties of fiber-reinforced concrete under impact loading). The expansion of the developed numerical method by a bionic remodeling approach (B1/I Multi-scale simulation of the anisotropic damping properties of fiber-reinforced concrete under impact loading) is intended to allow the calculation of an optimal reinforcement orientation. The interphase design also plays an important role for the fiber-matrix composite (A2/I Strain-rate dependent composite behavior of fiber reinforcement in mineral-based matrices) which is favorable in terms of the fracture behavior. Furthermore, significant improvements are expected from higher heterogeneity or an engineered composition of the matrix (A3/I Development and characterization of hybrid-fiber reinforced composites for structural strengthening against impact loading). These conceptual-experimental developments are to be improved by the establishment of a physically motivated damage model for the description of the fiber pullout (B3/I Modeling textile reinforced components).\nIn the development of reinforcement solutions using new composites, variants for their application are considered both on the impact-facing side (A5/I Strengthening of plane RC elements against impact on the impact-far side) and on the impact-opposite side (A6/I Strengthening of plane RC elements against impact on the impacted side). Through this process natural principles of impact absorption with regard to their adaptability for reinforcement layers for structural components should be examined (A6/I Strengthening of plane RC elements against impact on the impacted side). The new impact-resistant composites and reinforcing systems should be developed and evaluated not only from an engineering but also from an economic and ecological point of view (C2/I Analysis and assessment of the sustainability and resilience of reinforcement methods with new composites).\nResearch Projects of GRK 2250/1\nResearch Projects of GRK 2250/2\n|A1/II Gradient 3D-reinforcing structures |\nwith integrated in-situ sensors\n|A2/II Fiber and interphase|\n|A3/II Sustainable and impact-|\n|A4/II Shear resistance of mineral-|\n|B1/II Multiscale simulation of the fracture|\nbehavior of fiber-reinforced concrete\n|B3/II Numerical multiscale analysis of hybrid|\n|A5/II Strengthening on the|\n|A6/II Damping layers as impact|\n|B4/II Failure simulation of|']	['<urn:uuid:7fd5351b-4992-4af6-9fdc-9a7e77210071>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	23	18	532
74	Do the Swift birds in Iguazu National Park and the Ground Woodpecker of South Africa share similar nesting habitat preferences?	No, they have very different nesting habitat preferences. The Swift birds in Iguazu specifically nest in the rocky walls behind waterfalls, while the Ground Woodpecker is almost entirely restricted to ground level, with family groups typically found on exposed boulders in rocky and mountainous areas.	['With the theme “Destination Air Route : Migratory Birds and Tourism” , World Migratory Bird Day ( WMBD ) 2014 highlights the link between conservation of migratory birds, the development of local communities and tourism in wildlife observation worldwide.\nEach year, more than a billion tourists crossing international borders. A rich biodiversity is an attraction for tourism, and the spectacular movements of migratory birds in the world are no exception . If properly managed , tourism activities related to birds , such as observation or photography of birds can serve as the basis for a mutually beneficial relationship between people and migratory birds.

Although in raw numbers (843 species recorded to date) it doesn’t compete with tropical countries to the north or on other continents (especially South America), South Africa makes up for this in several ways:\n• the highest number of endemics on the continent: 19 true endemics, 2 breeding endemics, 1 winter endemic and 45 near-endemics (having more than 70% of their range within the borders of South Africa);\n• two near-endemic bird families (more details below);\n• generally easy birding with large numbers of birds, many readily observed;\n• excellent information on the country’s birds and where to observe them;\n• superb bird photographic opportunities;\n• extensive infrastructure allowing easy access to the best birding sites; and\n• solid value for your birding buck.\nIn this post, I’d like to focus on a small selection of South Africa’s special endemic birds.\nStarting off with my favorites (I have to say that!), the Rockjumpers. Originally considered monotypic, two species are now recognized. Cape (or Rufous) Rockjumper is a true South African endemic and restricted to the southwest Cape. Drakensberg (or Orange-breasted) Rockjumper is a Drakensberg Mountain species whose range is shared with the tiny landlocked kingdom of Lesotho. Their taxonomic affinities have caused great confusion and debate amongst ornithologists; they were originally assigned to the thrush family, then Old World warblers before being shifted to babblers (the last mentioned a common dumping-ground for any aberrant passerines). DNA evidence then indicated that they are an ancient group mostly closely related to the bizarre and wildly different rockfowls and they were therefore contentiously placed in the Picathartes family, before finally finding a contented home in their own family, Chaetopidae.\nThe Cape Rockjumper (here a female) is best sought at Rooiels, on the east coast of South Africa, north of Cape Town. An image of a male can be found in my African Birding Beat intro post http://10000birds.com/introducing-the-african-birding-beat-2.htm.\nOne of the Drakensberg Rockjumper’s most reliable stake-outs is Sani Pass, a winding 4×4 track from the village of Himeville into the mountain kingdom of Lesotho. Males of this species are more brightly colored in their non-breeding winter plumage.\nThe Sugarbirds are another family endemic to Southern Africa, again with two species; Cape Sugarbird (being a true endemic to the southwestern Cape) and Gurney’s Sugarbird (occurring at scattered sites through eastern South Africa with a small isolated population in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe.) Stands of nectar-rich Proteas are the sugarbirds’ preferred habitat and this is the essential ‘ingredient’ when searching for them. The sugarbirds’ taxonomic affinities have, like that of the rockjumpers, also provided a challenge to ornithologists. They have been considered sunbirds, Australasian honeyeaters and thrushes before being placed in their own family, Promeropidae.\nThe long-tailed Cape Sugarbird is quite common in and around Cape Town, and prime sites include Cape Point National Park and Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens.\nThe more elusive Gurney’s Sugarbird is most reliably seen on the lower slopes of Sani Pass in KwaZulu-Natal Province.\nA plethora of colorful and busy sunbirds occur in South Africa, many of them filling niche’s occupied by hummingbirds in the New World. However they are not at all related, hummingbirds are allied to swifts but sunbirds (and spiderhunters) to white-eyes, flowerpeckers and other passerines; a perfect example of convergent evolution. Three of South Africa’s sunbirds fall into our category, the stunning Orange-breasted Sunbird is a true endemic restricted to the southwestern Cape’s unique Fynbos. Two near-endemics are Greater Double-collared and Southern Double-collared Sunbird, both more widely distributed in forest edge, woodlands and other habitats that produce enough nectar to sustain their busy bodies.\nThe colorful Orange-breasted Sunbird is common in Fynbos habitats, which it shares with Cape Sugarbird.\nThe Southern (or Lesser) Double-collared Sunbird (left) is an often abundant species that is usually first detected by its cheery song. It occurs in forest edge in eastern South Africa, and in Fynbos, and even into arid areas, in the southern parts of the country. Greater Double-collared Sunbird (right) is less common and more localized than its smaller cousin. It is most reliably found in mid-elevation ranges, especially where Aloes are flowering. Notic the different width of the red chest band, this is the most obvious feature when separating these species.\nLong-tailed Pipit is classed as a Winter Endemic and its story is a fascinating one. Upon retirement, ornithologist Richard Liversidge and his wife settled in the city of Kimberley in the Northern Cape. Here he kept up his birding and one of his local patches was an urban field hockey ground where he used to walk his dogs on a regular basis. Richard noticed a variety of pipits that foraged on this grass playing field and after some observation decided that further investigation was called for, as one type seemed larger and longer tailed than any pipits with which he was familiar, and they occurred in large flocks, also an unusual feature for South African pipits. In 1996, several pipit specimens were collected for DNA analysis and it turned out that there was not one, but two new species to science in this sample! The Long-tailed Pipit was the more obvious one, this species turning up every winter in this arid region of South Africa, before mysteriously disappearing. However during a summer visit to the far northwest of Zambia on the DRC-Angola border, I filmed pipits with young that Richard Liversidge, just before his untimely passing, confirmed were Long-tailed. The second discovery was a cryptic species now known as Kimberley Pipit and its exact range and niche are still being debated.\nThe little known Long-tailed Pipit appears every winter in the area around Kimberley, but much about this bird is still a mystery. It is most easily identified by its habit of rapid tail-pumping, a feature which first drew the attention of its discoverer, Richard Liversidge.\nSouth Africa’s national bird is the Blue Crane. This small, elegant crane is arguably one of the world’s classiest birds, with a gunpowder blue plumage, massively extended primary plumes (that look like long tail feathers when perched), a resonant call and an exhilarating and elegant courtship dance. Blue Cranes are almost entirely restricted to South Africa, with an isolated (but dwindling) population in Namibia’s Etosha National Park and a few pairs in Botswana. Their numbers have dropped dramatically throughout their range, although the population seems to have stabilized, if not increasing in the southwestern Cape; however elsewhere in the country they are still under immense pressure.\nA dancing Blue Crane, South Africa’s national bird.\nAnother near-endemic, shared only with tiny Lesotho and Swaziland is the bizarre Southern Bald Ibis. It used to occur widely throughout South Africa, breeding even on Table Mountain which towers over Cape Town, but over the decades its range has contracted and is now centered around the Drakensberg Mountains and outlying rocky areas. Sharing much the same story with its cousin the Northern Bald Ibis, a closely related species that during the Middle Ages was widely known throughout Europe as the Waldrapp (meaning “Forest Crow”). It bred in large colonies on cliffs and castle ramparts throughout southern and central Europe, before it began a relentless march towards extinction. By 300 years ago it had disappeared from the whole of Europe and this pattern followed in the Middle East and North Africa. It now exists only in 4 breeding colonies at 2 locations on the coast of Morocco and a recently rediscovered relict colony in Syria, where it had been declared extinct for 70 years. Sadly this tiny Middle Eastern remnant has declined from 7 birds at discovery to just a single pair and 2 juveniles. The Southern Bald Ibis’ situation is fortunately not as chronic but it is still classified as Vulnerable.\nThe Southern Bald Ibis can be seen feeding in flocks on grasslands at the top of Sani Pass, where this image was taken.\nMy final bird for this post is another of my favorites, the Ground Woodpecker. Like the Southern Bald Ibis, its range just extends into Lesotho and Swaziland and family groups occur in rocky and mountainous areas from the Cape Peninsula northwards into eastern South Africa. This is the largest of South Africa’s woodpeckers, and in appearance and behavior it is completely different to other members of its family. Its genealogy indicates that the Ground Woodpecker is a very ancient diversion off the standard woodpecker evolutionary lineage. They are almost entirely restricted to ground level, with family groups often perching on exposed boulders issuing forth their strange gull-like shrieks.\nSani Pass is also a good site for finding the aberrant, pink-bellied Ground Woodpecker.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to wish all 10,000 Birds followers and friends a merry Festive Season and a superb, bird-filled year ahead!\nAll images © Adam Riley']	['<urn:uuid:1ffe39f6-a81a-43b9-ab3e-2f15bf6d9f7e>', '<urn:uuid:bb61d903-7262-45cb-8245-a20cc4fc32f0>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	20	45	2119
75	My therapist mentioned something about Schema Therapy helping with childhood issues. What exactly does this therapy say about how our childhood experiences affect our adult behavior?	Schema Therapy explains that when core childhood needs (like safety, love, acceptance, and respect) aren't met, people develop 'early maladaptive schemas' - which are self-defeating patterns of thinking and feeling. These schemas, formed from 'toxic childhood experiences,' create problematic patterns of interaction that continue throughout adulthood, causing ongoing troubles in relationships and personal life.	"['Schema Therapy for Personality Disorders\nSchema therapy is based upon schema theory. It has recently emerged as an effective treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder and has been successfully applied to other personality disorders as well (Young & Klosko, 2005). Schema therapy was developed by the psychologist Jeffrey Young, Ph.D. It is considered to be an integrative psychotherapy approach. This means it draws from several psychological theories to formulate its corrective strategy for repairing a damaged personality. Schema therapy derives mainly out of cognitive-behavioral theory, but also includes elements of attachment theory, and object relations theory.\nThe theoretical underpinning of schema therapy have been previously discussed. By way of brief review, schemas are considered an organizing framework of the mind. Schemas represent patterns of internal experience including memories, beliefs, emotions, and thoughts. Maladaptive schemas form when a child\'s core needs are not met. These core needs may include: safety, security, nurturance, acceptance, respect, autonomy, guidance, direction, love, attention, approval, self-expression, joy, pleasure, and relaxation. Young contends that the problem for people with personality disorders is that these core needs were not met. This leads to the development of ""early maladaptive schemas."" Maladaptive schemas and the associated unmet core needs are a focal point of schema therapy.\nYoung believes that people with personality disorders have developed maladaptive schemas stemming from ""toxic childhood experiences."" These experiences caused the formation of self-defeating patterns of interaction with the world. These self-defeating patterns of interaction get played out throughout the person\'s lifetime causing them a great deal of trouble, heartache, and grief.\nPeople with personality disorders tend to use maladaptive coping strategies in response to the maladaptive schemas. These maladaptive coping strategies can be categorized into three basic types: 1) surrender strategies, 2) avoidance strategies, or 3) overcompensation strategies. Ironically, the coping strategies themselves end up causing people problems. Schema therapy attempts to elucidate these maladaptive coping strategies and to replace them with more adaptive ones. For a more detailed explanation of these concepts, please return to the section on schema theory.\nLet\'s consider the example of a woman with Borderline Personality Disorder who was abandoned as a child. This could include abandonment through divorce or death of a parent, but could also include emotional abandonment through neglect or parental indifference. A maladaptive schema would emerge to represent ""Everyone I love will leave me."" During adulthood, whenever she experiences an event that reminds her of this early abandonment, her abandonment schema is triggered. When the schema is triggered she will experience strong negative emotions such as rage, shame, or fear. In response to the schema activation, a maladaptive coping strategy will be elicited. So, whenever her husband goes away on a business trip, this schema is triggered. As her husband prepares to go on his trip she may directly experience an intense emotional response in anticipation of his ""abandonment."" She may become overwhelmed by these emotions. She responds with a maladaptive coping strategy of overcompensation. So, she refuses to take his phone calls in an effort to prove, ""I don\'t need you"" when in fact, this is quite opposite her true feelings of needing him very much. Schema therapy would assist this woman to identify her maladaptive schema and the maladaptive coping strategy, and to make corrections to both.\nSchema therapy follows a fairly structured approach. It begins with an assessment phase where participants review their life history. During this review, present-day problems are linked to historical events. Next, assessment tools and questionnaires are used to assist the participant to identify their maladaptive schemas. These tools further highlight the relationship between present-day problems and childhood events. In addition, several experiential exercises are used to connect emotions to upsetting childhood events. These exercises help the therapy participant to identify what core needs were unmet. This is accomplished by asking the participant to reflect back upon an upsetting, significant childhood event and to vividly image that event. Then, therapy participants are asked to engage in an imaginary dialogue with their caregiver, and to identify what it was they needed from their caregiver, but did not receive. This further clarifies unmet needs and illustrates how maladaptive schemas may have developed.', 'What is Schema Therapy?\nSchema Therapy, also called Schema-Focused Cognitive Therapy or Schema-Focused Therapy, helps people identify and replace their maladaptive schemas with healthier ones.\nSchemas are self-defeating patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Schemas are thought to develop from unmet needs during early life, and become the lenses through which people view the world. When a schema is activated you can feel like someone is “pushing your buttons”. Schemas are deeply rooted beliefs that lead us to over-react or over-compensate to prevent us from feeling hurt. Unfortunately, the ways that we try to unconsciously avoid schema reactions can also be problematic. In fact, the people usually tend to engage in coping methods that unintentionally reinforce schemas. For example, if I hold the belief that others are rejecting, I might not open up to them. Then, because I don’t open up, others reject me. This then reinforces the belief that others are rejecting. In this process, maladaptive beliefs become a self-fulfilling prophesy, and are resistant to change.\nHow does Schema Therapy work?\n- Assessment: Identify underlying maladaptive schemas.\n- Emotional or experiential awareness: Notice the schemas getting activated in everyday life.\n- Behaviour change: Replace maladaptive schemas and behaviours with healthier ones.\nWhat are Maladaptive Schemas?\n- Abandonment/instability: The belief that others are unreliable and unable to provide continued support due to their emotionally instability, likelihood to suddenly die, or possibility to abandon the person for someone else.\n- Mistrust/abuse: Anticipating that others will cause oneself pain (e.g., by lying, cheating, abusing, humiliating, manipulating, or taking advantage), either intentionally or due to negligence.\n- Emotional Deprivation: The belief that others will not provide a normal amount of nuturance, empathy, or protection.\n- Defectiveness/Shame: The belief that one is flawed, unlovable, inferior or bad, and that others will notice this and the person will feel shame.\n- Social isolation/ Alienation: The feeling that one is different from others and cannot fit into to a group or community.\n- Dependence/Incompetence: The feeling that one is incapable of doing things on one’s own, and must rely heavily on others.\n- Vulnerability to harm or illness: Having fears that catastrophes are always just around the corner. This could include Emotional catastrophes (e.g., going crazy), Medical catastrophes (e.g., heart attacks), or External catastrophes (e.g., plane crashes).\n- Enmeshment/ Underdeveloped self: Feeling emotionally intertwined with others (usually parents), to the degree that individual development is compromised, or one feels smothered, or has identity confusion.\n- Failure: Belief that one is incompetent or inadequate and likely to fail.\n- Entitlement/ Grandiosity: Believing that one is superior to others, and therefore deserves special rights and privileges, and to have whatever one wants. Can involve excessive competitiveness or domination of others, and the pursuit of power and control.\n- Insufficient self-control/ self-discipline: Difficulty or refusal to restrain oneself or tolerate not getting what one wants.

76	How do genetics and lifestyle choices affect reaching age 100?	While genetics plays a role in longevity - with having a sibling who lived past 100 being the best predictor of reaching that age - only 25% of how long we live is dictated by our genes. The other 75% is determined by lifestyle choices. Key lifestyle factors common among centenarians include: following a predominantly plant-based diet, staying physically active through natural movement like walking and gardening, having strong family and social connections, maintaining a sense of purpose, and regularly relieving stress through practices like taking a weekly Sabbath day or daily naps.	"[""|Photo of the author with her 100 year old grandmother 10-1-2012|\n100 is such a nice round number.\nShould I start with a disclaimer? I'm a chemist, not a biologist. Perhaps I should leave a post on centenarians to the biologists, but I have a vested interest in the topic. On October 1 of this year, my grandmother turned 100, so I've been a little obsessed with living until 100. In the United States, an estimated 1 in 4400 people reach the age of 100 and the highest number worldwide. The next highest number of centenarians reside in Japan, with a rate of 1 in 3500 people.\nThe question is, why do these people live so long? This is a highly studied question. When one delves into the literature, as with most questions, there is no simple answer and often studies conflict with each other. There are different modes of study: some scientists study those who have become centenarians to try to determine what they have done to reach this rare milestone while other scientists work in theories, then animal models to study what pathways lead to longevity.\nStudies have found that healthy centenarians in some areas have high levels of vitamin A and vitamin E1 and higher red blood cell glutathione reductase and catalase activities.2,3 But the presence of higher levels of these vitamins and glutathione reductase is not present in all centenarians, and the mere presence of these high levels does not necessarily indicate longevity.\n|Molecules that may or may not help longevity|\nYou may have heard exclamations about antioxidants or calorie restriction. While antioxidants (the aforementioned vitamin A and vitamin E) are known to protect the body from the harmful effects of free-radicals, which occur in the normal processes of the body, evidence does not support that simply adding more antioxidants to the diet will slow aging. There are studies also showing that calorie restriction may have beneficial effects in terms of markers of aging in some animals, but many animals that are commonly used as human models do not extend longevity under calorie restriction, and such a course of action may have deleterious effects. The safety and benefits of long-term calorie restriction is currently unknown. Scientists are working towards answering these questions.\nGenetics plays an important role. The best predictor of a person reaching 100 is having a sibling live past 100. Variations in genes abound, but other than children of long-lived parents living longer, specifics are elusive. Oddly, being born in the Fall (September through November) is linked with a higher likelihood of becoming a centenarian.4 And functional independence for a longer period of time (past the age of 90) was found to be strongly correlated to centenarians. 90% of the participants in the New England Centenarian study were found to have been so.\nHormones are integral to our body function and have been studied for their potential pathways in longevity. Testosterone has been focused on, and lately a study of Korean eunuchs gave a higher rate of centenarians, 3 in 81 individuals. Due to the wide variability of the amount of testosterone produced by individuals, whether more or less testosterone exposure is beneficial or deleterious is unknown.\nWhat causes aging? This question is so important the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has devoted National Institute on Aging, the leading research institute on aging. A summary in more detail than I have gone into here is given on the NIH NIA’s site about preventing aging.\nIf we look at the cellular level, scientists discovered that complete copying of DNA is dictated by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase, which earned 3 scientists the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 2009. The unique DNA sequence in the telomeres protects chromosomes from degradation. When telomeres are shortened, cells age. Eventually, the telomeres will shorten, and cells will age and die. Unfortunately, extending telomeres or increasing the activity of telomerase enzyme does not help anti-aging, it contributes towards the growth of cancerous cells.\nA conversation with Dr. Mark D Johnson on twitter gave me these neat facts: Complete natural Homo sapiens LifeSpan = 120 years! All mammals except humans, bonobos, and chimpanzees, live six times their growth cycle. We grow within 20 years. That means natural mammal lifespan of 120.\nOverall, the contributing factors towards ageing and longevity are deemed to be complicated and there is no short-order anti-aging remedy.\nTurning more towards my own field of expertise, the Maillard Reaction, a chemical reaction that makes cooked food tasty, also turns 100. Obviously, the actual chemical reaction goes back longer than 100 years - to when amino acids began to react with sugars at elevated temperatures. However, the French chemist Louis-Camille Maillard first reported the nature of these reactions in 1912.5 Maillard chemistry not only describes the molecules in baked bread, grilled veggies, and brewing of beer, but also other molecules as products, so many that chemists did not study Maillard chemistry in detail until World War II. Nearly 60 years ago, African American chemist John E. Hodge reported a mechanism for the Maillard reaction6.\n|Hodge’s Flowchart of the Maillard Reaction|\nProducts of the Maillard reaction range from molecules that are both welcome and abhorrent. The usually enjoyed flavor and aroma of roasted coffee is a product of the Maillard reaction, as is the char on the surface of grilled food which is considered to be carcinogenic.\n|Roasted Coffee Beans, photo by Adrienne Roehrich|\n|Grilled Yams, photo by Adrienne Roehrich|\nDo you know someone or something that has reached the anniversary of 100 years on this earth?\n(1) Mecocci, P.; Polidori, M.

The number of centenarians is expected to rise to 3.5 million by 2050. People are living longer and many have a high quality of life in their later years. The exciting part about longevity is that only 25% of how long we live is dictated by our genes. The other 75% is determined by our lifestyle and daily choices. What are the lifestyles of people who live to be a ripe old age while enjoying a high quality of life?\nAuthor Dan Buettner, has studied the top five Blue Zones in the world. Blue Zones are regions of the world where people live much longer than the typical age and have a higher than average numbers of centenarians. In his book, “Blue Zones”, Dan examines the commonalities within these five regions that cause people to live active, fulfilling lives into their 90’s and 100’s.\nNINE AREAS TO ENHANCE LONGEVITY:\nDan Buettner suggests that these five blue zones have nine areas in common that increase people’s lifespan and quality of living. These nine blue zone secrets are:\nMOVE – Make moving and exercise a natural part of your lifestyle.\nLESS CALORIES – Watch out for mindless eating. You can cut calories by 20% if you stop eating before your stomach is full.\nEAT PLANTS – Slant your diet towards being plant dominant with at least 6 servings of vegetables per day and add nuts to your snacks.\nRED WINE – A daily glass or two of these grapes of life have polyphenols that are great for the heart.\nPURPOSE – This is why you wake up in the morning. When your life has meaning and you can see the big picture, you will be sharper, and live longer. Having purpose is shown to reduces stress, Alzheimer’s, depression, stroke, and even arthritis.\nDOWNSHIFT – Relieve your stress and slow down! Many centenarians keep a Sabbath (one full day each week to relax, worship, and enjoy life with zero work). Keeping a Sabbath, focuses on God, family, and nature, promoting a greater sense of wellbeing and reducing inflammation in the process. Stress causes inflammation and inflammation is responsible for many of our chronic diseases. When you can relax and slow down you will add years to your life.\nSPIRITUAL COMMUNITY – Have faith and belong to a spiritual community. Having a spiritual dimension in your life reduces depression, stress, and suicide. It also gives you a higher self-esteem, higher sense of worth and enhances your immune system.\nFAMILY – By making family a priority, not only are you part of a loving, supportive group of people, it will sharpen your mental and social skills which play a huge role in longevity.\nTRIBE – When you belong to the right tribe, you are surrounding yourself with people who share your Blue Zone values. It is true that we become like those we hang around. Be intentional that you share the same lifestyle and values of those in your tribe.\nTHE 5 BLUE ZONES AND THEIR LIFESTYLES:\n1. SARDINIA, ITALY\nSardinians eat a predominantly diet with a minimal amount of meat.\nThey drink healthy quantities of goat’s milk which protect against inflammation and inflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer’s and heart disease.\nSardinians put their family first. Every member of the family is cared for and the grandparents are very involved in daily life.\nThey walk 5 miles or more every day. This amount of walking has a great effect on cardiovasculatory fitness, muscle and bone strength, and metabolism.\nThey drink a glass or two of red wine daily. The local of wine of Sardinia is Cannonau, which has 2-3 times the flavonoids (artery scrubbers), as other wines.\nSardinians are known to laugh often with their friends. (Having a sardonic sense of humour originated here). Laughter reduces stress, which in turn can lower cardiovascular disease.\n2. OKINAWA, JAPAN\nOkinawans embrace their purpose in life and have a reason to get up in the morning. A dynamic part of their culture is having a vital life purpose is known as, “Ikigai.”\nTheir diet is predominantly plant-based. It includes a large quantity of the bitter vegetable, goya, which is high in anti-oxidants and very powerful in lowering blood sugar.\nGardening is a common practice there and has a threefold effect. Okinawans get their daily physical activity, reduce their stress, and consume plenty of fresh vegetables.\nMedicinal gardens are also very common there. Powerful herbs such as ginger, turmeric, and mugwort are a natural part of their diet.\nOkinawans eat more soy which has powerful flavonoids that help reduce cancer.\nThe social networks (or Moai) are very strong in Okinawa. This enhances emotional wellbeing, financial support, and lowers stress.\nThey enjoy the sunshine, therefore, obtain plenty of vitamin D which is great for strengthening bones and making healthier bodies.\nOkinawans stay active, including the traditional form of having meals on the floor. With this tradition, a person must get up and down many times of the day using important muscles for functional movements.\nTheir sunny disposition and healthy attitude in life are also thought to increase longevity.\n3. LOMA LINDA, CALIFORNIA\nThis Seventh Day Adventist community in California practices a 24-hour Sabbath day of rest. On their weekly day of rest, they focus on family, God, friendship, and nature. This practice allows them to relieve stress, strengthen social networks, and exercise.\nMost everyone in this community exercises at least moderately on a daily basis.\nThis community is rich in social and spiritual connections. People spend time with like-minded friends who are there for support and to build up of their faith.\nLoma Lindans also have a strong purpose and live to give something back.\nThe majority in the community maintain a healthy BMI (Body Mass Index).\nTheir diet is primarily plant-based, they drink plenty of water, they eat meat in moderation (mostly fish), and snack on nuts.\nIt is common in this community to eat an early, light dinner. One of their expressions is: “Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, dinner like a pauper.”\n4. NICOYA, COSTA RICA\nNicoyans have a strong sense of purpose and are focused on contributing to the greater good.\nThey drink great quantities of hard water which also known to have the country’s highest calcium content.\nFamily is a high cultural value. Centenarians live with their families where they receive support, purpose, and belonging.\nSocial Networks are very strong here and it is normal to drop in and visit neighbours.\nNicoyans eat a light dinner and have plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in their diets.\nEveryday chores and physical labour builds exercise into their lifestyle.\nIn Costa Rica there is plenty of sunshine which gives them natural Vitamin D.\n5. IKARIA, GREECE\nIkarians drink plenty of goat’s milk which has high amounts of calcium, potassium, and is excellent for maintaining healthy intestinal flora.\nThey live in the mountains and maintain their exercise by walking, and gardening.\nThey follow the Mediterranean diet which consists primarily of olive oil, vegetables, fruits, beans, potatoes, whole grains, and moderate amounts of meat.\nIkarians take Naps on a regular basis which lowers stress hormones and allows the heart to rest.\nThey drink plenty of herbal teas.\nFamily & friends are a huge priority in this culture.\nFasting occasionally is also a part of their culture because of their Greek Orthodox faith.']"	['<urn:uuid:2ad4a0cd-a21f-447e-b2d3-402954b90f38>', '<urn:uuid:dc207b67-4312-41a2-b500-e2001e5e9b4c>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	10	93	2289
77	Which handles larger crowds better - Jackal or GLEX 2017?	GLEX 2017 handled larger crowds, hosting over 1000 people from 51 countries, while Jackal is still being improved to handle bigger crowds and has only been tested in student center settings with smaller numbers of people.	"['From June 6 to 8, 2017, Global Space Exploration Conference (GLEX), jointly organized by International Astronautical Federation (IAF) and Chinese Society of Astronautics(CSA), was held in Beijing. The theme of this conference was ""Sharing and Cooperation"". More than one thousand (1000) people from over fifty-one (51) countries in the world, such as scientists, entrepreneurs, representatives of institutions and the like attended the conference for further discussion of space exploration. Mr. Weng Jingnong, Executive Director of the Centre and participants of the Centre were invited to attend it.\nIn a letter of congratulations sent to the conference by Chinese President Xi Jinping, he said that China wanted to enhance cooperation with the international community in peaceful space exploration and development. Xi noted that progress in space science and technology would benefit people around the world and China wanted to use space exploration achievements to create a better future for mankind.\nChinese Vice President Li Yuanchao attended the opening ceremony and delivered a congratulatory letter on behalf of President Xi Jinping. Mr. Li Yuanchao pointed out that the exploration of the vast universe is the tireless pursuit of our space dream. He hoped that different countries would jointly promote the development of aerospace innovation.\nChinese astronaut Wang Yaping talks with children and accepts their painting on outer space.\nMr. Li Yuanchao, Vice President of China, Mr. Jean-Yves Le Gall, Co-Chair of the GLEX, Chairman of IAF, Director of French Space Agency, Mr. Tang Dengjie, Director of China National Space Administration (CNSA), Mr. Jan Woerner, Director General of European Space Agency (ESA) started the Model of Ji Heng Fu Chen Yi Astronomical Instrument, signifying the beginning of the conference.\nOn the technical forum, two papers written by three participants of the Centre were accepted by the conference. Mr. PEDRO HENRIQUE DE OLIVEIRA NOGUEIRA and Mr. RENAN FELIPE OLIVEIRA gave a report based on their paper Micro-satellite\'s Energy Balance Analysis Based on Thermal-Electrical Modeling. Ms. NATALIA INDIRA VARGAS CUENTASTHE gave a report on her paper SALAR THE UYUNI AS A SIMULATED MARS BASE HABITAT IN SOUTH AMERICA.\nThis conference provided a very good platform for representatives from all over the world to exchange ideas, which is meaningful for sustainable use of space in the future.\nParticipates of the Centre who attended the conference were recommended by national space agencies of different countries. They are key talents for the promotion of space development. Let’s share some of their impressions on this conference.\nMr. RENAN FELIPE OLIVEIRA (Brazil):"" It was an honor to attend to this extremely important conference in space science and engineering. I had the opportunity to publish a paper and without the help of Beihang it wouldn\'t be possible to had this wonderful experience. The experience to face an audience and talk about my work results qualified me more for future challenges. In addition, the lectures gave me a great view of the international compromise and state-of-the-art technical developments. Furthermore, it was an great honor to have the opportunity to listen to the wise words of Buzz Aldrin, one of the first man to step on the moon.""\nMr.GONZALES VALLEJOS MICHAEL CARLOS (Bolivia):"" Glex was a great experience, seeing developing iniciatives from many countries, future projects to make the moon and mars achievable, and China taking the lead of space exploration was definetly something out of this world. I am more than interested in participate and support the space exploration from my career.""\nMr. ERDENEBADRAKH TSENDBAYAR (Mongolia): ""The experience of GLEX 2017 is enriching for every participants. The congress gives us the chance to cooperate and learn from other high levels and agencies. The GLEX 2017 provided young participants with a great network and opportunities. It means the congress is great way to meet people and make new cooperation.""\nMs. VARGAS CUENTAS NATALIA INDIRA (Bolivia): ""For me the experience of attend to the Global Space Exploration Conference (GLEX 2017), was quite rewarding, since I think that I have grown professionally, in the academic field and in the personal aspects, as I have been able to learn about the trending topics in space exploration and all the different initiatives and perspectives of different institutions to reach the Moon and Mars, or other destinations. For me as a young professional from Bolivia, who is an emerging country in the space theme, it has been very profitable to expose a personal research work and also to do networking to establish future cooperation and projects in my country.""', 'This is one in a series presenting news on technology and innovation, made possible with generous support from the Lemelson Foundation.\nAt a crowded student center, people toting backpacks hurry to class. Among them is a robot on wheels. It moves left to pass a column blocking its way. Then it veers right to make room for an oncoming group of people. Crowds are no problem for this robot, which obeys human social rules to get around.\nThe robot’s name is Jackal. It gets where it’s going at a brisk walking pace without bumping into anybody. Jackal can “plan paths around people in a way that makes them feel comfortable and makes our robot stay safe,” says Michael Everett. He’s part of a team of students who helped design the robot. Yu Fan Chen led the team. The students attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge.\nYou probably walk through crowds without thinking much about it. But robots are just starting to learn how to do this. “Navigating a crowd is a difficult thing to do,” says Everett. The people in a crowd move in many directions and at different speeds. A robot has to try to predict where these people will go, then plan its own path around them.\nA robot uses a set of rules called an algorithm to calculate how it should move. Sometimes, robots that are around lots of moving people get stuck. This is called the “freezing robot” problem. Their algorithms might find no way to move without bumping into someone.\nBut a robot that could make its way through a crowd without freezing would be very useful. For example, “I could send a robot to pick up a pizza and drive it back,” Everett says. Ford Motor Co. sponsored the MIT team’s research. Ford hopes to one day turn Jackal into a product it can sell. Such robots could help deliver packages. They might even be able to carry people who need help getting around.\nReady, set, go!\nChen and Everett thought they could help make this robotic assistant a reality. They decided to use a new computer-programming technique. Called deep learning, it lets an algorithm learn by practicing. For example, a deep-learning system might practice finding faces in photos by looking at millions of pictures where the faces have first been labeled. Later, it can find faces in photos it never saw before.\nComputer scientists used deep learning to write an algorithm called AlphaGo. It plays a board game called Go. Like chess, it’s a game of strategy. But the board is bigger and more complex. For computers, the game is far harder than chess. Yet in 2016, AlphaGo defeated the human world champion at Go. This was a major triumph for computer science.\nAnd the MIT students took notice.\nAlphaGo’s win “was an inspiration to us,” Everett recalls. “It gave us a lot of confidence.”\nWalking through a crowd obviously isn’t a board game. But one could think of it that way. “It’s like a game where you want to get to a certain place,” explains Everett. The player — here, the robot — has to get to its destination without freezing. And along the way it has to follow certain rules.\nThough we may not realize it, people follow many rules as they walk. These social customs are part of our culture. For example, in North America, folks tend to stay to the right side of a sidewalk or hallway. If they need to get around someone who’s slow or stopped, they tend to move to the left.\nWhen Everett’s team first started testing Jackal, the robot didn’t know these rules. Sometimes it moved strangely. People gave it funny looks, Everett recalls. So the students tweaked the algorithm. It calculated a score for each test trip based on how well the robot did at reaching its goal. But now, the robot lost points if it broke social rules.\nPractice makes perfect\nTo learn, Jackal had to practice — but not using a real hallway. The students set up a computer model. It was like a video game. Four simulated robots started at random points on a map. Each had to reach a separate goal while obeying social rules. The computer model ran through 3,000 practice scenarios over a period of about 9 hours.\nFinally, this algorithm was ready for show time.\nToday, Jackal can navigate a crowd without freezing. People no longer give the robot funny looks. They do, however, stop sometimes to take selfies with it. “We’ve seen [Jackal] go for over 20 minutes at a time,” says Everett. “We’re pretty proud of that.”\nChen’s team presented its research with Jackal in September at an International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems. The conference was held in Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada. Jackal’s team won best student paper at the meeting.\n“It’s definitely an interesting piece of work,” says Silvio Savarese. He’s a computer scientist at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif. His team is working on a very similar robot. Theirs is called Jackrabbot.\nBoth teams used deep learning to train their robots. But Savarese’s team didn’t define any social rules. Jackrabbot had to write its own. It does this using lots of data. To get those data, a drone flies over campus. Using the drone’s video, Savarese explains, “We look at people from the top.”\nStudents then review each frame of that video. Along the way, they identify people. They also pick out other moving objects, including bikes, skateboards and carts. Jackrabbot’s computer program then studies how each of these objects navigate situations, such as intersections, without colliding with each other. From those, it puts together a set of observed social rules. For example, it may note that when people are in a rush, they move quickly and turn suddenly.\n“Our robot can capture subtle rules,” says Savarese. But in teaching robots rules of the road — or the sidewalk — the best approach might be a combination of the methods used by each team. Some rules, like keeping to the right, are obvious enough to define. But recognizing people who are dawdling or rushing isn’t as simple. A robot might need to learn how to do this on its own.\nNeither team’s robot is ready to deliver pizzas yet. Jackal uses very expensive equipment to sense its environment. The MIT students hope to build a less costly version. They are also working to improve their algorithm to handle even bigger crowds.\nMeanwhile, Savarese’s team wants to add another level to Jackrabbot’s social skills. People communicate with each other as they move around. A person on a bike may lift a hand to indicate a turn. A person waiting to cross the street may smile and wave to say, “go ahead.” Robots need to learn to communicate in a similar way. “It’s important for humans to be able to predict what the robot’s going to do,” notes Savarese.\nAs robots get better at cruising through crowds, they’ll start to show up in more places. That means one may be come soon to a hallway or sidewalk near you — maybe even bearing pizza.\n(for more about Power Words, click here)\nalgorithm A group of rules or procedures for solving a problem in a series of steps.

78	What causes cancer and how can exercise prevent it?	Cancer is caused when cells in the body grow abnormally due to DNA mutations, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation. These cells can survive and form unnecessarily, potentially spreading to other body parts through blood or lymphatic system (metastasis). Regarding prevention through exercise, being active and maintaining a healthy body weight can reduce the risk of 13 different types of cancer. Experts recommend adults aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly, which can include activities like walking, swimming, dancing, or even housework and gardening.	"['We break out in a cold sweat upon hearing the word ‘Cancer’. This life-threatening disease has taken millions of lives over time and continues to haunt us we can never predict the occurrence of this deathly disease. ‘Cancer’ is not just one disease but it has a lot of cancers under the umbrella. How is cancer caused? Cancer on any part or organ is caused when the cells in the body grow abnormally. Our body has trillions of cells which have a process cycle to keep the body healthy and function properly. The cells grow, divide and die. This represents the life cycle of healthy cells. New cells are formed as the old ones die but when this process is disrupted due to DNA mutations, cells grow abnormally and cause cancer.\nDNA mutations can cause damaged cells to survive and unnecessary formation of new cells. This means extra cells in the body that trigger the uncontrolled growth of cells, also called tumors. These can form at any part of the body. The health problems and severity of the condition depends on the location of the tumor and its size. Malign tumors can also attack the neighboring organs causing severe damage. Some cancer cells spread to the other parts of the body through blood or lymphatic system and this process is called metastasis. Metastasized cancers are more dangerous and fatal.\nHowever, all tumors are not cancerous. Some tumors are benign which do not damage the nearby cells and tissues.\nSome Facts About Cancer\nThere are more than 100 types of cancer and any body part can get cancer.\nCancer is the second major cause of death in the USA, heart ailments being number one. 1 out of 4 people die due to cancer and the risk is higher in people aged above 40.\nAbout 1,600 American people died of cancer every day in the year 2013.\nBreast cancer and skin cancer are highly common in women.\nThe most common cancers among women are breast, skin, lung and colon while for men it is: prostate, lung and colon.\nTobacco consumption causes 22% of cancer death globally. Also, it is the only preventable cause.\nMore than 2.5 million cases of skin cancer are identified every year. Most of them can be prevented by taking the necessary skincare steps.\nUnexpectedly, the second major cause of death in children is cancer.\nHere are some factors that can put a person to the risk of cancer:\nPoor lifestyle, diet and hygiene habits\nExposure to carcinogens(chemicals that cause cancer)\nExposure to radiation\nDirect exposure to sunlight and UV rays\nSmoking and/or tobacco consumption\nSome viruses like HPV(human papillomavirus)\nCommon Signs and Symptoms Of Cancer\nThough the signs and symptoms of cancers differ as per their type, here are some common cancer warning signs:\nUnexplained Weight Loss: When the person experiences abrupt weight loss without any diet restriction or major lifestyle changes. Losing 10 pounds or more unreasonably could be the initial warning of stomach, pancreas and lung cancer.\nFever: This is a common health condition that we ignore. Due to cancer development, body temperature changes causing fever. Fever is one of the first signs of lymphomas and leukemia cancer.\nFatigue: Extreme tiredness on a regular basis indicates that something is not right with your body.\nPain: Some cancer such as breast and bone cancer causes pain which I due to the growth of tumors in the body. Generally, this occurs in the case of metastasized cancer.\nSkin changes: If your skin is turning pale or yellow, it could mean that you have a cancer cell growth.\nDigestive problems: Improper bowel movements, diarrhoea, constipation, etc. are common signs of colon cancer.\nOut of all the cancers, lung cancer is the most death-causing cancer type. The two types of lung cancer are:\nPrimary lung cancer: when the cancer cells grow in the lung itself\nSecondary lung cancer: when cancer originated at some place but traveled to the lungs (metastasis).\nThe treatment for both of them is different.\nThe major complication with lung cancer is that most patients don’t show symptoms initially or these signs might not be noticeable. Some possible symptoms are:\nIn most cases, the growth of lung cancer is rapid and it can also spread to other vital parts such as brain and bones.\nTreatment of lung cancer depends upon the stage of cancer, your medical stats, type of cancer tumor and its location. The common treatment options for lung cancer are chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy. Sadly, the survival rate of lung cancer patients is very low.\nBreast cancer is highly common in women where the cancer cells originate in the breasts on either the ducts or the lobules. Lobules are milk-producing glands and ducts are the passage that supplies milk from lobules to the nipple. In some cases, cancer also occurs in fibrous tissues and fatty tissues. Like lung cancer, breast cancer can also metastasize to other body parts.\nThe types of breast cancer are invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), Tubular Carcinoma, Mucinous (colloid) carcinoma, Carcinomas with medullary features and Invasive papillary carcinoma.\nEach breast cancer type has different symptoms but the common symptoms are:\nBlood cancer is caused due to abnormal functioning of blood cells. This cancer originates in the bone marrow as blood is produced there and are also called as hematologic cancer. Due to interruption in the functioning of blood, new blood cells are not formed and also, infection is caused.\nThere are three main types of blood cancer:\nLymphoma- There are two sub-categories of lymphoma cancer- Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This cancer originates in the lymphatic system and attacks lymphocytes which boosts immunity.\nLeukemia- this cancer occurs in the bone marrow and hampers its ability to produce platelets and RBCs. This cancer is triggered when there is an abnormality in the number of white blood cells.\nMyeloma- This blood cancer type originates in the plasma cells of the blood.\nAs the name suggests, this cancer originates in the ovary and is common in women as it is a female reproductive gland that produces female hormones. When the cells multiply abnormally in the ovary and form a cancerous tumor. Ovarian cancer is treatable if diagnosed on time. Also, it is metastatic cancer which can spread to other body parts. Due to vague symptoms, only 20% of cases are identified at the initial stage.\nThere are three types of ovarian tumors:\nEpithelial: Most of the ovarian cancers are caused due to epithelial tumors.\nStromal tumors: This cancer occurs in the hormone-producing cells.\nGerm cell: This is rare cancer that originates in the egg-producing cells.\nThe early symptoms of ovarian cancer are vague and therefore, it gets difficult to diagnose it beforehand. Here are some common signs:\nProstate cancer is a type of cancer that originates in the prostate gland and is responsible to transport sperm. This cancer occurs only in men and generally, its growth is very slow. In some cases, prostate cancer doesn’t require any treatment as it slows slowly whereas, sometimes it gets aggressive and spread rapidly. The treatment becomes easier with early detection but the signs and symptoms are vague in the first stage.\nSometimes, patients of prostate cancer suffer from these symptoms:\nThe risk of skin cancer is high in people whose skin is exposed to the sun and harmful UV rays for most of the time. However, skin cancer can also grow in the skin areas that are least exposed as a result of metastasis. In this cancer, the skin cells suffer abnormal growth which then forms a tumor.\nThe common types of skin cancer are Melanoma, Basal cell carcinoma, Squamous cell carcinoma, and Nonmelanoma skin cancer.\nThe less common types are Kaposi sarcoma, Sebaceous gland carcinoma and Merkel cell carcinoma.\nEvery skin cancer type shows different signs and symptoms. Here are the common signs that you should watch out for:\nWhen malignant tumors grow in the brain, it causes brain cancer. This cancer may either form in the brain or may come metastasized from other parts of the body. But all tumors are not cancerous, it depends. When cancer cells come in contact with healthy cells, they turn them cancerous. The grades of brain cancer decide the aggressiveness of cancer and treatment.\nOften vary but the common brain cancer symptoms are:\nBone cancer is caused in any bone of the body but mostly, it affects the long bones of legs and arms and the pelvis. Out of all the cancers, only 1% of cases are of bone cancer making it rare. Surprisingly, non-cancerous tumors in the bone are highly common as compared to cancerous tumors.\nThere are three types of bone cancer- Ewing sarcoma, Chondrosarcoma and Osteosarcoma.\nSome types of bone tumors occur only in children whereas some affect only adults. The treatment of bone cancer is done by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Surgery is the go-to bone cancer treatment although the treatment depends on the kind of bone cancer.\nThe common signs and symptoms of bone cancer are:\nRadiation therapy: If you have undergone cancer treatment earlier, then you may also get bone cancer. Radiation therapy often causes the risk of bone cancer in the nearby future.\nBone disease: A disease like Paget’s disease which occurs in adults puts the person to a risk of bone risk in later life.\nThe alternative treatments are acupuncture, yoga, massage, hypnosis, meditation, relaxation techniques, etc. Doctors suggest practicing these along with other treatments for the best results.', ""What are the best ways to prevent cancer?\n04th Feb, 2019\nCancer is the second highest leading cause of death worldwide. It seems it’s everywhere you look, and with one in five men and one in six women developing the disease, it’s no wonder.\nHowever, steps can be made to prevent cancer. A key example is that 27% of all cancers relate to tobacco and alcohol use - no more than 10% of diagnoses come from genetic mutations.\nWhat is cancer?\nCancer occurs when a body’s cell or cells become abnormal. This abnormal cell will then divide and make more abnormal cells. These cells can evolve, mutate and weaken the immune system, which is why it is unlikely, if not impossible to create one treatment that cures all cancers.\nThe theme for World Cancer Day 2019 (and the next three years) is ‘I am and I Will’ - a call to action asking people, whether they’re a cancer survivor, healthcare worker or business leader, to make a personal commitment to help reduce the impact of cancer.\nFor those who don’t work in oncology or care for cancer patients, the greatest physical step you can take in cancer prevention is caring for yourself! Experts estimate that lifestyle changes could stop roughly 40% of all cancer cases.\nHere’s how you can do just that…\nHow to prevent cancer\nWe all love having a summer glow, but for skin cancer prevention, it’s crucial you know how to enjoy the sun safely.\nStay safe in the sun by:\n- Using a minimum of SPF15 with a rating of at least four stars - remembering to re-apply regularly, especially if you’re going in and out of water\n- Covering up and wearing sunglasses\n- Giving your skin breaks and spending time in the shade (as much as you can)\nDiet and foods that prevent cancer\nWhat you put into your body can have a massive impact on reducing your cancer risk. It helps you maintain a healthy weight and care for your internal organs, preventing their chance of becoming diseased.\nThe best foods to eat to prevent cancer include pulses, wholegrain foods, fruits and vegetables - essentially foods containing fibre.\nProcessed and red meats can increase the risk of bowel cancer, so it is best to keep these to a minimum within your diet.\nExercise goes hand in hand with diet, as keeping a healthy body weight can really lower your cancer risk. In fact, being active and maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the risk of 13 different types of cancer.\nWhat counts as being active?\nExperts recommend that adults aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week – this could be walking, swimming, dancing or even doing housework and gardening!\nAlcohol can cause seven different types of cancer so cutting down is another way of preventing your risk. All forms of alcohol are equally as hazardous because it is alcohol itself that causes harm. Ultimately, the less you drink, the better your chances of remaining cancer-free.\nSmoking is the world’s leading cause of cancer. According to Cancer Research UK, it forms at least 15 different types! It’s responsible for seven in ten of the UK’s lung cancer cases and is the most common cause of death by the disease.\nWhat else can you do as a healthcare professional?\nThe Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), the leaders of World Cancer Day, asks that healthcare professionals learn the signs and symptoms of cancer to avoid misdiagnosis, and understand, as well as encourage, the value of early detection in their patients.\nSend your CV straight to the right person\nWho is the best nursing agency to work for?\n22 January 2020\nLooking to join a nursing recruitment agency?

80	earth tilt daylight hours seasons correlation explain	Earth's 23.5-degree tilt on its axis, combined with its orbit around the Sun, causes seasonal changes. When the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, it experiences summer with longer days, while the southern hemisphere has winter. The opposite occurs when the northern hemisphere tilts away from the Sun. During equinoxes (spring and fall), day and night are nearly equal at about 12 hours each. Solstices mark the longest and shortest days - the summer solstice has maximum daylight hours, while the winter solstice has the longest night. Areas near the Equator maintain more consistent temperatures year-round since they don't tilt much toward or away from the Sun.	['Seasons Background Information for Teachers and Parents\nThis page contains information to support educators and families in teaching K-3 students about the seasons.The information is designed to complement the BrainPOP Jr. movie Seasons. It explains the type of content covered in the movie, provides ideas for how teachers and parents can develop related understandings, and suggests how other BrainPOP Jr. resources can be used to scaffold and extend student learning.\nIn this movie, children will learn about different seasons and different types of weather. They’ll learn how Earth is tilted on its axis, and how as our planet orbits the Sun, seasons change in different parts of the world!\nReview with children that we divide the year into seasons, or sets of consecutive months that have similar weather patterns and length of days. There are four seasons in many parts of the world: winter, spring, summer, and fall (also called autumn). Other parts of the world have two seasons: wet and dry. Children should observe that seasons happen in the same cycles year after year and that different types of weather occur during different seasons.\nWhich is the coldest season? Which is the hottest? Children should know that temperature is how hot or cold something is, and this can be measured with a thermometer. Though temperatures and amount of precipitation varies across different areas, winter typically has lower temperatures than the rest of the year. Snow, sleet, hail, and rain are common forms of precipitation in the winter. In snowy areas, many animals have difficulties finding food and some will even hibernate to conserve energy. Children can learn more about hibernation by watching the Hibernation movie. December, January, and February are considered winter months in the northern hemisphere, though some countries acknowledge November to be a part of winter. Children should understand that during winter they may wear heavier clothing like coats, hats, and scarves and participate in cold-weather activities such as sledding or skiing.\nAs the winter ends, spring begins and temperatures slowly rise as the days get longer. Snow and ice melt and more rain tends to fall during this season. Flowers and plants grow and bloom, and animals become active again. Many animals will have their young in the spring when food is plentiful. Furthermore, their young will have time to grow before experiencing a cold winter themselves. The United States marks the beginning of spring with the vernal equinox in March and the end of spring with the summer solstice in June. Children should understand that in spring they may wear lighter coats and rain gear, and also begin outdoor activities like baseball, softball, or gardening.\nAfter spring is summer, which begins in June and ends around September in the United States. Summer is the warmest season and has the longest days, because our part of Earth is tilted toward the Sun throughout the season. Most areas receive the least amount of precipitation during this season. Children should understand that in summer they may wear shorts, skirts, shirts, hats, and sunglasses and go swimming or take a vacation. The Sun stays high in the sky during the summer and children should understand the importance of using sunscreen and staying covered and cool.\nAs the summer ends, the weather gets cooler again and the days get shorter. In the northern hemisphere, fall (or autumn) begins in September and ends in December with the Winter Solstice. During fall, leaves of some trees will turn colors and fall off. Some plants bear fruit, such as apple and pear trees. Autumn squash or gourds ripen, too, which is why pumpkins are abundant at Halloween. Some animals will begin to migrate, or move to warmer areas for the coming winter. You may want to watch the Migration movie for further exploration and extension of the topic. Other animals will store and eat food to prepare for hibernation or dormancy. Football is a common fall sport in many schools and community programs, and other fall activities include apple-picking or collecting autumn leaves. Children should understand that in fall they may wear coats and sweaters.\nSeasons change because as the Earth orbits, its hemispheres are titled towards or away from the Sun. It takes Earth 365 days, or one year, to go around the Sun. When the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, the southern hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun. During this time, the northern hemisphere experiences summer, while the southern hemisphere experiences winter. The areas near the Equator, the imaginary line around the middle of the Earth that separates the two hemispheres, do not tilt much toward or away from the Sun. This means their weather is more consistent throughout the year, and usually is quite warm. Tropical countries in South America such as Ecuador, Colombia, and Brazil, are good examples of areas that do not vary much in temperature during the year.\nBecause of the Earth’s tilt and orbit around the Sun, different constellations can be seen during different seasons. While people living in the northern hemisphere might see a particular constellation in the summer, people living in the southern hemisphere might see the same constellation in the winter.\nFor children who want to learn more information about the seasons, we recommend watching other movies in the Weather unit.', 'September in the Northern Hempisphere brings back-to-school time, the last poolside splashes, and the first falling leaves as autumn slowly creeps in. This year, the autumnal equinox arrives September 23, 2023, signifying the official end of summer and the slow transition to cooler, shorter days. But unlike the summer and winter solstices that occur three months before and after fall, the autumnal equinox marks a different moment in Earth’s journey around the sun. Here’s what happens during the autumnal equinox.\nHow Earth’s Seasons Change\nThe Northern Hemisphere begins its slow descent from summer’s heat to winter’s chill in mid-September thanks to two planetary features: Earth’s oblong orbit around the sun and its tilted axis. The planet spins at a 23.5-degree angle, not directly on the northern and southern poles the way it appears to us on maps. Combined with its annual rotation around the sun, Earth’s tilted poles allow one hemisphere to receive more sunlight than the other for half the year.\nThose shifts toward and away from the sun lead the separate hemispheres to experience different weather; without the shifts, there’d be no major seasonal changes on any part of the planet. The Northern Hemisphere experiences cooler temperatures and winter when Earth’s northern pole is angled away from the sun, while at the same time, the Southern Hemisphere gets more sunlight and moves toward summer. But the angles don’t change quickly; it takes months for the hemispheres to trade spots, which allows seasons to gradually wax and wane.\nThe Difference Between a Solstice and an Equinox\nSolstices and equinoxes mark different points along Earth’s route around the sun and the transition from more to less sunlight. As one of the poles gets closer to the sun, the amount of daylight hours grows until reaching its maximum — in the Northern Hempisphere, we call this the summer solstice or the longest day of the year. Half a year later, when the northern pole is angled its furthest from the sun, the Northern Hemisphere experiences the day with the longest hours of night, also called the winter solstice.\nSpring and fall are transitions between these two extremes, and with them come equinoxes. Meaning “equal night” in Latin, equinoxes mark the time when day and night are nearly the same length of time (approximately 12 hours of sunlight and 12 of darkness). That’s because following the summer solstice, days become slowly shorter and nights gradually longer until the winter solstice arrives. After the winter solstice, daylight hours increase, becoming momentarily equal with hours of night when the vernal (spring) equinox arrives in March.\nLike solstices, equinoxes last only a day and are calculated down to the minute, though they aren’t perfectly equal — in some regions there’s a small, 10-minute difference based on how the sun’s rays reach Earth’s atmosphere. This year, the autumnal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere occurs at 3:20 p.m. ET on September 22.\nWhen Does Autumn Really Begin?\nWhile most calendars mark mid-September as the beginning of autumn, you may have heard that fall begins a few weeks earlier. How is it possible to have two first days of fall? There are actually two commonly used calendars for determining seasonal changes: astrological and meteorological.\nAstrological seasons are based on Earth’s tilt, transitioning throughout the year based on the equinoxes and solstices. But meteorological seasons align with the Gregorian calendar, syncing the start and end dates with set three-month spans of time. Meteorological calendars break down the year into four distinct seasons with a nearly equal number of days. Instead of determining seasons by the number of daylight and nighttime hours, meteorological seasons are based on historical temperature records and weather patterns. Because seasons are determined by date (and don’t fluctuate in number of days like astrological seasons), scientists and researchers can more easily compile data about weather changes and trends.\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, meteorological autumn begins September 1 and ends November 30 each year. But if you’re looking to knock out a lengthy autumnal bucket list with apple picking, seasonal drinks, and leaf peeping, you’re free to keep honoring fall for a few additional weeks, since astronomical winter won’t begin until December 21, 2021.\nPopular Equinox Myths, Debunked\nWhile most modern cultures give little thought to the autumnal equinox, societies of the past noted the first day of fall during harvest season preparations. Over time, some unattributed equinox lore has stuck around from centuries past — the most common tall tale says it’s possible to balance a raw egg on end only during the equinox. Fortunately for party tricksters, this myth has been disproven by scientists who note that the planet’s position and hours of sunlight have no impact on gravity. So long as you have a steady hand, it’s possible to balance an egg any day of the year.\nAnd that myth about your shadow disappearing entirely during the equinox? It’s mostly untrue, unless you live within the Tropic of Cancer, close to the equator. Because of Earth’s axis tilt, sunlight always hits us at an angle, creating a shadow. But during the equinox, those who live within this zone can be momentarily shadowless at precisely noon, when the sun is directly overhead and casts shadows directly downward. The phenomenon lasts only minutes and isn’t possible anywhere else — a momentary treat to honor Earth’s journey around the sun.\nFeatured image credit: Simotion/ iStock']	['<urn:uuid:ed020031-7cf5-4a53-a728-3af3d151c541>', '<urn:uuid:c0f9f131-d234-4016-a079-5fb4b3d082fd>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	7	108	1779
81	vehicle parts where can sensor screws be installed applications examples	The sensor screws can be installed at different points in vehicles. Specific examples of application areas include belt buckles, trailer hitches, and particularly in the area of the vehicle's gearbox and engine. The system is designed to be robust and can withstand dust and splash water, making it suitable for these challenging environments. It's also designed to be stable across different temperatures from winter to summer operation.	['Wireless Sensor in a Screw Head Harvests its Own Energy Jun 29 2017 Electroblog Print Article Jun 29 2017 Electroblog A wireless sensor system in a screw head, developed by the Technische Universität Chemnitz and IK Elektronik, is powered by kinetic energy harvesting from vibration in commercial vehicles, writes Andreas Mangler, Head of Strategic Marketing at Rutronik. This research and development project centres on a wireless sensor system integrated into a screw. The system measures and processes sensor signals and sends them to a measurement data processing system. The electronic system in the screw functions without a battery. It converts kinetic energy from vibrations at the fixing element into electrical energy and uses this energy for sensor signal conditioning and processing. The sensor cannot be distinguished externally from a standard screw. Figure 1. The sensor screw system developed by Technische Universität Chemnitz and IK Elektronik. Areas of deployment with robust design The most important application scenario is using the screw in vehicles at different installation points. Examples for system application are belt buckles, trailer hitches, and particularly sensors in the area of the vehicle’s gearbox and engine. Dust and splash water must not have any effects on the screw itself; deployment in a robust environment must be possible. The housing must be hermetically sealed to the greatest possible extent. Moreover, in view of the different potential ambient temperatures resulting from winter/summer operation and deployment in different geographical vehicle widths, the system must be stable and independent of temperature influences, particularly regarding the material stretching. The system needs to be as small as possible due to the limited space. Development challenges Vibrations in vehicles arise with different amplitudes and frequencies. Energy converters thus generate alternating voltages with different amplitude and frequency. Particularly when it comes to only very small vibration amplitudes, very small alternating voltages arise. Standard rectifiers are able to rectify very small voltages, but not without large losses. The required boost converters must exhibit a high degree of effectiveness and stellar starting behavior. Energy converters and energy management need to be optimized for certain vibration frequency ranges. Additionally, the mechanical specifications and the use in a metallic environment posed great challenges in the development of the energy converter. The challenge for IK Elektronik in developing the electronics was to obtain a usable direct voltage with highest possible effectiveness from the lowest alternating voltages, and to store the energy in an appropriate manner. Depending on the amount of stored energy, connected electronics may be operated for longer or shorter periods. The most applied methods of energy generation using vibrations are based on electrodynamic, piezoelectric, electrostatic, or electromagnetic principles. An electrodynamic energy converter, comprising a cylindrical magnet and a surrounding solenoid, is a good choice to be used in a screw. This is because such a converter achieves a large increase in resonance when the system is set up appropriately. The conversion of ambient vibrations into electrical energy is based on the relative movement between magnet and solenoid according to Faraday’s law. Literature on this subject contains various types of electrodynamic energy production, which can be sub-divided according to the mechanical structure of the spring-mass system: use of bending beams, magnetic springs, or spiral springs. Mechanical and electrical structure IK Elektronik developed the prototype of an assembly housed in the head of a screw. This contains the rectifiers and voltage multipliers, storage capacitors and energy management wiring, microcontrollers with sensor application (contact sensor, temperature sensor, and pressure sensor), radio transceiver, and antenna. Figure 2. Arrangement of the electronics in the sensor screw in various configurations (source: IK Elektronik GmbH) Various applications can be mooted thanks to the combination with the TU Chemnitz electrodynamic energy converter in a screw. Functionality can be optimised based on the vibration energy available in the respective target environment. Various investigation concepts Various solutions were investigated regarding the structure of the energy converter. Two concepts were proposed regarding applying the magnetic spring principle. The solution developed by the Professorship of Electrical Measurements and Sensor Technology (MST) at TU Chemnitz uses a moving magnet between two permanently fixed magnets to generate a variable magnetic field depending on the ambient vibrations. The solenoid and its connections are fixed in this structure, meaning that greater reliability is attained when the energy is converted. Figure 3. Example of a mechanical structure for an energy converter with the fixed and moving elements The converter’s energy yield is chiefly dependent on the magnet size and the magnetic field strength, number, and quantity of solenoid winds, as well as the excitation frequency and amplitude, irrespective of the configuration in use, i.e. a moving magnet or moving solenoid. For the energy converter design, the FEM analysis (finite element method) was used and can be adjusted to different kinetic profiles and sizes. Figure 4. Finite element analysis regarding the energy converter’s magnetic field distribution in the sensor system Test series with the energy converter TU Chemnitz created two prototypes for using a moving magnet; the open circuit voltage for the systems was measured. The applied test structure consists of a vibration shaker as a synthetic external vibration source, monitored by a laser sensor, measuring the deflection in use and frequency stimulation. The vibration shaker is operated in a closed control circuit together with a laser sensor, a controller, and an amplifier; the vibration amplitude can be controlled with this control circuit. The trials have been carried out for a vibration amplitude of 0.5 mm, 1 mm, and 2 mm in a frequency range of 5 to 30 Hz (see figure 5). The resonance frequency of the intended structure is in the range 25-30 Hz, depending on the solenoid and excitation amplitude in use. By applying the magnetic spring principle, the resonance frequency can also be set to other values relatively simply. As the measurement values show, open circuit peak voltages of over 500 mV were achieved. Figure 5. Open circuit output voltage for the developed magnetic spring energy converter (a) for excitation amplitudes of 1 mm and 2 mm with a wire diameter of 0.2 mm. (b) for excitation amplitudes of 0.5 mm, 1 mm, and 2 mm with a wire diameter of 0.09 mm.

82	correct technique maintaining weight distribution during classical rond de jambe movement	In classical rond de jambe, the weight should be centered, with the weight placed over the arch. The center of the pelvis should be positioned above the arch, with slight pressure in the ball of the foot.	['Notes on Rond De Jambes (a terre)\n“Round of the leg on the ground”\nposter available here in 3 sizes. (click here)\nEeesh. This is one of the hardest steps at barre in ballet. The exercise requires a ton of control and focus. In theory, this step should be really easy and a lot of people overlook how complicated rond de jambe is. Somewhere in between adagio qualities and stretching, rond de jambes are one of those things that you either have or you don’t.\nRond de jambes are versatile, you can do them en l’air, in a jump, on relevé, done en dehors or en dedans or even in fondu/plié. The list goes on. It can be done at varied heights, at varied speeds, or varied accents. Like most steps in ballet, you can do them any way you want.\nSo, let’s get to breaking down rond de jambe.\nen dehors:It is easier to learn rond de jambes from first. Standing very tall, you press through to tendu devant. Both legs are extremely straight without gripping the quad, and you need to focus on the inner hip socket. From this position, you hold the turnout and push to the side without changing the shape of the leg. Without gripping the quad you rotate the hip socket rotates even more and you continue the semi-circle to get to tendu devant. Nothing moves. I MEAN NOTHING! You keep the shape of the leg the entire time, the turn out, the shape, everything. Closing through the tendu and relaxing the toes, the heel gradually pushes forward and closes back to first. The important thing in rond de jambe is to keep the turn out active at all times. (Reality… you are supposed to keep your turn out active at all times but sometimes you just need to relax. Relax in first position if you need to relax.)\na. Standing in first position. If you need to get some tips on improving your first position. Click here >> (https://aballeteducation.com/2016/03/25/first-position-it-is-so-hard/)\nb. Just like a tendu start pressing the heel forward and pushing through the floor. Because barre is built one step on top of the other, don’t miss out the notes on tendu. Click here >>(https://aballeteducation.com/2016/03/26/notes-on-tendu-well-tendu-devant/)\nc. Reaching the maximum length of tendu devant, you have to extend even more in rond de jambe. You want to create enough length in the working leg to free up the hip socket. To do this, you have to push through your standing leg, or channel energy down into the floor on your supporting side.\nd. This is the hardest part of rond de jambe… You have to start rotating the heel even more, and channel energy up into the hip sock and start to rotate the femur head in the socket outward. Don’t change the shape of the foot or leg, don’t relax the knee. Grow taller and start to carry to the side. You should feel a ton of tension pressing outwards in the supporting hip.\ne. Keep carrying till you hit tendu a la seconde. A very long a la seconde. Keep lifting in the supporting side.\nf. The next hardest part of rond de jambe is ridiculously hard. This is where a lot of people go a muck. Stabilize the hips by rotating outwards and channeling energy into the floor and start to rotate towards the back. Do not flip the hips or let the pelvis rock. Don’t sway in your back, don’t sit in your hips, don’t let your weight shift. You have to be even more mindful of your supporting leg. All while making the circle even larger.\ng. Reach to tendu derriere\nh. Relax your toes and press the heel forward leaving the toes behind.\ni. Pull up harder into your standing leg and hip flexor. Lift even higher. The energy should never die in rond de jambe. You have to constantly grow and channel energy through each extremity of the body. As your relax your full foot on the floor your turn out should feel the deepest in the hip socket.\nj. Reach back into a taller first.\nOkay, here are some of the ridiculously hard things about rond de jambe… One, your body has to create tons of infinite circles that move through your space at barre. It is rather difficult, each time trying to make the circle bigger and bigger. Keeping the pelvis neutral and legs long. The best way is to keep your hamstrings constantly engaged without gripping into your quads and locking up your hip flexors. Another really difficult thing to do in rond de jambe is to keep the foot relaxed and not gripping.\nRond de Jambes for the young child…\nIt is a common imagery tool to teach kids to draw a half circle on the floor. The problem with this, is that kids will usually push most of the work and effort into the quad. I find it better to tell kids to make an egg-like shape with the foot. This keeps from adding too much pressure in the knee, and not letting the student grip in the quad.\nRond de Jambe for the adult dancer…\nNowadays, rond de jambe kills my hip. Like to the point of exhaustion. It is easier to work from a more turned in first than perfect first, and definitely in fifth position, it puts too much pressure to the knee… For me. I also find when being in a more turned in fifth position, I use my quad too much, so I rond de jambe from first. Less pressure all over, and my legs don’t die and I don’t grip in my quad.\nWhere in the world do you put your weight in rond de jambe… Classically speaking, rond de jambe should always be centered… meaning the weight is centered in your pelvis and the weight is placed over the arch. Some teachers allow weight to shift into the standing leg even more so that the hamstrings are longer. The weight then shifts so the center of the pelvis is above the arch and there is slight pressure in the ball of the foot. This frees up the working hip. The standing hip and leg then channels more energy.\nThe stylistic rond de jambe… Some teachers teach to over cross the rond de jambe in tendu devant and derriere (over crossing meaning that the toe of the working foot lines up to the heel or arch. Some teachers, teach a more open rond de jambe that pushes the focus on the in between positions. Like half tendu front and half tendu back. Some teachers teach an exaggerated over crossing where the working toe lines up with the supporting toe. This definitely causes a weight shift.\nSome final thoughts on rond de jambe…\nRond de jambe is hard, but don’t give up! The most important thing in rond de jambe is to open the hips and really create a connection through the space and floor. I always enjoy rond de jambe, and try to find really great musicality. Some teachers prefer accent front and back, some prefer accent side, and some prefer no accent and to keep the motion evenly. Depending on the song and the musicality and tempo, I accent in various places including first. Best of luck rond de jamming out… hahah']	['<urn:uuid:902166f2-3cf4-4d70-8967-3f2f75fdc454>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	11	37	1227
83	In my studies of post-war Japan, I've noticed significant changes in how history is taught. What shifts have occurred in Japanese history textbooks' treatment of World War II in recent decades?	While the Japanese government had acknowledged certain controversial World War II actions in textbooks during the 1980s and early 1990s, there was a significant shift to the right in textbook policy around 1994-95. In recent editions of some history textbooks, the government has denied Japanese responsibility for World War II and restored nationalist content. This change in textbook policy has been accompanied by other nationalist measures, such as mandatory singing of the national anthem 'Kimigayo' praising the emperor and the required display of the Hinomaru flag at school events.	"['Resurgence of the Right and Japan\'s World War II Accountability\nby Chung Chinsung\nAt major intersections throughout Japan one can see the rightist groups with patriotic banners across their chests. They use relentless microphone-amplified diatribes to drive home their message as they stand atop their black vans. Their posters declaring ""Worried about the Nation"" has become a fixture of the Japanese urban landscape. After the Second World War such figures were considered comical. They seemed but hot-blooded nationalists; marginal crackpots far from the norm and with minimal influence. But before we knew it, the vague sense that perhaps their ravings contained a kernel of truth spread through Japanese society. Ironically, the far right has gained considerable power in Japanese society by insistently holding up the ideal of protecting the imperial system at the very time that civil society has achieved remarkable maturity in Asian nations.\nModernization was carried out under the auspices of the Japanese government in tandem with the war preparations so central to pre-war militarism. The trend throughout the world between 1910 and 1930 was towards socialism and labor activism. Yet such movements were ruthlessly suppressed by the government in Japan. Along the way, the rightist movement that had emerged within civil society was absorbed directly into the government.\nAfter the Second World War, democratic reforms implemented during the occupation led to the revival of the left. After a brief period of reform in the immediate post-war period, the previously progressive political course went into reverse. The outbreak of the Korean War and the ensuing conservative mood offered the opportunity for the right to retake the stage. Although the rightists came back to life, they often lacked credibility. Like many Japanese social movements, their ideological and intellectual foundation was weak.\nSocial activists and the student movement were transformed into the political presence known as the New Left after the Liberal Democratic Party came to power in 1955. Japan was swept by a wave of social action in the sixties and seventies. Notable among them were the citizen\'s movement, the anti-Vietnam war protest movement, the Women\'s Liberation Movement, and others. Yet they soon faded from prominence, proving how short-lived citizen\'s movements can be. Civil society in post-war Japan developed on the two legs of economic growth and political stability. In recent years the central movements that have emerged are concerned primarily with the pursuit of quality of life. Such powerful groups as the food cooperative movement, consumer organizations and the pre-school education movement are distinctive in their ability to draw members from both the left and the right. These movements promote an improved and healthier life and consequently have a broad appeal. Consequently, the discourse of civil society in Japan has lost its ideological and theoretical dimension.\nThis situation started to shift again in the early 1990s when a series of international controversies rocked Japan. Korea led the nations of East Asia victimized by Japan during World War II, demanding recognition of, and settlement for, Japan\'s historical crimes. For example, the campaign to receive apology and reparations for the enslavement of Koreans as military comfort women grew into a Pan-Asian movement. Japan\'s ethical standing was seriously shaken by these charges and the climate at home rapidly became more supportive of domestic social movements. Progressive political movements that had just managed to scrape by as small-scale study groups before now teamed up with activist citizens\' groups from other Asian nations. They demanded a full accounting of Japan\'s wartime responsibility. The social engagement thus generated was unique for post-war Japanese society in that women\'s groups, organizations of ethnic Koreans, peace groups, intellectuals and lawyers all joined in the campaign. They were tied together by a common thread: criticism of the imperial system.\nConservative groups launched a determined counter attack. With vast resources at their disposal, the rightists were able to bring together politicians, intellectuals and youths for their purposes. These neo-nationalist groups held that Japan was fully justified in its actions during the war. The right denigrated the citizens\' groups and victims who came forth from other nations in East Asia and branded as treasonous the statements of domestic critics. Japanese political discourse lurched to the right. Although a healthy Japanese society had developed in the post-war period, ultimately, the lack of ideological foundations for the new order made possible the resurgence of the right.\nIn the early nineties the forces of the left and right counterbalanced each other in Japanese society. Recently, the balance has tipped increasingly in favor of the right. The rightists sharpened their rhetorical weapons in battles to suppress the demands made by former comfort women. Rightists also demonstrated their prowess in the battle over history textbooks. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Japanese government had acknowledged certain controversial actions in World War II. Revisions appeared in government-approved history textbooks. In 1994-95, however, textbook policy took a turn to the right.\nThe government has denied Japanese responsibility for the Second World War in recent editions of some history textbooks and restored nationalist content. In addition, the obligatory singing of the newly approved national anthem ""Kimigayo"" in praise of the emperor, and raising the Hinomaru flag are required by law and rigorously enforced in formal events at many schools. A string of new laws, starting with the Emergency Security Law, has been implemented and serious debate concerning revision of Japan\'s Peace Constitution has ensued. As a result, rightist social movements have spread their wings and flown to every corner of the country. They carry out campaigns such as the demand for the revision of history textbooks and violently attack Japan\'s tradition of peaceful engagement with the world. Starting with the prime minister, a long line of officials now pays public visits to the Shinto holy place Yasukuni Shrine. The leaders and martyrs associated with Japan\'s conquest of Asia during the Pacific War are interred and honored there. Adjacent to the Yasukuni Shrine is the Yushukan Hall, a museum featuring exhibitions for the education of Japanese visitors about the ""glorious Japanese race"" and the new educational system.\nAt the same time, many citizens\' groups that demand accountability for Japan\'s wartime actions have turned their backs on issues such as the punishment of those responsible for the crimes of World War II and the legitimacy of the imperial system. Participants in citizens\' movements nowadays are often passive figures who have given up hope of successfully combating the rightists, but continue to find a certain personal meaning in ethical activity.\nThe long-term stagnation of the Japanese economy has nourished a mentality receptive to the arguments offered by the rightists since the 1990s. Japan has witnessed the demise of its legendary system of life-time employment. Foreign workers have entered Japan in growing numbers. The social disruptions resulting from such cataclysmic changes have proven difficult for most Japanese to absorb. At the same time, neighboring China is aiming the heavy cannons of diplomatic warfare at Japan over unresolved historical issues. The regional configuration of East Asia today demands a new role of Japan. Political conservatism and economic development can no longer simply work hand and hand without friction. Similarly, social movements in Japan cannot remain secondary activities subordinate to larger political priorities.\nIt is not immediately obvious whether the groups that once took such pride in their power such as the food cooperative movement or volunteer organizations will recognize their complicity in the swing to the right, or whether it is possible to have critical intellectuals in Japan.\nThis article appeared in Hankuk Ilbo on May 3, 2004.

84	What are the major environmental risk factors for dogs during hot weather, and what preventive measures should be taken to create safe spaces both indoors and outdoors?	Major environmental risks include direct sunlight exposure, hot surfaces like asphalt and concrete that can burn paw pads, and parked vehicles where temperatures can rise 40 degrees above ambient temperature within minutes. Old dogs are particularly vulnerable as they find it harder to maintain body temperature as they age. To create safe spaces, establish a 'heat-free zone' in basements, garages, or under shady trees where temperature is lower than outside. Ensure multiple sources of cool, fresh drinking water are available and regularly checked. Keep pets indoors during excessive heat, and if outdoors, provide kiddie pools or misting hoses. Exercise should be limited and scheduled for early morning or late evening. Never leave pets in parked vehicles, even with windows cracked, as temperatures can become lethal quickly, especially on days over 90 degrees.	['Sometimes it is easy to overlook the importance of a basic knowledge of first aid for dogs. It really can be a lifesaver. This applies even more so to the owner of an old dog, as there are unfortunately a few more serious conditions that could occur such as a stroke or heart attack. It is however rare for dogs to suffer a sudden death situation.\nThe following is a brief first aid for dogs guide. It is made with the older dog in mind. Most of the first aid problems I have listed apply to dogs of all ages but I have listed the ones which apply more to old dogs first.\nPlease remember they are all only a temporary measure until you can get your dog to the veterinary hospital and that this is not a complete list. Print this page out and keep it handy.\nThe dog will lie on his stomach or side and will be unable to\nrise. He may breathe heavily.Seek the advice of a vet as soon as possible but while waiting keep the dogs temperature comfortable and make sure the airway is clear.\nThere are a number of causes of collapse and these should be\ninvestigated by a vet.\nThe dog will usually experience pain in their fore legs. It will\ntry and stretch its fore legs, bend and stretch its neck backwards and can have trouble breathing. They can often occur in the old dog in hot weather especially after exercise.\nLie the dog on their side with the neck and head extended.\nIf they have stopped breathing : Perform mouth to nose\nresuscitation. Pull the dogs tongue forward slightly, close their mouth, then blow to fully with your\nmouth over their nose and expand the lungs 4-5 times. Do not blow too hard. Check for breathing. If not then repeat several times.\nListen / feel for a heart beat or pulse. If and ONLY if there is no heart beat, perform chest compressions by laying the dog on its right side and with the heel of the hand in the area of the ribcage just behind the elbow. 15 compressions to 1 breath.\nSEE THE FOLLOWING VIDEO FOR CANINE CPR\nThis a serious and real risk for old dogs in hot weather as they\nfind it harder to maintain their body temperature as they age.\nThe symptoms are usually\nrapid panting, thick sticky saliva, very red gums and tongue,\nweakness, unsteadiness and sometimes vomiting.\nRemove the dog from any hot area as quickly as possible. Cool the dog by wetting her thoroughly with water which is not too cold though as this can be counter productive. If possible try and position a slow fan near to the dogs mouth and gently direct the flow of air ensuring the mouth is open slightly. If the dog has collapsed and you have use of a fan, do not let your dogs tongue dry out by either lightly misting or sprinkling water onto it. Do not let the dogs temperature become too low though (below 103 F or 39.4 C). Contact your vet as soon as possible.\nThese can be easily confused with other conditions in your dog as dogs do not suffer from paralysis like humans can. A stroke in a dog is not as serious as in humans and they can recover well. However, like humans there are two types of of stroke : ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes are caused by a\nsudden stop in the blood flow to the brain and a hemorrhagic\nstroke is caused by the rupture of blood vessels in the brain.\nSymptoms can include loss of sight, falling over, drooling,\ncircling and tilting or turning of the head. It These symptoms\ncan be confused with vestibular disease though which is more common in older dogs.\nThere is not much you can do for your dog apart from treat as a\ncollapse, keep your dog comfortable and contact your vet.\nThe dog will normally collapse onto its side often with sudden\nspasmodic movements, champing of the jaw and salivation.\nSometimes they might move their legs as if they are running or swimming.\nRemove the dogs collar and make the dog as comfortable as\npossible. Make sure the dog cannot injure themselves and can\nbreathe by keeping the neck and head extended if necessary. Keep in a darkened quiet area if possible until you can get help. Try and remember the dogs symptoms during the fit and behavior\nproceeding it so you can inform your vet.\nDogs will try to vomit, gag or tear frantically at his mouth with his paws.\nTry and open the dogs mouth and remove the object by using your fingers. If this fails turn the dog on her side, place your palms just behind the last rib and give 4 quick thrusts. Recheck the throat. Repeat thrusts if necessary. Call for help immediately if you have not been able to remove it.\nIf this still fails and help has not arrived perform a Heimlich maneuver. The Heimlich maneuver should only be performed as a last resort as serious injury can occur. One method is as follows : Straddle your dog from behind. Put your hands over the back of your dog, letting them hang down. Put your hands together and clasp them together just behind the last ribs in\nthe center. Using the back of your hands lift up and forwards in several quick successions.\nStomach is full of gas and greatly expanded in size. AN EMERGENCY\nGO TO YOUR VETERINARY HOSPITAL IMMEDIATELY\nUnless the ingestion of the poisonous substance has been\nwitnessed the symptoms can be difficult to diagnose. Symptoms can include vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, lack of appetite, staggering, and difficulty breathing.\nIf a known poison has been seen to be ingested and is not\nunconscious then in most cases it is best to induce vomiting.\nThis can be done by pouring a salt solution of water down the throat. Do not do this for petroleum or caustic liquids (i.e.. Bleach) as they might damage the throat\nagain on the way up. In all cases contact your vet with the details of what has been eaten and if possible how much.\nSNAKE BITES OR STINGS\nYour dog could seem withdrawn, lame, limping or repeatedly\nlicking an area of its body.\nLook at the area and if it is swollen check the area for snake bite wounds. If snake fang puncture wounds are found then contact your vet immediately.\nFor stings, if any can be seen such as bee stings then remove them with a pair of tweezers, otherwise keep an eye on your dog over the next hour. If your dogs condition deteriorates or the swelling increases contact your vet. Contact your vet immediately if you suspect it might be a venomous spider bite or scorpion sting.\nVery loose bowel motions which can result in weakness.\nWithhold all food and keep the dog warm. Offer a small volume of\nwarm glucose solution (a tablespoon of glucose to a pint of\nwater). If the dog is weak then\ntake it to a vet as soon as possible however if the dog is\notherwise bright then take him the next available appointment.\nYou might witness the accident or the dog might return obviously injured or lame.\nRestrain your dog if necessary to prevent further injury. If in a dangerous position move the dog and yourself to a safe area. The dog will most probably be in a state of shock, could be frightened and might bite. Approach the dog slowly and fit a muzzle if possible. Speak gently to the dog, make slow movements and keep the dogs temperature stable\nTry and assess any injuries and whether you think it is possible to transport the dog to the emergency veterinary hospital or if the dog will need a veterinary ambulance. Speak to your vet immediately and beware of any internal injuries which might not be obvious.', 'We Love Your Pets Like You Do!\nCall For An Appointment\nWed & Sat\nArticle 6: Heat Stroke\nWARNING SIGNS YOUR PET IS SUFFERING FROM HEAT\nWe have all heard and seen the daily excessive warnings this summer and there appears to be no relief in sight. Our warm winter without snow payback is wreaking havoc on our crops, our lawns, and our pets. Excessive heat can be extremely dangerous for our pets. They can suffer from dehydration, over-heating, heat stroke, and in extreme cases even death. The good news is all heat-related illnesses can be avoided and prevented if you plan ahead and take the proper protection steps. Here are some things to watch for and some steps to take to keep your pet cool this summer.\nCreate A “Heat-Free” Zone In & Out of Your Home\nWhether it is your basement, garage, a nice shady tree, a doghouse, or other shelter your pet\nneeds a place to get out of the direct sun and ideally where the area temperature is lower than the current outside temperature. Plan and create a “Heat-Free” Zone before the excessive heat warning arrives and make sure everyone in the family knows where that place is and is ready and willing to move the pet to the safe location. Avoid those “Did you, no I thought you did…” moments that can lead to heat-related illnesses.\nDuring Excessive Heat Warnings\nMove your pet to the “Heat-Free” Zone.\nKeep your pet indoors as much as possible.\nIf your pet likes water and is outside place a kiddie pool or misting hose in or near the\nMake sure you pet has access to plenty of cool, clean, fresh drinking water at all times.\nAllow for greater consumption by adding an extra water dish/bowl/bucket or increasing its size.\nMake sure someone is checking the bowl throughout the excessive heat day. It might get spilled, knocked over, or consumed and may need to be refilled.\nJust like you do for yourself or your family greatly limit or restrict the amount of exercise\nreceives and arrange for that to occur either early in the morning or late in the evening. At all costs avoid midday heat exercise.\nDogs and cats can get sunburned just like we do it left out. Especially the nose, ears, and paws. So make sure they can get away from direct sunlight on excessive heat\nYou know what it feels like when you walk on asphalt or concrete during an excessive heat day in bare feet. It is no different for your pet. Avoid burned paw pads by allowing your pet to walk on grass. Stay clear of all concrete, asphalt, and especially metal surfaces during excessive heat\ndays. If your pet refuses to walk, has a limp, or is licking/chewing at its paws they may be warning signs that they have burned their paw pads. If you see these types of behavior consult your veterinarian immediately for home or in-clinic treatment. If your pet is suffering pick your pet up and carry to a grassy area and allow the paws to soak in cool water, or apply a cool compress to the affected area.\nNEVER LEAVE PETS IN A PARKED VEHICLES DURING EXTREME OR NEAR-EXTREME HEAT\nEach year hundreds of pets across the country die needlessly from being left in parked vehicles.\nThe inside vehicle temperature can rise by as much as 40 degrees above the ambient outside temperature. This is true even when the outside temperature is as low as 72 degrees. That means on a 90 degree day the inside temperature can exceed 130 degrees in as little as thirty minutes. Imagine what it does on an extreme heat day. With an outside temperature of 102 a vehicle parked in direct sunlight can rise as much as 30 degrees per minute and quickly become lethal even with the windows cracked slightly. The bottom line is do not ever leave your pet unattended in a vehicle for any reason. If your pet is exposed to this type of extreme heat contact your veterinarian immediately for assistance. Your pet’s body is not designed to sweat like human the human body and therefore has very little body surface area from which sweat can pass through. Short-nosed breeds and heavy coated breeds have an even higher risk factor for heat-related illnesses including heat stroke.\nWATCH FOR THESE TELLTALE SIGNS\n(IF YOU SEE ANY OF THESE CALL US IMMEDIATELY)\nHeat Stroke is an immediate life-threatening situation that needs urgent attention and care. It occurs when the body cannot regulate its own temperature and cool itself. It is associated with an extremely high internal body temperature of between 104 and 110°F. Your pet will show signs of\nexcessive panting, a dark red or bright red tongue and gums, sticky/dry tongue and gums to the touch, nausea, bloody diarrhea and/or vomiting, unstable on feet, seizures, up to and including unconsciousness.\nIf left untreated your pet can lapse into a comma and die.\nHeat Stress is a milder form of heat-related stress illness that can develop over several days of heat exposure, and/or inadequate fluid intake. The signs can be similar to heat stroke and\ninclude heavy panting, glazed eyes, rapid pulse or heart rate, staggering, no desire to eat/drink, vomiting, and weakness or lethargy.\nSunburn looks the same in animals as it does in humans and is likely to occur to the nose, ears, and paws. Normally pink-skinned pets (light skinned) are at a greater risk of sunburn.\nHOME TREATMENTS FOR HEAT RELATED ILLNESSES\nHeat related illness is very serious business and should not be left to home care alone. Many symptoms are similar to other types of illness and must be evaluated by a trained professional to determine exact cause and treatment. However, if you are certain your pet is suffering from a heat-related illness you can begin urgent treatment at home by doing the following before you visit your veterinarian.\nMove your pet to a shaded area, indoors, or to an air conditioned area nearby (including a vehicle).\nApply ice packs, cold packs, or cold towels to your pet’s head, neck, and chest.\nDo not cool your pet too quickly or leave ice packs on for more than ten minutes at a time to avoid frostbite.\nLet your pet drink small amounts of cool (not ice cold) water or lick on an ice cube. Never force your pet to ingest ice or drink water. Small amounts over a longer period of time are much better for your pet than ingesting an entire bowl in a matter of minutes.\nFinally, if it is uncomfortable outside for you your pets feel the same way. If you would not want to be out in it for an extended period of time neither would they.

Several key testing scenarios should be implemented: 1) Verifying that the payment gateway is secured with HTTPS and stored information is encrypted, 2) Ensuring payment processing only proceeds when mandatory fields are filled, 3) Testing various combinations of valid and invalid card numbers, CVVs, and blocked cards, 4) Checking if all essential transaction details are received after successful payments, 5) Confirming customer notification or email delivery following successful payments, and 6) Preventing duplicate payments and misleading occurrences.	['Attaining and maintaining excellence in payment processing comes with its set of difficulties. Complicated software structures, delicate connections with external partners, and continuously shifting rules and regulations can result in unforeseen errors and interruptions. While manual testing holds significance, more is needed in confronting these challenges due to the possibility of human mistakes, time limitations, and the incapability to explore every potential situation comprehensively.\nTherefore, automated tools and scripts will enhance the testing to ensure the feature and the system are fail-safe. Let us see the factors responsible for having an accurate and efficient payment processing system through automatic regression testing.\nTable of Contents\nPayment Processing and Challenges\nPayment processing online has revolutionised how transactions are conducted, offering convenience and speed. However, this complex system is not immune to challenges that can potentially lead to payment failures. Issues such as network connectivity problems, server downtime, incorrect input of payment details, expired cards, or insufficient funds can all contribute to payment failures. Moreover, security concerns such as unauthorised access, data breaches, or fraudulent activities can further disrupt the payment process. These challenges indicate the need for robust testing and validation methods to guarantee a seamless payment experience and protect against potential errors that can adversely affect both businesses and customers.\nOnline payment processing is filled with difficulties due to complex software architectures, difficult system integrations, and a legal environment that is always changing. These challenges often lead to unexpected errors, disruptions, and security vulnerabilities that can undermine the seamless flow of transactions. However, the integration of automated regression testing offers a powerful solution to enhance the efficiency of online payment processing.\nAutomatic Regression Testing (ART) – What, Why and When?\nAutomatic Regression Testing is the practice of using automated scripts and tools to perform checks on already tested features and see whether the tested feature or update is working as intended after the modifications to the system.\nAutomatic Regression Testing mitigates the risk of collateral damage. Sometimes, the changes made to the system will have an unanticipated impact on another part of the system. Features that used to work fine before appear to have bugs now. The testing team has to ensure this doesn’t happen, and the system should work properly after the changes have been made to it. This is why we need Automatic Regression Testing.\nAdding a new feature, bug fixes, changes in the requirements etc., or anything that modifies any part of the feature or the product itself is when Automatic Regression Testing is required.\nImplementing Automatic Regression Testing for Efficient Payment Processing\nPayment operations serve as the backbone of any modern business, encompassing all the processes involved in the receipt, verification, and completion of financial transactions. With consumers and businesses depending more on online transactions, smooth payment systems are no longer just a convenience – it is a crucial advantage in staying competitive.\nImplementing Automatic Regression Testing into payment systems will help to identify potential bugs & fixes that need to be addressed to provide efficient payment operations.\nA certain set of scenarios have to be set to determine where the payment operations might fail. Some set of scenarios are:\n- Ensure that the gateway utilized for payment transfers is secured with HTTPS, and the stored information (if any), must be encrypted for protection.\n- Payment processing must only proceed if any mandatory field is filled.\n- Conduct tests using various combinations, such as valid card numbers and valid CVVs, as well as mixing valid and invalid inputs. Also, use a blocked card for validation purposes.\n- After a successful payment, check whether all essential transaction details are received.\n- Confirm if the customer receives a notification or email following a successful payment.\n- Avoid duplicate payments and take steps to prevent any misleading occurrences.\nNow that we have our set of scenarios, we have to select a suitable tool that aligns with the testing scenarios and offers great utility for the price. Here are some of the tools for automatic regression testing for payment operations.\nAutomatic Regression Testing Tools for Payment Processing\n- FIS Global Payment Testing System\n- Applause Payment Testing\n- Paymentwall Test Payment\n- t3 V7\nIn conclusion, perfecting payment processing faces challenges due to intricate software structures, complex integrations, and evolving regulations. Automated Regression Testing (ART) is pivotal, as it detects unintended consequences in tested features, ensuring system integrity. Its significance arises when introducing new elements or making changes to uphold system functionality. Selecting appropriate testing tools enhances its effectiveness, safeguarding secure and competitive payment systems.\nAutomated Regression testing ensures that updates and changes do not inadvertently introduce new issues by systematically running automated tests on existing features following system modifications. This proactive approach not only detects potential bugs and glitches but also significantly reduces the risk of payment disruptions, security breaches, and operational inefficiencies. As a result, automated regression testing plays a vital role in streamlining online payment processing operations, enhancing their reliability, security, and overall efficiency.']	['<urn:uuid:91e8d76b-1eba-45fe-903b-5f606ca487ec>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	24	77	826
86	What are the key factors that need to be considered when choosing a non-return valve for a specific application?	When selecting a non-return valve, there are three key factors to consider: First, the size and compatibility with your existing plumbing system. Second, the flow rate and pressure requirements of your application. Third, the valve material must be suitable for the type of fluid being handled.	['Water is a precious resource, and in today’s world, where sustainability is paramount, finding efficient ways to conserve water has become more important than ever. The non-return valve is one often overlooked yet highly effective water conservation device.\nThis article will explore the secret power of check valves and how they can make water conservation effortless.\nThe Importance of Water Conservation\nWater scarcity is a global issue and every drop of water saved counts. Conserving water helps the environment and reduces utility bills for households and businesses. To achieve effective water conservation, explore innovative solutions and non-return valves play a significant role in this endeavour.\nWhat Are Non-Return Valves?\nNon-return valves, also known as check valves or one-way valves, are mechanical devices that allow fluid (in this case, water) to flow in one direction only. They prevent the reverse flow of water, ensuring that once it passes through a pipe or system, it does not return.\nHow Non-Return Valves Work\nNon-return valves utilize a simple yet ingenious mechanism to allow forward flow while preventing backward flow. The valve consists of a flap or a disc that opens when water flows in the desired direction, and it closes to block the flow when there is back pressure or reverse flow.\nThe Benefits of Non-Return Valves\nBy effectively blocking the reverse flow of water, non-return valves prevent wastage and ensure water is used only where intended.\nIt also plays a crucial role in reducing contamination. They prevent contaminated water from flowing into the main water supply, safeguarding drinking water quality.\nBy maintaining a unidirectional flow, non-return valves help optimize the efficiency of pumps and other water systems. This, in turn, saves energy and reduces operational costs.\nApplications of Non-Return Valves\nNon-return valves are commonly used in plumbing systems to prevent backflow, ensuring a safe and efficient water supply.\nIn irrigation systems, non-return valves help maintain pressure and prevent water from flowing back into the distribution network.\nNon-return valves are vital in sewage systems, preventing sewage backflow and ensuring the integrity of the wastewater management process.\nInstalling Non-Return Valves: A Step-by-Step Guide\nInstalling non-return valves is a straightforward process. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you with the installation:\n- Identify the appropriate location for the non-return valve based on the specific application.\n- Turn off the water supply to the area where you plan to install the valve.\n- Cut the section of the pipe where the valve will be installed using a pipe cutter.\n- Clean the pipe ends and the valve connections to ensure a proper seal.\n- Connect the valve to the pipe, ensuring a tight fit.\n- Turn the water supply back on and check for any leaks.\nMaintenance and Care for Non-Return Valves\nTo ensure the optimal performance of non-return valves, regular maintenance is essential. Here are some maintenance tips:\n– Inspect the valve periodically for any signs of damage or wear.\n– Clean the valve to remove any debris or buildup that may hinder its functionality.\n– Lubricate the moving parts of the valve as recommended by the manufacturer.\nTips for Choosing the Right Non-Return Valve\nWhen selecting a non-return valve, consider the following factors:\n– Size and compatibility with your existing plumbing system.\n– The flow rate and pressure requirements of your application.\n– The valve material is suitable for the type of fluid being handled.\nCheck valves are the unsung heroes of water conservation, providing a simple yet powerful solution to prevent wastage and contamination. Husting their secret power of non-return valve unlocks a more sustainable future where every drop counts.']	['<urn:uuid:1c760be6-a991-4737-9c1b-1482145e19eb>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	19	46	598
87	what happens refugee child south africa turns 18 years old	When refugee children in South Africa reach 18 years of age, they lose all protection under the Children's Act and face risks of being arrested, detained, and deported as illegal migrants. They can only stay in the country if they apply for asylum in their own right and receive a valid permit, which must be based on their original refugee claim from when they first entered the country.	['Caught in a Catch-22: Child Migrants in South Africa – Are short-term plans and implementation gaps putting foreign children at risk?\nIn 2004, a court case brought by the Centre for Child Law reflected the severe challenges and restrictions that children face in the South African migration landscape. Responding to the detention of over 100 children at Lindela, including some who were illegally held with adults, the Pretoria High Court ruled that such detention of minors was unlawful and a shameful transgression against the children’s rights and interests. In spite of this, approximately 50 children have been discovered at Lindela since 2016.\nThe ongoing arrest and detention of foreign children underlines the need to address the adversity that they face upon entering South Africa, especially given that civil conflicts and trans-border migration have brought more and more child migrants into the country in recent years. Though South Africa has accepted international obligations to act in children’s best interests and arguably possesses one of the strongest and most progressive foreign child protection frameworks in Africa, severe gaps in implementation and interpretation often make foreign children’s long-term welfare an unattainable ideal rather than a reality.\nIn their recent review of the legal and political structures that deal with different categories of foreign children, Ncumisa Willie and Popo Mfubu highlight the deficiencies in the state asylum-seeking and child protection systems, drawing attention to the practical challenges that foreign children face in accessing documentation and social services. They find that the lack of long-term focus or flexibility in the current system especially hurts unaccompanied and separated foreign children, forcing them into a vulnerable “legal lacuna” or void as soon as they reach majority age. Here, it should be noted that a separated child may have a non-parent adult accompanying her, but an unaccompanied child has no adult with her. Across all foreign child categories – including accompanied foreign minors with refugee claims, as well as unaccompanied or separated children without them – it is concluded that children’s situations are approached in a narrow and short-sighted way that is crippled by poor understanding of the relevant laws among involved officials.\nAs a signatory of the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, South Africa is internationally obligated to pass and implement laws for the realization of children’s interests. At the same time, Section 28 of the South African constitution establishes the duty to protect, fulfill, and promote children’s rights, and the 2005 Children’s Act gives effect to those rights and sets principles for children’s care and protection. As neither document distinguishes between foreign and South African children, South Africa is duty-bound to protect all children regardless of nationality or status . Moreover, under the 1998 Refugees Act, the Children’s Court can order that a child with a valid refugee claim be assisted in applying for asylum and documentation. In theory, several basic steps are followed when a foreign minor is discovered. While identifying the nature of the child’s situation, it is determined whether she is unaccompanied or separated from her parents or guardians; if so, she is assumed to require care and protection and arrangements are made to improve her situation. Also, if she is found to have a strong refugee claim, involved officials help her to apply for refugee status documents. Meanwhile, the child’s social worker should find out both why she left the home country, why she is alone, and whether there are parents, caregivers, or extended family members able to care for her and provide for her needs. The child is reunited with these relatives if they are found and if repatriation serves her best interests. Otherwise, alternative care arrangements are recommended to the Children’s Court. Throughout this process and afterward (if alternative care is necessary), the child can be placed in foster care, temporary safe care, a Child and Youth Care Centre, or other forms of care.\nUnfortunately, children navigating this process face a host of challenges in accessing social and economic services, applying for documentation, and securing their long-term future wellbeing. Unaccompanied children often remain undocumented because status determination officers assume that they can only deal with children as dependents of an adult or part of a family. The same is true for unaccompanied/separated children without refugee claims, who are dealt with under the Immigration Act and cannot receive permits because they are not traveling as dependents of an adult. Across both the Refugees and Immigration Act, this practice leaves unaccompanied children with no place to turn in seeking documents. The lack of documents can then bar them from accessing education, healthcare, and other services, as well as leave at risk for detention and arrest. Additional problems include social workers and other officials’ failure to account for child-specific refugee claims (such as risks of forced service as child soldiers or forced child marriage) and a short-sighted emphasis on children’s placement in secure but temporary care. Lacking documentation and often considered resolved cases as soon as\nthey are placed in a safe environment, unaccompanied children lose all protection once they come of age. Overnight, they are shunted from enjoying safety and protection under the Children’s Act to suffering risks of being arrested, detained, and deported as illegal migrants.\nSeparated foreign children with refugee claims face many of the same problems in gaining documentation, though they are not specifically catered for in the Refugees Act. According to court precedent, however, every separated child should be documented as soon as possible, with the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) helping the child with her asylum application before the Children’s Court releases its findings. The unfortunate reality is that in practice, the DHA often leaves children undocumented and vulnerable while the Children’s Court performs the inquiry. Meanwhile, accompanied foreign children with refugee claims are considered under their parents’ asylum applications as dependents. This means that a refugee minor is only able to apply for derivative asylum status and cannot have her independent asylum application adjudicated. Then, once she reaches 18 and is no longer a dependent, she can only stay in the country if she applies for asylum in her own right and receives a valid permit. To do this, she must base her application on the refugee claim that she possessed when first entering the country, which is often no longer reliable grounds for status.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nWhether a child can be classified as unaccompanied, separated, or accompanied, and whether she has a refugee claim or not, she faces a number of barriers in securing a stable future in South Africa. Willie and Mfubu make a number of recommendations for better implementation and adaptation of the political and legal frameworks, urging measures that will more effectively serve children’s best interests and futures. In the current situation, the intensive focus on short-term social welfare for undocumented and unaccompanied children has a large consequence: especially in the long-term, the children are denied access to services such as health care and education and suffer the risk of being arrested and deported. The children’s position as foreign nationals and lack of documentation are held against them when they try to access their rights\nand services. Children’s Court officials and social workers are poorly versed in the children’s specific vulnerabilities as foreigners and the full protections they are entitled to. Within the legal framework of children’s protections, a step to remedy this could be to insert the clause “irrespective of nationality” and mentions of unaccompanied/separated foreign children in the Children’s Act. Moreover, when evaluating whether a child needs care or protection, the DSD should be more systematic in determining whether the child needs legal documents, recognizing that a lack of documents makes the child more vulnerable to exploitation or unlawful detention. The Children’s Court should likewise play a more active role in deciding whether a child needs care and protection and in enlisting legal experts to provide input about a child’s qualification as a refugee. Overall, implementation of the frameworks in place must shift from a short term emphasis on children’s\nimmediate welfare and temporary care to forward-looking efforts that prioritize children’s need for documentation and recognize the distinct vulnerabilities and claims to residency in the country that children have. Until this transition effectively takes place, the present and future security of child migrants and asylum seekers is in jeopardy.']	['<urn:uuid:b7c35df7-7497-4645-8d29-fece1c8a40ef>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	10	68	1383
88	What changes more with pressure - diamond surfaces or copper materials?	Copper materials show more dramatic changes under pressure. While diamond surfaces only transform into thin amorphous layers during grinding, copper-based materials undergo a series of structural transitions that completely reorient their magnetic spins when pressure is applied, creating a reversible magnetic switch effect.	"['Secret of diamond polishing revealed\nDec 2, 2010 2 comments\nIt is the hardest everyday material on Earth, so why does diamond glisten when rubbed against another diamond? Now, the ancient but mysterious process of diamond grinding may have been explained by physicists in Germany, who have created a model for explaining the frictional interactions at the molecular level.\nFor centuries precious-stone merchants have polished diamonds by grinding them with cast-iron wheels embedded with coarse diamond fragments. It is not clear why this procedure is so effective at cleaning diamonds, but experience suggests that it works far better when the diamond is fixed at certain angles to the wheel than others.\nThis directional dependence of diamond grinding has now been investigated by Lars Pastewka at the Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials who set out to investigate the phenomenon. Working with colleagues at several other institutes across Germany, he has developed a quantum mechanical model to study the atomic interactions in ""diamond-like"" carbon films, which are often used in industry to reduce friction in machinery.\nDiamond in the rough\nBut when the researchers applied their model to diamond itself, they were surprised to find that it accurately predicted the experimental wear rates for this material – even though the exact wear mechanism has so far remained poorly understood. ""At this point we became very excited about this work and analysed our simulations in much more detail to uncover the details of the process,"" Pastewka told physicsworld.com.\nPastewka\'s team set about simulating diamond grinding using 70 computer processors running for a year, and discovered that during the grinding the diamond surfaces were being transformed into soft, amorphous layers. These thin films can then be easily removed by either chipping them away, or through carbon molecules bonding with oxygen in the atmosphere, leaving behind clean diamond surfaces.\nThis creation of the amorphous film occurs because of existing imperfections at the diamond surface, including the build-up of dirt over time. As a diamond atom slides over the surface it repeatedly pulls at the diamond crystal\'s atoms, and sometimes removes an atom from the crystal surface, which becomes part of the amorphous layer.\nLike a stack of paper clips\n""Imagine you have a stack of paper clips neatly arranged on your desk,"" explains Pastewka. ""Now you take a magnet and move that over these clips at a certain height. You cannot keep the height ideally constant, so if the height is right you will pull some paper clips to your magnet and others will remain on the desk.""\nChangfeng Chen, a materials scientist at the University of Nevada in the US is impressed by the research and its potential to boost industrial processes. ""This research is of particular significance in nanotechnology where the orientations of nanoscale crystallites can be well defined and controlled,"" he says. ""The predicted orientation-dependent anisotropic amorphization wear mechanism may open doors to a new level of material processing, ranging from better designer jewellery to superior high-tech device components.""\nTo develop the work, however, Pastewka\'s team intends to further investigate diamond\'s surface chemistry, and is currently writing a paper on the oxidation of the amorphous layer.\nThis research is described in a research paper in Nature Materials.\nAbout the author\nJames Dacey is a reporter for physicsworld.com', ""A material’s properties are a critical factor in the way that material can be used for practical applications. Magnetism is one such property, and magnetic switches are key components for advances in data storage and for displays in computers and cell phones. These properties are normally adjusted (or “tuned”) by changing the “recipe” during preparation. Now scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Argonne National Laboratory, along with a collaborator from Eastern Washington University, have harnessed the power of extreme high pressure and discovered a novel approach to predictably tune the switching of a promising new family of next-generation magnetic materials. Their results were published in the online version of Angewandte Chemie International Edition on September 10, 2010.\nThe magnetic materials the team studied are made from copper ions and simple building blocks, including water and fluoride. Their simple structures are held together by strong hydrogen bonds, making very robust molecular networks. Each copper ion, which sits at the corner of a molecular cube, contains one unpaired electron. These spins are disordered at normal temperatures, but begin to align in opposite directions at low temperatures, creating the magnetic state called antiferromagnetism.\nUsing state-of-the-art high-pressure equipment and the high-energy, highly focused x-ray beams from the X-ray Science Division 1-BM beamline at the Argonne Advanced Photon Source, the scientists observed a series of structural transitions as they exerted pressure on the material. These rearrangements abruptly reoriented the magnetic spins of the material, creating a reversible magnetic switch effect.\nHigh-pressure science has traditionally been the domain of Earth scientists and, until now, has not been routinely used to study molecular systems. Such studies promise to greatly improve our understanding of the often complex way materials’ functional properties are related to their molecular structures—a key step in realizing the diverse potential of molecular materials.\n“Molecule-based materials are much softer than traditional solid-state materials, like oxides and minerals,” said Argonne scientist Gregory Halder. “As such, we can expect to induce dramatic changes to their structures and functional properties at relatively low, industrially relevant pressures.”\nNext up for this team of researchers: Studying a targeted series of molecular network materials under pressure to understand the broader implications of this new phenomenon.\nSee: Gregory J.

89	What's the difference between how women experience menopause symptoms and how people with fibromyalgia experience their symptoms in terms of sleep disturbances?	Both conditions affect sleep but in different ways. Menopause causes sleep disturbance as one of its symptoms, while fibromyalgia patients often feel fatigued despite sleeping for extended periods and may have additional sleep-disturbing conditions such as sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome.	"[""Contributor: Sarit Polsky, MD, MPH\nThe menopausal transition can be a confusing time for a woman. She may experience uncomfortable symptoms that she does not realize are associated with this transition in life. Many women also don’t realize that they may have symptoms for years before they actually have their last menstrual periods. It also usually coincides with a stage of life that in and of itself is associated with many personal and sometimes professional obligations. At such a busy time, women sometimes think their symptoms are from something else, like stress. If you add diabetes into the mix, this confusion can increase because some of the symptoms are common to both menopause and diabetes. So, let’s try to answer some common questions.\nWhat is natural menopause?\nNatural menopause is when menstrual periods stop permanently and there are no obvious pathologic or physiologic causes, but this permanence is determined after at least consecutive 12 months without a period. The reason the menstrual periods stop is because all (or nearly all) of the ovarian follicles (eggs) are gone and estrogen levels decrease. It usually occurs around age 51. Symptoms of menopause include hot flashes, sweating, sleep disturbance, depression, vaginal dryness, sexual dysfunction, changing in thinking (memory, concentration), and joint pain.\nHow are women with diabetes affected by menopause?\nThe studies are inconsistent, but sometimes women with diabetes undergo menopause at an earlier age. Women with diabetes may have a difficult time deciphering if symptoms are from menopause or from hypoglycemia, such as with hot flashes and sweating. They may also find it hard to tell if symptoms are from menopause or from diabetes complications, like vaginal dryness and decreased libido.\nWhat are the treatment options for menopause?\nSome treatments are over-the-counter, which means that a provider does not need to write a prescription. Though many herbal and complementary therapies have been studied, there has not been a consistent benefit seen with them. Some treatments include non-hormonal based prescription drugs, like certain antidepressants which can help with hot flashes. Finally, there are hormone-based prescription treatments. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) includes estrogen and sometimes progestin (to protect the uterine lining in women who have a uterus). HRT use is limited in duration and can increase the risk for some serious medical conditions. HRT can be delivered in pills, patches, gels/lotions, suppositories, and vaginal rings. There aren’t enough studies in women with diabetes. It is very important for women to consult medical providers about the options available to them and to make sure they do not start therapies contraindicated for their particular circumstances.\nWhat else should one consider?\nWhen menopause occurs in women with diabetes, they are especially vulnerable to other conditions like brittle bones (osteopenia/osteoporosis), cardiovascular disease, and dementia.\nMenopause can present some physical and emotional discomfort in women with diabetes. While some symptoms are well-known, others may not be common knowledge. Women with diabetes may have trouble determining what is causing some symptoms because the symptoms themselves may occur from diabetes and/or from menopause. Fortunately, there are licensed professionals who can help women navigate these discomforts.\nDr. Polsky is an Assistant Professor at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, specializing in Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism. She directs the Pregnancy & Women’s Health Clinic at the Barbara Davis Center, Adult Clinic and is interested in how diabetes affects women during the reproductive years, menopause, and post-menopausal stages. She maintains a clinical and research interest in women's health and diabetes. She believes that she is a medical advisor to her patients, and works together with them to provide comprehensive care for their conditions that takes into account medical expertise, patient safety, and quality of life."", 'It’s been over three months. You haven’t slept well or thought straight since the pain started. It’s hard to name a muscle that doesn’t ache. Yet the lab tests have revealed little. Finally, you decide to see a pain specialist. After ascertaining that your pain extends to all four sections of your body, he diagnoses you with fibromyalgia.\nBy Katherine Ladny Mitchell\nFibromyalgia is a chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder that can greatly affect your sense of health and well-being. It is often associated with other health problems such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, recall issues, headaches, and irritable bowel syndrome. On average, those with fibromyalgia miss about 17 days of work per year – almost three times as many as those without fibromyalgia.\nThankfully, fibromyalgia is never life-threatening, and there are several things you can do to minimize its symptoms. Here is an overview of the condition, its diagnosis process, treatment options, and self-care tips to help those with fibromyalgia to enjoy a higher quality of life.\nWhile the exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, there are several factors that correlate with the condition. The first of these is gender. According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, over 80% of those with fibromyalgia are women. However, about one in 200 men also develop it. While most people with fibromyalgia are middle-aged, doctors occasionally diagnose children with the disease.\nGenetics could be a potential factor in causing fibromyalgia as the condition seems to affect members of the same family. Researchers are studying whether genetics associated with how the central nervous system perceives pain may be a cause of fibromyalgia. It’s hypothesized that those with certain genes may react painfully to stimuli others do not consider painful.\nFactors that appear to trigger fibromyalgia include the development of conditions like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or hypothyroidism, certain infections, or experiencing an emotionally or physically traumatic occurrence.\nFibromyalgia has three main symptoms: extensive pain, fatigue, and mental difficulties. The first major symptom is widespread pain lasting more than three months. This pain occurs in the muscles, ligaments, and tendons, and feels similar to having pulled muscles or a general flu-like achiness. Those with fibromyalgia often feel fatigued despite sleeping for extended periods and may have other sleep-disturbing conditions such as sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome. Many patients report having difficulty concentrating or remembering things (a.k.a. “fibro fog”). Those with fibromyalgia may also have a host of other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, headaches, sensitivity to light, temperature, and noise, painful periods, chronic fatigue syndrome, and stiffness.\nJulie Brown, a psychotherapist and vice chair of the board of directors at the Center for Mindful Living, describes some of the emotional side effects of living with chronic pain. “Pain is trauma, and when we can’t make sense of that, our human reflex is to begin spinning stories around why we have it, which can exacerbate anxiety and sadness and confusion. These stories can perpetuate the negative emotions, deepen them, and develop a pattern in the brain.”\nBrown says these emotional disturbances have a physical toll, too. “People feel betrayed by their bodies, almost like they constantly have to fight themselves,” she says. “So they have this pent up resistance that leads to constant muscular tightness and fast, shallow breathing. This only compounds the problem.”\nThe American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has outlined 18 sites on the body called “tender points” around major joints including the neck, shoulder, elbow, hip, and knee areas as well as on the chest. A doctor may perform an exam to see how many of these points are sensitive to pain in response to light pressure. However, a doctor can also diagnose fibromyalgia if a patient reports pain present on both sides of the body, both above and below the waist lasting more than three months. Health care professionals will likely order lab tests to rule out other possible conditions.\nAlthough there is no current cure for fibromyalgia, taking a holistic approach to treatment and improving your overall health can alleviate your symptoms. Seeking advice and expertise from various medical experts can help you develop a personalized care plan. Depending on a patient’s unique case, his or her team may include a neurologist, rheumatologist, physical therapist, pain management professional, and/or counselor.\nThere are some medications available that may help relieve some fibromyalgia symptoms. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved three medications – duloxetine (Cymbalta®), milnacipran (Savella®), and pregabalin (Lyrica®) –\nto help treat the condition. Doctors also prescribe duloxetine and milnacipran to patients battling depression, and pregabalin to those with pain associated with nervous-system damage. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen can also reduce general achiness, but particular care should be taken to avoid overuse. These drugs are not designed to treat chronic disorders or pain – so if you are using them regularly or plan to for an extended period of time, pursue a doctor’s supervision and take special precautions to know all of their potential side effects and drug interactions.\n“Medication is just a small piece of the puzzle,” says Dr. Sadiq Sohani, an anesthesiologist and pain medicine specialist at Center for Spine and Pain Medicine, P.C. – Ambulatory Surgery Center. “Most treatments are non-pharmacological – they may include postural correction, limiting repetitive injuries, nutritional changes, correction of the sleep cycle or insomnia, physical therapy, stress reduction, acupuncture, and aerobic exercise.”\nDr. Sohani says that in many cases, it can be helpful to first address psychological components such as sleeping problems and underlying conditions like depression. “To help with that, following an aerobic exercise program and keeping up structured activity are both extremely important,” he says. “Once you give in to the challenges of pain, it can be really hard to get out of that again. Cognitive behavioral therapy can be very helpful.”\nSome people with fibromyalgia have found relief in alternative medicine. Practicing yoga, tai chi, or meditation can help reduce stress. Massage therapy and acupuncture can also serve to provide pain relief.\nThe practice of mindfulness, which is about listening to your thoughts so that you can discover their habitual patterns, has shown to be very helpful to many people suffering from chronic pain. “Instead of turning away from pain in fear or looking to ‘quick fixes’ that can hurt you in the long run, mindfulness asks people to turn toward the pain,” says Brown. “Becoming aware of your fear, self-blame, or confusion, releasing judgement, and treating yourself with compassion, can actually release tension and decrease pain. Instead of just reacting instinctively to pain, you bring yourself into the decision on how to cope with it.”\nThese medications and therapies have helped many with fibromyalgia. But in conjunction with any treatment plan, one of the best things you can do is to make wise lifestyle choices that will not only improve your health in general, but help reduce your symptoms. These include:\nMore rest. Following a regular sleep routine and minimizing naps can be very helpful for reducing fatigue. If you are having serious trouble getting your zzz’s, undergoing a sleep study can help you find ways to quantify and improve your quality of sleep.\nRegular exercise. Low-intensity exercise can help reduce pain symptoms over time. Build your endurance level slowly and enjoy moderate activities such as walking, swimming, biking, and flexibility exercises.\nA lighter load. Adjusting your working environment and/or schedule can significantly improve your life and make the pain more manageable. If workplace demands worsen your symptoms, consider reducing your hours, switching jobs, replacing uncomfortable office furniture, or seeking advice from an occupational therapist for improved workplace strategies.\nCoping and Support\nGetting diagnosed with fibromyalgia may seem frustrating and overwhelming, but remember, you are not alone. There are resources and social networks available both online and in local support groups. The National Fibromyalgia Association (fmaware.org) is a nonprofit organization that educates and encourages those in the fibromyalgia community. The American Chronic Pain Association (theacpa.org) can provide helpful information to friends and family members of those with the condition. Inquire at your doctor’s office, local library, or hospital for information on local support groups. While fibromyalgia may impact your life, it need not define it.']"	['<urn:uuid:db8f59ff-c31b-449a-bac7-7b642c326762>', '<urn:uuid:d1d64a50-97da-48de-9c2a-f137838b6a6d>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	22	42	1981
90	As an endocrinology researcher, I'm curious about the role of hormones in chronic diseases - how do the endocrine functions of the pancreas compare with the hormonal impacts on bone density in terms of disease development?	The endocrine functions of both systems play crucial roles in disease development. In the pancreas, endocrine cells in the islets of Langerhans secrete hormones that regulate blood glucose: alpha cells secrete glucagon to raise glucose levels, beta cells release insulin to lower glucose levels, and delta cells secrete somatostatin to regulate growth hormone production. When there are defects in insulin production or utilization, diabetes mellitus develops. For bone density, hormonal factors significantly impact osteoporosis development, particularly in women after menopause, as decreased estrogen levels lead to higher bone loss. Additionally, hormone levels and thyroid conditions are risk factors for osteoporosis development. Both conditions show how hormonal imbalances can lead to serious chronic diseases affecting different body systems.	"['Overview of Pancreatitis\nPancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. Pancreatitis can develop suddenly and resolve in a short amount of time (called acute pancreatitis), or can be long lasting and recurrent (called chronic pancreatitis). In some cases, the condition is genetic (called hereditary pancreatitis).\nPancreatitis is a serious medical problem that can be life threatening. It is more common in people who have a history of alcohol abuse or diseases of the biliary tract (e.g., liver, gallbladder, bile ducts). Symptoms of pancreatitis include abdominal pain (which may be severe), nausea, and vomiting.\nPancreatitis can cause serious complications, including tissue death (necrosis), bleeding, and infection. In severe cases, it can cause toxic substances and digestive enzymes to be released into the bloodstream, where they can spread throughout the body, damage other organs (e.g., heart, lungs, kidneys), and cause infection (e.g., bacteremia).\nAnatomy of the Pancreas\nThe pancreas is a long, glandular organ that is part of the digestive system. It is located in the abdomen, behind the stomach and between the first part of the small intestine (called the duodenum) and the spleen. The pancreas is both an exocrine gland and an endocrine gland, and the organ is involved in digestion and metabolism.\nThe exocrine function of the pancreas is to produce and secrete a substance called pancreatic juice. Pancreatic juice is made up of sodium bicarbonate and certain enzymes (e.g., trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, amylase, lipase) that aid in digestion in the small intestine. It flows from the pancreas through the pancreatic duct to the duodenum, where the enzymes become active. If the enzymes start to work before leaving the pancreas, they can begin to ""digest"" the organ itself (called autodigestion), causing pancreatitis.\nThe endocrine function of the pancreas is to secrete certain hormones into the bloodstream that help regulate levels of blood glucose (sugar) and other substances in the body. This function is performed by small groups of endocrine gland cells called islets of Langerhans, which are scattered throughout the exocrine tissue of the pancreas.\nThere are three types of endocrine cells in the pancreas and each type secretes a certain hormone. Alpha cells secrete glucagon, which raises glucose (sugar) levels in the blood; beta cells release insulin, which lowers glucose levels in the blood; and delta cells secret somatostatin, which helps regulate the production of growth hormone.\nInsulin is necessary to convert glucose into a form that can be used by cells for growth and energy. Diabetes mellitus, also called diabetes, is a disease that results from a defect in the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin or in the body\'s ability to utilize the hormone.\nIncidence and Prevalence of Pancreatitis\nPancreatitis occurs more often in adults who have a history of alcohol abuse and in patients who have gallbladder disease (e.g., gallstones). According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), approximately 80,000 cases of acute pancreatitis occur each year in the United States and about 20% of these cases are severe and life threatening.\nRates of recurrent attacks and chronic pancreatitis are difficult to determine. Approximately 70% of chronic cases in adults are related to alcohol abuse. Chronic pancreatitis is more common between the ages of 30 and 40.\nPancreatitis affects men more often than women and is more common in African Americans than in Caucasians. The condition is rare in children.', 'What is Osteoporosis?\nOsteoporosis (OP) is a condition of low bone mineral density (BMD). It causes fragile and brittle bones where fractures are more prevalent. The most commonly affected areas are the spine, hip, upper arm, wrist, ribs or forearm.\nEpidemiology data reports 70% of people in NSW & ACT aged 50 years and older have osteoporosis or osteopenia; this is 1.9 million people (Sanders et al. 2017). Year on year prevalence continues to rise with the ageing population. Women are more likely to suffer from OP, specifically after menopause, as bone loss is higher as estrogen levels decrease.\nOther risk factors include:\n- Family history of OP\n- Low calcium and vitamin D levels\n- Medical history: use of corticosteroids, hormone levels and thyroid conditions\n- Low levels of physical activity\n- Excessive alcohol intake\nIf you are over 50 and have suffered a fracture after a minor incident, it is important you are investigated for osteoporosis as it is a “silent disease” and you may not have any other signs or symptoms.\nHow is Osteoporosis Diagnosed?\nIf your care team suspects low bone mineral density, a GP will refer for a DEXA scan. A DEXA scan is the most specific way to determine bone mineral density, a T-Score is then calculated to make a diagnosis. A DEXA scan includes BMD readings in the wrist, hip and lumbar spine. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) the following scores determine osteoporosis severity.\n- A T-score of -1.0 or above is normal bone density\n- A T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 means low bone density or osteopenia\n- A T-score of -2.5 or below is a diagnosis of osteoporosis\nI Have Been Diagnosed with Osteopenia or Osteoporosis, What Should I Do?\nOsteoporosis severity will determine what happens next (refer to image 1 below). A GP usually manages mild-moderate BMD loss and they may refer you to an Endocrinologist for further medical management if indicated.\nPharmacological interventions may be prescribed to assist in rapid bone rebuilding. Calcium and vitamin D levels should also be checked as adequate levels are crucial to maintain and build bone. Exercise is the only other way to increase or stimulate bone growth. After a diagnosis of OP it is absolutely necessary to either commence or modify exercise to ensure its’ impact is as effective as possible.\nExercise for Osteopenia and Osteoporosis\nExercise is the most effective lifestyle strategy to maintain healthy bones, it can assist in building and maintaining bone density. Specific loading through strength training has also been shown to be an effective way to treat osteoporosis (Liftmor 2019).\nWhat Kind of Exercise is Best to Build Bone?\nExercise at difference ages has different impacts. Adults need a combination of progressive resistance training and moderate impact weight-bearing activities. These specific types of exercise will increase BMD and prevent further bone loss. The key here is exercise TYPE and progressive increases in resistance.\nOptimal exercise guidelines\n- Regular: at least 3 x per week\n- Challenging: heavier weights with fewer repetitions\n- Progressive: exercise difficulty needs to increase over time\n- Varied: routines need to have variety, bone adapts to exercise and stops changing if you continue the same set of exercises\n- Short intensive bursts of weight bearing exercise are more effective than slow movements\nWhat Type of Exercise Should I be Doing?\n- Highly osteogenic (best for building bone):\n- Impact aerobics\n- Progressive resistance training\n- Sports e.g. Basketball or netball\n- Moderately osteogenic (some ability to build BMD)\n- Running or jogging\n- Brisk walking or hill walking\n- Stair climbing\n- Low osteogenic effect (minimal effect on bone mineral growth)\n- Leisurely walking\n- Lawn bowls\n- Yoga or Pilates\n- Tai Chi\n- Non-osteogenic (no effect on bone mineral growth)\nIt is most effective to do three activities per week, aiming for activities that are HIGHLY OSTEOGENIC.\nAre There any Types of Exercise I Cannot do with Osteoporosis? Do I Need to be Careful?\nThere is no specific exercise that is completely off-limits. In fact, recent research has found that high-intensity and impact training, previously thought to be high fracture risk, to be safe in the osteoporotic population (LIFTMOR Trial, 2019). This research also found this type of exercise to enhance bone strength when compared to lower intensity type exercise.\nHowever, for those with either osteoporotic spinal fractures, or a history of such fractures, it is worth considering end of range spinal positions, including: flexion, extension and rotation of the spine. End range spinal positions theoretically increase vertebral body load, thought to increase risk of a wedge or compression fracture. This is definitely not to say you can’t bend forward/backward or rotate to the side, but if loads are excessive or repetitive, the load has the potential to cause injury. This is why exercise programs need to be specific to each individual and exercise programs need to be monitored.\nExercise intensity, selection, variety and the overall program should be matched to capabilities and training history. Muscle strength and endurance in the tissue surrounding your bones will greatly influence your overall exercise capacity, as will current and previous exercise history. Exercise programs should be developed by either a Physiotherapist or exercise physiologist, who are trained in exercise therapy in chronic disease. This will help to ensure optimal outcomes while avoiding potential pain flare-ups or overload.\nFor exercise to have the biggest possible impact you need to participate in regular exercise (at least 3 x per week), choose exercise/activity that has high or moderate osteogenic (bone building) effects and change your schedule regularly.\nExercises to Get You Started\nThe femoral neck and the spine are two high-risk areas to suffer osteoporotic fractures. Targeted strength training in muscles surrounding these joints aims to directly increase BMD and surrounding muscle bulk. The following are examples of exercises that target these areas.\n*As this information is a general guide only, the following exercises do not take into consideration other pathologies or injuries. This does not substitute for a Physiotherapy exercise plan.\nSit to Stand\n- Start sitting on a chair, feet hip width apart\n- Arms out in front\n- Rise from the chair by shifting body weight forward into the heels of the feet\n- Stand with control, completely straighten hips and knees at the top\n- Lower with control to sitting\nTo make easier: start with bottom further forward in the chair or use a higher chair.\nTo make more difficult: hold arm weights, use a very low chair or hold each phase as pictured for 5 seconds.\n- Keeping feet hip distance, place one foot on the step\n- Push up onto the step, and straighten your hip and knee with control\n- Place opposite foot up on the step\n- Descend with control\nTo make easier: use a lower step or hold on to the wall for balance.\nTo make more difficult: use a higher step (picture b), hold hand weights, or add a single leg jump at the top (this requires balance, strength and coordination).\n- Start with feet hip width apart, knees behind toes, in a low squat position\n- Keeping arms straight holding weights\n- Drive up to standing by straightening your back and hips\n- Keep weights close to you\n- Lift and lower with control, descend as far as your hips and back are comfortable\nTo make easier: use light weight, move through a small range of motion.\nTo make more difficult: heavier weights, increase speed and depth of the motion.\nActive Prone Extensions\n- Lie face down on a firm surface, resting the head\n- Lift one arm and alternate leg as high as you can\n- Hold 3-5 seconds\n- Repeat opposite side\nAdd arm or ankle weights and increase length of hold to progress.\n- Lie face down on a firm surface\n- Lift arms, legs and head off the floor as high as you can\n- Hold 5-10 seconds\n- Repeat x 20\nTo make easier: lift either upper or lower body or move through a small range of motion.\nTo make more difficult: Add arm or ankle weights and increase length of hold, flutter arms and legs in a swimming motion.\nExercise to Prevent Osteoporosis\nThe most effective time to build bone is pre-puberty. Research has found that jumping has significant protective effects against bone related decline later in life (McKay et al 2005). This research found that only 10 jumps three times per day is adequate to improve bone mineral density. Weight bearing exercise is incredibly important to build bone, especially if your child tends to spend a lot of time in non-weight bearing sports such as swimming or bike riding. To make sure children are getting the benefits of weight bearing exercise, get them hopping, skipping or jumping every day.\n- McKay H.A., MacLean L., Petit M., Mackelvie K., O’Brien K., Janssen P., Beck T., Khan K.M.

91	what functions amniotic fluid pregnancy fetus development how much normal levels pregnancy	Amniotic fluid performs several crucial functions in fetal development: it protects the baby from injuries and infections through antibodies, enables movement for muscle and bone development, aids lung development through breathing, and helps digestive system development through swallowing. Regarding normal levels, the amniotic fluid volume increases up to 800-1000 ml by the 36th week of pregnancy, then decreases to about 600 ml by the 40th week in preparation for birth.	['What is amniotic fluid?\nIn the beautiful journey of pregnancy, when you are carrying your baby in the womb, she/he rests inside an amniotic sac filled with amniotic fluid.\nAmniotic fluid during pregnancy has many important functions and is crucial for healthy fetal development.\nAmniotic fluid is a clear, yellow fluid that surrounds the growing baby in the uterus, and is responsible for various tasks in this time.\nYou must be wondering about how does amniotic fluid keep your baby healthy?\nIt prevents the fetus from injuries and protects your baby from infections, as it contains antibodies while giving him/her room to move around and grow.\nThe amniotic fluid consists of necessary components such as nutrients, hormones, and infection-fighting antibodies that protect your baby in the uterus.\nHowever, if the amount of amniotic fluid inside the uterus is too much or too less, complications in pregnancy can occur.\nGenerally, the level of amniotic fluid is at its highest when it is around 36 weeks of pregnancy. This level decreases as the delivery date comes near.\nAmniotic fluid levels differ from person to person. The amount of amniotic fluid inside your uterus should be monitored as it may result in abnormal fetal development or lead to complications.\nToo much amniotic fluid causes Polyhydramnios, whereas too little amniotic fluid causes Oligohydramnios. Symptoms and signs of these vary from person to person.\nThe reasons behind Polyhydramnios are not clearly identified, but have a look at some known causes:\n- Maternal diabetes is one of the major causes of Polyhydramnios.\n- A possibility of twins is the other one. In this case, there is a complication in pregnancy wherein one twin receives too much blood and other is left with too little.\n- Shortage of red blood cells in the baby.\n- A possibility of infection during pregnancy leads to Polyhydramnios.\nCommon Polyhydramnios symptoms are :\n- Difficulty in breathing\n- Swelling in the lower extremities\n- Swelling of the vulva\n- Decrease in urine\n- Tightness in the belly\nCommon Oligohydramnios symptoms are\n- Extra Leakage of the amniotic fluid.\n- Less maternal weight gain.\n- Abdominal discomfort.\n- A sudden drop in heart rate.\n- Rupture of membranes before labour.\nHere are some tips that will help you increase the amount of amniotic fluid during pregnancy:\n1. Drinking an ample amount of water\nThis is one of the easiest ways to increase amniotic fluid. Increasing the level of water in your body also increases the level of amniotic fluid. Keeping your body hydrated is most important in all stages of pregnancy.\nHigh water-content foods like cucumber, strawberries, watermelon and tomatoes should be added in the diet on your platter.\n2. A big no to alcohol\nStop drinking alcohol. Alcohol is not considered good while you are pregnant, as it’s not good for your baby’s health. Alcohol dehydrates while lowering the level of amniotic fluid in your body. It is one of the things that you strictly avoid during pregnancy.\n3. Regular workouts\nPregnancy exercises are considered the best to stay stress-free, active and for maintaining a better circulation of blood. Regular workouts during pregnancy help in circulating the blood to various parts of the body. The increase in blood flow in the uterus also increases the level of amniotic fluid during pregnancy.\nHere are a few tips that will help you decrease the amount of amniotic fluid during pregnancy:\n1. Treating your disease right\nSometimes, any diseases you have can lead to an increase in the amount of amniotic fluid. Treating your disease right with proper consultation of doctors helps in lowering the level of amniotic fluid.\n2. Reduction of amniocentesis\nAmniocentesis drains out the excess amniotic fluid from your body. In this process, doctors draw fluid from the womb with proper techniques and procedures.\n3. Proper medication\nIf the amniotic fluid leakage is in excess then the doctor may put you on Indomethacin medication. It helps in reducing amniotic fluid levels. Doctors generally put you on indomethacin 31 weeks before delivery.\nAn excessive amount of amniotic fluid or too less amniotic fluid can be dangerous for you and your baby. Too much amniotic fluid in the womb causes polyhydramnios whereas too little amniotic fluid in the womb causes oligohydramnios.\nWomen with a lower or higher than average level of amniotic fluid during pregnancy may experience complications for their fetus and other problems during delivery.\nProper care is required in both cases. An optimal level of amniotic fluid is requisite for the well-being of both the mother and child. Make sure to get your amniotic fluid level checked for a safe pregnancy.', 'In this Article\n- What is Amniotic Fluid?\n- What is Oligohydramnios?\n- How Common is Oligohydramnios?\n- What Role does Amniotic Fluid Play in the Development of the Baby?\n- How Much Amniotic Fluid is Normal When Pregnant?\n- Common Symptoms of Low Amniotic Fluid\n- Causes of Low Amniotic Fluid\n- Diagnosis Methods for Oligohydramnios\n- Risk Factors of Oligohydramnios\n- How Does Low Amniotic Fluid Affect Your Baby?\n- Complications of Low Amniotic Fluid\n- Treatments for Oligohydramnios\n- How Can You Prevent Oligohydramnios?\nLast Updated on\nAmniotic fluid is a water-like fluid that helps in the development of the baby. It performs a lot of crucial functions that are important in keeping your baby safe while it grows in your womb, and in its proper development. Let us find out more about amniotic fluid and the causes behind the amniotic fluid becoming low in pregnant women.\nWhat is Amniotic Fluid?\nYour baby grows and develops inside a fluid-filled bag called the amniotic sac. This amniotic sac is filled with amniotic fluid. Amniotic fluid cushions your baby and protects it from all sorts of infections. It also protects your baby from getting hurt if you suffer a blow to your tummy. It keeps the temperature inside the womb constant and also helps in the development of baby’s muscles, limbs, lungs and digestive system.\nAs your baby begins to breathe in the second trimester, she will start swallowing the amniotic fluid and later pass it as urine. That’s how a baby maintains the volume of amniotic fluid around herself.\nWhat is Oligohydramnios?\nOligohydramnios is a condition where the volume of amniotic fluid inside the amniotic sac is too low. Doctors can measure the amount of amniotic fluid inside you through amniotic fluid index evaluation or deep pocket measurements. If the volume of liquid is less than 500ml in pregnant women during the 32nd to 36th week, then oligohydramnios is suspected.\nOligohydramnios is diagnosed when:\n- The amniotic fluid volume is less than 500 ml\n- The maximum vertical pocket is less than 2 cm\n- The amniotic fluid index is less than 5 cm\nHow Common is Oligohydramnios?\nThe percentage of women suffering from oligohydramnios is close to 8%, and it can occur at any time during pregnancy, though it is most common during the last trimester. If you are 2 weeks from your due date of delivery, then there are high chances of your amniotic fluid becoming low. 12% of pregnancies that cross 41 weeks of gestation may encounter complications due to Oligohydramnios.\nWhat Role does Amniotic Fluid Play in the Development of the Baby?\nAmniotic fluid has several functions as follows:\n- When the baby moves around freely in the amniotic fluid, it helps in bone and muscle development.\n- When the baby breathes the amniotic fluid in and out, it helps in the development of lungs.\n- When the baby starts swallowing the fluid and peeing it out later, it helps in the development of the digestive system.\n- Amniotic fluid protects the umbilical cord from getting compressed. As a result, the flow of nutrition from the mother to the baby for its overall development is constant.\n- The amniotic fluid also acts as a lubricant and helps in the development of fragile body parts that grow together like fingers and toes.\nHow Much Amniotic Fluid is Normal When Pregnant?\nThe volume of amniotic fluid continues to increase till the 36th week of pregnancy, and it measures anywhere between 800 to 1000 ml which are considered normal. After the 36th week gestation, the volume of amniotic fluid starts to fall in preparation for birth. The amount of amniotic fluid goes down to 600 ml by the 40th-week gestation or at full term, and that too is normal.\nCommon Symptoms of Low Amniotic Fluid\nDuring your regular check-ups, your doctor will keep a close watch on your belly. If your stomach is not growing the way it should, then your doctor may ask you to go for a scan to check the development or growth of the baby. Now, that is the first symptom. Other symptoms are:\n- Fluctuating blood pressure\n- First baby born with low birth weight or smaller in size\n- Constant leakage of fluid from the vagina\n- Both mother and child not gaining enough weight\n- Baby’s growth is prolonged\nCauses of Low Amniotic Fluid\nLow levels of amniotic fluid are most common during the third trimester. The causes for the same could be any of the following:\n- Water-breaking: If your amniotic sac tears off and fluid flows out, it is called water breaking. This usually happens in and around the time of delivery. If you haven’t quite reached the delivery time, then your doctor may give you antibiotics to protect you and your baby from infection while you wait for the delivery date to close in. If you have crossed 38th week of pregnancy, based on your condition, the doctor may also suggest inducing labour.\n- Health hazard: If your baby has some health issues, then the volume of amniotic fluid may become low. Especially during the second-trimester scan, babies are diagnosed with kidney, heart or chromosomal abnormality. This becomes obvious in the scan if your baby is passing very less urine. Your doctor may also suggest another test called amniocentesis, to be sure.\n- Issues with placenta: If you have diabetes, high blood pressure, lupus or pre-eclampsia, then your placenta may fail to supply enough blood and nutrition to your baby. In this case, the volume of amniotic fluid in your baby may fall, and you may have to be under strict supervision.\n- Medication: Some medicines must be avoided during pregnancy as they cause low amniotic fluid. Especially drug for high blood pressure and anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen are not prescribed during pregnancy.\n- Identical twins: If identical twins share a placenta, then sometimes there may be an issue of low amniotic fluid. In this case, the baby with extra blood will get access to the amniotic fluid while the other will not get enough.\nIf your doctor can rule out all the above causes, then there is nothing to worry about. Many a time it has been observed that low amniotic fluid level is due to dehydration during summers. So drinking plenty of water and taking enough rest will help.\nDiagnosis Methods for Oligohydramnios\nFollowing methods can be used to detect oligohydramniosis.\n- Ultrasound: The best and first diagnosis for oligohydramnios is an ultrasound scan. During the ultrasound, the amniotic fluid volume is measured in four various parts of your uterus, and then all the four values are put together to regulate the amniotic fluid index or the AFI. Also, the kidneys and bladder of the baby are assessed to look for any anomalies. The ultrasound diagnosis also includes the assessment of the baby’s growth which is done by measuring abdominal circumference, head circumference and the femur length.\n- Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI): AFI is measured through ultrasonography and is a widespread and safe test. This test helps your doctor to determine the volume of amniotic fluid in your uterus.\n- Sterile Speculum Examination: This test is performed by the doctors to check for a range of motion which is caused due to tear of the amniotic sac membrane, which in turn results in leakage of amniotic fluid.\n- Maximum Vertical Pocket: This test is used to check the volume of amniotic fluid in the thickest part of the uterus which doesn’t include a fetal portion and umbilical cord. Once again, ultrasound is used to conduct this test.\n- Blood Tests: Blood tests like maternal serum screening can help in the detection of low amniotic fluid. It also allows the doctor to check if your baby has any congenital problems like Down Syndrome.\n- Amniotic Wrinkle: If you are carrying identical twins then you may have an amniotic wrinkle which is caused by the folding of the inter-twin membrane. By checking the amniotic line properly, doctors can detect if both babies are getting enough amniotic fluid or not.\nIf any of the above assessments point at oligohydramnios, then a team of experts need to manage your pregnancy and delivery.\nRisk Factors of Oligohydramnios\nSome women are at a higher risk of oligohydramnios than other. Risk factors include the following:\n- High blood pressure during pregnancy\n- Problems with placenta\nIf you are facing any of these issues in pregnancy, it is wise to get yourself checked for this pregnancy complication.\nHow Does Low Amniotic Fluid Affect Your Baby?\nThere are numerous and severe problems associated with low amniotic fluid if it is diagnosed during the first and second trimester. If the same is detected in the third trimester, then the situation can be brought under control as the doctors are well equipped for handling the complications at this stage. The problems associated with low amniotic fluid are as follows:\n- Your baby may be born with severe congenital disabilities like missing internal or external organs or malformation of bones like dysplasia or clubfoot.\n- It can also result in stillbirth or in-utero death of the baby after the 20th week of pregnancy. Some babies die soon after birth.\n- Miscarriage after the 20th week is also one of the complications associated with the low amniotic fluid.\n- Babies are born prematurely before the 37th week with low birth weight and underdeveloped organs.\n- If oligohydramnios is diagnosed during the third trimester, when a baby may be born with limited growth, compressed umbilical cord during labour, and caesarean delivery.\nComplications of Low Amniotic Fluid\nSome of the severe complications or oligohydramnios effects on baby are listed below:\n- Foetal compression syndrome\n- Amniotic band syndrome\n- Pulmonary hypoplasia\n- Severe foetal infection\nThese complications pose a significant risk to your pregnancy and can adversely affect the baby.\nTreatments for Oligohydramnios\nIf oligohydramnios is diagnosed in the third trimester, then the doctors are well equipped to handle it. Also, if the condition is mild, then it doesn’t require any treatment in the third trimester. The doctor will only prefer to keep you under observation for oligohydramnios management. But if oligohydramnios is diagnosed in the first or the second trimester, then the following treatments may be followed to deal with low amniotic fluid in your uterus.\n- Amnioinfusion: In this treatment, the doctor infuses sodium chloride in your amniotic sac through an intrauterine catheter, at room temperature.\n- Vesico-amniotic shunt: If the low amniotic fluid is due to your baby not being able to pass urine, then the doctor will try to divert your baby’s urine with the help of vesico-amniotic shunt. While this procedure will take care of the low amniotic fluid in your uterus, but it doesn’t ensure the effective functioning of your baby’s kidney or lungs.\n- Fluid Injections: This is a temporary method of treating oligohydramnios by injection fluid with the aid of amniocentesis.\n- Maternal Hydration: Here, the doctor advises you to drink lots of water and put you in IV and oral fluids to increase the volume of amniotic fluid. This is applicable if dehydration causes oligohydramnios.\n- Bed rest: If you have mild oligohydramnios, then your doctor will keep you under observation and advise you complete bed rest. Proper hydration and complete bed rest can help to increase intravascular spaces, hence making more space for amniotic fluid.\n- Termination of pregnancy: The worst of all may be the medical termination of pregnancy due to severe oligohydramnios during the first trimester. But it is the best for you and the baby as the baby may be born with severe and multiple defects.\nYour doctor will usually involve a specialist in maternal foetal medicine to treat oligohydramnios. This is to deal with severe complications that may occur in your baby due to low amniotic fluid, like hydrops foetalis and congenital malformations.\nHow Can You Prevent Oligohydramnios?\nPreventing oligohydramnios entirely is not possible, and few precautions during pregnancy may reduce the chances of amniotic fluid becoming low during pregnancy.\n- Drink a lot of water and keep yourself hydrated. Many cases of oligohydramnios are due to dehydration.\n- Eat healthy food and listen to your doctor. Consult a nutritionist if necessary.\n- Do not take any medicines without speaking to your doctor; not even herbal supplements or vitamins.\n- Exercise regularly without exerting yourself. But walking periodically or prenatal yoga is beneficial during pregnancy.\n- Stop smoking. It affects your baby’s lungs directly.\n- Keep your prenatal check-up appointments without fail. Only regular check-up and help your doctor to determine any problem or abnormalities during pregnancy.\nOligohydramnios can be mild or severe. In both cases, your doctor would like to keep you under close supervision. Keep your appointments and consult your doctor in case of the slightest doubts. Be alert and watch your pregnancy carefully.']	['<urn:uuid:9210a069-b0f4-4668-8b64-99f1ebd1f4ae>', '<urn:uuid:dae9ea13-0f89-484a-89af-0bc3a959e662>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	12	70	2919
92	I heard the Inca Trail goes pretty high up in the mountains. What's the highest point we reach during the trek and on which day do we get there?	The highest point of the trek is Dead Woman's Pass (Warmiwañusca) at 4,200-4,215 meters, which you reach on day 2 of the trek. This is the most challenging day, involving approximately 5 hours of vertical hiking to reach the pass.	"['Start: Cuzco / Finish: Cuzco\nCategory: Trekking Adventures\nA spectacularly rich experience in the Andean Mountains awaits you! Immerse yourself in the Inca culture as you hike 45 kilometers through the heart of the beautiful Andes. This 4-day trek is the only one to take you along the original Inca Trail; an authentic hand-built stone footpath where you will walk in the footsteps of ancient Inca royalty. Climb from 2,380 meters to 4,210 meters at Dead Woman\'s Pass, then pass through unforgettably beautiful jungle scenery and hidden labyrinth-style ruins, until you reach the Inti Punku (Sun Gate) in the early morning light. Get ready for awe-inspiring views over Machu Picchu; the most spectacular Inca archaeological site in South America!\nDay by Day Itinerary:\nTrek Briefings: All travelers are required to visit the Cuzco office for a mandatory briefing on your trek one day prior to departure at 6pm. At this meeting you will receive detailed information on the route, a list of what to bring, confirm your hostel pick-up for the morning of the trek and be able to ask questions.\nDay 1: Cuzco to Ollantaytambo to KM 82 & Trek to Wayllabamba Camp (2,980m) (L/D)\nHostel Pick-Up between 5:00-6:00 am. Please make all of the necessary preparations one day prior to the trek. You will be taken by bus to the town of Ollantaytambo where you will have an hour to eat breakfast on your own and purchase last minute snacks, water and walking sticks. Then you will hop back on the bus to Piscacucho (KM 82) where the famous Inca Trail journey will begin. Bring your original passport, student card (if applicable) for the first Inca Trail check point. Your guide will have your tickets for you. Hike along rolling hills in the Vilcanota River Valley passing by several small archaeological sites along the way. Lunch will be prepared half-way and you will have time to relax before reaching Wayllabamba camp (2,980m).\n(11 kms ; 6 hours)\nToday is the most challenging day along the trail with a vertical hike of 6 km (approximately 5 hours) to reach Dead Woman\'s Pass at 4,215m followed by a 3 km hike down stone steps to reach Pacaymayo camp at 3,600m (approximately 2 hours). After an early breakfast around 6:00 am you will start off for the big hike. Take your time and rest as much as you feel necessary as you ascend more than 1,200 meters over the course of the morning. Don\'t miss awe-inspiring views of the valley as you reach the pass and remember to take your photograph at the top! Just after you cross Dead Woman\'s Pass you will be rewarded with spectacular views of nearby snow-capped mountain peaks and roaring waterfalls. Stroll slowly down to Pacaymayo Camp (3,600m) to enjoy the scenery. Arrive in time for lunch and a well-deserved nap to the sounds of the nearby waterfalls and nature. Then you will have the rest of the afternoon to enjoy the camp before dinner and an early bedtime.\n(10 kms ; 7 hours)\nAn unforgettable journey along ancient Inca stairways, mountain lakes, intriguing archaeological sites and humid jungle scenery awaits you. Start with a one-hour hike uphill to visit the oval-shaped Pacaymayo archaeological site believed to have been either a crop-storage structure or an Inca military fortress overlooking the valley to control the region. Continue one hour to Runquracay Pass (3,950m) where you can climb to the tip-top of the mountain for incredible views of surrounding peaks. Visit 2 more archaeological sites called Sayacmarca & Phuyupatamarca with your guide and have lunch along the way. By late afternoon you will reach Wiñayhuayna High Jungle camp (2,650m) set above a river valley in a high jungle / rain forest climate.

93	As a cybersecurity analyst investigating phishing trends, I'm wondering what was the total number of phishing attacks reported in 2012?	According to a report, there were 445,004 phishing attacks in 2012.	['What is phishing?\nPhishing is the process of stealing information from various individuals by attacking them through fake emails having viruses and malicious software. The phisher tries to gain personal information of the people through this process.\nIn phishing, the attacker sends a fake email which looks if it is sent from a legitimate company such as Microsoft, yahoo, etc. According to a report, there were 445,004 phishing attacks in 2012. There was a case when a large-scale phishing scam took place in which thousands of fake emails claiming to be sent from American Express were sent to various individuals. This process is very popular among cybercriminals due to the ease of getting people tricked into providing their information.\nHow is phishing done?\nThe attacker sends various fake emails to several individuals. The email is composed in such a way that it is difficult to predict if it is genuine or fake. This is because the email seems to be sent from a genuinely known company asking for your details to update their records, etc. To make phishing emails look genuine, they even include the logos of the company and other important information such as tagline, etc.\nThe phishing email may consist of a link or an attachment. Clicking the link could direct you to a fake website asking to enter your personal details such as bank account information, SSN, etc. Also, downloading the attachment may lead to the installation of a malicious software on the user’s device which in turn could have access to all the information on your device.\nOnce the attackers learn your information, they use it to commit identity theft. The attackers can read your emails, steal your money by gaining access to your bank accounts and do much more.\nTypes of phishing\nIn spear phishing, the phishing messages are aimed to be sent to certain individuals or companies. The attackers may even acquire personal information and interests of their targets through social networking to have better chances of success in attacking.\nIn this technique, an exact clone/copy of a genuine email which is already sent to a user is created. The cloned email replaces the original attachment or link with a malicious one. When this email is sent, it appears to be sent from the original sender only as it is spoofed.\nWhaling includes whaling attacks in which the targets of the attackers are not common individuals, but senior executives of companies. The whaling attack email usually consists of a customer complaint, executive issue, etc. and appears to be sent from a legitimate business authority.\nHow to identify phishing attacks?\n• The phishing messages usually consist of poor grammar and incorrect spellings. Legitimate companies mostly have copywriters to proof-read the content.\n• The link given in the email might have an incorrect company name. They often look correct but might have wrong spelling of the company name. The link might have a special character or symbol before or after the URL address.\n• The emails could lead you to .exe files which are known to install malicious software on devices.\n• The emails could contain threats such as termination of your account if you fail to respond to the message. The email may contain phrases like “your account will be closed”, “your account has been compromised,” or “urgent action required.” They terrify you using these phrases so that you react immediately.\n• The phishing attacks also consist of pop-ups. These pop-ups could be found on a legitimate website also. If you get a pop-up asking you to fill your information such as your username or password, be careful.\n• Beware of phishing phone calls which offer you to solve your computer problem or try to sell you a software.\nDamage caused by phishing\nThe damages caused by phishing can be very huge. It can lead to denial of access to your email account and even huge financial losses.\nAccording to a recent study, every year, the businesses in the US lose approximately $2 billion due to phishing.\nFor preventing phishing attacks, take the following steps:\n• Use a gateway email filter as it can catch phishing emails which are sent to various individuals.\n• Ensure that your mail server uses authentication standards.\n• Use a Web security gateway which can prevent users of being the target of phishing emails.\n• Use a Web browser having anti-phishing detection. Various common Web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, etc. have free add-ons to help you identify phishing websites and offer you anti-phishing protection.\nReporting phishing attacks\nIf you think you have been the victim of phishing attacks, note down all the information regarding the email or call (whatever the case might be) and report it to your local authorities as soon as possible.']	['<urn:uuid:c33ce36c-3b92-4476-903c-cf29146024ca>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	20	11	797
94	polyurethane heat resistance plastic processing methods	Polyurethane processing involves several temperature considerations. During curing, fans must keep part temperature below 300°F to prevent overheating from the exotherm reaction. The material can maintain thermal stability above 180 degrees. Various processing methods are possible, including open pour, injection molding, extrusion, compression molding, and free rise techniques. The material can be processed using slow to high speed production molding lines, including stand-up molds, turntables, race tracks, carousels, belt conveyors, and squirrel cage type carousels.	"['When you think of artistic sculpture, coal and polyurethane may not be the first materials that come to mind. But that’s not how Gerhard Baut, Artistic Director of Baut Studios, Swoyersville, Pa., sees it.\nFor the $208 million, 300,000-sq-ft Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs Casino in Wilkes Barre, Pa., Baut created a 20-ft-tall sculpture inspired by the variety of coal forms and surfaces found in northeastern Pennsylvania mines. He designed a coal base representing geologically different coals, going from fossilized soft coal and peat to bituminous and hard anthracite. Above the base, lumps of coal transition into diamonds suspended from the ceiling.\nTo realize this vision, Baut used mercury-free polyurethanes from Innovative Polymers, St. Johns, Mich. The mercury-free polyurethanes included high-strength, high-flexural-modulus IE-3075 and rapid-casting, waterclear RC-72DC. The materials’ handling qualities let the artists replicate varied coal surfaces and hand-form individual cast pieces over a substructure.\nUnder Baut’s direction, craftsmen built nearly 100 different silicone-rubber molds from large, locally mined pieces of coal. The coal’s sulfur content meant workers had to make molds from a tin-catalyzed silicone rubber. However, rigid polyurethanes chosen for the sculpture needed to be cast in platinum-catalyzed silicone rubber molds to permit easy demolding without release agents that could compromise the bond between the polyurethane and substructure.\nWorkers made intermediate tooling by lining the patterns with foundry wax, and cast platinum- catalyzed silicone molds from the wax forms. Each mold was used several times to create rigid polyurethane parts, most of them 4 × 4 ft × ½-in. thick and weighing between 25 and 30 lb.\nForming parts of that size while keeping the curing reaction from generating excess heat was another challenge. The large polyurethane pieces also had to be malleable enough at demolding to let workers reform them on the sculpture, yet tough enough to maintain the intricate coal-like patterns on their surfaces.\nTo form each polyurethane piece, craftsmen began by warming mold surfaces with heat lamps, which cut demold times and prevented shrink marks on cast surfaces. During the cure, fans held part temperature below 300°F to keep the exotherm, heat generated by the curing reaction, from overheating the part or creating a hazard. Finished castings had few defects, even when the polymer was exposed to varied ambient temperatures and humidities.\nAs soon as each coal-like slab attained green strength, workers wearing heavy, heat-resistant gloves demolded it and carried it to the sculpture. There, they formed the interlocking parts over the substructure, an aluminum and plywood support covered with squares of flame-retardant, 10-lb/ft3, open-cell polyurethane foam. Workers clamped the polyurethane slabs in place until the parts were fully cured.\nTo complete each section of the base, workers gently pulled cured slabs away from the foam subsurface and joined them to the substrate with black-pigmented polyurethane adhesive. The foam’s coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) is comparable to that of the slabs, helping ensure a durable bond. In all, the base holds about 1,000 lb of polyurethane.\nThe “diamonds” of the sculpture are RC-72DC ultraclear polyurethane cast into silicone molds. Workers incorporated varying amounts and types of pigment as well as reflective powders to get, diamondlike tetrahedrons ranging from opaque black to clear and glittering. Tight cure-cycle control prevented exotherm and shrinkage on the 3-lb parts.', 'Patent application title: Rigid Semi-Flexible Polyurethane for Structural Applications\nKenneth J.

The coating has bonded to the surface forming a superior\nadhesion which resists most kinds of damage. This coating is superior to\nnormal process painted surfaces because of the enhanced chemical bond\nthat is created during the manufacturing process. (t) A novel mold design\nallows a section of the mold to accept inserts with different designs. An\ninsert section allows inserts to be changed in the mold bowl as needed.\nInserts can be produced from a variety of materials such as, but not\nlimited to aluminum, steel, epoxy, and silicone. Using our concept,\ncustomers will be able to custom design their shingles, at a competitive\nprice, using any of the following characteristics, but not limited to\nshape, design, pattern, thickness, color, or reveal.\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n ""Not Applicable""\nSTATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT\n ""Not Applicable""\nNAMES OF THE PARTIES TO A JOINT RESEARCHING AGREEMENT\n ""Not Applicable""\nINCORPORATION-BY-REFERENCE OF MATERIAL SUBMITTED ON A COMPACT DISC\n ""Not Applicable""\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n On Feb. 22, 2008, a problem was encountered during the routine molding of decorative souvenirs using an epoxy resin with alabaster as a filler material. The resin and alabaster, after mixing, was foaming, causing the volume of the material to expand and subsequently ruining the souvenirs. After some initial investigations and trials, moisture in the alabaster was theorized to be the problem. As a solution, the alabaster powder was dried in an oven for 20 minutes at 300 degrees F. The resulting subsequent production showed that the drying corrected the problem with the mixture and the foaming was eliminated. The foamed material, while being a rigid material, had a core matrix similar to flexible polyurethane foam. The core was stiffer than normal flexible polyurethane but still maintained some flexibility which was unusual. The information was committed to memory.\n In October of 2009, discussions were had about the manufacturing of siding shingles using the resulting formulation from the trials detailed above. As a result, a molded open pour process was proposed for the production of the shingles. The following beginning formulation was proposed with a water content based on the February 2008 observations.\n Initial formulation for the development of an in mold painted siding shingle for exterior cladding for use in residential and non-residential application consisting of the following:\nTABLE-US-00001 Isocyanate 30.3% Polyol 30.3% Load 30.3% Flame-retardant 9.1% Blowing agent plus catalyst 0.1%\n A cost analysis was completed based on these initial trials. No parts were made or any other experimentation completed due to lack of funds.\n As a result of these successful first trials, the molded siding shingle concept was conceived and a cost analysis showed promise for this process of manufacturing. At the same time in mold painting of the shingles was discussed, as were various process and equipment issues. The art of in mold painting flexible, rigid, and semi-flexible urethane products is an important part of the cost effectiveness of this initial design concept. Knowledge in this field stems from prior experience in producing molded flexible polyurethane foam for the automotive and seating industries using high speed turntables and in mold painting.\n Around the first of November, the team pooled their money and had a shingle mold made. Chemicals and process equipment were obtained for the purpose of running sample parts.\n On Nov. 11, 2009, the process of running test parts began. The following formulation was used:\nTABLE-US-00002 Isocyanate 38.5% Polyol 38.5% Load 22.7% Blowing agent plus catalyst 0.3%\n Good parts were obtained after a day of experimentation. Parts were run using different formulations during the first two weeks in November using various filler materials, water parts, catalyst, and process parameters. During this period the idea of an insert for the mold was discussed. The insert system would allow the use of one mold with the ability to vary the pattern, grain, reveal, and thickness of the siding shingle. At the same time, many other products were discussed and the insert system would work on these products also. The initial prototype mold was modified on design to accommodate this insert feature.\n On Nov. 19, 2009, parts were run using the modified mold and insert concept. The following formulation was run.\nTABLE-US-00003 Isocyanate 24.9% Polyol 24.9% Load 49.8% Blowing agent plus catalyst 0.4%\n On Nov. 30, 2009, good parts were produced and the insert concept worked. At this time parts were made using the in mold paint concept. A few days of trials involving different paint and mold release combinations were tried. On Dec. 14, 2009 one combination worked well, producing a paint that bonded to the shingle substrate. The bond between the paint and shingle was excellent, passing the cross hatch test with no paint pull-up. Good parts were run in December with various filler materials trialed. The results showed that most filler material will work but that some are not cost effective.\n Continued trials resulted in several variations of the current formulation with the best results coming from the formulation utilized on Sep. 18, 2010. The formulation consisted of the following:\nTABLE-US-00004 Isocyanate 36.8% Polyol 47.3% Load 15.8% Blowing agent plus catalyst 0.1%\n Information on experiments, cost analysis, and other details are saved as hard copies.\n Testing of the in-mold coating over foam substrate for humidity, freeze thaw, adhesion, boiling water, and heat buildup was conducted with samples produced with the formulation detailed in example 4 above. All tests were conducted as planned with the exception of the heat buildup test. With the foam core, the heat will not penetrate the substrate enough to get a good reading from the bottom. Instead an infrared gun was utilized to read the surface heat and the resulting measurements were used as a guide. Though different than the standard procedure it should not change the results.\nTABLE-US-00005 Adhesion: 5B 0% Loss Boiling Water: 5B 0% Loss Humidity: No blisters or cracking at 300 hr. Freeze Thaw: No cracking after 20 cycles. Heat Buildup: HBU - 56\n In conclusion, all tests were performed on the foam substrate as indicated, with very good results on all testing. The adhesion with a 5B showed no loss of coating in standard adhesion test and Boiling Water Adhesion test. The Freeze Thaw test showed no cracking or separation of any kind after 20 cycles. Humidity test for 300 hours detected no change in the coating at all. The Heat Buildup, although adjusted for the insulation properties of the foam, indicated a very small temperature change on the surface of the material. This is in step with a lighter colored material as supplied and it is not expected that any warpage should result with most dark colors on this substrate.\n In addition to the above mentioned tests conducted by an outside laboratory, internal tests have been conducted that reflect the following results on a painted substrate in line with the examples one thru four detailed above.\nTABLE-US-00006 Water absorption: less than .5% Thermal stability: 180+ deg. Burn Test: self extinguishing (two minute exposure to flame source) Silicosis test: negative Mold and termite resistant: Pass MEK rub test: No appreciable change Cross hatch: Pass\n(1) FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n As detailed by Chittolini in U.S. Pat. No. 5,859,078, Polyurethane is well known as a base product for the manufacture of rigid, flexible, and semi flexible foams. Polyurethane foam is produced by the intimate mixing of an isocyanate component and a polyol component which contains all or some of the following homogeneous mixtures:  Polyols--reactive products of suitable molecular weight for reacting with the isocyanate to foam a rigid, flexible or semi flexible product;  Catalyst--generally tertiary amines or potassium, tin or lead slats, which regulate the reaction rate;  Surfactants--which affect the surface tension and regulate the formation of the foam;  Water--this reacts with the isocyanate to produce carbon dioxide which acts as an expander;  Flame-retardants--which regulate the behavior of the foam with respect to fire;  Expanding agents, that is, low-blowing products--which regulate the expansion of the foam;  Additives--such as fillers, dyes and pigments for various applications\n The polyol component and the isocyanate component are thermostatically controlled, metered, mixed and poured by means of suitable machines. Various formulations of the polyol component are used to produce different types of rigid, flexible, or semi-flexible foams by various processes including but not limited to;  Continuous and discontinuous production of rigid or flexible foam blocks;  Continuous or discontinuous production of rigid foam panels; poured and/or sprayed rigid foams;  Mould casted high-density rigid foams with integral skins;  Mould casted low density flexible or semi-flexible cold molded foam;  And molded semi-expanded and unexpanded mould casted foam.\n Polyurethane is well known as a base product for the manufacture of a wide variety of products including cushions, mattresses, seat padding, arm-rests, bumpers, insulation in refrigerators and freezers, insulating panels for building, insulating for pipes and tanks, as well as high-density rigid foams for furniture.\n(2) DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART\n Polyurethanes and urethanes are very much in the public domain. Flexible, rigid, and semi-flexible are a few variations of the base polyurethane formulation. The present invention varies from other common polyurethane systems as detailed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,859,078 in that no solvent blowing agents are required. The urethanes and/or silicates require moisture to cure and expand, with the addition of fillers that enhance the expansion effect.\n Composite materials detailed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,037,865 use urethanes and high filler load plus reinforcing materials to create composites. The present invention improves upon and solves problems with this patent as detailed by the following;   The composites in U.S. Pat. No. 7,037,865 absorb and retain water. The ratio of resin to load is high allowing water to be absorbed as a result of the fillers (load) not being encapsulated. The present invention provides for an adequate ratio for the urethane to properly encapsulate the fillers.   Using reinforcing materials creates vehicles by which wicking occurs, allowing water intrusion into the product. The present invention provides strength without the use of reinforcing materials.   The material strength is suspect due to high load to resin ratio. The current invention uses urethane as the basis for material strength.   The composite materials have heat related problems which cause a low melting point. The current invention\'s melting point can be varied by adjusting the chemical components of the formulation to a minimum melting point of 180°+(f).   Processing of composite materials in U.S. Pat. No. 7,037,865 is very difficult. In the present invention, handling and forming material is easily achieved, repeatable, and can be adapted to various processes to create a wide variety of products.  The composite material patent focuses on the use of microspheres as filler. The present patent uses a wide variety of fillers with the same result.\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The invention pertains to a series of formulations for and a variety of method for producing foamed materials with rigid characteristics consisting of a core matrix similar to flexible polyurethane foam. The core, which is stiffer than normal flexible polyurethane still maintains some flexibility.\nDESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n ""Not Applicable""\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION\n The invention detailed in the claim below is suitable for use in any of the following list of products for interior or exterior application such as, but not limited to, roof shingles, siding shingles, siding boards, trim, moldings, garage doors, ceiling panels, fence boards, stone, and brick panels. In addition, the material formulations detailed can be used to repair existing poured basement walls, cement block walls, columns, and various other structural components making these impervious to water intrusion. Additional details of the preferred embodiments of the invention are discussed in the latter part of the Claims.\nPatent applications in class Introducing material under pressure into a closed mold cavity (e.g., injection molding, etc.)\nPatent applications in all subclasses Introducing material under pressure into a closed mold cavity (e.g., injection molding, etc.)']"	['<urn:uuid:73ef63ec-694c-4cea-8956-3f805f14d7bc>', '<urn:uuid:fcd6af9b-3a96-442a-87bd-224cdbab0e95>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	6	75	3532
95	How did early humans' mastery of fire influence cooking methods, and what were the historical developments of kitchen stoves across different civilizations?	Early humans' mastery of fire led to the practice of cooking food, which was a significant development in the pyrocultural energy regime. The fireplace became central to daily practices, enabling humans to roast food and make it more digestible. Cooked food was like pre-digested food, requiring less energy for digestion and making more energy available for the brain. As for kitchen stoves, they evolved differently across civilizations. Chinese, Korean, and Japanese civilizations developed closed stoves early on, with clay stoves appearing in the Chinese Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC) and kamados in Japan's Kofun period. In Europe, cooking was done over open fires until the Middle Ages, when waist-high brick-and-mortar hearths and chimneys emerged, allowing cooks to tend to food without kneeling.	"[""In Part 56 I told you about the various energy revolutions and energy regimes that followed the emergence of life on Earth. Here is a recap:\n~3.8 billion years ago | Photo-energy revolution\n~2.1 billion years ago | Oxo-energy revolution\n~0.5 million years ago | Pyro-energy revolution\n~12000 years ago | Agro-energy revolution\n~400 years ago | Carbo-energy revolution\nHumans are 'thinking reeds'. Their emergence on the scene (cf. Part 57) had a societal and cultural aspect, which impacted very strongly what would otherwise have been purely raw, blind-forces-of-Nature evolution.\nHumans have been instrumental in the creation of an ‘anthroposphere’, comprising of the following four 'anthroposystems' (Niele 2005):\nHuman knowing (leading to discovery, or new observation).\nHuman capacity (leading to invention, or new creation).\nHuman action (leading to innovation, or new practice).\nHuman living (leading to diffusion, or new way of living).\nThe anthroposphere emerged ~2.5 million years ago, near the end of the aerobic energy regime. Early humans observed the hardness of stones and the sharpness of some shapes of stones. This was ‘discovery’ or earth wisdom (the first of the four anthroposystems listed above).\nThe next stage was ‘invention’, namely the creation of tools (axes, cleavers, picks) by striking stone against stone (stone technology).\nInnovation followed invention. The invented tools or artefacts were used for procuring and processing food (foraging and scavenging).\nAll this changed the way of living; an example was the emergence of the practice of cave dwelling.\nMan the toolmaker and cave dweller could survive and thrive through his earth wisdom or comprehension of his surroundings. The dominance of the human species triggered the pyro-energy revolution, resulting in the pyrocultural energy regime.\nThe aerobic regime had changed the face of the Earth. The new-look planet got ~20% oxygen in the atmosphere, and supported plants and animals. Niele (2005) has pointed out another important fallout of the aerobic regime, namely the appearance of wild fire on the scene. A new energy gradient had emerged, with wood plus oxygen serving as the energy source. The energy sink for this gradient was carbon dioxide plus water.\nIn due course, humans acquired mastery over fire. This was a development with far-reaching consequences. Anthropogenic fire can be said to have marked the beginning of the human civilization. It engendered the beginning of the pyrocultural energy regime. The new energy-dissipating structure (based on wood-burning) was societal in nature. Fire mastery meant several things: Heating; lighting; roasting of food; scaring away animals, and most significantly, the emergent social intercourse around the fireplace.\nThe societal aspect of the pyrocultural energy regime had ever-spiralling fallouts. The ever-increasing energy dissipation (through burning of wood) took the System Earth farther away from equilibrium, leading to the emergence of new kinds of complexity. Since the fire economy was a societal dissipative structure, the emergent phenomena were cultural by nature (Niele 2005). As people tended to assemble around the fireplace, emergent phenomena like coordination, communication, spoken languages, symbolic thinking, etc. were the result.\nEvolution of complexity in an energy-dissipating system involves a driving force and a shaping force. The driving force here, of course, was solar energy trapped in wood. The shaping force was human ingenuity.\nThus, for the pyrocultural energy regime:\nEnergy source: Wood plus oxygen for creating controlled fire.\nEnergy sink: Carbon dioxide plus water.\nEnergy-dissipating pathway: Societal structure around the fireplace.\nChief drivers: Humans.\nThe key phrases for the four anthroposystems characterizing the pyrocultural regime are:\nSymbolic thinking (discovery);\nfire technology (invention);\nhunting and cooking (innovation); and\nnomadic bands (new way of living).\nHumans had observed wild fires and the burning of wood, and also experienced the heat of the fire. They soon learnt how to create and sustain this fire in a controlled manner. The fireplace became a daily practice, making cave dwelling more attractive. This had a major influence on the life style of people. They could not only hunt with their tools, they could also cook the food.\nThere is a new (2011) book Modernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking, by Nathan Myhrvold et al. Among other things it explains in an appetising manner how cooking made humans smarter. Cooked food is akin to pre-digested food in certain ways. Therefore it takes the load off the intestines, thus making extra energy available for the brain. This was one of the factors leading to an increased brain size of humans, compared to the apes.\nSince humans cook their food, they spend just 5% of the day eating. Uncooked food is hard and stringy, requiring hours of chewing and still not giving the same level of nourishment. The extra time available to early humans enabled them, among other things, to look for new kinds of food, gather fruits, or lie in wait of animals for hunting.\nThe fireside not only resulted in the emergence of nomadic culture, it also provided the right milieu for the development of symbolic thinking. The fireside became the hub of social evolution, and its most important fallout was the uniquely human trait of symbolic thinking. This led to the development of language, as also an increasingly sophisticated way of looking at Nature. The coevolution of brainpower and technology, or 'memes' and artefacts, accelerated. [As I shall discuss in a future post, memes are the social equivalent of genes.] Humans even created ‘nonuseful’ artefacts like jewellery and musical instruments.\nEmergence of symbolic ‘doings’ like these has been viewed by Niele (2005) as a Symbolisational Signal, which triggered the agro-energy revolution, and the consequent agrocultural energy regime. More on that next time."", ""cooker n : a utensil for cooking\n- Rhymes: -ʊkə(r)\nA kitchen stove, cooker or cookstove is a kitchen appliance designed for the purpose of cooking food. Kitchen stoves rely on the application of direct heat for the cooking process and may also contain an oven, used for baking.\nIn the industrialized world, as stoves replaced open fires and braziers as a source of more efficient and reliable heating, models were developed that could also be used for cooking, these came to be known as kitchen stoves. When homes began to be heated with central heating systems there was less need for an appliance that served as both heat source and cooker and stand alone cookers replaced them. Cooker and stove are often used interchangeably,\nThe fuel-burning stove is the most basic design of kitchen stove. In the developing world, such stoves are still the most common cooking appliances and new, more fuel efficient and environmentally sound biomass cook stoves are being developed for use there. Modern kitchen stoves may use alternative methods for heating food. Gas and electric stoves are the most common today in western countries. Both are equally mature and safe, and the choice between the two is largely a matter of personal preference and preexisting utility outlets: if a house has no gas supply, adding one just to be able to run a gas stove is an expensive endeavour. In particular, professional chefs often prefer gas cooktops, for they allow them to control the heat more finely and more quickly. On the other hand, some chefs often prefer electric ovens because they tend to heat food more evenly. According to EnergyGuide labels on appliances sold in the U.S. and EnerGuide labels in Canada, natural gas fueled appliances are more cost-efficient for the duration of its life. Today's major brands offer both gas and electric stoves, and many also offer dual-fuel stoves combining gas cooktops and electric ovens.\nModern kitchen stoves have both burners on the top (also known as the cooktop or range or, in British English, the hob) and, as noted, an oven. A cooktop just has burners on the top and is usually installed into a countertop. A drop-in range has both burners on the top and an oven and hangs from a cutout in the countertop (that is, it cannot be installed free-standing on its own).\nEarly kitchen stoves\nChinese, Korean, and Japanese civilizations had discovered the principle of the closed stove much earlier than the West. Already from the Chinese Qin Dynasty (221 BC–206/207 BC), clay stoves that enclosed the fire completely are known, and a similar design known as kamado (かまど) appeared in the Kofun period (3rd–6th century) in Japan. These stoves were fired by wood or charcoal through a hole in the front. In both designs, pots were placed over or hung into holes at the top of the knee-high construction. Raised kamados were developed in Japan during the Edo period (1603–1867).\nIn Europe, prior to the 18th century people cooked over open fires fueled by wood, which first were on the floor or on low masonry constructions. In the Middle Ages, waist-high brick-and-mortar hearths and the first chimneys appeared, so that cooks no longer had to kneel or sit to tend to foods on the fire. The fire was built on top of the construction; the cooking done mainly in cauldrons hung above the fire or placed on trivets. The heat was regulated by placing the cauldron higher or lower above the fire..\ncooker in Danish: komfur\nDutch oven, alcohol stove, baker, barbecue, boiler, broiler, burner, caliduct, camp stove, chafer, chafing dish, cook stove, cookery, element, furnace, gas jet, grill, griller, heater, heating duct, infrared cooker, jet, pans, percolator, pilot light, roaster, samovar, steam pipe, stove, tewel, toaster, tuyere, warmer""]"	['<urn:uuid:c109736f-1b46-4dd4-86ee-8f3ea168b51d>', '<urn:uuid:83e77c91-fd1b-4a20-8f06-d1a3ad2c4135>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	22	121	1554
96	minimum deposit auction house funding sources	At property auctions, buyers must pay a minimum 10% deposit on the day of winning the bid, plus auction house commission fees. The remaining 90% must be paid within 28 days. Funding options include bridging loans, which start from £26,000 and can cover up to 80% of the property's purchase price or 70% of the OMV, as well as buy-to-let mortgages for rental properties.	['Closed Bridging Loans are a financial strategy that is most often used by residential investors or developers who are looking to fund the purchase or renovation of a property in order to refurbish and then sell.\nMost often, financing for these projects come in the form of a short term loan that is secured against the property being renovated. For Closed Bridging Loans in particular, the exit strategy or the plan in which the borrower has to repay the loan must be guaranteed by the sale or remortgage of the property being used to secure the loan.\nHere we will answer some of the most asked questions about Closed Bridging Loans – if you need additional information, a loan broker can be a great resource.\nHow Much Funding Can Be Borrowed Using a Closed Bridging Loan?\nIn most cases, the minimum borrowing amount for a Closed Bridging Loan is £26,000 and can extend to much larger amounts but some lender’s qualifications vary, so it is important to consult with a loan professional.\nAs far as security, most lenders will allow financing using the property being refurbished or purchased as long as the work is being done with the intention of selling the property through a licensed real estate agent. Closed Bridging Loans are not an option, however, if the property developer or residential investor plans to make the property his or her own permanent residence.\nWhat Loan to Value Can is Seen on Closed Bridging Loans?\nThe Loan to Value, or LTV, of the loan will depend heavily on the value of the property that is being used as security. In general, 80 percent of the property’s purchase price will be reflected in the loan’s LTV or 70 percent of the OMV.\nDepending on additional security that is available, the lender will grant either the higher or lower percentage for the loan. If you need more information on a property’s LTV rate in terms of a Closed Bridging Loan, it is always a best practice to contact a knowledgeable finance broker who is familiar with this type of funding for property resale projects.\nDoes the Property’s Geographical Area Come into Play?\nIn many cases, in order to qualify for a Closed Bridging Loan for a refurbishment project, the property must be located within a geographical area in which the lender covers. In general, areas such as Wales, England, and Scotland will be covered by most lenders.\nBefore applying for a Closed Bridging Loan, make sure that the property in question does indeed fall within the correct geographical area for the lender to help ensure there are no problems down the line. If you need help to identify whether or not the property is covered based in its location, contact a finance broker for assistance and more information.\nDoes a Borrower Need to Prove their Current Income to Qualify for a Closed Bridging Loan?\nSince Closed Bridging Loans are accepted based on the value of the property being purchased or refurbished, the borrower’s current income does not come into play when the lender makes a final decision.\nLenders will, however, take a close look at the borrower’s Experian credit report and score in order to help them make an education evaluation about what type of borrower the applicant is. Even though the borrower’s income holds no weight in the decision making, it is important to know that the applicant’s borrowing history will be looked at and evaluated when the lender is finalizing the loan.\nWill the Borrower Need to Supply Their Own Mortgage Broker or Solicitor?\nAs with any type of financing, it is always recommended that a potential borrower seek the assistance of a professional, independent mortgage broker and/or solicitor. These professional should specialize in the arena of property purchase for resale or whichever market the borrower is working in and should be consulted before signing any legal documents from a lender or financial institution.\nOften times, having retained the help of a mortgage broker or solicitor can help to streamline and speed up the loan application and approval process, making them an asset for those working in property refurbishment.\nWhat Repayment Terms can a Borrower Expect with a Closed Bridging Loan?\nThere is no benchmark for what the repayment terms for Closed Bridging Loans are. Since every borrowing situation is different, lenders will evaluate applications on a case by case basis and create repayment terms based on that particular borrower’s lending situation as well as the total amount of funding that is being borrowed.\nClosed Bridging Loan repayment terms can vary from one day to up to twelve months, all depending on the situation. In most cases, it is best to contact a finance broker to discuss the project so they can give a better idea of what the terms of the loan will look like.\nWhat Costs are Associated with Arranging Closed Bridging Loans and How Long Does the Process Take?\nAgain, there is no benchmark for the costs and fees associated with arranging a Closed Bridging Loan – each lender is different on how they evaluate the cost of their time and effort to put the loan agreement together.\nSome of the common costs and fees associated with loan are arrangement fees, valuation fees, monthly interest, and exit fees as well as whatever fees the borrower’s mortgage broker or solicitor will charge for their services.\nIn general, Closed Bridging Loans can be arranged in as little as 72 hours provided all the needed information is available and the broker replies to the lender’s questions quickly.', 'A Guide to Property Auctioning and Financing\nWhat types of people tend to sell properties at auction?\nFor most property owners, the main attraction behind selling at auction is the sheer speed at which a deal will go through. When you think of the stress of being caught up in a property chain, or the annoyance of patiently waiting for someone to show interest on the open market, you start to realize that losing a few thousand pounds on a real estate transaction is quite a healthy sacrifice to make. This is especially true if you are the type of person who is liable to start pulling out hair when faced with a frustratingly long wait for a transaction to go through that might never take place.\nOf course, a hefty percentage of those selling at auction are not made up from residential homeowners looking to sell up and move on at all. Moreover, they tend to be third parties such as mortgage and secured loan providers who are trying to recoup secured funds from broken finance agreements. When you turn up at an auction for the first time, you will also encounter a number of properties on offer from professional builders, construction companies and property investors at all levels that are looking to sell their real estate assets quickly.\nThe benefits of buying property at auction\nProperty owners who sell at auction are typically willing to accept a much lower price than the open market value in return for a fast sale and a relatively quick transference of funds. Therefore, the most obvious advantage of purchasing a property at auction is the simple fact that you can pick up a real bargain, assuming you have the cash to cover the deposit and a suitable financing strategy that can be put into place quickly once the winning bid has been accepted.\nOnce you have made a winning bid on a property that you are interested in, you can then relax safe in the knowledge that the deal will definitely go ahead. This is due to the fact that you are automatically entered into a legally binding contract with the seller once your final offer has been accepted. This means that you will not be upstaged and outdone at the last minute by another buyer offering more money for the same property, which can sometimes happen when buying through a real estate agency.\nSo, where do property auctions actually take place?\nIf you have never been to property auction before, or even heard of one taking place, then there is a perfectly sound explanation for this. The fact of the matter is that property auctions have always been somewhat secretive in nature, especially in terms of being advertised to the general public. As property auctions are typically reserved for professional investors and their exclusive little network of friends, with a touch of detective work you should be able to find out when and where the next set of bargain priced properties will be up for grabs.\nOnce you have decided on the area where you would like to buy a property, the next step is to locate the actual auction houses that deal in properties for that region. There a couple of useful websites that will provide you with the relevant information you will need and these are the Essential Information Group website (visit at eigpropertyauctions.co.uk) and the UK Auction List website (ukauctionlist.com).\nThe properties themselves are listed in an auction catalogue which is usually published around a month before the auction takes place.\nHow to prepare for an auction\nWhen it comes to buying a property at auction, the last thing you want to do is turn up unprepared. You should familiarize with the properties in the catalogue well in advance, and make arrangements to view the properties you are interested in personally. If you are prepared to put the work in, there are some real bargains to be had at auction, although the greatly reduced prices are often reflected by the condition of the building that is up for bidding. If you are not an expert yourself, then take a friend along who is, or perhaps invite an architect or builder along to inspect the property. That way, you will have a much better idea of what the work will entail and how much it will cost to put everything right.\nRemember, it’s only an auction and that you don’t have to bid at all if you aren’t comfortable or interested in any of the properties available. You could just go to familiarize yourself with everything so that you are more experienced and better prepared when you go to an auction where you will be making serious bids.\nWhat are the costs of buying at auction?\nThere are a few things you will need to pay for when you make a winning bid on a property at auction which include the following:\nAuction House fees\nThe auction house will expect you to pay an administration fee to cover their costs and this is normally around £250, depending on the auction house itself.\nYou will also need to pay the fees of the conveyancing firm you have chosen to take care of the legal aspect of the purchase.\nIf the purchase price of the property is over £125,000, you will need to pay Stamp Duty Land Tax. Anything lower than this, or under £40,000 if you have more than one property, and Stamp Duty rate falls to 0%. Stamp duty ranges from 2 to 15%, depending on the amount a property is sold for and the number of properties the buyer owns.\nOf course, once you have bought a house at auction, you will obviously need to insure it so that your investment is financially protected.\nDeposit and House Price\nThere is usually a 10% deposit to be paid on the day of the auction, once the winning bid has been accepted. After this, the buyer has 28 days to pay the remaining 90% of the house price. You could apply for a mortgage in principle before the auction, so that you know how much you can afford to borrow and when to stop bidding. However, you might be better off with a bridging loan depending on your personal requirements and intentions of what to do with the property.\nWhat are the most commonly used financing options for auction purchases?\nThere are a number of funding options designed to help those who are looking to buy property at auction and these encompass a wide range of short and long term financing solutions. Over the past few years, there has been a considerable rise in the number of first time homebuyers, buy-to-let landlords and property investors in general who are using bridging loans as their borrowing product of choice.\nIn most cases, a short term bridging loan provides the perfect solution for the interim, offering time to think and the required breathing space to organise a more suitable long-term solution such as a mortgage or secured loan.\nAre bridging loans really that useful?\nThere are many benefits associated with the use of bridging loans to cover the cost of buying property at auction. In a time-critical arena like this, the obvious advantage of bridging products is the speed at which loan applications are processed and approved. A decision to lend can be made well within the hour and the required funds can be transferred to your bank account in little more than a few days.\nWhen you buy a property at auction, you will almost certainly be required to make an initial deposit covering a bare minimum of 10% of the agreed sale price. The auction house commission fees may also be added to this amount and, in most cases, they usually are paid upfront at the same time. You will then be given 28 days to secure the rest of the funding, which is ample timing to get a bridging loan approved and paid out.\nAs well as being quick to arrange, bridging loans are also highly flexible. Unlike a traditional mortgage from a mainstream lender, the application criteria are remarkably less stringent and the amount borrowed can be secured against almost any type of property imaginable even if it is in a poor condition.\nWhat about Buy to Let Mortgages?\nIf you are buying an auction property with a view to renting it out then a more specialist borrowing product such as a buy to let mortgage is highly recommended. Of course, you will need to act quickly in order to ensure the funds are available to complete the deal within the 28 days allocated in the contract. Whereas the lending criteria on bridging loans is generally quite relaxed, buy to let mortgage providers are a lot pickier when choosing their customers. Your credit file, employment history and ability to afford the monthly repayments will all be given careful consideration when you apply for this type of finance and this is why many people are turned down for such finance.\nEven if your borrowing history serves as a glowing example to the rest of mankind, it is important to remember that your application may not be accepted if the property you are in the process of buying is in need of extensive repair work or renovation. This is because banks and building societies always want to get their money back as quickly as possible if a borrower defaults on repayments. The chance of selling a property at a decent asking price is generally quite slim when the building itself is in due need of care and attention and this is another hurdle that you may run into.\nWhen you apply for a bridging loan, the lender is only interested in your ability to make the final repayment and this is essentially referred to as the ‘exit strategy’. Unlike a conventional mortgage, bridging loans are not paid back in monthly instalments with an annual interest rate factored into the arrangement. Instead, bridging loan interest rates are calculated on a monthly basis and the net loan amount plus any additional fees and charges are typically rolled up and added to the gross balance, which is settled in full at the end of the term.\nAnother key difference is the fact that bridging loans are only intended to be short-term products, with borrowing terms ranging from 1 to 24 months. However, a select few providers have recently been testing the waters with slightly extended repayment terms and you will now see the occasional bridging loan being advertised with a 36 month product lifetime.\nHow and where should I apply for property finance?\nWhen it comes to property finance, you may quite understandably find yourself at a complete loss as to how and where to apply for an appropriate funding solution, especially if you are looking for the most favourable borrowing terms with the lowest rates and charges. In fact, being able to source, compare and weigh up the advantages of one product against another could quite easily become a full-time job in itself. Even if you apply for finance directly online using the in-house services of a principle lender, there are no guarantees that you will get the best deal or that your application will be a success.\nThe most practical solution is to seek out the services of an established broker with a proven track record and a respectable reputation for outstanding customer service. You should certainly make sure that the firm you approach is FCA authorised and regulated as this will ensure that the company is entirely obligated to find a suitable funding package for you that is completely in line with your individual requirements and best interests. – UK Property Finance']	['<urn:uuid:7b9d5a6e-1026-4a14-b2f0-16c68c98ee5b>', '<urn:uuid:96c38913-8df2-431a-87b0-fec9b2691c35>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	6	64	2890
97	How do cybersecurity breaches affect both businesses and their customers financially, and what specific types of unauthorized activities can lead to these losses?	Cybersecurity breaches can result in significant financial losses for businesses, with 75% of executives reporting harm from third-party actions. For customers, the impact includes costs of privacy notification (estimated at $30 per person), credit monitoring services, and credit freezes. Unauthorized activities that can lead to losses include data breaches, intellectual property theft, trademark infringement, and system security failures, with claims potentially reaching millions of dollars. For example, one software installation error resulted in a $1.8 million loss.	"['Failure to assess and plan for risks associated with third parties can be costly. Of the more than 250 executives surveyed by CFO Research Services, 75 percent were harmed by action or inaction of a third party, resulting in financial loss, supply chain issues and data breaches.\n“Companies initially think about risks with high-cost providers. But they may have a $10,000 contract with a small marketing or advertising firm that fails to adequately protect their customer information. Their servers get hacked and experience a breach that in turn raises concerns with their customers and brings reputational and financial risk and penalties,” says Jim Stempak, principal at Crowe Horwath LLP.\nSmart Business spoke with Stempak about assessing third-party risk and solutions to limit exposure.\nWhat poses third-party management risks?\nRelationships that drive the most risks are:\n- Service providers — processing, accounting, computer services, IT, service centers, advertising and marketing, leasing, legal and collections.\n- Supply-side partners — production outsourcing, research and development, material supplies and vendors, and software development providers.\n- Demand-side partners — customers, distributors, franchises and original-equipment manufacturers.\n- Other relationships — alliances, consortiums, joint ventures and investments.\nThe Japanese tsunami and Hurricane Sandy illustrated this. If something happens to a single-sourced company, what’s the impact on suppliers or business partners?\nWhat are some gaps that expose risk?\nA ChainLink Research study found that 70 percent of organizations reported no resilience and risk mitigation standards for service providers. It also noted that risk assessment often focuses on the easiest risks to quantify, such as financial viability and business continuity plans.\nWith supply-side partners, vendor risk assessments are hampered by a lack of good data and poor visibility into contractor use.\nHow often should companies conduct risk assessments of third parties?\nRisk assessments should be done at least annually for all vendor relationships that are high risk. Those with moderate or low risk can be done on a rotational basis.\nIn determining high-risk relationships, consider the financial risk penalty if a supplier has a breach. Another risk is reputational, such as a third party compromising private health information found in hospital records. Other high-risk areas are protection of systems and data, and reliability or continuity of operations. Are there contingency plans if a vendor faces a natural disaster or labor strike?\nMany organizations don’t address risk management of third-party relationships until a problem arises. Before that happens, establish ownership for the organization’s third-party risk management framework, and responsibility for review and monitoring of individual relationships.\nWhat other solutions address these risks?\nFirst, establish ownership and buy-in, which requires executive leadership and oversight, with clear goals and objectives. Strengthen the overall relationship with the third party. Then evaluate risks by developing a risk profile of the organization that covers financial, integrity and operational issues. This spurs initiatives to audit, inspect, benchmark performance and costs, verify, and gain assurance or attestation.\nA third-party risk management program should have:\n- Risk measurement and monitoring.\n- Performance measurement and monitoring.\n- Incident tracking.\n- Evaluation of the value received from the relationship.\nThis information guides decisions about when and whether to renegotiate an agreement. Success depends on customizing the assessment to the relationship, using automation to streamline the process, and analyzing trends of incidents.\nIn the CFO Research Services study, less than half of companies had a formal process for assessing and managing third-party risks, and 97 percent said at least one aspect of their third-party risk management should be improved. Businesses do their due diligence when entering contracts but tend to take their eyes off of it once a contract is signed.\nJim Stempak is a principal at Crowe Horwath LLP.

98	What was the median age of police officers with negative attitudes?	The median age for police officers with negative attitudes was 30 years (with an interquartile range of 27-34 years).	['Factors associated with police attitudes towards mentally ill people in Lusaka urban\nMetadataShow full item record\nObjective: The main objective of the study was to determine factors associated with Police attitudes towards mentally ill persons in the streets and Police Cells of Lusaka urban.Design: This was a case control study involving 220 consenting Police Officers, randomly selected, out of which 110 with negative attitudes constituted cases and the other half with positive attitudes were controls.To be considered a case, an Officer had to score less than 70% on an attitude scale, while any Officer who scored 70% and above was a control.Main Outcome Measure: Police attitudes towards mentally ill persons was the main outcome measure seen as positive or negative.Setting: The study covered all Police Stations and Posts in Lusaka urban where sampled subjects were to be found.Results: Because two analyses were done, instead of considering the 5% significant level, 2.5%) was considered as a cut off point for statistical significance. Thus, a p-value of 0.025 was considered significant at 95% level of confidence. The median (QuQs) ages in years for those with negative attitudes and those with positive attitudes were 30 (27,34) and 29 (26,35) respectively (p=0.014).There was statistically no significant difference in the median length of stay at work for the two groups (p=0.144). Those with positive attitudes had significantly (t-2.330; p=0.021) spent more years in school, than those with negative attitudes. There was an association between sex and attitude (p=0.017) as well as between marital status and attitude (p=0.253). Some significant difference (p<0.001) was noted in marital status between males and females in the total sample. Some association (p=0.026) was observed between handcuffing and Police attitudes towards mentally ill persons. Another significant association (p<0.001) noted was between the conviction that mentally ill people must be locked up in Chainama Hills Hospital and Police attitudes towards mentally ill persons. A listing of signs and symptoms (in category 1: violent, restless, talkative, nakedness or torn clothes) was significantly (p<0.001) higher among Officers with negative attitudes. Suggestion among Police Officers that they needed further training in skills on how to deal with mentally ill persons was significantly (p=0.024 associated with their attitudes towards mentally ill persons. An association between the conviction that breast-feeding mentally ill mothers should be allowed to breastfeed and attitude was observed (p=0.025). After adjusting for confounding factors, breast-feeding was the only factor independently associated with the outcome.Officers who stated that mentally ill breast-feeding mothers should be allowed to continue breast-feeding were 28% (95% CI; 0.55,0.94; p=0.015) less likely to have negative attitudes towards mentally ill persons.conclusion and Recommendations: We conclude that there was an association between socio-cultural belief (e.g. breast-feeding, marrying a person with history of mental illness) related to mental illness stigma, and Police attitude towards mentally ill persons. There was no association between training, education, personal experience in dealing with mentally ill persons and attitude.The report concludes with a recommendation that health education targeting socio-cultural beliefs of the Police regarding mentally ill persons should be introduced quite early in their training and this must be on going even after graduation. This should be augmented by the introduction of a training module/component in their curriculum, which involves visits to practical sites like Chainama Hills College Hospital Board.\n- Medicine']	['<urn:uuid:b7b94ab5-df8c-44a6-909b-b44b1f596f68>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	11	19	544
99	what percentage children get otitis media ear infection by age 2 symptoms and causes	Otitis media is the second most common childhood disease, with over 80% of children experiencing at least one episode before age 2. It occurs just behind the eardrum and typically presents with symptoms including fever, irritability, otorrhea, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea and sometimes hearing loss in children. Ear infections don't spread between people but usually occur as a secondary infection following a cold. While mostly bacterial (98%), they can occasionally be viral or fungal.	['- URTI : Upper Respiratory Tract Infections\n- LRTI : Lower Respiratory Tract Infections\n- AECOPD : Acute Exacerbations in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\nUpper Respiratory Tract Infections\nOtitis is a general term for infection or inflammation of the ear, usually bacterial (98%) and occasionally fungal or viral. It is part of upper respiratory infections (URI). Ear infections do not spread from person to person and they most commonly occur as a surinfection following a cold. Antibiotics are often used to treat ear infections.\nDifferent forms of otitis can be found :\nOtitis externa (acute, chronic or malignant) which involves the outer ear and ear canal.\nOtitis media (acute, chronic, with effusion) which involves the middle ear with a localisation just behind the eardrum. The usual symptomatic presentation is known as acute otitis media and is characterized often by fever, irritability, otorrhea, letargy, vomiting, diarrhoea and hearing loss in some children. Otitis media is the second most common childhood disease and it can occur at any age. It is estimated that over 80 % of children would have experienced at least one episode before the age of 2.\nOtitis interna (Labyrinthitis) is an inflammation of the inner ear when bacteria move from the naso-pharynx to reach the level of the alignment of the ear.\nThe annual incidence of acute otitis externa is between 1/100 and 1/250 of the general population and 256/1000 for acute otitis media in European children under 5 years.\n|Main bacteria involved in OTITIS\n|Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida\nThe most common bacteria responsible for Otitis Externa, Media and Interna\nRhino-sinusitis (or sinusitis) is an inflammation or infection of the lining of the sinus cavities, triggered by a viral, bacterial or fungal infection.

In Europe, acute sinusitis affects an estimated 2 % and chronic rhino-sinusitis 10 % of the adult population.\nSinusitis can be :\n- Acute, which is usually caused by a bacterial infection in the sinuses that results from an upper respiratory tract infection.\n- Sub-acute or chronic, which refers to long-term swelling and inflammation of the sinuses that may be caused by bacteria (such as Staphylococcus aureus) or fungus and may involve allergy, environmental factors (pollution…).\n|The different sinusitis\n|Symptoms last for up to 4 weeks\n|Symptoms last for 4-12 weeks\n|Symptoms last for 3 months or longer\n|Main pathogens involved in Rhino-sinusitis\n|Streptococcus pneumoniae (30-35%), Haemophilus influenzae (20-25 %), Moraxella catarrhalis (20%), Staphylococcus aureus\n|Rhinovirus, Influenza A et B, Parainfluenza, Coronavirus (which are the primary pathogens), Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Adenovirus and Enterovirus\n|Aspergillus, Alternaria, Bipolaris and Curvularia species\nThe most common pathogens responsible for Rhino-sinusitis\nTonsillitis is an inflammation of the glands of the throat. It is mostly caused by viruses, and, in 10 to 30 % of cases, by bacteria. The tonsils are two glands located in the back of the throat that help to protect the body from upper respiratory infections. In Europe, the prevalence in community studies is estimated to 2-4 % (20 000 – 40 000 individuals per million population).\nTonsillitis is mainly transmitted from one person to another by social contact, by droplets in the air from sneezing. The symptoms of tonsillitis are essentially fever, sore throat, pain when swallowing, headache. In some cases, complications are possible, they include cervical adenitis and tonsil abscess.\nDifferent treatments exist to reduce tonsillitis symptoms :\n- Use of paracetamol / ibuprofen or anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, corticosteroids).\n- When tonsillitis is caused by bacteria, use of antibiotics such as penicillin or amoxicillin.\n|Main pathogens involved in Tonsillitis\n|Adenovirus, Rhinovirus, Influenza, Coronavirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus.\nIt can also be caused by Epstein-Barr Virus, Herpes Simplex Virus, Cytomegalovirus, or HIV.\n|Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcal pharyngitis, Staphylococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Pertussis, Fusobacterium, Diphtheria, Syphilis and Gonorrhea.\nThe most common pathogens responsible for Tonsillitis\nLaryngitis is the medical term for inflammation and swelling of the larynx, characterized by voice loss and irritation of the vocal cords.\nThere are two types of laryngitis : acute or chronic.\nAcute laryngitis is usually caused by an infection that inflames the vocal cords, but may also be caused by voice overuse with excess talking, singing or shouting.\nChronic laryngitis lasts over a week and comes back over time.

It is a progressive Chronic disease which is characterised by a decline in respiratory function and the worsening of symptoms provoke what are known as exacerbation.\nThe frequence of exacerbations has an impact on individual’s life expectancy. Moreover, they represent a significant cause of hospital admission and readmission. Acute exacerbations are an important cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with AECOPD.\nAECOPD is the fourth leading cause of death and affects over 210 million people worldwide. In Europe, the prevalence in adult population has been estimated between 4-10 % . The development of AECOPD is not completely understood and may also depend on gender, genetic and socioeconomic factors (exposures to dusts, chemicals, pollutants).\nThe principal risks factor associated with AECOPD are :\n- Smoking, (50 % of chronic smokers develop AECOPD).\n- Air pollution and chemical fumes or dust from the environment.\n- Genetics, in rare cases (deficiency of a protein which is called alpha-1 antitrypsin).\nTwo main forms of COPD exist : chronic bronchitis and emphysema :\n- Chronic bronchitis is a cough with sputum production on most days during 3 months per year, for two consecutive years.\n- Emphysema is an enlargement of the air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles with destruction of their walls (which reduces the surface available for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide).\nAcute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are commonly triggered by bacterial or viral pathogens and also pollutants. Typically, infections cause 75% or more of the exacerbations, bacteria alone can be found in roughly 25% of cases, viruses in another 25%, and viruses and bacteria coinfection in another 25%.\nFurthermore, other factors may provoke exacerbations, such as environmental pollution (nitrogen dioxide)\n|Main pathogens involved in AECOPD\n|Rhinovirus (66%), Influenza, Parainfluenza, Coronavirus Adenovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Picornavirus, Metapneumovirus.\n|Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosas.\nThe most common pathogens responsible for AECOPD\n- Rhinovirus (66%)\n- Respiratory syncitial virus\n- Noncapsulated Haemophilus influenzae\n- Moraxella catharrhalis\n- Streptococcus pneumoniae\n- Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nTuberculosis is an infection caused by the koch bacillus Mycoplasma tuberculosis which attacks the lungs but may involve any other body part, especially bones and brain in case of inadequate containment by the immune system. Various tuberculosis causes exist, among them: weak immune system, poverty, vicious life, no strict hygiene, alcoholism. In 2008, there was an estimated 9.4 million incident cases of tuberculosis and the prevalence of the disease is estimated to be 200 per 100 000 population in the world. In Europe, the number of tuberculosis cases was 322 310 in 2008 and the annual cost is estimated to 2.1 billion euros per year.\nTuberculosis bacteria are transmitted through air from one person to another via small droplets of saliva produced when speaking, coughing, sneezing.\nWhen the inhaled tuberculosis bacteria enter the lungs, they can multiply and cause a local lung infection (pneumonia). In most patients, within weeks from infection, the immune system limits propagation of tuberculosis infection resulting in asymptomatic that may remain in the body for many years. About 5 % of infected persons will develop the disease.']	['<urn:uuid:6d25d338-b1df-46b6-96ef-41ef4827be6c>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:55:22.640870	14	73	1914
100	I'm new to teaching and have some students who don't speak English as their first language. What are three key ways that I can help these English language learners succeed in my classroom?	There are three essential ways to help English language learners succeed: First, provide small-group language instruction and maximize teacher-student interaction to accelerate language development. Second, make your ELL students feel welcome and create a safe, supportive environment where they can practice. Third, use visual aids and different teaching methods, including diagrams, photos, and drawings to help students connect English words to their meanings.	"['English to Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL)/ Dual Language Bilingual Education (DLBE)\nAdrienne Viscardi, Director of ESOL Programs, K-12\n“If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart.”\nServing a distinct and dynamic population, the K-12 Department of English to Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) aims to promote the academic excellence, creativity, and wellness of English language learners. Specifically, the Department endeavors to advance district efforts to reduce the achievement gap among students of culturally, ethnically, and linguistically diverse backgrounds. New York State’s recent adoption of the Common Core Standards prompts a timely review of the ESOL Department’s structure, resources, and instructional approaches\nThe district recognizes that ELLs come to the country and classroom with varied educational, linguistic, and economic backgrounds. Among the factors affecting students’ academic achievement and community membership are the experiences of literacy, migration, and financial hardship. ESOL faculty and staff actively participate in community efforts that fortify the home-school connection with this segment of the population. The ESOL Department seeks to collaborate with leadership and clinicians in a thoughtful review of existing programs and services to determine whether the district or larger community adequately addresses the specific needs of ELLs and their families.\nAt every grade level, ESOL instruction is designed in alignment with the Common Core Learning Standards and the TESOL Standards of English Language Proficiency. Specifically, students develop academic language proficiency in listening, speaking, reading, and writing through the content areas. Entering and emerging ELLs receive intensive language instruction in small groups concurrent with the literacy instruction of their native English-speaking peers. The ESOL faculty strives to develop students’ basic interpersonal communication skills and instructional language, laying a foundation in academic language proficiency for studies across the disciplines.\nIn addition to their mandated English language and literacy instruction, ELLs participate in mainstream classroom experiences upon entry into the district. Where larger clusters of ELLs exist in a single section, essential scaffolding is provided through a co-taught model or with the support of a teacher and/or instructional assistant. Optimally, transitional and expanding ELLs receive small-group language instruction in addition to receiving grade-level content instruction in the mainstream classroom, where ESOL and content-area teachers work collaboratively or with content-area teachers in sheltered classes in accordance with the SIOP protocol.\nThe ESOL faculty recognizes that achieving English proficiency according to state measures is only one indicator of academic achievement. To this end, the Department aspires to monitor the continued progress of former LEP students through direct instruction, co-teaching, and consultation with mainstream teachers. Similarly, the Department believes that language minority students who are not LEP eligible but demonstrate similar gaps in vocabulary and comprehension would benefit from ESOL instruction.\nOur Guiding Principles\nTheory, research, and evidence-based practice in multiple arenas drive the work of the K-12 ESOL Department. Specifically, the Department has derived a shared set of beliefs rooted in the fields of second language acquisition, bilingual studies, multicultural theory, and immigration studies. The ESOL Department aims to develop and maintain a continuum of service rooted firmly in these principles.\n- English language learners rise to the same high expectations that are established for all students.\n- Language learning is a developmental, not remedial, process.\n- English language learners receive distinct language instruction designed for second language learners.\n- A learner’s ability in his or her first language informs instruction in the second language.\n- Culturally and linguistically diverse learners require thorough and explicit instruction in content and language.\n- English language learners actively develop proficiency in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in classes exposing them to demanding content material and strong models of language.\n- Smaller instructional groups and classes maximize teacher-student interaction and interaction among students, accelerating ELLs’ language development.\n- Educators evaluate ELLs using appropriate and valid assessments that consider a student’s level of English proficiency and cultural background.\n- All educators share responsibility for the academic success of ELLs with the family and the community.\n""Language should be a central part of the curriculum but not [only] because bilingualism postpones the onset of dementia: any intellectually engaged activity requiring intense involvement will keep your brain healthy. Learning other languages is important because it helps you understand other people, other cultures, other ways of thinking. Even if it didn\'t change your brain, there are just so many benefits.""\n----Dr. Ellen Bialystok\nNeuroscientist and Distinguished Research Professor at York University', 'Top Tips for Teaching English Language Learners (ELL)All Posts\nWritten by Melanie Arden\nProdigy English is here! Get your students playing — and learning — today.\n- Teaching Strategies\n- Prodigy English\nEnglish Language Learners — or ELLs — refers to students whose native language is not English. Some ELL students have difficulty mastering this academic language without the help of ELL strategies.\nNot all ELL students struggle to learn English. Some languages, such as Spanish, have similar sounding and spelled words. Languages based on character inscriptions might make English challenging to learn for people who are unaccustomed to written words.\nWant to learn how to effectively teach ELLs in your classroom? We’ll cover the importance of English language skills and offer tips for teaching ELLs with effective strategies.\nWhat is ELL and why it it important?\nELL describes a non-English-speaking student aged 5 years and older who learns English as a second language. They’re unable to progress academically until they receive consistent English language instruction and practice.\nThere are six ELL levels to consider:\n- Beginner - Intermediate\n- Intermediate - Advanced\n- Achieved written and verbal fluency\nThe primary educational goal focuses on helping students learn English communication quickly. It\'s important for students to become proficient in English to enhance their social and academic development. They\'ll become successful and productive members of society.\nApproximately 10% of elementary school-age children are ELL students. The National Education Association estimates that by 2025, at least 25% of the student population will be English language learners.\nNon-English-speaking students often encounter difficulties with reading comprehension and math skills. What can you do to help integrate ELL students into their classrooms?\nUse these tips to support your English language learners:\n- Foster ELL students\' English literacy through reading, math, and other subjects that interest them. Offer help whenever they need it.\n- Make your ELL students feel welcome every day. Give them the comfort and stability to learn English in a safe and supportive environment.\n- Understand that ELL students don\'t have the same vocabulary as their peers. Patience is the key to help them learn new words with vocabulary strategies.\n- Encourage English-speaking students to engage with ELLs. Regular social interactions and opportunities to practice help ELLs learn English faster and with greater accuracy, and help you teach a diverse classroom.\n- Promote inclusivity by involving students in class activities and discussions. Although they might not completely understand their new language, it\'s crucial to their success to allow them to share and feel like they belong.\nWhen students gain proficiency in English, they\'re well prepared for high school and college education programs.\nHow has ELL evolved over time?\nELL emerged as an alternative to ESL (English as a Second Language) thanks to the inconsistencies associated with English as only a second language. For many students, English is a third or fourth language at home, making ESL an incorrect term. It made more sense to replace ESL with ELL to accurately describe someone new to the English language.\nELL also refers to students who must learn English to take part in academic programs abroad. College-age exchange students might travel to English-speaking countries for a year or longer. It makes sense for them to learn English to prepare for their new school adventure.\nPotential challenges when teaching ELL\nEducators face many challenges associated with teaching ELLs. One of the top issues includes properly assessing and accommodating each student. But there are other challenges, too:\n- Consider diversity and culturally responsive teaching when assessing individual needs\n- Lack of training for non-ELL teachers in proper instruction techniques and making accurate student assessments.\n- Classrooms can have ELL students from several countries, each with their own unique abilities, struggles, and identities.\n- Language barriers to parent and teacher communications. If students are new to English, the same might hold true for their parents, preventing them from fully taking part in parent teacher conferences.\nHow can educators cope with these challenges?\n- Ask your school board for ELL teacher training and student/parent resources.\n- Make learning materials accessible to students and their parents via a class website or learning management system.\n- Encourage parents to learn English with their kids. They can help each other gain fluency sooner if they practice their new language at home.\n- Break down language barriers when communicating with parents and teachers. Try digital language tools like iTranslate, Google Translate and Microsoft Translator to connect with your ELLs.\n- Use digital tools like ESL Video to give students supportive interactive content, Visual Dictionary Online for vocabulary building, and Starfall (a free service) that offers ELL elementary learners fun interactive materials in language, art and music.\nDespite any difficulties related to ELL, there are options available to help you overcome these challenges. Don’t be afraid to ask your school administrators for help.\nWays to help English language learners improve\nThere are many ways to support ELL students on their language development journey. Look for fun ways to enhance their learning. Encourage your ELLs to watch movies and educational television shows such as Sesame Street, listen to popular music, or play board games with native English-speaking peers. Each of these components makes up a fun and creative learning environment for English language learners to grow and improve their skills.\nHere are more actionable tips for teaching English language learners:\nMake a point of checking in with your ELL students every day. Consistent communication between teachers and students shows you care about their language development. Keep them engaged and include them in regular discussions to build a positive relationship.\nMotivate your ELL students to listen, ask questions, and use non-verbal communication if they\'re struggling to share their frustrations surrounding their language development.\nSpeak slowly & pause between communication\nDo you sometimes wonder if you\'re talking too fast to your students? Record yourself during a lesson, note how fast you speak and listen to your rhythm. It will take time for you to slow down, but it will benefit your English language learners.\nELL students need teachers to speak slower. If you wait three to five seconds after asking a question, it allows your students to translate from their native language to English. Give them the buffer of a few more seconds to think about their answers.\nUse different methods of teaching\nELL teaching methods help educators to engage students in meaningful ways. We\'ve outlined four effective teaching methods to get you started on successful ELL instruction:\n- Develop a caring and supportive relationship with your ELL students.\n- Encourage your students to apply their new language skills to other subjects like math and social science with interdisciplinary learning projects.\n- Use game-based learning platforms like Prodigy English to boost key language and reading skills in a fun world-building game. Plus, you can track student progress as they play!\n- Feature art as an effective way to deepen students\' understanding of the English language. They can create their own books with pictures and a story, or add drawings in their notebooks.\n- Add visuals to make learning easier. Incorporate the use of diagrams, photos, drawings and other visual aids to help your students connect English words to the meaning shown on the images. Keep students engaged by getting them to make their own visual aids.\nGauge achievement gaps\nAchievement gaps exist for both ELL and non-ELL students. There are ways for educators to gauge these gaps while helping students to grow and develop their English communication skills.\nBut what is an achievement gap?\nAn achievement gap is defined as a gap in students\' academic performance. Several factors, including socioeconomic status, lack of technology, and low acclimation cause these gaps.\nWe discovered six techniques to help you close achievement gaps:\n- Offer supplemental lessons for struggling students.\n- Give students time to let lessons sink in and avoid information overload.\n- Be patient and remain open to finding other teaching methods to help your students learn and grow.\n- Keep an open dialogue with parents. Get them involved in their child\'s language development. Make it a team effort so that kids learn in school and at home.\n- Look for ways to personalize your teaching strategies. Accommodate differing learning goals and levels of understanding. Remember, one size doesn\'t fit all.\n- Create goals and track students\' progress in all subjects. You can use apps like SpeakingPal, Quizlet, and Kahoot to help your students succeed in their English language studies.\nUse native languages at times\nDon\'t be afraid to ask your ELL students to use their native language when they review course materials. Their native language provides a foundation for building their new English language skills. If kids get stuck translating words, they should be encouraged to use apps like Google Translate for help.\nDuolingo makes learning new languages fun and easy. Based on a game environment, your students can learn a range of languages, including Spanish, French, Arabic, Italian, and much more. Best of all, it\'s free!\nTechnology continues to be a great ""language bridge"" between teachers and students. Google Translate receives top honors in assisting teachers in translating words and phrases into their students\' native language. Keep in mind that technology isn\'t perfect. Translations don\'t always make sense.\nIt is wise to use translation technology sparingly. Students should not become too dependent on its use.\nBuild on success when teaching ELL\nPractice and build upon teaching methods that work best for your students. It\'s important to try more than one strategy to provide several learning opportunities for growth and development.\nConsider putting yourself in your ELL students\' shoes to understand what it means to learn a new language. Understand that they\'re facing cultural differences and need to be seen as individuals instead of as a collective of ELL students.\nTry combining multiple teaching strategies to discover what works and what doesn\'t. A well-rounded education encompassing diverse teaching methods helps your ELL students reach their English language proficiency sooner and benefits every student in your classroom!\nWant more ways to engage ELL students?
