1	philosophy children benefits critical thinking	Teaching philosophy to children helps develop critical thinking skills that can be applied to standardized tests. More importantly, it encourages children to become independent thinkers and inquirers who develop their own ideas rather than just fitting into a slot. It also helps them reflect on moral issues, not by telling them what is good, but by giving them the ability to think about moral questions themselves.	"[""Gareth B. Matthews was in Japan last year talking to fifth-graders about perfect happiness.\nHe read them a story he had written about a child absorbed in the satisfaction of scratching an insect bite. Could this define perfect happiness?\n“Scratching an insect bite and enjoying it so much that at the moment you don’t enjoy anything else is only one petal on the flower of happiness,” one child said.\nMatthews, a philosophy professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, was impressed.\n“Adults are not generally aware of the fact that children are capable of raising interesting philosophical questions and pursuing interesting philosophical issues,” he said.\nBut elementary school children are doing just that.\nMatthews travels worldwide explaining concepts of teaching philosophy to children, an interest of his since the early 1970s. His book “Dialogues With Children” contains stories he wrote and discussions that followed.\nThe philosophy-for-children movement is gaining momentum in the United States as well.\nMount Holyoke College philosophy professor Thomas E. Wartenberg teaches a course called “Philosophy for Children.” College students help develop questions based on picture books and then lead discussions for second- and fifth-graders at Jackson Street Elementary School in Northampton, Mass. Out of the adventures of storybook characters come such questions as “What is courage?” Lively discussions develop around the topics of beauty, truth, justice and reality.\nUnder Wartenberg’s supervision, college students help grade-schoolers create a “community of inquiry” in which children learn the crucial elements of a philosophic discussion. He tells children, “You have to listen carefully and think hard and then make up your mind. If you can’t defend your answer, you have to think some more.”\nAt the end of six weeks of philosophy classes at Jackson Street this year, fifth-grade teacher Susan D. Fink said the experience has many benefits.\nThe class had a wide-ranging discussion about courage after reading one of Arnold Lobel’s Frog and Toad stories, “Dragons and Giants.” In it, two friends decide to test their bravery by going on an adventure that sends them running back to the house. Still, they decide that they are, in their own way, brave.\n“They think about the difference between bravery and stupidity,” Fink said. “They think a long time when someone dares them. They’re connecting it to the world when you ask big questions.”\nIn the early 1970s philosopher Matthew Lipman founded the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children at Montclair State University in New Jersey.\nLipman makes bold claims for the work. “The children who cannot make sense of their own experience, who find the world alien, fragmentary and baffling, are likely to cast about for shortcuts to total experiences, and eventually may experiment with drugs or succumb to psychoses,” he writes in “Philosophy in the Classroom,” co-authored with Ann Margaret Sharp and Frederick S. Oscanya. “Possibly we could teach children before they reach out for such desperate remedies by helping them find the meanings so lacking in their lives.”\nMatthews said many teachers consider philosophy a luxury for which they lack time under pressure to cover curriculum material aimed at preparation for standardized testing. But he said it develops critical thinking skills that students can apply to such tests.\nIn addition, he said, “We want to encourage children to be independent thinkers and inquirers, to develop their own ideas and not just fit into a slot.”\nThe story about scratching the bug bite, he said, raises larger questions, such as, “`Is perfect happiness being zonked out on drugs or drink?’ You need to have more desires than being high. It doesn’t keep people from using drugs, but it encourages them to think about the broader life.”\nPhilosophy “helps them reflect on moral issues. It doesn’t tell them what it is to be good. That’s important too. But morality is going to be unimportant unless you include the ability to reflect on moral issues.”\nIn the last class of the year at Jackson Street Elementary School, second- and fifth-graders read Dr. Seuss’ “Oh, the Thinks You Can Think.”\nThey talked about things called bloogs and things called thinks and about imagination, reality, art and other topics.\nAfterward, fifth-grader Leela C. Riesz said she had thought philosophy was only for grown-ups with big ideas. But, she said, “My sister is in second grade and she’s doing it. Anyone can do philosophy.”\nWyatt Y. Fedora learned, “There are infinite questions and every question doesn’t have a proven answer.”\nAlyssa V. Lopez said she never knew children’s books contained so many philosophical questions. “There’s so many other things behind the cover of the book you never saw,” she said.\nAnd this from her classmate Louis M. Gaudet: “You can look at things from different angles. I used to see it one way and be done with it. Now I see it one way and think of another.”\nMount Holyoke student Sarah Ernst says such discussions can comfort children.\n“It’s a lonely world even for children with friends,” Ernst said. “(It’s nice) to know that other people are questioning things and that even the authority figures don’t have all the answers.”\nLocal journalism is essential.\nGive directly to The Spokesman-Review's Northwest Passages community forums series -- which helps to offset the costs of several reporter and editor positions at the newspaper -- by using the easy options below.

2	How do modern rice cultivation practices affect both global food security and greenhouse gas emissions, and what solutions are being developed to address these challenges?	Rice cultivation significantly impacts both food security and climate change. Vietnam's rice output reached 42.8 million tonnes in 2020, with high-grade rice varieties expanding to 74% of production, up from 50% in 2015. This improvement in quality and productivity helps ensure food security. However, rice farming is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing about 11% of total global methane emissions, estimated at 25.6 Tg/year in 2000. The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) offers a solution by reducing methane emissions while enhancing food security. SRI method can increase yields by more than 50% compared to conventional methods, reduce water usage by 50%, and significantly decrease methane emissions by preventing anaerobic conditions through intermittent irrigation. This method also improves soil quality through organic fertilizer use and increases farmers' income through reduced production costs.	['Vietnam : Rice exports enjoy opportunities for breakthrough in 2021\nHigh hopes are pinned on Vietnam’s rice exports in 2021 when major export markets such as the Philippines and Africa continue to sign contracts to buy rice from Vietnam, while many others have great demand for fragrant rice and sticky rice – which are advantageous staples of Vietnamese enterprises.\nThe bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements between Vietnam and other countries such as the EU-Vietnam and the UK-Vietnam FTAs with preferential tariffs would create favourable conditions for Vietnamese rice to compete with that from rival countries, the Vietnam Food Association said.\nAccording to the Vietnamese Trade Counsellor in the UK Nguyễn Cảnh Cường, rice shipments to the country this year will sharply rise against 2020. He added more UK firms will purchase Vietnamese rice under the UK-Vietnam FTA, creating a chance for Vietnamese rice to expand its market share in the UK this year.\nIn 2019, rice exports from Vietnam to the UK had a leap forward with a turnover growth of 376 per cent. That meant the UK has great potential as a rice export market for Vietnam.\nIn order to tap into the advantages under FTAs, rice export giants such as Intimex JSC, Lộc Trời Group, VRICE Co, Trung An High Technology Agriculture JSC are planning to seek new customers in markets where Việt Nam had signed FTAs, especially in the UK, baotintuc.vn reported.\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade said it would provide rice export firms with information about the market demand situation in a timely manner while implementing trade promotion activities to help Vietnamese rice exporters better access customers.\nDetailed information about the regulations and barriers under these FTAs’ commitments will be also offered by the ministry so that businesses can improve their understanding and draw up suitable business plans.\nAs part of its efforts to facilitate Vietnam’s rice exports, the VAF has built up online sales channel and participated in online trade seminars to develop the rice industry.\nIt suggested rice exporters focus on high quality products with good export results, ensuring food hygiene and safety to be able to enter fastidious markets such as Europe, America and Canada.\nExperts have said that if Việt Nam wants to maintain rice export growth in 2021 it needs to focus on building a complete rice value chain and controlling quality in production, processing, and distribution.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Việt Nam’s rice output totalled 42.8 million tonnes in 2020, down about 0.2 per cent because of the shrinkage of some 192,000 hectares in farming areas. However, the productivity rose 50kg per hectare from a year earlier.\nThe areas of high-grade rice varieties have expanded to 74 per cent, compared to 50 per cent in 2015, as a result of the country’s efforts in improving the value of the Vietnamese rice.\nThanks to that, the shipments of high-grade rice made up more than 85 per cent of the total, resulting in the growth of average rice price from US$440 per tonne in 2019 to $496 per tonne in 2020.\nThe country exported 6.15 tonnes of rice for $3.07 billion last year, down 3.5 per cent in volume but up 9.3 per cent in value year-on-year.\nThe Philippines was Vietnam’s leading rice importer, making up 34 per cent of the total. Rice exports to this market in 2020 reached 2.22 million tonnes and $1.06 billion, up 4 per cent in volume and 19.3 per cent in value compared to 2019.\nVietnam News – February 14, 2021', 'Reducing methane emissions from rice farming by ClimateRe\nReducing Methane Emission While Enhancing Rice Farmers’ Resilience to Climate Change\nThe rice farmers are perceived as emitters of GHGs (mainly methane) which they are largely unaware of. Nepalese rice farmers bear the adverse effects of GHGs in terms of climate change felt in forms of erratic monsoon rainfalls, which is the main source of water for rice cultivation. Unpredictable and inadequate monsoon directly result in a rice yield decline, which is one of the reasons for an increasing trend of food imports in Nepal.\nSystem of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a proven alternative rice growing method enabling rice farmers to cope with these adverse effects of climate change and actively participate in mitigating GHG emission. SRI relies on intermittent irrigating and draining of water to avoid anaerobic conditions and the subsequent emission of methane. Additionally, SRI is estimated to reduce fresh water use in rice cultivation by about 50%, reduce production cost and increase income for farmers which will enhance household food security.\nThe proposed project is located in the South of Nepal covering 55,000 ha. By changing the current rice growing (flooding) practice to the SRI method the climate resilience of more than 56’000 farmers will be increased and 500,000 tons of CO2eq will be abated. Although, the SRI method is promising, key challenge is its wider adoption by farmers. Therefore, the program begins with creating social environment in the target communities, followed by closely supervised technical training and follow-up support during the entire rice growing season to enable them cope with the perceived risks and uncertainties while changing their age old practice.\nDifferently to other SRI projects, it does not rely on grants and funds, but instead the project will be developed as a carbon offset program. This will not only guarantee financial sustainability but will also increase prospects for a successful up-scaling to other parts of South-East Asia.\nWhat actions do you propose?\nThe research results indicate that globally rice field emit about 11% of the total methane. The estimated global emission for 2000 was 25.6 Tg/year. Practices such as draining rice field and applying rice straw offseason can reduce global methane emissions by 7.6 Tg/year (Yan et al., 2009).\nIn Nepal, rice is a staple food crop grown in 1.5 million hectares with a low average yields of 3 tons/ha and accounts for 32% of the total methane emission. In this context, it is important that the conventional rice growing method is replaced by an environment-friendly and socio-economically beneficial one. System of Rice Intensification (SRI) method is a promising option that significantly reduces methane emission, uses less water, minimizes cost of production and increases the yield. The SRI is a scientifically proven alternative rice growing method that is currently introduced in 28 countries world-wide. In conventional rice growing method, rice field is flooded with water during the growing season causing anaerobic condition and resulting in methane emission. In contrast, SRI method does not flood the rice field but maintains soil moisture keeping it well-drained and aerated that facilitates aerobic condition, thereby, reducing the formation of methane. Primarily, it focuses on developing strong root system and healthy soil conditions resulting in a robust plant physiology that is more adapted to adverse growing conditions.\nThe proposed project will promote System of Rice Intensification (SRI) in Nepal covering about 50,000 ha in 10 years. In this area the conventional rice growing method is practiced, producing an average yield of 3 tons/ha. Whereas, the research results of SRI method conducted by the District Agriculture Development Office (DADO - a government agency for agriculture) is 6.3 tons/ha while using about 50% less water.\nAlthough SRI method is promising, the key challenge is its wider adoption by farmers. It requires a major ‘change’ in farmers’ attitude and appropriate supports to cover the risk involved in the transition phase while adopting a new method, as rice farming is the livelihood base of the majority farmers. They need to learn not only new technical skills but also gain adequate experiences to master the new method.\nThe district coordinators implement and monitor the planned project activities, assisted by field assistants and leader farmers. The project activities include:\nAwareness actions - to create an enabling environment for the introduction of new SRI method. Orientation on SRI method will be conducted in the project area prior to introduction of SRI method for farmers and all relevant parties, i.e. government agency like DADO, Non Government Organizations (NGOs), media personnel, local leaders and other relevant stakeholders. It intends to creating supportive environment and hence, prepare farmers in deciding for adopting SRI method.\nTraining - technical capacity building of farmers and their leadership role in the scaling up activities. In each district, field level trainings will be conducted for selected leader farmers at several stages of the rice growing season. Thereafter, the trained leader farmers will be further trained and mobilized for the scaling up of SRI method to peer farmer groups in their neighborhood.\nDemonstration sites – trials plots for farmers to observe and compare the physiological differences between rice grown under SRI method and conventional method. Trial plots will be established in coordination with the Farmers groups, National Agricultural Research Council (NARC) and DADO. It will help farmer see and learn from the real field situation which is more convincing than abstract learning.\nMonitoring of methane emission at specific sites in the rice fields and project activities. Regular data will be collected from both sample plots (SRI method and conventional method) during the entire rice growing seasons. This will provide reliable data to standardize methane emission level from rice fields for Nepal and to estimate total amount of methane reduced annually through SRI method.\nMass Information dissemination to other farmers in the project area. A weekly local FM radio program will broadcast relevant information on SRI method during the rice growing season (June - Sep and Feb - May). Additionally, posters and booklets will complement the information dissemination process.\nScaling up – to create demand for low carbon rice and to introduce the SRI method to other countries. Our target is to promote low carbon rice among large retailers (e.g. Walmart, Aldi, etc.) and large food companies using rice as ingredient (e.g. Mars, Nestle, etc.) to create additional demand.\nWho will take these actions?\nClimateRe will coordinate and manage the project in collaboration with Department of Agriculture, farmer cooperatives and local implementing agency /NGO. ClimateRe will also be responsible to develop this project as a carbon offset program.\nDepartment of Agriculture: The government support is vital to create supportive environment (including regulatory) for implementation and scaling up of SRI. District agriculture department office will also be responsible for promoting, and monitoring and evaluation after the project phases out.\nFarmer cooperatives: Reaching to farmers through cooperatives will be more efficient and effective. And thus rice farmer cooperatives will be involved to practice SRI. For the project, existing farmer cooperatives will be promoted but new cooperatives will be formed if required.\nLocal NGOs: Local organization, will help in implementation of the project through capacity building, active interaction with the farmers, up scaling to other neighborhoods and monitoring and evaluation.\nWhere will these actions be taken?\nThe actions will be taken in Nepal. Total population of the country is 28 millions of which approximately 80 % of the rural population aged 15 and above is engaged in agriculture. Agriculture sector accounts for 35 % of the GDP (approx. USD 19 billions).\nIn Nepal rice is planted in an area of 1.5 million hectares. Rice is the main source of nutrition for Nepalese contributing of 50% calorie intake. An average person consumes 80 kg of rice in a year.\nThe pilot project will be on the lowland districts of central region, Nepal. It will be initiated in three adjoining districts Chitwan, Nawalparasi and Makwanpur. These are some of the major rice growing districts that have access to less than 50% irrigation. Climate in the majority of rice producing regions is sub-tropical to tropical that is ideal for summer rice that is highly influenced by Southeast monsoon that coincides with the critical rice growing period June to September when the most water is need. Consequently, the rice farmers rely heavily on unreliable monsoon rainfall; however, with the recent climate change monsoon is erratic that often results in crop failure or poor harvest causing widespread food shortage at the household level. Majority rice farmers are rural subsistence small land landholders (average land size < 0.96 ha per family). In Nepalese subsistence farming system, family members are the main source of labor force for rice cultivation. The farmers grow wide varieties of rice both for consumption and for sale and any excess are sold for cash income.\nThe project can be up-scaled to other rice growing countries in Asia. Paddy rice cultivation accounts for 0.52 GtCO2eq /year methane production (Smith et. al., 2014). Asia is the largest contributor and is responsible for 90% of global emissions. Emissions from rice cultivation is steadily increasing and if the current agriculture practices are not changed the annual contribution to global GHG anthropogenic emissions will increase by 0.4% each year.\nHow much will emissions be reduced or sequestered vs. business as usual levels?\nThe project, 55,000 ha of rice field converted into SRI method, will abate 500,000 tCO2eq in a period of 10 years. After 10 years of the project, the project area will reduce 99,000 tCO2eq methane every year.\nWhat are other key benefits?\nCompared to conventional rice growing method, SRI method has following benefits:\n- SRI method uses organic fertilizers instead of chemical fertilizers that could avoid both the emission of N2O from rice fields and nitrate leaching into the ground water. It also promotes microbial activities and hence, improves the soil quality.\n- SRI method avoids harmful chemical insecticides and pesticides, as the rice plants are more resistant to pests and diseases.\n- Reduces pressure on fresh water use, as SRI method requires about 50% less water for rice cultivation than in conventional method.\n- Improves family food security through increased yield (>50%).\n- Enhances farmers’ income (>100%), as it yields higher and requires less production costs.\n- Adaptation strategy against uncertain rainfall or drought condition, as SRI method requires about 50% less water.\n- Avoids irrigation related conflicts that is common during rice growing seasons\nWhat are the proposal’s costs?\nThe estimated cost of the project is 1.5 million USD for 10 years and 9 months. It includes the cost for project implementation and coordination and for the accreditation as a CDM project (CDM UFCCC, 2016). Main project cost (560,000 USD) will be spent on capacity building and trainings of the farmers as well as institutional arrangement to raise farmers’ capacity.\nThe proposed 10 years project will be developed as a CDM project which will co-finance the project through revenue generated from sale of CO2 credits. Hence, the project needs initial funding of approximately 450,000 USD for first 3 years and thereafter, the remaining 7 years will be financed through carbon revenue. The surplus of carbon revenues after completing 10 years project period will be used to launch new projects in other countries in South-East Asia. Based on the expected price of CO2 at 5 USD/ton on the voluntary carbon market, we assume that we will be able to generate 2.5 million USD revenue.\nMain drawbacks of SRI\n- Labor intensive, required greater skills and drastic change of farming practices\n- Possibility of increased pests\n(Uphoff & Fernandes, 2011)\nThe project preparation of 9 month will start in April 2017 and will end in December 2017. Field implementation will start in January 2018 and will end in December 2027.\n- CDM UNFCCC. 2016.

3	why sky blue at daytime red at sunset altitude air pressure affect color	The sky's color varies due to how light interacts with our atmosphere. During daytime, blue light scatters more readily than other colors when sunlight hits air molecules, creating the sky's blue appearance. At sunset, sunlight travels through more atmosphere to reach our eyes, causing blue light to scatter away while red and orange wavelengths pass through. At higher altitudes, the air pressure is lower due to less dense air, which means fewer air molecules are available to scatter light. This causes the sky to appear paler or whiter at high elevations since less blue light reaches our eyes. The density of air molecules, which affects both air pressure and light scattering, decreases as you go up in altitude.	['Oliver Scott of Wombarra Our atmosphere interacts with sunlight to produce blue hued skies on Earth. Blue light scatters more readily than other colours; thus creating its distinct blue color.\nSunlight contains all of the colors of the rainbow, which we can see when passing it through a prism. But when the sun is low on the horizon at sunset or sunrise, its light has to travel farther through our atmosphere before reaching you and thus becomes even more blue-scattered before reaching you.\nLight traveling through the atmosphere scatters in all directions, producing a pale and blue glow as its path passes over particles in the atmosphere (including air molecules). This phenomenon, which was first identified by 19th-century British physicist Lord Rayleigh, is known as Rayleigh scattering.\nOn a clear day, when looking up at the sky you will likely witness scattered blue light that is lighter than direct sunlight coming directly from the Sun due to more atmospheric molecules blocking its path through lower elevations than at higher altitudes.\nAs you travel higher into the atmosphere, blue light becomes even paler as more atmosphere has to pass through before reaching your eyes. Additionally, many scattered beams reach only some parts of their original path before reaching all your senses.\nLight of all wavelengths scatters in the atmosphere, but air molecules tend to scatter shorter-wavelength light such as blue and violet more readily due to having closer wavelengths with vibration frequencies of electrons in molecules – when these electrons vibrate they radiate energy and give the sky its signature blue hue.\nRed light wavelengths are longer, making them less vulnerable to scattering; this explains why astronauts see Earth as red rather than blue from space, and why sunrise and sunset make more visible red hues than usual.\nRefraction and total internal reflection cause multicolored light to bend into various wavelengths, while scattering leads to its blue hue. It varies based on how much of each type of particle there are in the atmosphere – this depends on where you are.\nAs sunlight travels through our atmosphere, it becomes scattered by gas molecules. Blue light tends to be scattered more than red or orange light due to its shorter wavelength; when struck by air molecules that are smaller than itself, these vibrate, producing Rayleigh scattering – named for the scientist who first discovered this form of electromagnetic radiation.\nWhen blue light strikes water molecules in our oceans and lakes, it takes on a deeper blue hue due to the water molecules’ ability to absorb certain wavelengths of light – not because of what lies above but because water molecules excel at absorbing short blue and violet visible light waves while not being as effective at absorbing longer red or orange visible light waves; hence why open sea appears dark blue.\nAs sunlight travels through our atmosphere, its hue may shift toward red near the horizon due to blue light having to travel further through it before reaching you and being scattered away in other directions. As one ascends higher into our atmosphere, less blue light gets scattered; thus giving our skies above a distinctive dark or bluish violet appearance.\nAs you ascend into the stratosphere, your atmosphere thins further as its temperature increases with altitude. This layer extends approximately 30 miles above Earth’s surface and features dry air with few clouds, perfect for airplane flights as it rarely experiences turbulent airflow. Airplanes generally fly within this layer without encountering much turbulence as a result.\nAt even higher altitudes lies the exosphere – our atmosphere’s outermost layer, composed of extremely thin and sparse molecules. The exosphere contains most of our planet’s oxygen supply as well as creating a clear starry night sky due to sodium’s presence here. You might even spot shooting stars with distinct hues!\nOur eyes are most sensitive to blue light, so when combined with all of its other hues we perceive the sky as blue. Otherwise, any remaining sunlight may become mixed with different colors to appear white – but if our sun were instead emitting violet or red wavelengths instead, our view may change drastically and reveal more purple or red shades instead.\nAt nighttime, the sky becomes blue due to sunlight scattering through the atmosphere. At higher elevations of atmosphere, more air molecules come into contact with it, increasing its likelihood of scattering shorter wavelengths such as blue light. When this happens, longer wavelengths remain that cause it to mix together to appear white in appearance.\nIf you were standing on another planet like Mars, the sky might appear different than on Earth. Because the atmosphere on Mars is much thinner and less likely to scatter blue light, its sky typically displays as darker shades of blue or even bluish violet hues.\nOcean and lake waters appear blue due to how light interacts with them: long wavelengths of red and orange light absorb into the sea or lake water, leaving only blue light visible for you to see.\nAt sunrise and sunset, the Sun appears lower in the sky than during daytime. This requires it to travel through a greater portion of atmosphere before reaching your eyes – more blue light is scattered by this process, while shorter wavelengths (red and violet) pass straight through without scattering into space. As a result, sunrise and sunset seem to alter its hue as they pass from horizon to horizon.\nSunsets are one of the most spectacular natural events you can witness, offering an ideal opportunity to step back from daily stressors and experience nature’s beauty. Watching an idyllic sunset is great for mind, body, and soul; not to mention great for eyesight! But have you ever wondered why the sky becomes blue at sunset? That is because our atmosphere scatters sunlight differently during these evening moments.\nAs the sun lowers toward the horizon, its light must travel through more of our atmosphere than when it is higher up in the sky. More atmosphere means more air molecules which scatter violet and blue wavelengths away from your line of sight while red and orange wavelengths have difficulty being dispersed – this explains why sunset skies tend to feature more vibrant red-orange hues than blue hues.\nAt sunrise and sunset, the sky appears more yellow due to the Sun passing closer to Earth’s surface – meaning a thinner atmosphere layer which scatters shorter wavelengths more readily – while red and orange wavelengths have more of a chance of making their way through.\nAs you ascend in altitude, the amount of blue light that penetrates the atmosphere decreases due to fewer gas molecules being available to scatter it; this causes skies at high elevations to appear paler or even whiter due to less of its blue wavelengths reaching your eyes.\nAnother frequently-asked question about the sky concerns why it darkens at night. One reason could be due to how the Moon lacks an atmosphere; therefore there are no gases to diffuse its light, leading to almost 100% direct illumination with greater luminosity than would exist here on Earth.', 'can vary at any particular point on the Earth depending on the density of the air Air Pressure can vary at any particular point on the Earth depending on the density of the air Density = mass / volume Density = mass / volume\nWhere is air pressure higher, up in the mountains or down in the valley?\nElc&feature=related Air Pressure and Altitude\nThis bottle was photographed at 3600m (left) then again at sea level (right) We all live underneath a huge ocean of air that is several miles deep: the atmosphere.

4	What are primitive cells used for, and which research programs study them?	Primitive cells are used as the smallest way to define a crystal cell or lattice, helping describe atomic crystal structures mathematically. While there are infinite possible primitive cells, scientists typically use two types: the conventional primitive lattice with 1/8 of a lattice point at each corner, and the Wigner-Seitz primitive cell with a lattice point at the center. These structures are studied in research programs like Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, particularly through the Materials Project initiative which uses advanced scientific computing to investigate and predict material properties, including crystal structures, to accelerate materials discovery and design.	"['If you’re googling “primitive cell,” I imagine you are a somewhat advanced student in materials science (or an extremely advanced PhD student in chemistry or physics?).\nThe primitive cell, or primitive lattice, is the smallest way to define a crystal cell or lattice.\nIf you’re still here, I’ll assume you know some basics of crystals. For example, you know that the BCC unit cell has 2 atoms per cell in the traditional way of drawing the cell. It’s possible, however, to redraw the BCC crystal structure with only 1 atom per cell.\nThis redrawn perspective is called the primitive cell. The concept is more theoretical in nature and is more difficult for most people to grasp because it hides some of the symmetry that is shown in the traditional way of drawing the BCC cell.\nIn this article, I’ll explain why the primitive cell is useful, list them for common conventional unit cells, and also show you the Wigner-Sietz way to construct any unit cell.\nWhat are Crystals and the Unit Cell\nSince this topic is geared towards more-advanced students, I’ll hide a refresher about crystals in collapsable text. If you want a full introduction to crystallography, you may want to read this article.\nClick here to learn about unit cell definitions!\nAs you know, a crystal is made of a lattice + basis. The basis is the thing which is repeated (atoms, in our case), and the lattice is the pattern in which it is repeated. Here’s a 1-dimensional crystal.\nThe conventional way of identifying the unit cell is to draw it so that atoms are split evenly among different crystals. For example, in the image below, both the red box and blue box are valid depictions of the unit cell (in fact, any box of the same size would be a valid description).\nHowever, the box I’ve drawn in red is more conventional, because it helps us remember that the crystal should repeat.\nTake a look at this second example, with atoms spaced farther apart. In this case, if you drew the lattice to exactly encapsulate one atom (shown in blue), it would not make a unit cell. Draw another box to the right, and you’ll see that the two are not the same.\nHowever, if you draw the box so that the left edge of the box contains half of one atom, and the right edge of the box contains half of a different atom, the spacing is always correct. The starting point does not matter, so you could redefine the unit cell as a rectangle with an atom in the center and empty space on both sides, but we usually leave it as I show with the red box.\nThere are many (actually, infinite) ways to draw the same crystal structure, but materials scientists usually use a certain convention. We typically draw the unit cell as the smallest cell that shows full symmetry, basing this structure on its underlying Bravais lattice.\nAnother, less common way to draw the unit cell is to draw it as small as possible, hiding symmetry relationships if necessary. Drawing the unit cell like this is called the primitive cell.\nDefinition of the Primitive Cell\nLet’s start with a 2-dimensional example of a conventional cell vs its primitive cell.\nThis is a centered rectangular Bravais lattice. Since the basis is simply one atom, we can also say that it is a centered rectangular crystal. There is ¼ of an atom on each corner of the rectangle, and 1 full atom in the center.\nThis gives us 2 atoms per unit cell, and each unit cell has a volume of .\nThis way of looking at the unit cell tells you the full symmetry. Atoms are closer together in the vertical direction compared to the horizontal direction, and there is a centering operation as well. In a real material, this kind of information about atoms can provide all sorts of clues about the material properties.\nNow, look at the exact same crystal structure. None of the atoms have moved, but we are visualizing it differently. (Spoiler, this is the primitive cell). Instead of a rectangle, imagine that we have a rhombus. The sides are the same length, but the angle is not 90º.\nNow, we have 1 atom per unit cell (it’s not exactly ¼ of an atom on each of the 4 corners, but it still adds up to 1 atom in total). The number of atoms per unit area hasn’t changed since we have the exact same crystal, so the area of this new unit cell must be smaller than the old one.\nSpecifically, the conventional unit cell had 2 atoms per cell, and the primitive one has 1 atom per cell. Therefore, the primitive unit cell has half the area of the conventional one.\nSince the new unit cell has only 1 atom per cell, it is the smallest possible cell. Therefore, it is the primitive cell.\nDoes that mean all primitive cells must have a single atom inside? Not necessarily.\nRemember, there is a difference between “lattice point” and “atom.”\nFor every Bravais lattice, there exists a primitive lattice with a single lattice point in each cell. However, in a real crystal, each “lattice point” may be composed of multiple atoms.\nFor example, one of the most-common crystal structures is hexagonal close-packed (HCP). The HCP crystal is similar to the hexagonal Bravais lattice, except the HCP crystal has two atoms per lattice point.\nThe hexagonal prism can be sliced into parallelepipeds. If you are talking about the Bravais lattices, the conventional hexagonal lattice has 3 lattice points. If you looked at the primitive hexagonal lattice, there is only 1 lattice point.\nIf you are talking about the HCP crystal structure, the conventional HCP unit cell has 6 atoms, while the primitive HCP unit cell has 2 atoms.\nI hope that illustrates how a primitive crystal cell can have more than one atom per unit cell, but a primitive Bravais lattice must have only 1 lattice point.\nIn fact, you have probably even seen an HCP primitive cell before.\nPrimitive Versions of Conventional Unit Cells and Bravais Lattices (List)\nYou just saw the primitive cell for the HCP crystals, and the primitive lattice for the hexagonal lattice, but I’ll repeat them for the folks that skipped straight to this section.\nWigner-Seitz and Voronoi\nSo far we have constructed primitive cells using a mixture of intuition and guess-and-check (or you just peeked at the answer).\nThe primitive cells I’ve shown you so far are the standard primitive cells–they don’t have the full symmetry of the non-primitive conventional cells, but they are built to be similar to conventional cells.\nThere is another method of using math to generate a different set of primitive cells (remember, each primitive cell is one of infinite ways to describe the same pattern).\nThe primitive cells created by this method are called Wigner-Seitz unit cells.\nRather than splitting the atom to put ⅛ of it on each of the 8 corners, the Wigner-Seitz unit cell has a single atom surrounded by empty space.\nWigner-Seitz cells are unique, but they are not that intuitive to understand as a crystal structure. However, the algorithm to create these cells is simple. Let’s start with an example in 2D.\n- Choose any lattice point to start. This atom will be the only atom to appear in the cell, and it will be exactly in the center.\n- Draw a line from your center atom to every other atom. You’ll see that most of these will be redundant, so in practice you only need to draw lines to the close atoms. We’ll color these lines red.\n- Find the midpoint of each red line.\n- From the midpoint, draw a blue line perpendicular to the red line. The blue lines should be infinitely long.\n- The perpendicular blue lines will form the outline of a polygon. The smallest polygon formed is the primitive cell.\nIf you’ve done this correctly, your polygon should completely fill the space!\nWhat I have described is an algorithm for creating Voronai polygons. Voronai polygons are a mathematical concept which describes the set of all space which is closer to one point than any other.\nThe Wigner-Seitz unit cell is the unit cell which is generated from the voronai technique. There are also Voronai polyhedra, which are the 3-dimensional equivalent.\nWhen making 3D Wigner-Seitz cells, use the same procedure that I outlined. However, instead of drawing blue lines perpendicular to the red lines, draw blue planes perpendicular to the red lines.\nThe planes which intersect to form the smallest polyhedron is your Wigner-Seitz cell!\nHowever, a note of caution: the method of generating Wigner-Seitz primitive cells only works when you center the cell around a lattice point.\nPrimitive cells or primitive lattices are the best way to describe atomic crystal structures with math. Primitive cells are the smallest possible cell. There are an infinite number of primitive cells, but materials scientists typically use one of two types: the conventional primitive lattice has ⅛ of a lattice point at each corner of a parallelepiped, and the Wigner-Seitz primitive cell has a lattice point at the center of each polyhedron.\nReferences and Further Reading\nAFLOW library is a great resource for primitive cells, external to this site.\nIf you want to see the other crystallography-related articles I’ve written, here is this list, in recommended reading order:\nIntroduction to Bravais Lattices\nWhat is the Difference Between “Crystal Structure” and “Bravais Lattice”\nAtomic Packing Factor\nHow to Read Miller Indices\nHow to Read Hexagonal Miller-Bravais Indices\nClose-Packed Crystals and Stacking Order\nHow to Read Crystallography Notation\nWhat are Point Groups\nList of Point Groups\nWhat are Space Groups\nList of Space Groups\nThe 7 Crystal Systems\nIf you are interested in more details about any specific crystal structure, I have written individual articles about simple crystal structures which correspond to each of the 14 Bravais lattices:\n1.

State of the art high harmonic generation photoemission spectroscopy and time- and spin- resolved photoemission spectroscopy systems have been developed. The future goal is to stimulate materials at selective excitations with higher intensity laser pulses to establish a mean for manipulation and control of materials properties.\nM. Yi, M. Wang, A.F.

It encompasses design, fabrication, measurement, and modeling of static and dynamic magnetic properties of thin film materials exhibiting strong spin-orbit interactions and inversion symmetry breaking due to interfaces, particularly dynamics and thermodynamics of spin accumulation, skyrmions and spin textures. The research addresses three interrelated sub-projects: i) static and quasi-static novel thin film spin structures such as skyrmions and chiral magnetic textures; ii) strong spin accumulation and consequent control of magnetization created by interfaces between ferromagnet/non-magnet with strong spin-orbit coupling; and iii) highly non-equilibrium magnetic states produced in these heterostructures and studied through electron, optical and x-ray pump/probe techniques at time scales ranging from nsec to fsec. Through strategic choice of materials and utilizing a collective expertise in growth, magnetic, electrical, optical, and thermodynamic characterization, spectromicroscopy, and theoretical modeling, the NEMM team aims to control the strength of the critical underlying, sometimes competing, interactions (spin-orbit, exchange, single ion anisotropy, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, Coulomb, disorder) within and between dissimilar materials in proximity to each other, enabling development of models for resulting magnetic states and their dynamics. Theoretical modeling will provide a basis for understanding the structure (atomic, electronic, magnetic) and dynamics (electron and spin transport, magnetization response) of these states, and will guide the exploration of the multidimensional space of new material systems.\nN.

Interest is in the design, synthesis, characterization, and application of sp2-bonded materials whose dimensions range from 1-100 nm. This program has three major thrusts: The first, fundamentals, focuses on theoretical predictions of new stable structures, theoretical and experimental examinations of intrinsic electronic, magnetic, and mechanical responses, transport measurements (electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, isotope effects, Raman, photoemission spectroscopy, TEM, STM), and mechanical properties and tensile strength. The second focus is on functionalized nanosystems, where two or more distinct nanostructures are brought together and allowed to interact. Here, focus is on methodologies to integrate nanosystems comprised of graphene, hBN, nanotubes, and other nanoparticles interfaced to each other or to complementary nanostructures and materials. The third and final thrust is on growth of nanostructures. Novel synthesis methods are explored for non-equilibrium growth of sp2-based and other nanoscale materials. This program also seeks to develop specialized instrumentation for synthesis, characterization, and applications.\nS. Onishi, M. Moreno Ugeda, Y. Zhang, Y. Chen, C, Ojeda-Aristizabal, H. Ryu, S.-K.

The program has three thrust areas:\n- Thrust 1: Defect control in 2D semiconductors\n- Thrust 2: Interface enabled band engineering\n- Thurst 3: New synthesis modes for qunatum membranes\nCommon to these research themes is a synthetic strategy that allows to control structure and phase transitions at the nanoscale. In the case of quantum membranes, the ability to make and control free-standing 2-D semiconductors enables study of the interplay of quantum confinement and surface/interface properties with electronic structure and carrier transport at a fundamental level. Focus has been on exploring their electrical and optoelectronic properties at the ideal limit by repairing/passivating their defects. The control of materials composition via highly non-equilibrium synthesis techniques allows to tune band structures and interface properties on command. By exploiting new insights in the nanoscale control of phase transitions, one can synthesize new functional structures.

Directional Excitation Without Breaking Reciprocity. New Journal of Physics (2016).\nThe attainment of strength and toughness is a vital requirement for structural materials; unfortunately, these properties are generally mutually exclusive. It is the lower strength, and hence tougher, materials that find use for most safety-critical applications where premature fracture is unacceptable. Accordingly, the development of strong, tough materials has traditionally been a compromise between hardness vs. ductility. The aim of this program is thus to seek the fundamental strategies to solve this “conflict” by defining basic scientific principles underlying the development of damage-tolerance in structural materials suitable for the strategic missions of transportation, energy conservation and creation. Our approach involves understanding the scientific origins of damage-tolerance, principally in advanced multiple-element metallic alloys, principally bulk-metallic glasses and high-entropy alloys, where the salient mechanisms involve a balance of intrinsic vs. extrinsic toughening. A second approach involves using concepts of natural hierarchical design to examine the development of biomimetic hybrid ceramics. We include 2D materials, such as graphene, in this work. Our overall hypothesis is that by identifying the salient strengthening and toughening mechanisms at multiple length-scales, and by mimicking natural structural architectures, all guided by theoretical modeling at atomistic to continuum levels, we can develop the scientific foundations for unique structural materials with unprecedented levels of damage-tolerance. In all cases, our focus is on the scientific interplay between the individual nano/micro-mechanisms that contribute to strength and toughness, that of plasticity and crack-tip shielding, noting that these phenomena can originate at very different structural length-scales.\nB.

5	automated quality checks vs security protection methods compare differences	Automated quality testing focuses on verifying software functionality, performance, and compatibility through automated test cases and program validation. It helps check if the product works as intended without manual intervention. For security protection, specialized tools like Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) are used, which go beyond just testing by actively analyzing application traffic at runtime and preventing attacks by terminating malicious sessions or issuing alerts. RASP can detect and block vulnerabilities without requiring additional development work.	['Program Circulation – This is actually the treatment of making software accessible for download to consumers of the program in purchase to make sure that the individuals are actually able to install, utilize and also check the software. This can easily include manual circulation or automated distribution with Web downloads. Circulation of software application to its own intended customers is among the main functions of software application screening companies. It includes the article of pre-compiled software application elements for automated implementation on the intended bodies.\nSoftware Application how to become a software engineer Implementation Software Screening Companies – It is a collection of methods as well as tools, which allow users of a software unit to automatically deploy, run, as well as manage screening of the program. The process includes generating software distribution listings of the targeted systems; providing automated testing sources for these listings; and deploying screening tools for the targeted devices. It also involves picking up data from the unit and working analytical review exams on all of them to sense bugs and issues.\nSoftware program Layout – These consist of the approaches made use of in software testing for developing as well as composing test instances and program regulation and evaluating the regulation that may assist the developers to find out the compatibility, performance, stability, protection of the software or the product. These styles are used to establish the features of a product or the software application that are actually most vital to the consumers.\nSoftware application Concept – These feature the methods of creating the program and also making; as well as also the evaluation and validation of the design. In the procedure, the software program concept can easily also consist of the creation of test situations for the program.\nSoftware screening is actually a process of evaluating a product or even a company to ensure its own quality. It helps in checking out the performance of an item and is actually held out to offer buyers with dependable data on just how properly the item satisfies their necessities. Software application testing is a method carried out to offer stakeholders along with valuable relevant information on the high quality of an item or even a service under test.\nThere are actually a variety of locations in which software program screening might be actually implemented. These include however are certainly not limited to the following:\nPractical confirmation testing: A procedure of verifying that the software program may execute its functionality or even objective. The software application should manage to pass the useful screening for an item that is meant to become used or is intended for the objective planned. When performing operational testing, the software program ought to be actually developed to operate with the interface that is actually aimed to become made use of through the customer.\nSafety testing: This is actually lugged out to inspect the surveillance of an item. If a product has actually been actually designed to work effectively along with a particular network, at that point surveillance screening will generally test the network security.\nFunctionality screening: This method is additionally understood as the functionality testing. The objective of this procedure is actually to evaluate the functionality of a program product as well as enhance the usability of it.\nEnd-user test: This style of testing recommends to a customer’s viewpoint regarding a product. It is actually an overall term for program and also equipment items.\nAutomated examination: This sort of screening describes program that is actually examined by a pc course or other tool. The aim of these tests is actually to make sure that a program device works without human treatment as well as in an automatic fashion. Such programs are often used for software and equipment that need to be actually checked for being compatible along with different kinds of software application as well as functioning devices.\nAs the program business is actually expanding, there are lots of folks that are seeking to automate some of the repetitive tasks entailed in the screening of software application. Such automation aids in raising the productivity of companies in a pretty brief duration of opportunity. Business can easily also utilize automated examination tools to assist with the procedure of testing and offer valuable end results to stakeholders.\nAutomated software screening resources can easily include an application that operates a collection of tests on a software application prior to the product is launched or even marketed. The software application is then evaluated to find out whether the exams have actually discovered any kind of problems or even inaccuracies. The resources can likewise be actually utilized to find out whether the course is working as anticipated.\nIn many cases, an examination will only need to become competed the 1st opportunity through the business, and after that the software application will certainly have to be by hand inspected by hand. This results from the fact that the computerized exam devices are typically made to deal with plans and also features that are actually established. and also not along with the applications as well as functionalities which remain in growth.\nOther types of testing software include QA (top quality affirmation) testing, which is actually made use of to examine whether the services or product has passed all the necessary needs of customers. as well as is actually functioning as counted on. An item can additionally be tested by utilizing a pre-production version of the product and services.\nSoftware application screening is actually vital for making sure that a service or product meets its own function and also makes certain top quality. It is vital for the services or product to be actually offered effectively. A well-developed product may achieve market portion and also attract brand-new consumers, thus guaranteeing that business remains to succeed. Software program testing plays a significant function in delivering companies with trusted, reliable, and also cutting-edge items that will definitely profit all of them beyond their competitions.', 'What is Application Security Testing\nApplication security testing (AST) is the process of making applications more resistant to security threats, by identifying security weaknesses and vulnerabilities in source code.\nAST started as a manual process. Today, due to the growing modularity of enterprise software, the huge number of open source components, and the large number of known vulnerabilities and threat vectors, AST must be automated. Most organizations use a combination of several application security tools.\nStatic Application Security Testing (SAST)\nSAST tools use a white box testing approach, in which testers inspect the inner workings of an application. SAST inspects static source code and reports on security weaknesses.\nStatic testing tools can be applied to non-compiled code to find issues like syntax errors, math errors, input validation issues, invalid or insecure references. They can also run on compiled code using binary and byte-code analyzers.\nDynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)\nDAST tools take a black box testing approach. They execute code and inspect it in runtime, detecting issues that may represent security vulnerabilities. This can include issues with query strings, requests and responses, the use of scripts, memory leakage, cookie and session handling, authentication, execution of third-party components, data injection, and DOM injection.\nDAST tools can be used to conduct large-scale scans simulating a large number of unexpected or malicious test cases and reporting on the application’s response.\nInteractive Application Security Testing (IAST)\nIAST tools are the evolution of SAST and DAST tools—combining the two approaches to detect a wider range of security weaknesses. Like DAST tools, IAST tools run dynamically and inspect software during runtime. However, they are run from within the application server, allowing them to inspect compiled source code like IAST tools do.\nIAST tools can provide valuable information about the root cause of vulnerabilities and the specific lines of code that are affected, making remediation much easier. They can analyze source code, data flow, configuration and third-party libraries, and are suitable for API testing.\nMobile Application Security Testing (MAST)\nMAST tools combine static analysis, dynamic analysis and investigation of forensic data generated by mobile applications. They can test for security vulnerabilities like SAST, DAST and IAST, and in addition address mobile-specific issues like jailbreaking, malicious wifi networks, and data leakage from mobile devices.\nSoftware Composition Analysis (SCA)\nSCA tools help organizations conduct an inventory of third-party commercial and open source components used within their software. Enterprise applications can use thousands of third-party components, which may contain security vulnerabilities. SCA helps understand which components and versions are actually being used, identify the most severe security vulnerabilities affecting those components, and understand the easiest way to remediate them.\nRuntime Application Self-Protection (RASP)\nRASP tools evolved from SAST, DAST and IAST. They are able to analyze application traffic and user behavior at runtime, to detect and prevent cyber threats.\nLike the previous generation of tools, RASP has visibility into application source code and can analyze weaknesses and vulnerabilities. It goes one step further by identifying that security weaknesses have been exploited, and providing active protection by terminating the session or issuing an alert.\nRASP tools integrate with applications and analyze traffic at runtime, and can not only detect and warn about vulnerabilities, but actually prevent attacks. Having this type of in-depth inspection and protection at runtime makes SAST, DAST and IAST much less important, making it possible to detect and prevent security issues without costly development work.\nApplication Security Testing Best Practices\nShift security testing left\nNew organizational practices like DevSecOps are emphasizing the need to integrate security into every stage of the software development lifecycle. AST tools can:\n- Help developers understand security concerns and enforce security best practices at the development stage.\n- Help testers identify security issues early before software ships to production.\n- Advanced tools like RASP can identify and block vulnerabilities in source code in production.\nTest internal interfaces, not just APIs and UIs\nIt is natural to focus application security testing on external threats, such as user inputs submitted via web forms or public API requests. However, it is even more common to see attackers exploit weak authentication or vulnerabilities on internal systems, once already inside the security perimeter. AST should be leveraged to test that inputs, connections and integrations between internal systems are secure.\nNew vulnerabilities are discovered every day, and enterprise applications use thousands of components, any of which could go end of life (EOL) or require a security update. It is essential to test critical systems as often as possible, prioritize issues focusing on business critical systems and high-impact threats, and allocate resources to remediate them fast.\nThird-party code security\nOrganizations should employ AST practices to any third-party code they use in their applications. Never “trust” that a component from a third party, whether commercial or open source, is secure. Scan third-party code just like you scan your own. If you discover severe issues, apply patches, consult vendors, create your own fix or consider switching components.\nImperva RASP Solutions\nImperva provides RASP capabilities, as part of its application security platform. Imperva RASP keeps applications protected and provides essential feedback for eliminating any additional risks. It requires no changes to code and integrates easily with existing applications and DevOps processes, protecting you from both known and zero-day attacks.\nIn addition, Imperva provides multi-layered protection to make sure websites and applications are available, easily accessible and safe.

7	How can personal information be completely stripped from Office files?	Personal information can be removed from Office files using the Document Inspector. To do this, click File, go to Info, click Check for Issues, then select Inspect Document. Check all boxes in the Document Inspector window, click Inspect, and use the Remove All button for any data types found. Finally, save the document to ensure the data isn't re-entered. You can verify the removal by checking the XML files within the document.	['Plus the reasons why you want to do this\nEverything you do generates data somewhere. That data, when collected and analyzed, becomes information. That information can tell someone more about you than you probably want them to know.\nThe information collected over time can tell someone everything about you and can be used to help or harm you. This data is known as metadata.\nWhat is Metadata?\nMetadata is data about data. Don’t you hate it when people\nuse a word to define that word? Data is facts that are completely objective. It\ncannot be reasonably disputed. One is one and zero is zero. The temperature is\nwhat it is. Today’s date is today’s date. You get the point.\nMetadata is facts about a single piece of data. Let’s\nillustrate this with the example of writing a letter in Microsoft Word.\nYou type a letter to send to authorities about something\ngoing on at work that is unethical, possibly even illegal. Yes, we got dramatic\nThe letter is information made from the characters you typed\nin a certain order. The characters you typed are generated by a bunch of ones\nand zeroes. The ones and zeroes are the data that makes up the information in\nWhen the ones and zeroes are turned into the letter, there\nis other data about the letter that gets created. Some of that metadata\nincludes when you typed the letter, who typed the letter, when it was last\nsaved, what version of Word was it created in, all these are data about the\ndata or metadata.\nWhat Does Metadata Do?\nIn Microsoft Office, most of the metadata is there just for\nyour benefit. It can help you find the newest version of a document or see who\ncreated the document so you could ask them questions about it. It helps to keep\ntrack of edits or comments on documents.\nIt is also used by the Office program and other programs to\nwork with the document. Windows Explorer uses the information to categorize and\nsort documents, for example.\nWhy Would I Want to Remove Metadata?\nLet’s go back to the letter you’re sending to the\nauthorities about something sketchy going on at work. You’re doing this\nanonymously because you fear retribution, or you just don’t want to be involved\nbeyond bringing it to the authorities’ attention. It’s whistleblowing.\nYou go all out and get a temporary e-mail address and send\nit from a public computer at a library to cover your tracks. Because of\nmetadata, the document may have information that can be used to link it back to\nyou. It even may still have your name attached to it.\nEven worse, changes you made to the document, although no\nlonger visible to you, may still be in the document. If you wrote a paragraph\nabout something specific to you but then removed it because it could be used to\nidentify you, it still could be a part of the file in the form of metadata.\nHow Can I View Office Metadata?\nFollowing is a list of methods to see what metadata is\nattached to your Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files. Metadata surrounding e-mail\nsent from Outlook is far more complex and beyond the scope of this article.\nView Metadata in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint\nWith the document, workbook, or presentation open that you\nwant to check:\nClick on File in the top-left corner.\nOn the Info screen, you’ll see plenty of information such as Size, Pages, Words, Total Editing Time, Last Modified, Created, and Related People among other data.\nUnder that data, click on Show All Properties to see more data.\nNOTE: Pay attention to the Template data. If you used a template that has your name, or a company name in its filename, that could be tracked to you.\nView Metadata in Windows Explorer\nOpen Windows Explorer and navigate to where you have saved the file.\nRight-click on the file and click on Properties.\nIn the Properties window, click on the Details tab. You’ll see all the metadata in compact and concise list.\nView All Metadata for Word, Excel, or PowerPoint Files\nExtensible Markup Language (XML) is the defacto document for\nthe storage of metadata in computing. It accompanies all kinds of files and\nMicrosoft Office files are no exception.\nViewing these XML documents is surprisingly easy. Let’s do\nthis with a Word file.\n- Open Windows\nExplorer and navigate to where you have saved the file.\n- Make a copy of the file, so you don’t\naccidentally corrupt the original file.\n- Select the copy file and either tap the F2 button on your keyboard or\nright-click on the file and select Rename.\nChange the extension of the file from .docx to .zip. Yes, each Office filetype that ends in x is a compressed file containing XML documents. You’ll get a warning about doing this. Click Yes.\nRight-click on the file and select Extract All…\nIn the window that opens, it will ask you where you want to save the extracted files and if you want to show the extracted files when finished. The default values are good. Click Extract.\nOnce the extraction is done, you’ll see three folders and an XML file. Explore in these files to see what information is stored there. If you double-click on an XML file, it will likely open in Internet Explorer.\nIt will look odd, but you should be able to make out what most of the information means. There are two XML files that may contain your name: core.xml in the docProps folder, and document.xml and people.xml, both in the word folder.\nHow to Delete Metadata from Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint\nIt took a long time to get here, but if you’re going to do\nsomething like this you should know exactly why. Let’s get on with it.\nDelete Metadata in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint\nClick on File in the top-left corner.\nOn the Info page, click on Check for Issues on the left, near the middle of the page.\nClick on Inspect Document. The Document Inspector window will open.\nMake sure all the checkboxes in the Document Inspector are checked, then click the Inspect button.\nOnce the Document Inspector is done, you’ll see information about what kind of data it found. A green checkmark in a circle means it found no data of that type. A red exclamation mark means it found data of that type. Next to that data type’s description you’ll see the Remove All button.\nClick on that to remove all data of that type. There may be several of these buttons, so scroll down to ensure you get all of them.\nAfter you’ve removed the metadata, you may want to click the Reinspect button, just to make sure it didn’t miss anything.\nSave your document now to ensure the data doesn’t get re-entered.\nHow to be Certain the Metadata was Deleted\nGo through the steps above for View All Metadata in Word,\nExcel, or PowerPoint. Upon inspecting the core.xml, document.xml and\npeople.xml files, you should see that there is no personal data in the document\nIf you change the extension back from .zip to .docx, you’ll\nbe able to open the file normally in Word again.\nHow to Delete Metadata in Windows Explorer\nThis is a good method if you want to strip metadata from\nseveral files quickly. Doing this for 2 or more files can be done in a matter\nOpen Windows Explorer and navigate to the file you want to remove metadata from.

8	why hierarchical threshold signature scheme better accountability than tss	Hierarchical threshold signature scheme (HTSS) provides better accountability than regular TSS because it enables partial accountability through vertical access control. In HTSS, if there is an illegal signature, it can be confirmed that at least a high-level share was involved, whereas in regular TSS it is impossible to distinguish which share was involved in an unexpected signature.	['Key management plays a significant role in blockchain technology regarding digital assets protection. Practically speaking, losing private keys leads to great losses. Improper key management and poor system implementation may increase the risk of asset being transferred maliciously. Take an extreme case that happened before as an example, a principal died suddenly and no one was able to recover keys so that the whole asset was frozen. To solve these problems, experts therefore propose threshold cryptography to reduce the risk of key management.\nIn an untrusted system, all participants may not know each other, so we should come up with a method to produce a correct result based on private information distributed across multiple parties. A possible answer may be threshold cryptography, a special application of secure multi-party computation, that splits sensitive value into multiple shares, and the computation is performed in an intrusion-tolerant distributed system. In threshold cryptography, the shares of the secret do not need to be recombined to compute a particular result. Instead, the participants independently or collaboratively calculate outcome without revealing the input shares to others. In order to realize this idea, there are many protocols and of which Shamir secret sharing is the most famous one.\nShamir’s Secret Sharing:\nA (t, n)-Shamir Secret Sharing is a method which divides a secret s into n pieces by evaluating a polynomial of degree t − 1 at some points with the following two constraints:\n- s can be easily retrieved with the knowledge of t or more pieces.\n- No information can be revealed about s with the knowledge of any t′ pieces t′<t.\nProperties of Shamir Secret Sharing are shown as follows:\n- Secure: Information theoretic security.\n- Minimal: The size of each piece does not exceed the size of the original data.\n- Ideal: The cardinality of the secret set is equal to the cardinality of the share set.\n- Extensible: When t is fixed, shares can be be dynamically added or deleted without affecting the other pieces.\n- Dynamic: Security can be easily enhanced without changing the secret.\n- Flexible: In organizations where hierarchy is important, we can supply each participant different number of pieces according to their importance inside the organization. For instance, the president and one secretary can unlock the safe, whereas 3 secretaries are required to unlock it.\nProperty 1, 2, 3,4 and 5 are desired properties. However, there are some flaws of property 6:\n- A person who possesses more shares bears more risks. This fact is against to a single point of failure.\n- Every time the president wants to recover the hiding secret, he needs to aggregate his shares in individual storage, which induces inconveniences of shares management.\nExcept for the flaws mentioned above, another serious problem is that any important secret can be recovered by 3 secretaries without the permission of the president. In the hierarchical system (ex. bank, government…and so on), this scenario should be solved.\nHierarchical Secret Sharing( Tassa Secret Sharing):\nTassa introduced the concept of levels in Shamir Secret Sharing to solve the above questions. In brief, no matter how many low-level shares you have, each share produced by his scheme has different level such that “low-level” shares can not recover the secret.\nTo be more specifically, Tassa secret sharing : a random coefficient polynomial f(x) of degree t -1 is created first. Then, the secret is the constant term of f(x). Each share is the evaluation of the polynomial f(x) at a point. Tassa used an extra operation called differentiation such that the share is computed by the derivative of f(x) and evaluated at a given point. Due to the nature of the differentiation, the constant term would vanish so we call the share coming from performing the derivative of a polynomial as low-level share. It implies that the secret, the constant term, can not be recovered by shares which consists of lower-level shares.\nIn Tassa secret sharing, each person only keep one share of respective level, reducing the risk of managing shares. In addition, this secret sharing also offers a solution to the question, which is an important secret recovered that the president must get involved in. In summary, Tassa secret sharing not only offers the properties of Shamir Secret Sharing from the first to the fifth but also improves the flexible.\nAn Application of Threshold Cryptography: Threshold Signature\nThreshold Signature Scheme:\nThreshold signature scheme (TSS), a special application of threshold cryptography, dramatically decreases the risk of private key management. Compared to multi-signature, TSS offers shorter signature and better privacy. Moreover, TSS provides native multi-signature capability for those blockchains that lack shorter signature and better privacy. Most importantly, TSS does not save private key on the server and provides risk control as well as separation of duties. These significant advantages make TSS suitable for implementing hot wallets without revealing private keys and provides the service in realtime. Threshold Signature includes three phases as follows:\n- Key Generation：Each participant chooses his secret value first. All the participants run a progress together to determine their private key, the public key ,and own private shares based on these secret values.\n- Sign a transaction: Each participant uses his private shares and a public message to be signed as input. All the participants in this protocol will exchange some necessary data such that each person produces a partial signature and broadcast it. Combining these partial signatures will produce a digital signature. The most important thing is that the process ensures that no leakage of secret shares occurred and the private key is never appeared.\n- Verification: The verification algorithm of TSS and the original case are the same. Everyone having the knowledge of the public key and the message is able to verify the correctness of a signature.\nIt seems that TSS may be a fabulous solution, but there are still some problems. The following is the potential risk of applying TSS, but will not occur with multi-signature scheme:\n- TSS does not have the property of accountability: It is impossible to distinguish which share getting involved in an unexpected signature. TSS is not like the multi-signature scheme as the signature is signed by distinct private keys in multi-signature scheme. It is because Shamir’s secret sharing only supports horizontal access control.\n- TSS is lack of vertical access control: Although TSS achieves joint control to disperse risk among the participants, the level of all shares are equal. For example, an important contract not only requires enough signatures, but also needs to be signed by a manager. Despite the fact that vertical access control can be realized on the application layer and tracked by an audit log. Once a hack happens, we will have no idea about who should be blamed for.\nAs summarized above, we need to design a system providing “vertical and horizontal” access controls for the accountability reasons. TSS natively possesses the horizontal access control (i.e. enough shares to generate a valid signature), but it lacks the design of vertical access controls. In order to make TSS more practical and solve the problems which it induces, we propose to a new threshold signature called hierarchical threshold signature scheme (HTSS) by combining hierarchical secret sharing and TSS.\nHierarchical Threshold Signature Scheme:\nWe use an example to demonstrate applications of HTSS. This scenario fits better in a financial institution with role-based access controls.\nIn a (2, 3)-threshold signature sharing, a dealer can generate two different levels of shares by Hierarchical secret sharing. Here we assume that there are two low level shares with one high level share. If a customer wants to transfer a transaction, it will require a banking teller to sign first and then a manager to endorse. In HTSS, if two banking tellers with low level shares co-sign the transaction, they still cannot generate a valid signature. And the manager cannot transfer the transaction without getting the approval from the banking teller. Therefore, if there is an illegal signature, we can confirm that at least the high level share had been involved, which is so-called “partial accountability”.\n- HTSS preserves flexibility between partial accountability and privacy.\n- Private shares in HTSS can be refreshed and also permits add shares or delete shares dynamically without changing public key(i.e. address).\n- Compared to TSS, distributing extra new low level shares to users is less risky(i.e. This is an important merit for currency exchange) because low level shares can not recover a valid signature.\nThanks to Chang-Wu Chen and Yu-Te Lin.']	['<urn:uuid:6044a1b8-be8c-4da8-9be5-e95747a7f78a>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	9	57	1415

10	I'm curious about how eating habits have changed over time - what's the connection between modern fast food culture and ancient Roman food shops in terms of social class and convenience?	Both ancient Roman thermopolia and modern fast food establishments primarily served lower and middle classes who valued convenience over home cooking. In Rome, wealthy people could afford servants and storage space for home-cooked meals, while today, people exchange work hours for quick meals rather than preparing food themselves. Both systems developed tiered pricing - Roman thermopolia offered cheaper options like garum (fish sauce) and expensive ones like meats, similar to modern fast food's dollar menus versus premium items. However, modern fast food has health implications not documented in Roman times, with many meals exceeding recommended calorie and sodium limits, potentially contributing to obesity and cardiovascular disease.	"[""By Brenden Bobby\nThe concept of grabbing a quick bite to eat isn’t a modern invention. People were busy during antiquity, and while the texts of the Middle Ages taught us that people valued optimizing every facet of their lives and minimizing waste, the centuries of Roman rule in Europe painted a very different picture.\nDespite what Star Wars taught us, that empires are all evil and ruled by megalomaniacal, power-hungry creeps, history has shown us that there are genuinely beneficial reasons for empires to have sprung up and persisted for some time throughout the ages. Among them is affordable access to goods — particularly of the imported variety. It was this wide access to plentiful and affordable food that led to some of the first fast food joints springing up in the world.\nThese shops were referred to as thermopolia, and they were often attached to the entrance of a Roman apartment building, called an insula. Many shops were attached to the front of these apartments, acting similarly to strip malls today. Thermopolia were strategically placed in these locations so that busy Romans would swing in for a bite to eat on their way to and from work. You might be wondering why these Romans didn’t save some money and prepare their own breakfast, instead? The answer to that is simple: Romans didn’t have access to refrigeration like we do today. While they did often keep a number of ingredients at home to have meals prepared, such as salted meats and dried herbs, it was simply more economical to get a juicy slab of meat and some wine from a vendor that specialized in procuring and producing it than to store and prepare it themselves.\nIt’s important to consider social class when discussing these establishments, as some of the implications for class have stuck around over two-thousand years in regards to fast food. Thermopolia catered to the lower and middle classes, respectively, often under the same roof. The upper classes of Roman society could often afford servants and slaves, as well as the storage space required to house ingredients for home-cooked meals. Thermopolia exploited the class system of ancient Rome to its fullest, generally offering a selection of food on a tiered pricing system. Fermented fish sauce, called garum, and tree nuts were generally on the lower end of the scale — similar to a familiar franchise’s “dollar menu.” Those that were willing to spend a bit more and show off the excess of their middle class station could purchase lentil soups, baked cheeses or meats cut straight from the bone, similar to modern shawarma shops. Hot wine was also a staple of these businesses.\nMost establishments of the time had a fairly simple layout: an open area where customers could gather and wait to order, and an L-shaped stone counter with large holes cut into the surface where pots or jars, called “dolia,” would be placed. There was a space beneath the dolia where wood fires could be built and maintained through the day to keep the contents hot, or left vacant if they were meant to be kept cool. This practice has evolved into the hot bars you see at most contemporary grocery stores and buffets.\nThe concept of franchising may be a modern invention — most thermopolia were family-owned and operated — the concept of branding is a tale as old as time. Some establishments were very basic, designed exclusively for patrons to take their food and leave while others allocated a little extra real estate in the back for customers to sit and dine-in. A number of these dining locations we’ve excavated from the ruins of Pompeii show elaborate frescoes that indicate the owners were wealthy, and they wanted their clientele to know it. We see this frequently today, with a number of fast food chains offering “the best deals”, while others want you to believe you’re paying for a more classy, high-end experience.\nThese differences were illuminated by the taberna and popina, respectively. These shops existed as a form of thermopolia, but each with stark differences from one another. Taberna, from which the word tavern originates, functioned similarly to today’s food trucks, often forming a stall directly attached to the front of a Roman single-layer residence, called a domus. It would be like having a hot dog stand directly outside of your front door, every day.\nPopina were establishments designed with the lowest classes in mind, often selling basic “grazing” food such as bits of bread and olives, but specializing in wine, both hot and tepid. These establishments often grew seedy reputations, due to the nature of the people that frequented them. They were essentially the dive bars of Rome.\nIt’s intriguing to look back at this time in human history and compare it to our own, as well as the Dark Ages that followed the fall of the Roman empire. The metropolitan areas of the empire lived to great excess, and were capable of affording building shops where food could be wasted, but still profited upon. Throughout Europe, much of this disappeared in the wake of the empire’s collapse as the everyman took upon themselves the burden of maintaining their own supply of food and drink. Wastefulness and excess was frowned upon by most people, likely because of the influence of the growing Catholic church (which indulged in its own displays of gross excess).\nNow, it seems we’ve returned to a time and comfortability mirroring ancient Rome, where it’s easier for most of us to exchange an hour or two of work’s pay for a quick bite to eat, rather than store and prepare it ourselves.\nUnlike the Roman Empire, we have a lot of wax paper and plastic to contend with once we’re done.\nStay curious, 7B.\nWhile we have you ...\n... if you appreciate that access to the news, opinion, humor, entertainment and cultural reporting in the Sandpoint Reader is freely available in our print newspaper as well as here on our website, we have a favor to ask.

Unfortunately, unless consumers read nutrition information and make healthy choices, their fast food meals come at a cost to their health and their appearance.\nA 2010 report of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University highlighted many nutritional inadequacies in fast food menus as they pertain to children. Their study of 3,039 possible kids\' meal combinations at the largest fast food chains in America demonstrated that only 12 meals met nutrition criteria for preschoolers, and 15 met nutrition criteria for older children. The researchers found that an average meal provided 1,000 calories, far more than a child needs, and that snacks and desserts contained five times more than the 200 to 300 calories recommended by the American Dietetic Association for these foods. Eating too many calories contributed to obesity, particularly when the children were also inactive, but their diets were found to be low in fiber, vitamins and minerals.\nEating fast food may contribute to cardiovascular disease. Sodium, a major factor in developing heart disease, should be limited to 1,500 mg per day, according to the American Heart Association. In a study of 6,580 fast food meals, the New York Health Department found that 57 percent contained more than the daily sodium limit, according to Help Guide. Limiting saturated fat in the diet helps to reduce the risk of heart disease but fast food meals often provide extreme amounts of fat. For example, a Double Whopper with cheese, an apple pie and a medium order of fries contains more saturated fat than an adult should eat in two days.\nInsulin Resistance and Diabetes\nA 32-oz Big Gulp size of regular cola contains 425 calories, more than one third of the average woman\'s total intake for the day. These sugary, high-calorie drinks and other fast food items contribute to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, says Mark Pereira, Ph.D., lead researcher in study published in the January 2005 issue of ""The Lancet."" His study of more than 3,000 young adults over a period of 15 years demonstrated that the subjects who ate frequently at fast food restaurants gained 4.5 kg of weight more than those who ate fast food infrequently, and also had twice the increase in insulin resistance.\nSome fast food items cost about the same as it would cost you to prepare a similar meal at home, according to MayoClinic.com. A hamburger, for example, costs approximately 25 cents an oz to make a home and 29 cents an ounce at a fast food restaurant. Surprisingly, the healthier foods such as salads often cost more than so-called value meals that include a sandwich, fries, drink and dessert, says Timothy Harlan, M.D. in a 2007 article published on his website, DrGourmet.com. Other costs to consider when deciding between a homemade meal and a fast food meal include the cost of driving to the restaurant, preparation time and the cost of buying food transported from a distance versus buying locally.\nMore fast food restaurant meals mean fewer meals at home as a family, a change that may affect family cohesiveness. Eating together at the dinner table on a regular basis allows parents and children to talk in a relatively relaxed environment, as opposed to the noisy, frenetic atmosphere at a fast food restaurant. Although parents may be able to model healthy eating behavior at the restaurant, they have more control over meals at home with respect to portion size and choice of food. Eating on the run also prevents people from eating mindfully and paying attention to their emotions rather than eating to comfort themselves.\n- Fast Food Facts: The Science Behind Fast Food Facts\n- Help Guide: Healthy Fast Food\n- MayoClinic.com: Home Economics: Fast Food vs. Homemade\n- American Psychological Association: Fast-Food Culture Serves Up Super-Size Americans\n- Pediatrics in Review: Effects of Fast-Food Consumption on Energy Intake and Diet Quality Among Children in a National Household Survey\n- ""The Lancet;"" 2005; Fast-Food Habits, Weight Gain, and Insulin Resistance']"	['<urn:uuid:d18c7097-38e7-4390-b4e1-bf54da4d8780>', '<urn:uuid:e810e65a-8ca4-40e5-bb1f-735eabc35519>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	31	106	1805
11	india us differences patient privacy family	There are significant cultural differences between India and the US regarding patient privacy and family involvement in healthcare. At Banaras Hindu University, patients were accompanied in the hospital by family members, and when questioned about privacy concerns, it was revealed that patients' main worry was not about privacy but about being separated from their family. This contrasts with the US emphasis on individual privacy and confidentiality in healthcare settings.	"['Despite many attempts to broaden its ethical gaze beyond the patient-centered focus of traditional medical ethics, bioethics remains strongly individualistic. The patient is treated as a self-interested individual unencumbered by personal relationships, and the principle of self-determination is dominant. However, many areas of biomedicine call for a more relational perspective. This international collaborative project on family ethics is about just that.In my clinical work I\'ve been very attentive to the family context of my patients, but in my work on ethics it\'s the neglect of the individual\'s responsibilities as part of a society that I\'ve attended to. I\'ve argued ad infinitum that medical ethics - especially in the US - has attended too exclusively to the needs and interests of the ""numerator"" (the individual) without attending to the needs and interests of the ""denominator"" (the society the individual is part of). In the US that focus has led to wildly excessive health expenditures and neglect of public health and other social goods.\nIn 1989, during my first visit to India, I visited the psychiatry department at Banaras Hindu University. A resident who was Indian by birth but who\'d lived in the US through his teen age years and seemed very American was showing me around. On a hospital ward I saw an older woman combing the hair of young adult patient. I asked about what I interpreted as remarkable nursing care. The resident explained that this was her mother, and that patients were accompanied in the hospital by family members. I then asked a very American question - weren\'t the patients worried about privacy and confidentiality? The resident, despite having grown up in the US, simply didn\'t understand my question. He explained that their worry was about not being extruded from the family.\nMy question showed that I\'d been more influenced than I\'d realized by the tendency in US psychiatry to blame the family for the patient\'s problems. When I trained as a resident (1965 - 1968) and did a fellowship at the Family Studies Unit at the National Institute of Health (1968 - 1970), the concept of the ""schizophrenogenic mother"" was still widely accepted. When I was responsible for a hospital unit at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center (1970 - 1973), I was concerned that many staff members had a hostile view towards families, and often made them feel unwelcome, and I did teaching sessions about the important role of families as caretakers. But at Banaras Hindu University my reaction focused on fear of not having privacy, not fear losing family ties.\nI believe the tendency of US medical ethics to see the individual as an atom of self-interest and threatened rights comes from two main sources - (a) the anti-family tilt of American culture in the last half of the 20th century and (b) an effort to give the patient more authority and power in the patient/physician relationship. This latter aim has led to a beneficial and overdue rebalancing of the interaction between patient and physician elegantly conceptualized in the concept of ""shared decision making,"" but US medical ethics needs to incorporate more recognition of the role of ""families of origin"" and ""families of choice"" in the ethical equation.\nThere\'s no way to make clinical ethics tidy. Sometimes families are intrusive, hurtful, and even profoundly destructive. Somtimes they are nurturing and crucial for an individual\'s well being. And, as most of us have experienced, family involvement is typically a blend of delight and exasperation. Sorting out the situation is what makes the health professions so challenging, so important, and so much fun!']"	['<urn:uuid:b47f9729-bbe0-4d18-b4f8-925ef734548b>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	6	69	594
12	sunny side up eggs nutrition safety	While sunny-side up eggs are a good source of protein (6 grams per egg) and contain numerous vitamins and minerals primarily in the yolk, they are considered a risky food due to potential salmonella contamination. Food safety authorities recommend against eating sunny-side up, soft-boiled, or over-easy eggs unless they are pasteurized. Pasteurized eggs, available at many supermarkets, offer the same nutritional benefits while being safer to consume.	"['This Easter we have decided to highlight how incredible eggs are, and we’re not talking about the chocolate variety!\nProtein is in a lot of foods, but for many reasons the humble egg is an ideal package of nutrition. Eggs provide all 9 essential amino acids (known as the building blocks of protein) and, because of this, are known as “complete proteins”. Eggs are an effective food for maintaining, building and repairing muscles. They are filled with so much goodness that they are often referred to as ‘nature’s multivitamin’. Every egg contains a small amount of a huge variety of vitamins and minerals that are needed by the human body, including calcium, iron, potassium, zinc, manganese, Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin B12, Folate and many others. Eggs also contain choline, a lesser-known vitamin important for healthy brain function and reducing inflammation.\nThe yolks are rich in two antioxidants called Lutein and Zeaxanthin, which have powerful protective functions for the eyes, reducing the risk of Cataracts and Macular Degeneration, the leading causes of blindness in the elderly. Lutein also helps to maintain the skin’s elasticity and hydration, has shown to prevent plaque build-up in the arteries and could also have cognitive boosting capabilities, improving academic performance.\nIt’s hard to believe that all these essential nutrients are packed into just one egg, containing around 75 calories, six grams of protein and five grams of fat, and with only trace amounts of carbohydrates. It’s crucial to know that most of the vitamins and minerals come from the yolk, as many people assume that the yolk just contains fat, whereas the white of the egg consists of pure protein. This is a common misconception.\nARE EGGS HIGH IN CHOLESTEROL?\nEggs can get a bad reputation because they contain cholesterol, which people think is harmful to their bodies. One large egg contains around 212 mg of cholesterol which is a large amount compared to other foods – however this doesn’t mean that it will create bad cholesterol in the blood.\nOur liver actually creates cholesterol on a daily basis, so the less cholesterol you eat, the more your body produces itself. Studies have shown that eating eggs actually improves the levels of good cholesterol (HDL) in the blood and changes the bad cholesterol (LDL) into a large subtype which isn’t associated with a risk of heart disease. In addition to this, studies have analysed the risk of eating large amounts of eggs and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and found no association between the two.\nEGGS AND EXERCISE\nFasting before exercise can make you dizzy and lightheaded. You need to fuel your body with healthy carbohydrates and/or protein to provide your body with lots of energy to generate your best performance.\nStudies show consuming protein before and after exercise improves recovery, promotes growth of lean body mass, enhances athletic performance and boosts immune system functions. Eating adequate protein can also help with weight loss, lower blood pressure and optimise bone health. Most people who exercise regularly need 1.4-2g of protein per kilo of body weight. We recommend spreading your protein intake out throughout the day into several meals and snacks rather than all at once.\nExperts recommend pairing high quality proteins (like eggs) and easily digested carbohydrates (fruits, potatoes, crackers and breads) for pre and/or post workout fuel. The protein builds and repairs muscle and the carbohydrates replenish the body’s glycogen. Eggs are highly versatile, they can be in sweet baked foods, stir fries, omelettes, salads or just on their own. In fact, we found so many delicious recipes whilst researching eggs that we decided to do a separate blog featuring our favourite egg recipes. Check it out!', 'Risky Foods to Watch Out For continued...\nUndercooked eggs were the most commonly eaten risky food. That includes eggs served sunny-side up as well as raw eggs used in preparation of hollandaise sauce, meringue, Caesar salad dressing, and the like.\nFood safety authorities have long steered people away from sunny-side-up, soft-boiled, or ""over- easy"" eggs, all of which carry the risk of salmonella. If you must eat runny eggs or use them in recipes, Weis suggests you buy pasteurized eggs, which have been briefly heated to destroy bacteria. They are available -- typically at a small premium -- at many supermarkets. If you\'re ordering sunny-side-up eggs at a restaurant, ask if they\'re pasteurized, she suggests.\nRisky Take-Home Food\nFood safety experts are keeping an eye on some worrying trends in food consumption. One is the growing preference for unprocessed ""natural"" foods available at farmers\' markets. While many of these foods may be very healthy, unpasteurized dairy products and juices are more likely to carry a variety of nasty bacteria, experts say. ""You can have fresh and locally-produced food that is also safe,"" Scallan says, ""and safe food means pasteurized milk and juices.""\nAnother trend: Buying prepared food from supermarkets and then bringing it home for the family. It\'s dangerous to leave perishable food at room temperature for more than two hours, notes Shelly Feist of the nonprofit Partnership for Food Safety Education. That window shortens considerably when temperatures are higher -- such as when a prepared meal is placed in a hot car. So be sure to eat prepared food soon after purchasing it, Feist says.\nFood Safety in the Outdoors\nThe warm weather that makes springtime so inviting also creates an ideal breeding environment for bacteria and other pathogens found in food. Here\'s some advice from The Partnership for Food Safety Education on how to apply food-safety tips to the out-of-doors:\n- Clean. Wash your hands -- as well as utensils, cutting boards, and countertops -- in hot soapy water before and after preparing each food item. Also wash produce, which can carry harmful bacteria. As easy as these directives can be to ignore while in the kitchen, it\'s even easier when you\'re outside and playing with the dog, with the Frisbee, or with your baby niece, Feist notes. Don\'t drop your guard!\n- Separate. Sure, it\'s tempting to pour that sauce you used to marinate raw burgers or chicken wings onto the cooked food. It\'s also tempting to place the cooked grub back onto the plate that held your raw meat. Don\'t give in! Always keep raw meat and its juices separate from cooked food. If you want to reuse that sauce, then boil it first.\n- Cook. It\'s the best way to kill bad bugs. When grilling, preheat the coals on your grill for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the coals are lightly coated with ash. Use a meat thermometer to ensure that hamburgers and red meats are cooked to 160 degrees and ground poultry to 165 degrees. Poultry breast should be cooked to 170 degrees; dark meat (wings and thighs) should be cooked to 180 degrees. Poultry juices should run clear. Fish should be opaque and flaky.\n- Chill. No, this doesn\'t refer to what you do after breaking open a Bud at the barbecue. Bacteria grow quickly at room temperature and even faster under the hot sun. So refrigerate meat while it marinates, and keep that potato salad in a cooler that\'s well-packed with ice or freezer packs.\nMore tips are available at the Partnership\'s web site, www.fightbac.org.']"	['<urn:uuid:4c06b658-d287-4672-9f17-4740adb6751d>', '<urn:uuid:0153f205-e5b4-4085-bdc6-58c60f9f165a>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	6	67	1208
13	How do disasters affect poor communities, and what steps are being taken to help them?	Disasters disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, particularly those of low income and persons of color, who are traditionally underrepresented in disaster governance and recovery planning. Studies have shown that counties with high hazard losses have higher percentages of impoverished populations, especially impoverished Black populations. However, some positive changes are emerging. FEMA has developed options to increase the affordability of flood insurance, and some local governments are beginning to use social vulnerability indicators alongside traditional measures of risk when prioritizing disaster mitigation projects. For instance, Puerto Rico has integrated social vulnerability into its Community Development Block Grant Mitigation Action Plan, expanding considerations beyond purely economic factors.	['Disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, tornadoes, and droughts are not only increasing in intensity and frequency, they are also striking the same place multiple times. Yet, to date, disaster research largely focuses on individual events, and fails to account for legacy effects that leave people vulnerable in the wake of repeated disasters.\nTo improve predictive capacity to better prepare for future disasters, an interdisciplinary team of researchers has developed a novel framework for improving scientific understanding of ‘recurrent acute disasters’ (RADs). Their work was published today in Science Advances.\nStudy co-lead Steward Pickett, an urban ecologist at Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, says, “Recurrent acute disasters impact a specific place over time. Each event can create legacy conditions that shape the effects of subsequent disasters. As RADs become more frequent and intense, examining disasters as linked, rather than isolated, events will be critical to improving disaster science, preparedness measures, and outcomes for affected communities.”\nDriven in part by climate change, population growth in at-risk locations, and inadequate disaster preparedness, RADs pose an increasing threat to environmental quality, economic activity, and public health and safety. Examples of events that are beginning to interact in sequence include wildfires in the American West, extraordinary floods in Europe, and massive hurricanes in the Caribbean. Impacts of these sequences of events disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including those of low income and persons of color, who are traditionally underrepresented in disaster governance, policy, and recovery planning.\nThe paper’s authors propose a framework to guide future research on recurring acute disasters that accounts for: spatial relationships among recurring disasters; a holistic view of the ‘human ecosystem’ including the state of critical resources, demographics, and social institutions at a given point in time; and trends in legacy conditions – whether effects intensify or diminish (or both) between disasters. Puerto Rico is used as a case study for how a RAD approach to disaster recovery could improve outcomes and build resilience.\nCoauthor Miguel Román, former Program Director at the Universities Space Research Association, explains, “Understanding legacy conditions – the lasting behaviors and consequences created by one disaster that influence effects of subsequent disasters – can help emergency managers identify hidden threats and response needs. Ignoring legacy effects can cause gaps in preparedness plans.”\nRomán continues, “Consider Puerto Rico, which was hit by a series of RADs between 2017-2020, including hurricanes Irma and Maria, a subsequent drought, and the January 2020 earthquakes. These events have led to what we call ‘negative legacy conditions’ including deteriorating energy infrastructure, loss of trust in government institutions, and a health care system under immense strain. Because these legacy conditions exacerbate social, environmental, and infrastructure vulnerabilities, efforts to prepare for future events must take these factors into account.”\nPickett contends that the disaster research and response community is well positioned to adopt a RAD-based approach with the help of emerging data sources and online tools: “Numerous sources of data and new analytical methods could be leveraged to monitor and identify legacy conditions soon after a disaster. These include things like data collected by satellite and social media, new computer modeling approaches, and mobility tracking. Our framework could help organize these information streams to better understand what happens during and in the aftermath of disaster events.”\nEstablishing a more thorough understanding of recurring acute disasters could inform building codes, public health regulations, private insurance premiums, emergency communications, and community preparedness training. The authors note that to reduce risk from future disasters, preparedness programs should update incident response plans to include specific consideration of how previous disasters have altered the response landscape and available resources.\n“This research is an important new step toward understanding how legacy conditions created by one disaster influence the effects of subsequent disasters,” notes Professor Gary Machlis of Clemson University, who was the lead author and co-led the study. “In particular, adopting RAD-sensitive disaster and recovery policies should help improve outcomes for vulnerable communities. Increasing our understanding of recurrent disasters has the potential to advance disaster science, improve issues of equity and environmental justice, build resilience, and ultimately save lives.”\nPickett concludes, “The recent IPCC report from the UN confirms that the extreme events that generate many disasters will increase over time. For the disaster management community, including partner scientists, it will be necessary to convert the RAD-based predictions of legacy conditions into specific preparedness actions that reduce vulnerability to later disasters.”\nMachlis, G.E., M.O.

Although the nature of the damage may vary, major disasters are alike in that socially vulnerable populations often experience the worst repercussions. For example, we saw this following Hurricanes Katrina and Harvey, each of which generated widespread physical damage and outsized impacts to low-income and minority survivors.\nSocial vulnerability researchers seek to understand the impediments and capacities of people and communities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from extreme natural hazards. A major tool in this work is social vulnerability modeling, the use of which is expanding in large part because of growing awareness of the social equity implications of disasters.\nThis modeling applies knowledge garnered from disaster case studies describing how chronic marginalization translates to disproportionate adverse outcomes to identify the most vulnerable population groups. Such populations often include those living in poverty, the very old and young, minoritized ethnic and racial groups, renters, and recent immigrants [National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019]. Social vulnerability modelers select demographic variables representing these groups and combine them to construct spatial indicators and indexes that enable comparisons of social vulnerability across places.\nMapping Social Vulnerability\nFigure 1a is a typical map of social vulnerability across the United States at the census tract level based on the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) algorithm of Cutter et al. . Spatial representation of the index depicts high social vulnerability regionally in the Southwest, upper Great Plains, eastern Oklahoma, southern Texas, and southern Appalachia, among other places. With such a map, users can focus attention on select places and identify population characteristics associated with elevated vulnerabilities.\nMany current indexes in the United States and abroad are direct or conceptual offshoots of SoVI, which has been widely replicated [e.g., de Loyola Hummell et al., 2016]. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also developed a commonly used social vulnerability index intended to help local officials identify communities that may need support before, during, and after disasters.\nThe first modeling and mapping efforts, starting around the mid-2000s, largely focused on describing spatial distributions of social vulnerability at varying geographic scales. Over time, research in this area came to emphasize spatial comparisons between social vulnerability and physical hazards [Wood et al., 2010], modeling population dynamics following disasters [Myers et al., 2008], and quantifying the robustness of social vulnerability measures [Tate, 2012].\nMore recent work is beginning to dissolve barriers between social vulnerability and environmental justice scholarship [Chakraborty et al., 2019], which has traditionally focused on root causes of exposure to pollution hazards. Another prominent new research direction involves deeper interrogation of social vulnerability drivers in specific hazard contexts and disaster phases (e.g., before, during, after). Such work has revealed that interactions among drivers are important, but existing case studies are ill suited to guiding development of new indicators [Rufat et al., 2015].\nAdvances in geostatistical analyses have enabled researchers to characterize interactions more accurately among social vulnerability and hazard outcomes. Figure 1b depicts social vulnerability and annualized per capita hazard losses for U.S. counties from 2010 to 2019, facilitating visualization of the spatial coincidence of pre-event susceptibilities and hazard impacts. Places ranked high in both dimensions may be priority locations for management interventions. Further, such analysis provides invaluable comparisons between places as well as information summarizing state and regional conditions.\nIn Figure 2, we take the analysis of interactions a step further, dividing counties into two categories: those experiencing annual per capita losses above or below the national average from 2010 to 2019. The differences among individual race, ethnicity, and poverty variables between the two county groups are small. But expressing race together with poverty (poverty attenuated by race) produces quite different results: Counties with high hazard losses have higher percentages of both impoverished Black populations and impoverished white populations than counties with low hazard losses. These county differences are most pronounced for impoverished Black populations.\nOur current work focuses on social vulnerability to floods using geostatistical modeling and mapping. The research directions are twofold. The first is to develop hazard-specific indicators of social vulnerability to aid in mitigation planning [Tate et al., 2021]. Because natural hazards differ in their innate characteristics (e.g., rate of onset, spatial extent), causal processes (e.g., urbanization, meteorology), and programmatic responses by government, manifestations of social vulnerability vary across hazards.\nThe second is to assess the degree to which socially vulnerable populations benefit from the leading disaster recovery programs [Emrich et al., 2020], such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Individual Assistance program and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Disaster Recovery program. Both research directions posit social vulnerability indicators as potential measures of social equity.\nSocial Vulnerability as a Measure of Equity\nGiven their focus on social marginalization and economic barriers, social vulnerability indicators are attracting growing scientific interest as measures of inequity resulting from disasters. Indeed, social vulnerability and inequity are related concepts. Social vulnerability research explores the differential susceptibilities and capacities of disaster-affected populations, whereas social equity analyses tend to focus on population disparities in the allocation of resources for hazard mitigation and disaster recovery. Interventions with an equity focus emphasize full and equal resource access for all people with unmet disaster needs.\nYet newer studies of inequity in disaster programs have documented troubling disparities in income, race, and home ownership among those who participate in flood buyout programs, are eligible for postdisaster loans, receive short-term recovery assistance [Drakes et al., 2021], and have access to mental health services. For example, a recent analysis of federal flood buyouts found racial privilege to be infused at multiple program stages and geographic scales, resulting in resources that disproportionately benefit whiter and more urban counties and neighborhoods [Elliott et al., 2020].\nInvestments in disaster risk reduction are largely prioritized on the basis of hazard modeling, historical impacts, and economic risk. Social equity, meanwhile, has been far less integrated into the considerations of public agencies for hazard and disaster management. But this situation may be beginning to shift. Following the adage of “what gets measured gets managed,” social equity metrics are increasingly being inserted into disaster management.\nAt the national level, FEMA has developed options to increase the affordability of flood insurance [Federal Emergency Management Agency, 2018]. At the subnational scale, Puerto Rico has integrated social vulnerability into its CDBG Mitigation Action Plan, expanding its considerations of risk beyond only economic factors. At the local level, Harris County, Texas, has begun using social vulnerability indicators alongside traditional measures of flood risk to introduce equity into the prioritization of flood mitigation projects [Harris County Flood Control District, 2019].\nUnfortunately, many existing measures of disaster equity fall short. They may be unidimensional, using single indicators such as income in places where underlying vulnerability processes suggest that a multidimensional measure like racialized poverty (Figure 2) would be more valid. And criteria presumed to be objective and neutral for determining resource allocation, such as economic loss and cost-benefit ratios, prioritize asset value over social equity. For example, following the 2008 flooding in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, cost-benefit criteria supported new flood protections for the city’s central business district on the east side of the Cedar River but not for vulnerable populations and workforce housing on the west side.\nFurthermore, many equity measures are aspatial or ahistorical, even though the roots of marginalization may lie in systemic and spatially explicit processes that originated long ago like redlining and urban renewal. More research is thus needed to understand which measures are most suitable for which social equity analyses.\nChallenges for Disaster Equity Analysis\nAcross studies that quantify, map, and analyze social vulnerability to natural hazards, modelers have faced recurrent measurement challenges, many of which also apply in measuring disaster equity (Table 1). The first is clearly establishing the purpose of an equity analysis by defining characteristics such as the end user and intended use, the type of hazard, and the disaster stage (i.e., mitigation, response, or recovery). Analyses using generalized indicators like the CDC Social Vulnerability Index may be appropriate for identifying broad areas of concern, whereas more detailed analyses are ideal for high-stakes decisions about budget allocations and project prioritization.\nTable 1. Major challenges in measuring social equity\n|Issue||Challenge for Equity Measures||Measurement Considerations|\n|Analysis purpose||Aligning analysis with end use and users||Audience, intended intervention, hazard type, disaster phase|\n|Equity mode||Assessing distributional versus procedural equity and individual versus compounding inequity||Measuring process equity, identifying appropriate compound metrics|\n|Validity||Reflecting underlying processes of inequity||Connecting variable selection with vulnerability processes, choosing absolute versus relative impact measures|\n|Scale||Linking spatial and temporal scales with underlying vulnerability processes||Data availability and acquisition costs|\n|Robustness||Determining statistical reliability||Measurement error and sensitivity analysis|\nSelecting the relevant modes of equity for analysis is crucial. Is the primary interest to quantify disparities in the distribution of hazard impacts or procedural disparities in accessing resources? Is the focus on individual populations or on combinations of population characteristics? As social inequities often accrue to low-income households, analysts should consider assessing economic losses in both absolute and proportional terms.\nCreating valid measures of equity requires not only statistical expertise but also a fundamental understanding of the underlying processes of social marginalization. This facilitates selection of optimal proxy indicators and their geographic scales. However, practical considerations like data availability and cost can lead to indicator selection that diverges from conceptual bases. For example, for disaster assistance received by households, an equity analysis should ideally be conducted at the household scale. Unfortunately, data describing some dimensions of inequity, like race, are rarely collected by disaster agencies, necessitating analysis using census data at larger geographic scales.\nThe final major challenge is to develop statistically robust measures and best practices for assessing disaster equity that strengthen the foundation for policy interventions. Doing so may require expanding current approaches to include sensitivity analyses to assess how choices of parameters (e.g., input variables, geographic scale) in building social vulnerability indicators affect the statistical stability of resulting measures, and how these measures correlate with observed disaster impacts like dislocation, assistance eligibility, and recovery time.\nThe stakes for improving our understanding of relationships among hazards, vulnerability, and social equity are high, as climate disasters from flooding, drought, tropical cyclones, and wildfire have been increasing in their frequency and destruction. By definition, sustainable solutions that empower communities to resist, recover from, and adapt to these threats must be not only economically viable and environmentally sound but also socially equitable. Well-designed measures of disaster equity are an important tool for quantifying disaster disparities, which is the first step toward dismantling them.\nChakraborty, J., T. W. Collins, and S. E.

14	Are ebony and rosewood both used to make musical instruments?	Yes, both ebony and rosewood are used in musical instruments. Ebony is valued by musical instrument makers worldwide, particularly by Taylor Guitars for premium acoustic guitars. Similarly, rosewood is highly prized for making musical instruments, along with being used for veneers and high-end furniture.	['The country’s iconic ebony is a traditionally-used resource valued by musical instrument makers around the world.\nBut Cameroon’s ebony, along with the rich biodiversity in forests, face a long-term threat as more and more land is cleared for agricultural farming and by unsustainable industrial logging practices. Taylor Guitars, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of premium acoustic guitars, observed this trend and launched a project last year with the Congo Basin Institute to help local communities develop and plant different varieties of ebony to boost Cameroon’s ebony stocks.\n“Our Ebony Project brings science and community and practicality together to ensure that ebony survives for hundreds of years to come,” says Bob Taylor, co-founder and President of Taylor Guitars. “Our goal is to leave a lot more than we are taking.”\nThe government of Cameroon recently joined forces with Taylor Guitars to explore scaling up Taylor’s Ebony Project as part of Cameroon’s program to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (known as REDD+). This new public-private partnership, launched at the Bonn Climate Change Conference, will explore opportunities to apply the approach developed by the Ebony Project. This model combines the provision of seedlings, infrastructure, and training for the planting of ebony, along with fruit and medicinal trees, to communities participating in reforestation and agroforestry projects within the program area.\n“For any project to be successful, you need to have the right incentives in place for local communities,” says Rene Siwe from Cameroon’s Ministry of Environment, Nature Protection and Sustainable Development. “By giving communities fruit seedling like bush mango or safou along with other plants that have cultural significance and ebony to plant, they can benefit from fruit harvests in the short-term, and the slow-growing ebony harvests can be for future generations.”\nSiwe adds, “In Cameroon, there is still a big question about the ownership of trees, so what we are also trying to achieve in this project is to establish silvicultural log books that link the ebony trees we plant to specific individuals and families, so that they are the clear beneficiaries of whatever type of compensation schemes are put in place.”\nThe Cameroon-Taylor Guitars partnership will also study the ecology of African ebony, and provide communities with important silvicultural training that may ensure sustainable forestry practices will be used for generations to come.\nThe Ebony Project and Cameroon’s Emission Reductions Program\nAs an important steward of these ecosystems, the government of Cameroon has committed to a transformative vision of sustainable forest management through its REDD+ initiative.\nSupported by the World Bank’s Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, and the German Development Bank, the government has led the design of an ambitious subnational REDD+ program in the southern region of the country. The program area covers about 93,000 km2 of carbon-rich tropical forests, including the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Dja Reserve, several national parks, a gorilla reserve, cocoa and oil palm smallholders supplying to global markets, as well as many indigenous and forest-dependent communities.\nThis emission reductions program will work with stakeholders at every level to help shift the forestry and wider land-use sectors towards more sustainable practices in order to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. Key among these stakeholders are forest-related businesses, and the Cameroon-Taylor Guitars partnership underscores the important role the private sector can play in partnering for sustainable management of forest resources. The partnership’s silvicultural log books could also help inform the wider REDD+ program’s approach to benefit sharing.\nTo get started, the Cameroonian government is working to commission a study to identify agricultural landscapes in the REDD+ program area that would be suitable for agroforestry, as well as identify suitable species to be planted, and the appropriate community approaches that could be used. The outcome of this study will help prioritize where the initiative should engage first, and what mix of trees species will be planted.\nFor more on the Ebony Project, watch this Facebook Live chat from the 2017 Bonn Climate Change Conference (COP23): An Innovative Collaboration for Forest Protection in Cameroon with Taylor Guitars', 'Skip to the content\nFauna & Flora International and Belizean partner Ya’axché Conservation Trust commend a CITES decision to strengthen protection for tropical hardwoods, write Gail Stott and David Gill.\nValuable but highly threatened rosewoods and ebonies have a more secure future after a historic decision at the recent CITES meeting in Bangkok. These trees produce stunning timber that is highly prized for musical instruments, veneers and high-end furniture, but populations have been decimated by unsustainable logging, and many species are now threatened with extinction.\nDelegates from 170 countries agreed to include over 80 ebony species (Diospyros spp), and over 40 rosewoods (Dalbergia spp) from a range of countries including Madagascar, Belize and Thailand on CITES Appendix II, meaning that international trade in their timber will be more strictly regulated.\nThroughout 2011, as international demand for precious hardwoods spiked, Fauna & Flora International’s partner in Belize, Ya’axché Conservation Trust, observed dramatic impacts on the country’s native rosewood species (Dalbergia stevensonii) and on the people and forests in the south of the country.\nWhen the rosewood crisis reached its peak in February 2012, the Government of Belize stepped in to place a moratorium on logging and exports to allow a re-assessment of rosewood stocks. It then took a series of strong measures to demonstrate its no-tolerance stance – including the burning of rosewood stockpiles.\nWhile these national measures provided temporary relief for Belize’s rosewood, the decision from CITES will aid international cooperation in regulating timber trade if and when the national moratorium is lifted.\nThe CITES Appendix II listing requires exporting countries to provide data proving that timber has been harvested sustainably. This should lead not only to more sustainable management of the species, but also to more accurate trade data, and an increase in the knowledge of population sizes and trends.\nAfter a turbulent two years for tropical timber species across the world, the CITES decision is a much-needed piece of good news. The next challenge for the respective governments will be to ensure that sufficient in-country capacity is developed or strengthened to enforce the convention on the ground.\nYa’axché has also welcomed the decision. Throughout the rosewood crisis, Ya’axché has made data and expertise available to the respective authorities in order to support a more sustainable approach to the use of this valuable species, as well as stepping up its own efforts to protect rosewood stocks in the Golden Stream Corridor Preserve – a private protected area owned and managed by Ya’axché.\nYa’axché’s resident botanist, Gail Stott, said: “Rosewood has become something of a flagship species for Belize and, in stark contrast to the dire situation in Toledo just over a year ago, it looks like we may be on our way to a more positive outcome. If properly implemented, the CITES listing – together with continuing political will to practise sustainable forestry – could see a much more secure future for this species.”\nBuilding on previous work in the Toledo district, Ya’axché is now embarking on a new tree conservation project supported by the Global Trees Campaign (a collaboration between Fauna & Flora International and Botanic Gardens Conservation International).\nWhilst continuing to work with the Belize Forest Department in promoting a more sustainable approach to forestry, this project will build capacity to carry out targeted, well-planned conservation activities for a suite of species – including some rare and threatened non-timber trees that are already on the IUCN Red List.\nGail Stott comments, “At Ya’axché, whilst we realise the importance of forestry to Belize, we think it’s crucial that forests are not simply assigned a monetary value in terms of the timber they hold. A biologically diverse forest has multiple ecological, social and cultural values.\n“Our new Global Trees Campaign project will help to ensure that these values are recognised – particularly among the communities of the Toledo district. We have to ensure that the people living closest to the forests understand the urgent need to preserve them. Striking a balance between conservation and sustainable development is at the core of Ya’axché’s work and is essential if we want to see the forests of Toledo not just surviving into the future, but thriving.”\n❝If properly implemented, the CITES listing – together with continuing political will to practise sustainable forestry – could see a much more secure future for this species.❞']	['<urn:uuid:ae5d1ad8-28a4-4f7d-bb53-c689c1f8d600>', '<urn:uuid:95936d7e-4099-4851-b70e-f6f721742983>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	10	44	1393

Individual therapy consists of ""talk therapy"" between the therapist and the client with an expectation that the therapeutic relationship will become strong enough to allow each client to experience the level of safety and security necessary to explore and process thoughts and feelings contributing to patterns of behavior and internalized ways of viewing the world. We utilize a psycho-dynamic and object relations theoretical approach to therapy that aims to address the underlying personality structure and psychological defenses contributing to the emotional, relational, and occupational struggles of the client. Sessions are typically 50-60 minutes long and the frequency of each session typically starts at once week, however, the length and frequency of the session can be modified to better serve the client.\nParent-Child Interaction Therapy\nChildren Ages 2-7\nParent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is designed for children ages 2-7 who are struggling with defiant and/or disruptive behavior. PCIT involves the child and his/her parent or caregiver and consists of two phases. The first phase of treatment is called the Child-Directed Interaction (CDI) phase. The CDI phase of treatment works on strengthening the bond between the parent/caregiver and the child and focuses on using the parent/guardian\'s positive attention to increase desired behavior from the child. The second phase of treatment is called Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI). PDI focuses on increasing the child\'s ability to listen and follow directions. Parents/caregivers are coached on the importance of giving effective commands and providing appropriate follow-through to their children based on the actions of the child. During both phases of treatment the therapist is in a separate room observing the parent/caregiver-child interaction and communicating with the parent/caregiver through the ""bug in the ear"" technique (the parent/caregiver wears an ear piece and the therapist communicates through a walkie talkie). PCIT has empirical data supporting its effectiveness working with chidren with Autism, ADHD, ODD, Intellectual Disabilities, and other mental health diagnoses.\nChildren Ages 2-5\nAttachment Assessments are conducted to identify attachment styles between parent/caregivers and preschool aged children. Attachment assessments are conducted using Mary Ainsworth\'s preschool aged strange situation protocol. Assessments are completed and then evaluated or analyzed by the therapist and can be used to gain a better understanding of how to better serve the child and the family.\nPsycho-educational Groups and Process Groups\nGroup therapy sessions are provided to address anger management, parenting skills, and specific mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and chronic mental illness. Groups are designed to include clients experiencing similar mental health issues and allow group members to utilize the insight and experiences of other members as support towards their individual growth.\nServices Recommended or Mandated by the Court System\nPhipps Family Therapy provides services for individuals who have been referred or mandated by the court system. This may include substance abuse evaluations, mental health evaluations, anger management, etc.\nUtilize Play Therapy Materials and Techniques with Children\nPlay therapy materials and techniques are utilized as a way for the child to communicate with the therapists. Children use play to communicate and their play often provides valuable insight into how they view themselves, others, and the relationships between themselves and others.\nMarriage and Partner Counseling\nCounseling for couples\nMarriage/ Couples counseling is available for significant others to explore their relationship and gain a deeper understanding of underlying issues affecting the partnership.\nTherapy exploring family dynamics\nEach member of the family participates in the session. Family therapy focuses on identifying the role of each family member and exploring how the family system is affected by the inter-personal relationships between each individual.\nMental Health consultation and training\nConsultation and training services are available to address many mental health related topics within the workplace or other organizational setting. Topics include: Suicide Awareness and Prevention, Conflict Resolution, Stress Management, Team Building, and Non-Violent Communication.\nMediation services are offered to assist in resolving conflict between two parties. Through open and honest communication mediation aims to help two parties agree upon a compromised resolution that both sides can feel satisfied with.', 'How can I learn more about Play Therapy?\nThe Association for Play Therapy has an excellent video which explains more about play therapy.\nWhat problems does play therapy help my child overcome?\nIf a child needs counseling, play therapy is usually the answer.\nSome of these problems include:\n- Anxiety / fears\n- Conduct disorders\n- Abuse issues (physical abuse, sexual abuse and emotional abuse)\n- Post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD)\n- Low self-esteem\n- Poor social skills\n- Learning difficulties\n- Divorce issues\n- Coping skills issues\n- Handling trauma\n- or many other childhood problems\nWho can provide play therapy for my child?\nPlay therapy is very different than just playing with a child, and therefore only a therapist with training in play therapy should provide this service for you and your child.\nIt is okay for you to ask questions about therapist’s training in play therapy, their areas of specialization, and their experience in providing play therapy.\nWhat should I tell my child about play therapy?\nWhen bringing the child for the first session, the child can be told that he/she will be coming each week for a little while to play in the playroom.\nChildren love to play and it usually does not take a lot much for them to enjoy themselves during the session. Parents should be truthful with children and tell them they are going to see a counselor. Then explain in an age-appropriate manner what role the counselor plays and what to expect during the session.\nSome examples of how to describe what a counselor does is: they are someone who talks to lots of children about problems, worries and mixed up feelings, they are a “feelings” helper, someone who has the fun job of playing with kids.\nDiscussing this conversation with the play therapist prior to the session is also helpful. They will be able to guide you on how to best tell your child on their level. If your child exhibits anxiety about the session contact the counselor prior to session to discuss the child’s response.\nSome parents tell children it is like going to see a doctor. Since most children have anxieties about doctors, this is not a good similarity.\nHow long will it take?\nSince it is based on the development of the relationship with the child there is not usually a specific time frame.\nThe therapist will work toward establishing a therapeutic relationship with you child and employ techniques that he/she feels will best suit your child’s needs. Play therapy allows the child to work at their pace and sometimes issues are resolved quickly and sometimes it takes longer particularly if the issues are trauma related.\nYour child’s play therapist can give you more guidelines based on your child and/or families particular reasons for seeking counseling.\nHow does just playing help a child who has been traumatized?\nPlay is a child’s language.\nChildren tell about worries through play just as adults do through words. Counselors can help the child process these worries by listening (watching) and accepting the child where he/she is in the trauma.\nWhy is it important for parents to watch their children play and tell them what they are doing?\nChildren speak through play.\nBy watching and reflecting what your child is doing, you are telling your child you are concerned and interested. Your child, in turn, feels that he/she is important and worthy of your attention.\nWhy do you feel play therapy works better than normal “talking” therapy?\nChildren often have difficulty communicating complex feelings and emotions with words.\nPlay provides a means for this communication while engaging the child in something they naturally do and enjoy already.\nCan I be in the play room with my child?\nThis depends a great deal on the goals of your child’s therapy and the techniques that their play therapist will use.\nTypically the child’s play therapy session is with just the therapist. There are many reasons for this such as:\n- Decreasing the influence of parents/caregivers on the child’s lay\n- Limit the child monitoring their parent for feedback or approval\n- Providing an opportunity for the child to work as they need to in a therapeutic environment\nHowever, some play therapists also utilize more family play therapy techniques such as filial therapy which involve significant parent/caregiver participation. The best approach is to talk to your child’s play therapist about any concerns you may have.\nYour child’s therapist can further explain the goals and techniques used in play therapy and why it is beneficial for your child to have their session independent from caregivers.\nHow can I join AAPT?\nAAPT is a chartered branch of APT.\nThus, we have a dual membership arrangement. This means you join the national organization APT and the state branch which for Alabama is AAPT. As a mental health professional with a Master’s degree or higher, you may become a professional member of APT/AAPT.\nAs a fulltime mental health graduate student or other non mental health professional you may join as an affiliate member.\nYou may join anytime. Your anniversary month is the month in which you join. Full details and membership application are available here.\nJoin APT now!\nDo you have to be a member of APT/AAPT to attend the workshops?\nNo, anyone can attend our workshops.\nHowever, if you are a member of APT/AAPT you get a discount on the cost of the workshop as well as other member benefits.\nHow do you become a Registered Play Therapist?\nThere are three types of Play Therapy credentials:\n- Registered Play Therapist (RPT)\n- Registered Play Therapist-Supervisor (RPT-S)\n- School Based-Registered Play Therapist (SB-RPT)\nVisit our Play Therapy Certification page for details.\nFor what disciplines does the Association for Play Therapy provide Continuing Education?\nWe are approved CE providers for LPCs, LMFTs, RPTs, and LCSWs.\nWe are currently working on expanding this but those are all the disciplines covered at this time.\nWhat is the difference between directive and non directive play therapy?\nThere are two main schools of thought in the world of play therapy.\nThey are non directive and directive.\nNon directive play therapy, also called child-centered play therapy, is where the child leads the play in the session. The focus of the session is the child, not the problem of the child.\nDirective play therapy, also sometimes called prescriptive play therapy, is where the play therapist identifies and prescribes a technique to address a specific issue. The focus of the session is addressing the therapeutic issue/problem.\nIs play therapy just for children?\nPlay therapy is not just for children.\nPlay therapy techniques, including those modalities involving symbolic work are useful with adult populations. They are easily incorporated when adults find themselves “stuck” in traditional talk therapy.\nThe use of symbols allows for emotional distance and creates a sense of safety for clients to work through powerful emotions and is a way of communicating the “unspeakable.” Play therapy lends itself well to role rehearsal leading to mastery over an event in the clients’ lives.\nAdditionally, it is creative, fun and joyful, qualities that are helpful in the treatment of stress and healing for the mind and spirit.']"	['<urn:uuid:e13286a6-3a1d-4adf-b2e2-a8087f11fb69>', '<urn:uuid:4966d1c8-0634-412f-8888-8f7d39be95a6>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	11	95	2011
17	product safety compliance monitoring enforcement methods eu us standards	In the EU, authorities conduct market control inspections and can ban non-compliant products, with customs cooperating to stop dangerous goods at borders. For US standards compliance, UL performs quarterly unannounced visits to inspect materials, processing records, and work in progress. Non-compliance with UL standards can result in significant fines and restrictions on applying UL markings, while in the EU, manufacturers, importers, or distributors can become financially liable if products cause damage due to safety issues.	"[""Standards, certification and marking of products and services when doing foreign tradeThe page was last modified:\nAn introduction to the different standards and requirements that may apply to your products and services - and how you can fulfil these.\nThis page contains information about:\nGoods or services that you sell must meet different requirements, both those that are written down in regulations and those that customers set. They can apply to function, safety and labeling. Standards help you meet these requirements.\nA standard is a collection of rules and guidelines produced jointly by private companies, organisations and public authorities. Standards help you to avoid pitfalls, establish good order and set levels of requirements for products and services.\nStandards are found in all areas, for example, industry, IT, health care and environment. Most standards are European or international.\nSwedish standardisation bodies and industry organisations\nThe following are some examples of standardisation bodies and industry organisations that work on producing Swedish, European and international standards:\n- Swedish Standards Institute (SIS)\n- Svensk Elstandard (SEK)\n- Svenska Informations- och Telekommunikationsstandardiseringen (ITS) (in Swedish)\nIf you need to prove that the requirements of a standard or technical regulation are met, you can have an independent accredited organization certify, inspect or test your product, service or process.\nCertification ensures that what you sell meets relevant requirements. Sometimes you can decide for yourself whether to certify your goods or services. But it can also be mandatory according to laws and regulations or the agreement you have made with the customer.\nControls are about regularly inspecting a product when it is used to make sure it meets specific requirements.\nTesting usually concerns certain properties of the product, such as the strength of toys, the risk of fire for clothing, or the risk of squeezing and cutting for folding chairs.\nFind out what applies to your product or service\nYour industry organisation can give you information about standards and the position regarding certification, control and testing in your industry.\nAccredited organisations are approved to do the job\nWhen you need to certify, control or test your product or service, you can turn to organisations that are accredited by Swedac. Accreditation means that they are competence-audited, impartial and have quality-assured working methods for performing analysis, calibration, certification, control, and testing.\nA marking means that the manufacturer guarantees that a product or service meets special requirements. The marking may be mandatory, such as the CE marking for certain products to be sold on the EU internal market, but there are also voluntary markings.\nYou are responsible as a manufacturer, importer, or distributor\nIf your product is not covered by specific rules, the general product safety rules apply. You must also follow product liability rules and report dangerous products that you have sold on the market.\nIf you import or distribute imported goods to the EU, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you are responsible for ensuring that the products meet the EU's requirements for product safety and CE marking.\nYou as a manufacturer, importer or distributor can become financially liable if a product is not as safe as it should be and causes damage.\nMarket control of product safety\nSome authorities may carry out inspections and ban products that do not meet the relevant requirements. The Swedish Customs also cooperates with the market control authorities to stop dangerous goods at the border.\nObligation to provide information for chemicals\nIt is your own responsibility to know what your products contain, and in some cases to inform customers about it. If your product contains certain chemicals, you must also report it to the EU Register of Chemicals Products.\nRequirements for exports to countries outside the EU\nWhen you export to countries outside the EU, there may be specific product safety rules. Even if your product follows an international standard, there may be national rules that deviate from it. You should contact the authorities in the country in question, and Business Sweden can also help you find which rules that apply. You can certify the products in Sweden so that they meet the safety rules for countries that are party to different agreements.\nCE marking: mandatory for some products, but prohibited for others\nYour product may only be CE marked if the product is on the European Commission's list of what must be CE marked. Toys and personal protective equipment are examples of things that must be CE-marked, while, for example, prams, pacifiers and children's articles may not be CE-marked.\nProducts that may not be CE marked must still meet national product requirements that applies to goods and services sold to consumers.\nThe basic rule is that only the manufacturer can CE mark products. However, if you import a product that is not CE marked, even though it must be, you can CE mark it if you are considered a manufacturer. You will find information on the criteria that the various economic actors must meet in the Blue Guide.\nOther mandatory and optional labels\nIn addition to the CE marking, there are other mandatory and optional markings with which you can certify your goods or services.\nResponsible: Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth"", 'Most electrical consumer products in the US have a UL (Underwriters Laboratory) listing, which means that the product meets certain safety standards. In some cases it may be a requirement for a product to be UL listed, in other cases it becomes a sales and marketing decision. UL requirements are driven from the final product down to the component level. The requirement for flexible circuit recognition is driven by the product manufacturer as flexible circuits themselves are not sold directly to the consumer. The following are some common questions and answers relating to UL recognition.\nWhat is UL?\nUL stands for Underwriters Laboratory and is a global organization that provides safety standards for consumer products.\nWhat is the difference between UL listed, UL classification and UL recognized? (source)\nUL Listing means that UL has tested representative samples of a product and determined that it meets UL’s requirements. These requirements are often based on UL’s published and nationally recognized Standards for Safety. A UL listing can only be applied to the final product as sold to the consumer.\nUL Classification typically means that UL has tested and evaluated representative samples with respect to certain properties of the product. Product that passes flammability testing would be granted a Flammability classification mark.\nUL Recognition means that UL has evaluated components or materials intended for use in a complete product or system. These components are intended only for end-use products that may be eligible for UL certification. Since most flexible circuits are components, it would be technically incorrect to state that a flexible circuit is UL listed, it can only be UL recognized.\nHow do you get a Product UL Recognized?\nThere are two basic approaches:\n- Submit the generic product construction for UL listing. This requires extensive planning, product/sample build and testing. The process can take over 6 months, but once completed, the supplier has limited latitude in material and process changes. To receive qualification for a generic flexible circuit product listing, the fabricator chooses a number of possible variations that would be common (i.e. thickness, number of layers and trace configuration) and submits ranges to cover each of the common potential variations.\n- The second option is to submit a specific part number for testing. This is the fastest way to get a part listed as the qualification process can be completed in as little as a week. The main drawback with this method is there is little room for any design or process variation. The marking only applies to the exact construction and layout of the submitted part. If a customer wanted to change the copper thickness or polyimide thickness, those variations would need to be submitted for testing.\nWhat are the flammability ratings?\nUL 94 covers the flammability ratings. The ratings are as follows: (source)\n- HB: slow burning on a horizontal specimen; burning rate < 76 mm/min for thickness < 3 mm or burning stops before 100 mm\n- V-2: burning stops within 30 seconds on a vertical specimen; drips of flaming particles are allowed.\n- V-1: burning stops within 30 seconds on a vertical specimen; drips of particles allowed as long as they are not inflamed.\n- V-0: burning stops within 10 seconds on a vertical specimen; drips of particles allowed as long as they are not inflamed.\n- 5VB: burning stops within 60 seconds on a vertical specimen; no drips allowed; plaque specimens may develop a hole.\n- 5VA: burning stops within 60 seconds on a vertical specimen; no drips allowed; plaque specimens may not develop a hole.\nDoes UL Recognition also relate to product performance?\nUL only tests for safety issues, a UL listing in general does not apply to product performance, unless it relates to safety.\nWhat All Flex Products are UL Recognized?\nAll Flex has a number of constructions for flexible circuits and heaters that are UL listed. The following are current files:\nThe applicable UL spec for flexible circuits is UL796\nAre Process Parameters Included in the Listing?\nAny processing parameter that could affect aging or degradation of the material must be part of the submission. The UL listing would be restricted to those processing conditions. Temperature, pressure, chemicals and humidity are process parameters that are considered to potentially age or degrade materials.\nHow does UL monitor for Compliance?\nUL will perform a quarterly (unannounced) visit. During this visit the auditor will inspect the applicable materials, processing records, and work in process to assure compliance.\nWhat would be an example of non-compliance?\nAny material used in a product build that was not specified in the listing would be an example of non-compliance. Any recorded processing condition falling outside of the submitted range would be considered an incident of non-compliance. Failure to adequately track or record materials and conditions would also be incidents of non-compliance.\nWhat happens if UL finds non-compliance?\nWhen an incident of non-compliance is found, UL allows the company to submit a written response. Non-compliance can result in significant fines and restrictions on applying UL markings on products.']"	['<urn:uuid:c508673f-ed97-45b7-9cb5-06f17433c160>', '<urn:uuid:1e66ce80-bae9-4fd6-92ad-c6c7ee4a4782>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	9	75	1696
18	student mentor training programs implementation details	The mentoring programs involve comprehensive training and implementation strategies. At PAAM, mentors receive full-day training incorporating team-building activities, communication skills practice, and guidance on relationship development. They learn about giving feedback, resolving conflicts, and supporting mentees' independence. At Premier Academy, the mentoring program focuses on specific areas including social-emotional wellbeing, individual talents, leadership, cultural identity, and education goals. The programs both emphasize professional development, with PAAM's mentors working alongside teaching-artists while Premier Academy integrates mentoring with their counseling department to provide comprehensive student support.	['Training Teen Mentors for Young Artists\nProvincetown Art Association and Museum (PAAM) is a nonprofit educational, artistic and cultural organization in Provincetown, Mass. PAAM’s Reaching Forward Mentoring Program provides professional development in the arts for youth ages 17-21 years, while presenting positive role models for middle school students in an engaging professional studio and museum environment. Student mentors work with skilled teaching-artists and educators and receive training to support Art on the Edge, a Saturday arts program for 12- to 15-year-olds.\nAs PAAM moved into its second year of the Reaching Forward program, staff asked Youth Catalytics (then NEN) to provide mentor training that focused on helping mentors understand their relationship to mentees, boundaries, and the expectation that they uphold existing Arts on the Edge structure and expectations. We had previously worked in connection with PAAM under the Compassion Mass. grant in order to provide Positive Youth Development training and consultation around outcome measurement objectives and indicators for youth programming.\nWhat We Did\nWorking closely with PAAM, we created a full-day mentor training that incorporated positive youth development principles within the context of program goals and organizational expectations. The training used experiential activities tied to theory-based learning principles and packaged in fun to keep young people and adults engaged in the training. Throughout the day, we:\n- Facilitated a variety of team- and trust-building activities with mentors and artist-teachers including personal sharing and physical challenges. Each activity included reflection, which asked participants to consider how the lessons learned in the activity were relevant to the mentor program.\n- Guided a conversation about the goals and expectations of the Reaching Forward and Arts on the Edge programs to ensure full understanding and commitment to the objectives\n- Defined and discussed the role of the mentor and of the mentee, phases of the mentoring relationship and how to support relationship development while also achieving program goals\n- Practiced communication skills and used experiential activities to demonstrate how communication can go off-track, how to give and receive feedback in a direct and supportive manner and how to resolve conflicts\n- Explored how mentors transform the mentee/mentor relationship as mentees ‘graduate’ and move towards independence\nYouth Catalytics trained three young people as mentors in 2010 who mentored 20 middle school students. In 2011, we trained five mentors who were matched with 32 students. The training experience:\n- Facilitated PAAM’s observation of new mentors practicing key skills and identifying areas for future professional development\n- Strengthened the abilities of mentor and teacher-artist teams to work together toward program goals\n- Increased tools available to and used by mentors and teacher-artists for reflection and continued development\n- Taught specific mentor skills and strategies that emerged as key elements of program effectiveness and targeted recruitment efforts\n- Supported and reinforced PAAM’s decision to match specific mentees with individual mentors which research indicates improves relationship quality\n- Reinforced overall program goals and expectations leading to better implementation and ability to monitor program performance\n“The support, knowledge, and resources provided by NEN and specifically, the expertise and enthusiasm of Cindy Wilson, have all been instrumental in creating programming at PAAM that supports the young people of our community. Working with NEN helps us meet our goals to provide professional development in the arts and innovative educational opportunities of the highest caliber.”\n~ Lynn Stanley, Curator of Education, PAAM\nFacing a special challenge or being presented with a new opportunity? Contact us. We can help.', 'Counselling and Guidance\nThe Counselling department is an integral part of the educational process here at Premier Academy. Our program is built on the belief that certain educational, career and personal objectives can be achieved when School Counselling is provided to students. The School counselling program is coordinated with the input of teachers, parents and the school administration. With the knowledge that growth and learning is developmental, the School Counselling program is also developmental and sequential.\nThe School Counsellor offers educational and social advice, in addition to guidance services to students from Kindergarten to Year Thirteen. Our primary responsibility is to promote the academic, social/personal and career development of all students.\nThe School Counsellor also holds group counselling sessions, focusing on specific topics such as social skills/friendship, anger management and study/personal organisational skills. Students are encouraged to participate in these activities so as to help them further develop skills that will contribute to their success in school.\nIndividual counselling is also available to students who need short-term assistance and support.\nThe Counselling Department works with every student at the Kindergarten to help make school a safe and welcoming place. This also encourages the social and moral development of our youngest learners. Simple life skills such as good manners, how to make friends and what to do when their feelings are hurt, are imparted to them from a counselling perspective.\nThrough counselling, children in their early years are eased into a formal school setting, so that the new exposure to others broadens their understanding of the world.\nChildren at this age are also guided on how to identify their feelings, what causes them, as well as how to manage their emotions and behave appropriately.\nThe elementary years are a time when students begin to develop their academic self-concept and their feelings of competence and confidence as learners. They begin to develop decision-making, communication and life skills, as well as character values. It is also a time when students develop and acquire attitudes towards the school, themselves, their peers, social groups and their family. Comprehensive developmental school counselling programs provide education, prevention and intervention services, which are integrated into all aspects of children’s lives. Early identification of children’s academic and personal/social needs and intervention into these matters is essential in removing barriers to learning and in promoting academic achievement. The knowledge, attitudes and skills that students acquire in the areas of academic, career and personal/social development during these elementary years serve as the foundation for future success.\nToday’s young people are living in an exciting time, with an increasingly diverse and mobile society, new technology and expanding opportunities. To help ensure that they are prepared to become the next generation of parents, workers, leaders, and citizens, every student requires support, guidance, and opportunities during adolescence-a time of rapid growth and change. Adolescents face unique and diverse challenges, both personally and developmentally, that impact academic achievement.\nThe School Counsellor’s role is to promote emotional, social and personal development in students, in collaboration with students, parents, teachers, administrators and community agencies. Some of our many functions, here at Premier Academy include counselling students, their families and the community to foster growth in the students’ self-esteem, individual responsibility, and in skills such as decision making.\n- Mentoring Program –\nPremier Academy recently launched a mentorship program which is growing steadily. At its most basic level, the program guarantees a young person that there is someone who cares about them such that the child is not alone in dealing with day-to-day challenges.\nThe Mentoring program provides girls and boys at Premier Academy with a role model and a friend to talk to and with whom they can share the experiences of growing up, within school grounds. It is expected that the program will help create all-rounded students and mould them into responsible global citizens.\nMentoring can focus on particular areas including:\n- Social and emotional wellbeing. Mentoring assists the mentee to increase their self-esteem, self-efficacy and resilience by actively supporting their social and emotional wellbeing. The focus includes improving both their life skills and the positive connections they have with their friends.\n- Individual talents and leadership. Mentoring assists students to further develop their individual talents and/or leadership skills in a specific area (e.g. Sports, Music, and Drama) in order for them to reach their full potential.\n- Identity, culture and faith. Mentoring can assist the mentee in understanding their faith and/or culture and cultural identity. The program actively supports mentees to be proud and confident of their identity and culture and to be able to exercise this in their community.\n- Youth justice and crime prevention. Mentoring assists the mentees to avoid anti-social and offending behaviours by encouraging and motivating them to understand their weaknesses and improve on their strengths, and aim to be a better version of themselves.\n- Education, training and employment. Mentoring helps the mentee to positively engage in and maintain their participation in education. The program assists them to develop a vision for their future and provide support to achieve their education and career goals.\nIn Premier Academy, we have two types of mentoring relationships:\nOne to one. One mentor matched with one young person.\nGroup. One mentor matched with a group of young people.\n- Peer Counselling Program –\nPeer counselling is the process by which a trained student provides counselling, support and information to one of their peers (in this case students). The aim of the Peer Counselling Program in the school is to train students as counselors and equip them with the necessary skills and correct information to tackle current issues in the school – ranging from bullying, healthy relationships, mental and physical well being, drugs and alcohol etc. The peer counselors also assist students when they have personal problems as students seek out other young people from their age group to confide in.\nThe Peer Counselling Program provides students with in-depth training and will certify the students as Counsellors.\nParticipating in the Peer Counselling Program also looks good on the individual students’ university application form, as it shows that the student is responsible, motivated, mature, a role-model, and has the necessary skills to become a team leader.\n- Ted Ed Club –\nThrough TED-Ed, students at Premier Academy identify and research the ideas that matter to them most. And while TED-Ed offers students the opportunity to connect with others who, like them, are unabashedly curious about the world,\nTED-Ed is also about presentation literacy.\nThese form a broad spectra ranging from animation creation, story boarding, filming techniques, YouTube broadcasts, media processing and much more…\nTED-Ed offers students a hands-on opportunity to work on storytelling and communication skill – skills that are essential and are relevant to all careers.']	['<urn:uuid:2a190a2a-758a-42b1-ba73-8c0d961b462c>', '<urn:uuid:550ff022-2c81-4c10-9531-7121c5877f93>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	6	84	1696
19	when did nato fire first shots in war and against whom	NATO's first shots in a war were fired in 1995, when they launched three weeks of air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces that had attacked UN-designated safe areas in Bosnia.	"['Amid the ruins of World War II, the Soviet Union was drawing its Iron Curtain across Central and Eastern Europe. To counter the Soviet threat, five European countries signed the Brussels Treaty in March 1948 -- creating the Western European Union.\nRobert Walter, president of the European Security and Defense Assembly of the Western European Union, says that NATO could not have been created without the Brussels Treaty paving the way.\n""Sixty-one years ago was the Treaty of Brussels, which basically brought together the Benelux countries, France, and the United Kingdom in an alliance that was a forerunner of NATO by just one year,"" Walter says. ""We built on that with the Washington Treaty in 1949 -- which then encompassed the United States and Canada. And we\'ve gone on from there as Europe has evolved in the post-World War II environment.""\nIndeed, one of the aims of the Brussels Treaty was to convince the United States to join with Europeans in a defensive alliance. With the signature of the Washington Treaty, the European alliance expanded to include Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Portugal -- and the United States.\nOne key section of the treaty fulfilled the European countries\' hopes for a U.S. security guarantee against a Soviet invasion of Western Europe. It was Article 5: a promise that all NATO allies will come to the aid of any individual NATO country that is attacked.\nReshaping The Alliance\nAfter the Soviet-supported North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950, NATO leaders feared a Soviet attack on West Germany would be next. That is when they reshaped the alliance into a military organization with an integrated command structure.\nIn 1951, NATO established the Supreme Headquarters for Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE). The allies chose U.S. Army General Dwight D. Eisenhower to be the first supreme allied commander in Europe. The next year, NATO bolstered its southeastern flank with its first enlargement -- Greece and Turkey.\nIn 1955, an agreement was reached in Paris on West Germany\'s membership. Walter describes it as a pivotal development that helped facilitate growing unity within Western Europe.\n""The bringing of [West] Germany into the alliance was very, very significant indeed. And the creation, in parallel, of the economic developments of the European Community -- and then the European Union -- I think was also significant,"" Walter says.\nTo the chagrin of France, however, U.S. influence over NATO continued to grow during the 1950s.\nTensions between the Soviet Union and the alliance also rose as NATO shifted its reliance on conventional forces to a strategy of nuclear deterrence.\nIn the summer of 1961, mounting anxiety between East and West led to the creation of the Berlin Wall. At the same time, Washington tried to discourage France and West Germany from developing their own nuclear arsenals by proposing a European nuclear force.\nBut U.S. control over nuclear weapons in Europe was unacceptable to French President Charles de Gaulle. In 1966, de Gaulle withdrew France from NATO\'s military command structures -- forcing NATO to move its headquarters to Belgium.\nDe Gaulle\'s decision marked the start of a new phase in NATO history. A small group of NATO countries, led by Belgium, recommended a policy of detente alongside defense. Meanwhile, on the initiative of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, East-West relations began to improve.\nAs the first part of the Strategic Arms Limitation (SALT) agreements were worked out in 1972, internal divisions surfaced again within NATO -- with some Europeans worried the United States and the Soviet Union would work out deals on their own.\nThen, as Western Europe was lowering its defense expenditures, the Soviet Union began to deploy SS-20 nuclear missiles that were aimed at European cities.\nNATO responded in 1979 by deciding to deploy ground-launched cruise and Pershing II missile systems in Europe. Those deployments began in 1983 and marked an intensification of the nuclear arms race.\nArms-control talks resumed two years later as Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev expressed interest in a new relationship with NATO, and as he launched his policies of glasnost and perestroika.\nChange In Direction\nNeither Washington nor Europe anticipated the beginning of the collapse of the communist system that began in 1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall and climaxed in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nFormer NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, who now directs policy planning in the private office of the NATO secretary-general, says that the fall of the Berlin Wall was a revolutionary moment that ""seemed to spell the end of NATO.""\n""Why would you need NATO if there was no longer an adversary?"" Shea says. ""But in reality, the end of the Cold War brought about a situation where NATO discovered a new role for itself in terms of defense reform and security sector reform, helping these former communist countries to get back on their feet and expand the zone of peace and stability in Europe.""\nAt the same time, the end of the Cold War also meant new threats to European stability -- regional and ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet Union and in the Balkans. It was then that NATO evolved from a purely defensive alliance into one that carried out offensive operations beyond its own borders.\nNATO\'s first shots in a war were fired in 1995, when three weeks of air strikes were launched against Bosnian Serb forces that had attacked UN-designated ""safe areas"" in Bosnia.\nMichael Zantovsky, the Czech ambassador to the United States at the time, notes that those attacks came only after European diplomats had failed for years to broker an end to the fighting in Bosnia and Croatia.\n""All of a sudden, NATO became the only game in town that could effectively stem the tide of nationalism which threatened to engulf the countries emerging from decades of totalitarian rule -- in particular, in the Balkans,"" Zantovsky says.\n""I think that we should never forget that it was NATO that stopped the fighting in the Balkans,"" he continues. ""We can argue about the way it was done. We can argue about the force that was used. But it is not arguable that it was NATO who stopped it.""\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says that NATO\'s decision to launch air strikes on Serbia and Montenegro in 1999 had been heavily influenced by the earlier Balkan wars.\nAlbright was in office during Serbian forces\' crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. ""I had watched that it had taken us too long to get into Bosnia. And so we took NATO to war in a much longer 78-day war,"" Albright says. ""It was very significant because it was on behalf of freedom for people that were being pushed from their houses or killed.""\nAlbright adds: ""It showed the validity of the new mission for NATO. I hope that there were many lessons that came out of the Kosovo campaign that are useful in a different region now -- in Afghanistan. But it is part of the same post-Cold War story -- when an alliance that was set up to be anti-Soviet was, in fact, relevant in the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st.""\nIndeed, the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001 -- which ultimately brought NATO forces into Afghanistan -- also were a historic milestone for the alliance. In response to those attacks, NATO invoked Article 5 of the Washington Treaty for the first and only time in its history.\n""Article 5 was always based on the assumption that somebody would try to seize your territory and send a large conventional military force to cross your border,"" Jamie Shea says. ""That\'s not the way it happened on September 11 when it was the United States -- the country which was providing the Article 5 guarantee to Europe -- which was itself attacked.""\n""It was Europe, paradoxically, which offered assistance to the United States,"" Shea continues. ""It showed that NATO would have to be prepared to deal with a completely different set of security challenges in the 21st century. And it showed that although Article 5 is still sacrosanct, it might be applied in different ways -- for example, the ability to respond in places like Afghanistan. So it caused a process of rethinking in the alliance.""\nMichael Clarke, director of the London-based Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies, says there is another important lesson to be found in NATO\'s recent history. The alliance has undergone two successive expansions since 1999 -- adding Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and the Baltic countries to its ranks -- and has just welcomed Croatia and Albania this year. Such growth, he says, is a reminder that successful alliances must have the capacity to adapt.\n""After 1989 and 1991, I think the enlargement of NATO was a natural and correct reaction. If NATO had not enlarged, it would have been logical to have disbanded itself,"" Clarke says. ""It had very little rationale, unless it enlarged when the Cold War was over, to represent those values and commitments which it had represented during the Cold War.""\nRFE/RL\'s Bruce Jacobs contributed to this report\nNATO: 60 Years In Eight Minutes\n60 Years In Eight Minutes\nIn Washington in 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was born.

20	buddhist qualities needed reach enlightenment	There are five faculties needed to reach enlightenment: faith (as confidence, not blind religious faith), energy (to drive forward and remove obstructions), mindfulness (for clear awareness), concentration (to maintain focused attention), and wisdom (to understand the characteristics of reality).	['Part 3 of the Visuddhimagga is called “Understanding (Paññá).” Nestled amongst the very boring and hard to understand sentences is §74 — §82. It comes across as a sort of Abhidhammic verification of the Pure Land School of Buddhism. It deals almost exclusively with the “faith devotee” described as one of the seven kinds of noble person.\nThe list ranks them this way…\n- The faith devotee,\n- One liberated by faith,\n- The body witness,\n- The both-ways liberated,\n- The Dhamma devotee,\n- One attained to vision, and\n- One liberated by understanding.\nBuddhaghosa cryptically ends the list by saying; “This knowledge of equanimity about formations is a condition for their being placed as these seven classes.” We can be grateful that he didn’t just leave it at that. He actual explains himself in a very clear and detailed way, in spite of the cumbersome translation.\nWhen a resolute practitioner of the Dhamma realizes that all mental formations are impermanent he acquires the “faith faculty.” By faith we do not “blind religious faith,” that would be a hindrance. By “faith” Canon means something more like “confidence.” The one with a faculty of faith is not automatically destined for enlightenment or even a Pure Land rebirth. What the faculty of faith does is to provide the element of stimulus and ambition directing the mind away from the entanglement of doubt and establishes in the mind serene trust in the Triple Gem as the paramount foundation of liberation.\nThere are five faculties, virtues, which are needed to reach enlightenment. Faith is just one. The faculty of energy helps to drive us forward in a sustained effort burning up obstructions and brings the other factors to maturity. The faculty of mindfulness contributes clear awareness that acts as the antidote to heedlessness and the prerequisite of penetration through delusion and into reality. The faculty of concentration holds attention focused with unwavering, calm and composure, on the rise and fall of bodily and mental events, calm and composed. The faculty of wisdom, which the Buddha calls the crowning virtue among all the requisites of enlightenment, drives away the blindness of ignorance and lights up the real characteristics of experiential reality — phenomena — that is, bring the impermanence of mental formations (fabrications) to mind.\nThese are five faculties, taken in the same context, as we would say, “Virtue” here in the West. They are helpful in our pursuit of the direct experience of the emptiness of phenomena. As much as the five faculties, considered individually, each perform their own unique tasks in their appropriate arena, but taken as a group they cause the collective object of building inner balance and harmony.\nBalance and harmony are conducive to practice but do not take us to liberation. They are characteristics we need to form along the Way. That is the next step.\nOne becomes a faith devotee the moment one enters the stream. How does one enter the stream?\nAssociation with people of integrity is a factor for stream-entry.\nListening to the true Dhamma is a factor for stream-entry.\nAppropriate attention is a factor for stream-entry.\nPractice in accordance with the Dhamma is a factor for stream-entry.\n— Samyutta Nikaya 55.5\nRight away we can see how the five faculties, especially faith can help us to maintain an appropriate and successful Dhamma practice. Concentration and wisdom are needed to help us maintain appropriate attention. Faith helps us in all four categories of action mentioned by the Buddha in the Sutta. Association with people of integrity are people who are comfortable in their own skin and able to practice without doubts, without laziness, and without conflict. We can readily see how association with such people would enhance our own confidence or faith. Listening to real Dhamma will also do the same thing, increase faith. Counterfeit teaching will lead to doubts because they will eventually conflict and cause dissonance. Confidence will help us maintain appropriate attention.\nThe stream enterer is the first stage of the fourfold path to enlightenment. The Buddha describes each in the Suttas. It is a very straightforward definition and worth the read.\n“In this community of monks there are monks who are arahants, whose effluents are ended, who have reached fulfillment, done the task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal, totally destroyed the fetter of becoming, and who are released through right gnosis…\n“In this community of monks there are monks who, with the total ending of the five lower fetters, are due to be reappear [in the Pure Abodes], there to be totally unbound, never again to return from that world…\n“In this community of monks there are monks who, with the total ending of [the first] three fetters, and with the attenuation of passion, aversion, & delusion, are once-returners, who — on returning only one more time to this world — will make an ending to stress…\n“In this community of monks there are monks who, with the total ending of [the first] three fetters, are stream-winners, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening.”\n— Majjhima Nikaya 118\nThe Stream enterer has the “total” ending of the first three fetters: identity view, doubt, and grasping at habits & practices. These are called the “effluents that are to be abandoned by seeing.” (Majjhima Nikaya 2) It is when these three fetters are abandoned that the person with the faith faculty becomes a “faith devotee.” The identity view concerns “the various views that arise in the world, householder…when self-identity view is present, these views come into being; when self-identity view is absent, they don’t come into being.” —Isidatta Sutta, SN 41.3\nThe self-view is a mind that takes things personally — this is me, this is mine — and that is a cause for suffering. We only think with concepts. “I” is a concept that we have created. Because we take things personally we feel tension and tightness within our mind and our body. Contraction of body and mind is an unpleasant experience. The mind that takes things personally is the very definition of delusion.\nThere are ten fetters that bind the mind to the round of death & rebirth are (1) identity views, (2) uncertainty, (3) grasping at habits and practices, (4) sensual passion, (5) irritation, (6) passion for form, (7) passion for formlessness, (8) conceit, (9) restlessness, and (10) ignorance. The stream enterer, in our case the faith devotee, has relinquished the first three. The devotee has not yet conquered remainder. That is why they are said to be doomed to rebirth — but no more than seven. So powerful is the removal of identity view, doubt, and grasping at habits and practices.\nPlease notice that the Canon is specific of what is to be let go. It does not say relinquish anything except the grasping at habits and practices. There will still be habits and practices but not a dependence on them. The habit of brushing one’s teeth in the morning is a good one, but it is not earth shattering if it postponed to another time. It is the paralysis we feel by not following through on our rituals that is to be let go. We have routines we follow everyday. The problem arises when they drive us.\nThe statement was made that the faith devotee is liberated. So how is this stream enterer liberated when Arahantship or Buddhahood is the essence of liberation? The faith devotee has let go of only three of the ten fetters. In §76 Buddhaghosa tells us, “This is said: ‘when he brings [formations] to mind as impermanent, the faith faculty is in excess in him. With the faith faculty in excess he acquires the stream-entry path. Hence he is called a ‘faith devotee’” Likewise, “When he brings [formations] to mind as impermanent, the faith faculty is realized. Hence he is called ‘one liberated by faith’” Here is the liberation the faith devotee has attained — liberation from precisely the three fetters by gaining the insight that all his or her fabrications of mind are impermanent and therefore delusionary.\nWhen we try to attribute permanence to that which is impermanent we have also misappropriated the object of the attribution. For example, when we hear some proud father say, “I will always love my son. You can’t change that.” He has attributed permanence to 1) his love for his son, and 2) his son as he exists in the father’s eye. In making this claim, the father has taken possession of 1) his love for his son, as if he owned it and it had some inherent self-existence, and 2) the son himself, as if he were the sole possession of the father. If the father were to have another thought in his mind the son would not exist in his experiential reality and neither would the love he just misattributed eternal existence.\nThe mind is fickle. It will latch onto any notion set forth before it.\nHere though we see also that the same attributes given the faith devotee also apply to the Dhamma devotee. Again, §74: “When a man brings [them] to mind as not-self and, having great wisdom, acquires the faculty of understanding, he becomes a Dhamma devotee at the moment of the stream-entry path.” The two paths are somewhat different in that the emphasis of motivation was not identical. The faith devotee is moved by confidence while “understanding” moves the Dhamma devotee. This does not mean that one is superior to the other. The object of devotion, whether faith or understanding, is a unique choice made by the devotee dependent upon his conditioning and kamma. One is in the case of the highest fruition one liberated by faith and the other liberated by understanding. In either case they are liberated from the same three fetters and the illusion of permanence, just as the Canon says.\nThe interesting thing that is brought out in the Commentary, the Visuddhimagga, is that the two types of devotees merge into one. It should be understood that the faith devotee as stream enterer follows (anusarati; literally, “to follow,” or “conform oneself”) faith, thus he is a faith devotee (saddhānusāri); of he follows, he goes, by means of faith, thus he is a faith devotee. At the same time, he follows the Dhamma called understanding, or he follows by means of the Dhamma, thus he is a Dhamma devotee. He becomes liberated in both ways, by immaterial jhana (understanding) and the noble path (faith), thus he is both-ways liberated. Understanding, he is liberated, thus he is liberated by understanding. Putting aside the jhana for a moment, The Buddha explained this liberation as the total ending of [the first] three Fetters, are Stream-winners, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening. (Majjhima Nikaya 118)\nThe Pure Land would necessarily exist in the Fine Material world (rupa loka). This is experienced in the fourth jhana. The Anguttara Nikaya 4.123 says it comes “with the abandoning of pleasure & stress — as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress — enters & remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain. He savors that, longs for that, and finds satisfaction through that. Staying there — fixed on that, dwelling there often, not falling away from that — then when he dies he reappears in conjunction with the Vehapphala (literally “sky fruit”) devas. The Vehapphala devas, monks, have a life span of 500 eons. A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, goes to hell, to the animal womb, to the state of the hungry shades. But a disciple of the Blessed One, having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, is unbound right in that state of being.”\nBy this description we can see that the description of Sukhavati, Amitabha’s Western Pure Land, harmonizes with the Buddha’s own description of the Pure Abodes found in the Nikayas. This is the realm of the anāgāmī, the non-returner. A person who has abandoned the five lower fetters that bind the mind to the cycle of rebirth, and who after death will appear in one of the Brahma worlds called the Pure Abodes, there to attain nibbana, never again to return to this world. If we look at the verse quoted above, we find the Buddha said of such a one, “…having used up all the life-span of those devas, is unbound right in that state of being.” (See Majjhima Nikaya 118)\nDoesn’t this look like the Pure Land? The devotee at this stage has released himself from the fetters of self-identification views (sakkaya ditthi), uncertainty (vicikiccha), grasping at precepts and practices (sīlabbata-parāmāsa), sensual passion (kāma-rāga), and resistance (vyāpāda often used to mean malevolence). Non-returners are those who have fully developed virtue and concentration. (Anguttara Nikaya 3.88) Developing virtue and concentration is precisely the point of the Pure Land Buddhist practice. Virtue is developed through the practice of the Brahma Viharas and the Bodhisattva aspirations found in the Ten Perfections. Concentration is developed through the single pointed focus on Amitabha Buddha, the symbolic essence of Metta (the desire all beings be happy), Karuna (compassion as the activity relieving the suffering of others), and wisdom (as critical discernment). Such concentration can readily take the devotee into the jhanas with ease.\nIn the Pali Canon and Commentaries we do not have to go far to find the impetus and core of the Pure Land Buddhist doctrine. One just has to know where to look. That the Pure Land Buddhist begins with deep abiding faith, whether in a supposed being called Amitabha Buddha who is emblematic of the qualities of Metta, Karuna and Pañña, or if that faith is placed in the historical Buddha is not terribly relevant to them or their development. The important matter is the development of the individual, their happiness, their peace, and their freedom.\nIt is true that Pure Land Buddhism can easily degenerate into superstition, but this is true of any trend in Buddhism. Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana can all at one time or another be prone to superstition and meaningless rituals. The point is, like any trend of Buddhism, Pure Land Buddhism can lead the devotee to the highest realms of awakening and experience — and is that not why we practice?']	['<urn:uuid:1ab8f336-97a7-4891-b9b4-e86bbd945187>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	5	39	2396
21	pcb designer electromagnetic compatibility factors crosstalk shielding grounding	The main factors affecting electromagnetic compatibility in PCB design are crosstalk (caused by signals crossing breaks in ground planes, which can couple strongly resulting in significant interference), shielding (using metal isolation to control EMI through electrostatic and electromagnetic shielding), and proper grounding (including ground plane continuity and avoiding ground loops that cause RF and ground bounce).	"['Address: P. O. Box 1457, Los Gatos,\nFigure 1. A path crossing a break in a ground plane\nEMC and signal integrity engineers know that a signal that crosses over\na break in a ground plane often causes reflections as well as immunity and\nEMC problems. An additional problem that often results is excessive crosstalk\nbetween paths crossing the break. Figure 1 shows part of a circuit\nboard with a single path (of approximately 50 Ohms impedance) that crosses\na 5 cm break in the ground plane. The path is about 10 cm in length. The\nboard\'s solid ground plane extends downward from the bottom of the figure\nfor about another 10 cm. A 300 mV signal with a risetime of about 300 ps\nwas launched on the signal path. The waveform across the 47 Ohm resistor,\nnodes 1 and 2, is shown in Figure 2 using 100 mV/div and 5 ns/div scale factors.\nThe voltage across the ground plane break at nodes 3 and 4 is shown in Figure 3. Both waveforms were taken with a Fischer Custom Communications BCP-1 differential probe. Notice\nthe that the peak voltage in Figure 3 is almost 100 mV. That voltage represents\nthe voltage drop caused by the signal\'s return current flowing in the ground\nplane through the impedance (read that ""inductance"") of the path around the\nend of the break in the ground plane. As bad as this is for radiated emissions\nimagine what would happen if a second path crossed the break 1 cm above the\nsignal path, about halfway between the existing signal path and the top\nedge of the board above nodes 3 and 4.\n|Figure 2. Signal Voltage (V1-V2)\n|Figure 3. Slit Voltage (V3-V4)\nNormally, there would not be significant crosstalk between two paths spaced 1 cm apart over\na ground plane. However, in this case, both paths must\nshare the impedance around the end of the ground plane break in their return\npaths and thus the voltage measured across the break in Figure 3 will be\ncoupled into the second, victim, path. For the common case of a low impedance\ngate output driving a high impedance gate input in the victim path, the ~80\nmV peak voltage of Figure 3 will show up as crosstalk between the signal\npath of Figure 1 and our hypothetical victim path. In this case, the peak\ncrosstalk is nearly 1/3 of the original signal amplitude, not a value that\ncan be ignored.\nAs a general rule, any paths crossing a break in a ground plane (actually in all the ground and power planes of a board) will likely be strongly coupled resulting in significant crosstalk. The plane breaks I have seen in some equipment are much longer that the example of Figure 1. For those cases, even signals with much slower risetime could be strongly coupled. For cases of a broken ground plane over a solid power plane, or vice versa, there may or may not be a problem depending on several factors including plane spacing. Such a case is beyond the scope of this short Technical Tidbit.\nThe waveforms in this article were taken with an Agilent\nInfinium 54845a oscilloscope.\nTop of page', 'How to design electromagnetic compatibility and electromagnetic interference for PCB circuits\n1.General concepts of electromagnetic compatibility\nThe root cause to consider is the presence of electromagnetic interference. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is the process by which destructive electromagnetic energy is transmitted from one electronic device to another through radiation or conduction. Generally speaking, EMI refers to radio frequency signals (RF), but electromagnetic interference can occur in all frequency ranges.\n(Electromagnetic Compatibility, EMC for short) refers to the operation of electrical and electronic systems, equipment, and devices at the designed level or performance within the specified safety limits in a set electromagnetic environment without being damaged or impossible due to electromagnetic interference Ability to receive performance degradation. The electromagnetic environment referred to here refers to the sum of all electromagnetic phenomena existing in a given place. This indicates that electromagnetic compatibility means that the electronic product should have the ability to suppress external electromagnetic interference; on the other hand, the electromagnetic interference generated by the electronic product should be below the limit and must not affect the normal operation of other electronic equipment in the same electromagnetic environment.\nToday\'s electronics have shifted from analog to digital design. With the development of digital logic devices, issues related to EMI and EMC have begun to become the focus of the product, and have received great attention from designers and users. The United States Communications Commission (FCC) published radiation standards for personal computers and similar devices in the mid-to-late 1970s, and the European Commission introduced mandatory requirements for radiation and immunity in its 89/336 / EEC electromagnetic compatibility guidance document. China has also formulated national standards and national military standards related to electromagnetic compatibility, such as ""electromagnetic compatibility terms"" (GB / T4365-1995), ""electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic compatibility terms"" (GJB72-85), ""radio interference and anti- Specification for interference measurement equipment ""(GB / T6113-1995),"" Measurement methods and allowable values of radio interference characteristics of power tools, household appliances and similar appliances ""(GB4343-84). These electromagnetic compatibility specifications have greatly promoted electronic design technology and improved the reliability and applicability of electronic products.\n2. The importance of EMC in design\nAs the sensitivity of electronic equipment becomes higher and higher, and the ability to accept weak signals becomes stronger, the frequency band of electronic products becomes wider and wider, and the size becomes smaller and smaller, and the anti-interference ability of electronic equipment is required to become stronger and stronger. The electromagnetic waves generated by some electrical and electronic equipment when they work can easily cause electromagnetic interference to other electrical and electronic equipment around them, causing malfunctions or affecting signal transmission. In addition, excessive electromagnetic interference will cause electromagnetic pollution, endanger people\'s physical health, and damage the ecological environment.\nIf various electrical equipment in a system can work normally without mutual electromagnetic interference causing performance changes and equipment damage, people will call the electrical equipment in this system compatible with each other. However, with the diversification of equipment functions, the complexity of the structure, the increase in power and the increase in frequency, at the same time their sensitivity is getting higher and higher, and this mutually compatible state is becoming more and more difficult to obtain. In order for the system to achieve electromagnetic compatibility, it must be based on the electromagnetic environment of the system. It is required that each electrical equipment does not generate electromagnetic emissions exceeding a certain limit, and at the same time it must have a certain ability to resist interference. Only by making constraints and improvements in these two aspects for each device can we ensure that the system is fully compatible.\nGenerally speaking, there are two ways to transmit electromagnetic interference: one is the conduction method; the other is the radiation method. In actual engineering, interference between two devices usually involves the coupling of many ways. It is precisely because the coupling of multiple pathways exists at the same time, crosses repeatedly, and jointly produces interference, which makes electromagnetic interference difficult to control.\nCommon electromagnetic interferences are as follows:\n(1) Radio frequency interference. Due to the proliferation of existing radio transmitters, radio frequency interference poses a great threat to electronic systems. Cell phones, handheld radios, radio remote control units, pagers and other similar devices are now very common. No harmful power is required to cause harmful interference. Typical faults occur in the RF field strength range of 1 to 10V / m. In Europe, North America, and many Asian countries, avoiding RF interference to damage other equipment has become a legal requirement for all products.\n(2) Electrostatic discharge (ESD). Modern chip technology has made great progress, and components have become very dense in very small geometries (0.18um). These high-speed, millions of transistor microprocessors have high sensitivity and are easily damaged by external electrostatic discharge. The discharge can be caused directly or by radiation. Direct contact discharges generally cause permanent damage to the equipment. Electrostatic discharge caused by radiation may cause equipment disturbances and abnormal operation.\n(3) Power interference. As more and more electronic devices are connected to the power backbone network, there will be some potential interference in the system. These disturbances include power line disturbances, electrical fast transients, surges, voltage changes, lightning transients, and power line harmonics. For high-frequency switching power supplies, these interferences become significant.\n(4) Self-compatibility. Digital parts or circuits of a system may interfere with analog equipment, create crosstalk between wires, or a motor may cause disturbances in digital circuits.\nIn addition, an electronic product that can work normally at low frequencies will encounter some problems that are not found at low frequencies when the frequency increases. Such as reflection, string winding, ground bounce, high frequency noise, etc.\nAn electronic product that does not comply with EMC specifications is not a qualified electronic design. In addition to designing products to meet market functional requirements, appropriate design techniques must be employed to prevent or eliminate the effects of EMI.\n3. EMC considerations for design\nFor high-speed (Printed Circuit Board, printed circuit board) design EMI problems, there are usually two methods to solve: one is to suppress the effects of EMI, and the other is to shield the effects of EMI. These two methods have many different manifestations, especially the shielding system minimizes the possibility of EMI affecting electronic products.\nRadio frequency (RF) energy is generated by switching currents in printed circuit boards (PCBs), which are byproducts of digital components. In a power distribution system, each logic state change will generate an instantaneous surge. In most cases, these logic state changes will not generate enough ground noise voltage to cause any functional impact. When the edge rate (rise time and fall time) becomes relatively fast, enough RF energy is generated to affect the normal operation of other electronic components.\n3.1 Causes of electromagnetic interference on PCB\nImproper practices often cause out-of-specification EMI on the PCB. Combined with the characteristics of high-frequency signals, the main aspects related to PCB-level EMI include the following aspects:\n(1) Improper use of packaging measures. For example, devices that should be packaged in metal are packaged in plastic.\n(2) The PCB design is poor, the completion quality is not high, and the grounding of the cable and connector is poor.\n(3) Improper or even wrong PCB layout.\nIncluding improper setting of clock and periodic signal traces; improper hierarchical arrangement of PCBs and signal wiring layers; improper selection of components with high-frequency RF energy distribution; insufficient consideration of common mode and differential mode filtering; ground loops causing RF And ground bounce; insufficient bypass and decoupling, etc.\nTo achieve system-level EMI suppression, some appropriate methods are usually needed: this mainly includes shielding, padding, grounding, filtering, decoupling, proper wiring, circuit impedance control, and so on.\n3.2 Electromagnetic compatibility shielding design\nToday\'s electronics industry is paying more and more attention to the need for SE / EMC (Shielding Effectiveness, SE), and with the use of more electronic components, electromagnetic compatibility has become more concerned. Electromagnetic shielding is based on the principle of metal isolation to control electromagnetic interference from one area to another and induce and radiate electricity. Usually includes two types: one is electrostatic shielding, which is mainly used to prevent the influence of electrostatic field and constant magnetic field; the other is electromagnetic shielding, which is mainly used to prevent the influence of alternating electric field, alternating magnetic field and alternating electromagnetic field.\nEMI shielding can make the product simple and effective in compliance with EMC standards. When the frequency is below 10MHz, most of the electromagnetic waves are conducted, while the higher frequency electromagnetic waves are mostly radiated. New designs such as single layer solid shielding material, multilayer solid shielding material, double shielding or more than double shielding can be used for EMI shielding. For low-frequency electromagnetic interference, a thick shielding layer is required. The most suitable is to use a material with high permeability or magnetic material, such as nickel-copper alloy, to obtain the maximum electromagnetic absorption loss. For high-frequency electromagnetic waves, metal shielding material.\nIn actual EMI shielding, the effectiveness of electromagnetic shielding depends largely on the physical structure of the chassis, that is, the continuity of conduction. The seams and openings on the chassis are sources of electromagnetic wave leakage. In addition, the cable passing through the chassis is also the main cause of the shielding effectiveness. The electromagnetic leakage of the opening on the chassis is related to the shape of the opening, the characteristics of the radiation source, and the distance from the radiation source to the opening. The shielding effectiveness can be improved by appropriately designing the opening size and the distance from the radiation source to the opening. Generally, the way to solve the electromagnetic leakage of the slot of the case is to use an electromagnetic sealing gasket in the slot. Electromagnetic sealing gasket is a conductive elastic material, which can maintain the continuity of conduction in the gap. Common electromagnetic sealing gaskets are: conductive rubber (doped with conductive particles in rubber, so that this composite material has both rubber elasticity and metal conductivity.), Double conductive rubber (it is not mixed in all parts of rubber Incorporating conductive particles, the benefits obtained in this way are both to maintain the elasticity of the rubber to the greatest extent and to ensure electrical conductivity), metal braided mesh sleeves (rubber-based metal braided mesh sleeves), spiral tube liners (using stainless steel, Spiral tube made of beryllium copper or tin-plated beryllium copper). In addition, when the ventilation requirements are relatively high, a cut-off waveguide ventilation board must be used. This board is equivalent to a high-pass filter and does not attenuate electromagnetic waves higher than a certain frequency, but for electromagnetic waves lower than this frequency, For a large attenuation, reasonable application of this characteristic up to the waveguide can well shield EMI interference.\n3.3 Reasonable PCB Design for EMC\nWith the large-scale increase in the complexity and integration of system design, electronic system designers are engaged in circuit design above 100MHZ, and the operating frequency of the bus has also reached or exceeded 50MHZ, and some even exceeded 100MHZ. When the system is operating at 50MHz, transmission line effects and signal integrity issues will occur; and when the system clock reaches 120MHz, PCBs based on traditional methods will not work unless knowledge of high-speed circuit design is used. Therefore, high-speed circuit design technology has become a design method that electronic system designers must adopt. The controllability of the design process can only be achieved by using the design techniques of high-speed circuit designers.\nIt is generally believed that if the frequency of a digital logic circuit reaches or exceeds 45MHZ ~ 50MHZ, and the circuit working above this frequency has already occupied a certain amount of the entire electronic system (such as 1/3), it is called a high-speed circuit. In fact, the harmonic frequency of the signal edge is higher than the frequency of the signal itself, which is an unexpected result of signal transmission caused by the rapidly changing rising and falling edges (or signal transitions) of the signal. To achieve EMC-compliant high-frequency PCB design, the following technologies are usually required: including bypass and decoupling, ground control, transmission line control, and wiring termination matching.\n(1) Bypass and decoupling\nDecoupling refers to removing RF energy that enters the distribution network from high-frequency devices during device switching, while bypassing is the transfer of unwanted common-mode RF energy from components or cables.\nAll capacitors are composed of LCR circuits, where L is the inductance, which is related to the length of the wire, R is the resistance in the wire, and C is the capacitance. At a certain frequency, the LC series combination will produce resonance. In the resonant state, the LCR circuit will have very small impedance and effective RF bypass. When the frequency is higher than the self-resonance of the capacitor, the capacitor becomes inductive impedance, and the effect of bypassing or decoupling decreases. Therefore, the effect of capacitors for bypassing and decoupling is affected by the length of the leads, the traces between the capacitor and the device, and the dielectric filler. The ideal decoupling capacitor can also provide all the current required for logic device state switching. In fact, the impedance between the power supply and the ground layer determines how much current the capacitor can provide.\nWhen the bypass and decoupling capacitors are selected, the self-resonant frequency of the required capacitor can be calculated by the logic series and the clock speed used, and the capacitance value is selected according to the frequency and the capacitive reactance in the circuit. When choosing the package scale, try to choose a capacitor with a lower lead inductance as much as possible. This usually manifests itself as an SMT (Surface Mount Technology) capacitor instead of a through-hole capacitor (such as a DIP packaged capacitor). In addition, in product design, parallel decoupling capacitors are often used to provide a larger operating frequency band and reduce ground imbalance. In a parallel capacitor system, when the frequency is higher than the self-resonant frequency, a large capacitor exhibits an inductive impedance and increases with increasing frequency; a small capacitor exhibits a capacitive impedance and decreases with increasing frequency. The impedance is smaller than that of a single capacitor.']"	['<urn:uuid:9ef7b8eb-e2a6-4e87-9ce8-4b114133bcab>', '<urn:uuid:fba54ebd-d2cc-4212-aa2e-6679c2a0177a>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	8	56	2896
22	How do human activities and wildlife management practices affect the development of mixed forests and their long-term survival?	Human activities and wildlife management practices have significant impacts on mixed forests. While proper management can lead to the development of miraculous mixed wood forests featuring both deciduous and evergreen trees with rich wildlife corridors and wetlands, poor management decisions can lead to forest degradation. A key issue is the disconnect between wildlife and forest management - typically, state governments regulate animals while federal government regulates forests, leading to uncoordinated conservation efforts. This has been demonstrated in cases like the Pando clone, where unregulated herbivore populations (deer and cattle) have caused forest degeneration over the past 40-50 years. The solution lies in aligning plant and animal conservation efforts to work together, treating the ecosystem as a whole rather than managing wildlife and forests separately.	['The present is full of opportunity. Never before in the history of the planet has mankind been given the privileges and opportunities that are at his disposal today. A great light has been raised and is penetrating the darkness of the world, but alas, too many with dust blinded eyes have yet to catch the vision. Some of us have. That is our privilege and our responsibility. ~Richard St. Barbe Baker.\nWhat is an afforestation area? Afforestation is the planting of trees upon land which have not contained trees previously.\nReforestation, on the other hand, is the reforestation of an existing forest which has been depleted usually because of deforestation.\nDeforestation is the removal of a forest to make use of the land as farms, ranches, or neighbourhoods.\nSo in the case of the Richard St. Barbe Baker Afforestation Area, and the Afforestation Area Formerly known as George Genereux Park, the lands were part of the aspen parkland biome. Aspen parkland refers to a very large area of transitional biome between prairie and boreal forest. Aspen parkland consists of groves of aspen poplars and spruce interspersed with areas of prairie grasslands, also intersected by large stream and river valleys lined with aspen-spruce forests and dense shrubbery. This is the largest boreal-grassland transition zone in the world and is a zone of constant competition and tension as prairie and woodlands struggle to overtake each other within the parkland.\nBecause of afforestation, the area possesses a miraculous, and fully established mixed wood forest featuring both deciduous and evergreen trees. It is common in the Saskatchewan eco-system to not behold a mixed forest of this stature unless one is north of the tree line or at Cypress Hills park, as both these areas are at a higher elevation. To have a mature mixed forest with gorgeous canopy, full understorey, rich and vibrant semi-wilderness wildlife habitat corridor along with wetlands inclusive of Chappell Marsh with emergent fauna is a true blessing and good fortune within the boundary limits of the City of Saskatoon. This is a tribute to the City of Saskatoon parks department and the great insight of a great man, named Bert Wellman Saskatoon Director of Planning and Development who had a vision for a green belt to embrace and grace Saskatoon.\nFrom water and earth we came, and the future of mankind on this planet will be determined by respectful or disrespectful treatment of these basic elements. ~Richard St. Barbe Baker\nFor more information:\nRichard St. Barbe Baker Afforestation Area is located in Saskatoon, SK, CA north of Cedar Villa Road, within city limits, in the furthest south west area of the city.\nWikimapia Map: type in Richard St. Barbe Baker Afforestation Area\nGoogle Maps South West Off Leash area location pin at parking lot\nWeb page: https://stbarbebaker.wordpress.com\nIf you wish to support the afforestation area with your donation, write a cheque please to the “Meewasin Valley Authority Richard St. Barbe Baker Afforestation Area trust fund” (MVA RSBBAA trust fund) and mail it to Richard St. Barbe Baker Afforestation Area c/o Meewasin Valley Authority, 402 Third Ave S, Saskatoon SK S7K 3G5. Thank you kindly!\nTwitter: St Barbe Baker', 'Behold the Pando aspen clone, a sprawling carpet of vibrant green-yellow quaking aspens occupying more than 100 acres outside the Fishlake National Forest in Utah.\nThe “Trembling Giant,” as it is known, is actually a massive single organism connected by one sprawling root system. This ancient marvel of nature is thousands of years old — scientists don’t know exactly how old — and is considered the largest living organism on Earth.\nUnfortunately, it’s also dying. And humans may be responsible.\nAn ancient forest degraded over decades\nTo be clear, according to new research published in PLOS One, it isn’t necessarily human disregard or negligence that has threatened the Trembling Giant. It’s the herbivorous ungulates, aka the deer and cattle that graze in the area, that we allow to graze among the Pando’s trees.\n“While several human alterations to this forest have taken place in recent decades, it is the lack of simultaneous herbivore regulation that has caused this stand’s degeneration,” the study says.\n“This all relates back to human decisions,” Paul Rogers, the author of the study, told CNN. Rogers is an adjunct professor at Utah State University and the Director of the Western Aspen Alliance.\n“Even though wildlife are involved, humans govern the number and movement of animals.”\nA call to treat systems, not species\nThe solution, Rogers says, is in aligning plant and animal conservation efforts so they work together.\n“We can no longer manage wildlife and forests separately,” he says. “Typically, state governments regulate animals and the federal government regulates the forests or vegetation.”\nAccording to the study, which included samples, photography and other data taken from a sample site within the Pando, the forest started to thin out about 40 to 50 years ago. Around that time, Rogers says populations of elk started to grow around the area.\nNow, other species such as mule deer are protected by certain hunting regulations and roam unbothered. Grazing cattle populations and the rise of campgrounds and roads around the area have posed even more threats to the Pando’s ecosystem.\nOne organism, supporting many\nPreserving the Pando clone isn’t just important because of its age and size — the forest is also an example of how a whole ecosystem can be dependent on just a few species.\n“Aspen forests in general, including the Pando forest, support high levels of biodiversity,” says Rogers. In this instance, the quaking aspen is considered a “keystone species” — a species upon which others depend.\n“It has a cascading effect on other species, both plants and animals. If you remove one species, others will be limited as well.”\nBut there’s some good news. The aspens are a hardy organism, Rogers says, and with the right actions the Pando could flourish once again.\nRogers says the Pando clone “had a survival strategy that worked very well and expanded over millennia. But now it’s becoming unwound over half a century, and that points the finger at us as the main cause.\n“The upside is that clearly points the finger at us to create a restoration process, and work out compromises that are really focused on the whole ecosystem.”']	['<urn:uuid:6cfb5a20-ac9a-488d-a432-e0658eecd1d2>', '<urn:uuid:b745642f-660c-4e9f-adba-7f7cdf2ec27f>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	18	124	1049
23	Why do people notice food smells more when hungry?	This is an example of a perceptual set, which is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way. Perceptual sets can be short term, and in this case, the drive of hunger makes people especially sensitive to food-related stimuli, making it easier for them to notice the smell of food.	"['Methods | Statistics | Clinical | Educational | Industrial | Professional items | World psychology |\nIn psychology, a set is a group of expectations that shape experience by making people especially sensitive to specific kinds of information. A perceptual set, also called perceptual expectancy, is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way. Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses. They can be long term, such as a special sensitivity to hearing one\'s own name in a crowded room, or short term, as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food. A mental set is a framework for thinking about a problem. It can be shaped by habit or by desire. Mental sets can make it easy to solve a class of problem, but attachment to an inappropriate mental set can restrict problem-solving and creativity.\nPerception can be shaped by ""top-down"" processes such as drives and expectations. An effect of these factors is that people are particularly sensitive to perceive certain things, detecting them from weaker stimuli than otherwise. A simple demonstration of the effect involved very brief presentations of non-words such as ""sael"". Subjects who were told to expect words about animals read it as ""seal"", but others who were expecting boat-related words read it as ""sail"".\nSets can be created by motivation and so can result in people interpreting ambiguous figures so that they see what they want to see. For instance, how someone perceives what unfolds during a sports game can be biased if they strongly support one of the teams. In one experiment, students were allocated to pleasant or unpleasant tasks by a computer. They were told that either a number or a letter would flash on the screen to say whether they were going to taste an orange juice drink or an unpleasant-tasting health drink. In fact, an ambiguous figure was flashed on screen, which could either be read as the letter B or the number 13. When the letters were associated with the pleasant task, subjects were more likely to perceive a letter B, and when letters were associated with the unpleasant task they tended to perceive a number 13.\nPerceptual set has been demonstrated in many social contexts. People who are primed to think of someone as ""warm"" are more likely to perceive a variety of positive characteristics in them, than if the word ""warm"" is replaced by ""cold"". When someone has a reputation for being funny, an audience are more likely to find them amusing. Individual\'s perceptual sets reflect their own personality traits. For example, people with an aggressive personality are quicker to correctly identify aggressive words or situations.\nMental sets are subconscious tendencies to approach a problem in a particular way. They are shaped by past experiences and habits. An inappropriate mental set can hamper the solution of straightforward problems. For example when people are asked, ""When a United States plane carrying Canadian passengers crashes in international waters, where should the survivors be buried?"" the phrasing of the question suggests that it is a problem of international law. People who interpret the statement with this mental set will miss the fact that survivors would not need to be buried. A specific form of mental set is functional fixedness, in which someone fails to see the variety of uses to which an object can be put. An example would be someone who needs a weight but fails to use an easily available hammer because their mental set is to think of a hammer as for a specific purpose.\n- ↑ 1.0 1.1 Weiten, Wayne (17 December 2008).

24	What should I do with the water after cooking whole crabs to avoid getting sick from domoic acid?	You should discard any water or broth used to cook whole crabs and not use it to prepare dishes such as sauces, broths, soups, stews, stocks, roux, dressings or dips. This is because domoic acid may leach from the crab's internal organs into the cooking liquid.	['Question: Is there any kind of domoic acid test kit available that a consumer can use to test his/her own crabs? I would think there would be a lot of interest in this. I love to catch and eat crabs but also hate risking getting sick! (Bob W.)\nAnswer: If you do a google search you will find some kits that state they will detect domoic acid toxins in shellfish, marine algae and water samples. However, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) cannot comment on the suitability of these products to address your concerns. You can minimize your risk though by following California Department of Public Health (CDPH) advisories. In their recent news release, CDPH advised that meat from Dungeness crabs caught in areas where the advisory has been lifted is safe to consume. However, consumers are advised to not eat the viscera (internal organs, also known as “butter” or “guts”) of crabs.\nCrab viscera usually contain much higher levels of domoic acid than crab body meat. When whole crabs are cooked in liquid, domoic acid may leach from the viscera into the cooking liquid. Water or broth used to cook whole crabs should be discarded and not used to prepare dishes such as sauces, broths, soups or stews (i.e. cioppino or gumbo), stocks, roux, dressings or dips.\nTo check for current health warnings on the consumption of crabs and other shellfish, I suggest you call CDPH’s shellfish hotline at (800) 553-4133 or visit CDPH’s Domoic Acid health information Web page. This information is always up to date and available via a recorded message 24/7.\nIf I see a mountain lion, who do I call?\nQuestion: What do I do when I see a mountain lion come on my property? Who do I call? (Darren M.)\nAnswer: If you see a mountain lion come onto your property, you don’t need to call anyone unless the animal is acting aggressively toward you or your family, or if it appears to be sick or diseased. If you feel it is an immediate threat to you, call 911. But mountain lions are usually just looking for deer or other prey animals.\nIf you do know you have a mountain lion around your home, I suggest you keep small children, pets and other animals in a protective area, especially from early evening through mornings when mountain lions are most active. If the animal is just passing through, as they typically do, you might just watch it and enjoy the unique opportunity you’re being given to actually see one. Most people will never have the chance to see one in their lifetimes.\nFor more information, please check out our living with mountain lions webpage.\nDo blue catfish reproduce in California?\nQuestion: Do blue catfish reproduce in California lakes? If not, why? (Mike M., Anaheim)\nAnswer: Blue catfish can reproduce if they are mature (which can take 4-7 years) and the right temperatures and other environmental conditions exist. In the wild, they typically prefer a cave habitat where they can construct a nest (eg: under rock ledges, logs, or undercut banks) and it is the male that guards and protects the eggs and young fry. Catfish farmers often place into their ponds containers like old milk cans to help the spawning catfish establish nests so that the eggs are easily retrieved and further nurtured in the hatchery. In California, spawning season is late spring/early summer, as temperatures are warming.\nLifetime license still valid if I move out of state?\nQuestion: I was looking into the Lifetime Hunting/Fishing license. This may be a stupid question but if I leave the state of California and change my residency, do I forfeit the whole lifetime license? I assume I must live in California in order to qualify. (Bill)\nAnswer: No, you won’t forfeit it. Under the provisions of a Lifetime Hunting or Fishing License, your license is valid for hunting/fishing when you return to visit even if you move out of state. You would be required to buy non-resident tags for big game species but the license is still valid. For more on the benefits and privileges of hunting and fishing lifetime licenses, please visit the department website.\nCan you harvest abalone for a handicapped individual?\nQuestion: Just curious if there are any provisions in the abalone regulations to allow someone to assist a handicapped person. For example, if the person is unable to dive for abalone, can someone else harvest the catch for them? (Todd J., Milbrae)\nAnswer: No, an individual may only take or possess one daily limit of abalone (which is three). A diver could take three abalone one day, record and tag them with their abalone report punch card and tags, and then give them to a disabled person who is not able to dive. Then the following day, the diver may go out to get three more abalone for themselves, and again, report them on the punch card and tag them in accordance with the regulations.\n# # #\nCarrie Wilson is a marine environmental scientist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

26	I'm interested in experimental philosophers' methodology - what is their main criticism of traditional philosophical methods and how do they approach research differently?	Experimental philosophers ('X-Philes') believe there are important limitations to philosophy's traditional 'armchair' methods of reflection and argumentation. To address these limitations, they turn to psychological research on people's judgments, feelings, and behaviors. They either conduct this research themselves or collaborate with social scientists, moving away from pure theoretical reflection.	"['The Ironic Success Of Experimental Philosophy\nLater this week, hundreds of philosophers will converge near San Francisco\'s Union Square for the 87th annual meeting of the Pacific Division of the American Philosophical Association.\nReporters from The San Francisco Chronicle will not be onsite to cover the invited symposia on the epistemology of modality or on the semantics and pragmatics of pejoratives. Local news stations will not record the sessions on Plato or on consciousness. The New York Times will not run a feature on the latest arguments concerning moral realism, reproduction and bioethics, war and global justice or the problem of animal pain.\nLet\'s face it: philosophy rarely makes the news.\nSo it\'s all the more surprising that one small pocket of philosophy, known as ""experimental philosophy,"" has, over the last few years, made it to the pages of Slate.com, The New York Times Magazine, The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times\' Opinionator and Room for Debate, Prospect Magazine, and yes, even NPR\'s Talk of the Nation.\nWhat is experimental philosophy? And why this unprecedented public success?\nPractitioners of experimental philosophy (""X-Philes"") are a heterogeneous bunch, but most believe that there are important limitations to philosophy\'s dominant ""armchair"" methods of reflection and argumentation, prompting the adoption of a burning armchair as a logo (you can hear the accompanying anthem, sung by Alina Simone, on YouTube). To explore and remedy these limitations, they have turned to psychological research on people\'s judgments, feelings and behaviors. Some of them conduct this research themselves; others collaborate with social scientists or draw upon their work.\nTo illustrate, consider one of the most celebrated findings from experimental philosophy: the ""side-effect effect"" or Knobe effect, named after experimental philosophy icon Joshua Knobe, who first documented the phenomenon. In his original paper, Knobe (a philosopher) conducted a psychology experiment in which he presented participants with the following vignette:\nThe vice-president of a company went to the chairman of the board and said, \'We are thinking of starting a new program.

I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let\'s start the new program.\'\nThey started the new program. Sure enough, the environment was harmed.\nThe key question was this: did the chairman harm the environment intentionally? Eighty-two percent of participants responded \'yes.\'\nIn a different version of the vignette, a different group of participants read the same text, but with ""harm"" replaced with ""help."" So the proposed program had the side effect of helping the environment, but the chairman said that he ""didn\'t care at all"" about helping the environment and went ahead with the plan for greater profit. Now participants were asked whether the chairman helped the environment intentionally, and only 23 percent responded ""yes."" (If that went by a little fast, check out this YouTube reenactment of the two cases.)\nBut why would this be? Why would the simple change from ""harm"" to ""help"" in the environmental side effect of seeking profits alter whether or not that side effect was described as having been brought about intentionally? In both cases, the chairman was motivated by profit and claimed that he didn\'t care about the environment.\nKnobe and others have used findings like these to argue against armchair analyses of what it means for actions to be performed ""intentionally,"" and also to argue that moral evaluations (in this case, the perceived goodness or badness of environmental help or harm) have a pervasive impact on how people reason. To quote Knobe, we ""are moralizing creatures through and through,"" a conclusion that he advocates on the basis of experimental results like the Knobe effect, not armchair speculation.\nAt this point I should probably reveal that I\'m no stranger to X-Phi (yes, we\'re intimate enough for nicknames). In fact, Berkeley PhD student Dylan Murray will be presenting co-authored work in a session on Experimental Philosophy at this week\'s conference in San Francisco, and Joshua Knobe and I have co-edited special issues of journals (with Edouard Machery) on psychology and Experimental Philosophy and we\'re currently co-editing a volume on Experimental Philosophy for Oxford University Press (with Shaun Nichols). I\'ve even published my own heretical account of the Knobe effect with former PhD student Kevin Uttich.\n(In other words, some of my best friends are X-Philes, and some may not like what I\'m about to say.)\nOne reason for X-Phi\'s popular success is surely the novelty of contemporary philosophers sullying their hands with data. On top of that, they have a nifty logo, an anthem, a YouTube presence and assorted blogs. But I think there\'s a less recognized and deeply ironic reason for X-Phi\'s popular success.\nMost philosophical arguments — whether they\'re about the epistemology of modality or about bioethics — are hard to condense into an accessible form for public consumption. Like any academic discipline, philosophy has its own jargon. It can be hard to appreciate what philosophers are saying, or why it\'s important, without knowing something about the broader context within which they\'re working.\nThe most celebrated examples from experimental philosophy, in contrast, involve compelling empirical phenomena that people can readily appreciate. For example, most people share the intuition that the chairman of the board intentionally harmed the environment but didn\'t intentionally help the environment, and they find the apparent inconsistency across these cases curious and compelling. These reactions can be elicited by simply presenting people with the relevant vignettes in a short article. Which they can read from their armchairs.\nAnd that\'s the irony: experimental philosophy is all about getting people out of the armchair and into the lab. But I\'d argue that its popular success owes to the fact that armchairs are perfectly adequate to appreciate the force of many key arguments from experimental philosophy, whether you\'re a philosopher or an interested spectator.\nNow, this isn\'t true for all experimental philosophy. I\'d be the last person to argue that empirical research isn\'t crucial and capable of revealing when armchair intuitions are limited or simply mistaken.\nBut, perhaps, it\'s time to rethink the logo and the rhetoric. Instead of burning our armchairs, let\'s bring them with us into the lab. We\'ll have somewhere nice and comfortable to sit while we reflect on our work, with our empirical tools close at hand.\nYou can keep up with more of what Tania Lombrozo is thinking on Twitter: @TaniaLombrozo']"	['<urn:uuid:701246f2-c791-42bb-96fa-63773e67ad44>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	23	49	1080

29	I've seen some cave paintings of cows being milked in Africa and I wonder how scientists can tell if ancient African people actually used dairy products?	Scientists used sophisticated molecular and isotopic techniques to examine proteins and fats in ground pottery fragments. Their analysis revealed traces of milk and processed dairy products, such as yoghurt or cheese, in ceramic pots from the Takarkori site.	"['Milk that has been glorified as a wholesome balanced diet in the modern era.But it has been a safe and reliable food source for a very long time claims a new research.\nScientists have found evidence that humans in prehistoric Saharan Africa lived in a farm-based economy nearly 10,000 years ago. They had access to a nutrient-laden food from their animals.\nNewly discovered fossilized bones as well as rock art portraying cows with full udders and images of milking indicate that cattle, sheep, and goats roamed over green savanna about 7,000 years ago.\nLead author of the study, Julie Dunne, a doctoral student at Bristol\'s School of Chemistry stated, “We already know how important dairy products such as milk, cheese, yoghurt and butter, which can be repeatedly extracted from an animal throughout its lifetime, were to the people of Neolithic Europe.""\n""So it\'s exciting to find proof that they were also significant in the lives of the prehistoric people of Africa.”\nAfter grinding the pieces of pottery, scientists used sophisticated molecular and stable isotopic techniques to examine the proteins and fats rooted in the shards. This helped the investigators see what the pots once contained.\nEvidence of early dairying practices in ancient human cultures\nEngraved and painted rock art found in the Takarkori rock shelter in the Tadrart Acacus Mountains, a dwelling in the Libyan Sahara clearly depicts the importance of domestic animals, particularly cattle to the pre-historic people of Africa.\nHowever, the vivid representations do not clarify whether the animals were also milked.\nIn order to get an insight into whether dairy practices were prevalent in ancient human cultures, the scientists used tiny pottery fragments unearthed at the Takarkori site.\nAfter grinding the pieces of pottery, they used sophisticated molecular and stable isotopic techniques to examine the proteins and fats rooted in the shards.

It’s an approach my colleagues and I have previously applied to successfully determine the chronology of dairying, beginning in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East and spreading across Europe.”\nThe findings appear in the current issue of the journal Nature.']"	['<urn:uuid:384d89f9-2de4-4b50-bf16-22d2ebd6586e>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	26	38	504
30	I run a small restaurant and would like to donate our surplus food - do food banks typically accept small quantities from businesses like mine or do they focus on larger donors?	Food banks generally focus on large quantities of surplus food from farms, manufacturers, or large grocery chains. For smaller quantities from places like restaurants, there are other food recovery groups like Food Shift and Food Runners that work to fill this gap.	['Dana Frasz is the founder and director of Food Shift, which works with communities, businesses, and government to shift behaviors toward a more sustainable use of food. Food Shift’s programs increase awareness and action around food waste reduction; decrease the amount of edible food rotting in the landfill; and create jobs in the food recovery sector.\nFollowing are Dana’s responses to audience questions that did not get answered during the panel discussion “Beyond the Green Bin,” co-hosted by CUESA and the Commonwealth Club on March 24, 2014.\nQ: Do you just target retail and consumer food waste, or are you looking at addressing farm food waste? If so, will your model therefore compete with CropMobster?\nDana: Food Shift is not currently addressing farm food waste. We view CropMobster and other organizations and platforms in the space as allies rather than competitors. We are all in this together and all our efforts are needed to move the needle on this issue.\nQ: Are you working with caterers, hotels, and event planners to recover and donate food?\nDana: Yes, absolutely. Food Shift is currently in the design and planning stages of a service that will provide customized assistance around food recovery to caterers, hotels, and event planners. We are also exploring the potential for technology integration to make it easier for food donors to connect with food recovery organizations easily and efficiently.\nQ: Are you working with the US military to reduce food waste?\nDana: Not yet, but it’s an excellent idea! So much of reducing food waste is about logistics. There is definitely a place at the table for military to share their expertise!\nQ: What roles do food banks play in rescuing stranded food? Why aren’t you working with food banks?\nDana: Food banks play a huge and essential role in capturing and redistributing surplus food and Food Shift would love to work more closely with food banks. It’s important to note that food banks are generally going after large quantities of surplus food from farms, manufacturers, or large grocery chains. That leaves smaller quantities of food from grocers, delis, restaurants, and catered events without a formalized system for food recovery. That is the gap that Food Shift and other food recovery groups like Food Runners are working to fill.\nQ: What kind of food infrastructure is needed to support reducing food waste?\nDana: We need everything from containers to technology to education to policy changes! That’s why Food Shift is focused on education, advocacy, and action. Based on our work in Oakland we’ve learn that many food assistance organizations throughout the region are in need of food but are unaware of its location, lack legitimate credentials, and don’t have the resources, staff, and infrastructure to secure, store, and distribute food effectively. The food recovery space is in great need of investment to support staff, technology solutions, transportation, logistics, and refrigeration. As a nation we spend $750 million each year to dispose of surplus food that could be donated. We need to shift some of those resources toward the recovery and redistribution of food instead.\nCUESA (Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture) is dedicated to cultivating a sustainable food system through the operation of farmers markets and educational programs.

31	Are mesophiles and botulism similar in their temperature preferences?	Yes, botulism bacteria and mesophiles have similar temperature preferences since both grow well at moderate temperatures. Mesophiles have an optimal growth temperature between 20-45°C and include most human pathogens since body temperature is 37°C. This aligns with botulism bacteria's ability to grow and produce toxins in wort kept at room/moderate temperatures during processes like coolship brewing and no-chill brewing. This is why quick chilling and proper fermentation temperatures are important safety considerations.	"['The topic of the risk of developing botulism during homebrewing is a topic that circulates frequently among homebrewing circles. Recently, this topic has reared its head in the form of two sequential Experiential Brewing podcasts [1, 2]. People seem to fall into one of two camps – the “you’re going to die” camp and the “there is nothing to worry about” camp. So who is right and who is wrong?\nKeep reading to find out.\nThis article is a part of my Fact or Fiction series on the risk from infectious organisms during home brewing.\nWhat is Botulism?\nBotulism is a form of food-borne illness caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Illness is caused by a toxin released by the bacteria. This toxin can persist in foods lacking viable bacteria, but is quickly destroyed above temperatures above 85C (185F). Botulism itself is hard to kill – the bacteria forms spores when stressed, with those spores capable of surviving boiling. This is why many canned foods must be pressure canned, as destruction of botulism spores requires temperatures above 100C/212F.\nWhen in a suitable environment, these spores can “hatch” into viable, growing bacteria. The growth of botulism is not always obvious – some strains will cause putrefaction, producing the aroma of rotting meat. But the majority of botulism strains do not purify, meaning that there is no obvious sign of their presence. Botulism grows under a limited range of conditions: it needs a source of protein for growth, a pH above 5.0, a salt concentration below 5-10%, a sugar concentration below 30%, and an oxygen concentration below 1%. Botulism is relatively tolerant to alcohol, and is not fully suppressed until alcohol content reaches 6% ABV. The toxin is only produced by growing bacteria, and generally is not produced until 3 or more days after the bacteria begins to grow.\nThe botulism toxin itself is utterly terrifying. It is the most toxic substance known to human kind – literally millions of times more toxic than cyanide. The way that it functions is particularly insidious. Botulotoxin is a protease; a protein that cuts other proteins into smaller pieces. The toxin binds to neurons, which then take up the toxin. In the neuron the toxin renders the cell unable to release the neurotransmitters required to make muscles move. The end effect is flaccid paralysis – the inability of a patient to contract their muscles. Untreated, 50% of patients die due to paralysis of their respiratory muscles; they literally asphyxiate. Even with modern medical treatment, 5-10% of affected patients die, and those whose survive often experience long-term (even permanent) disability.\nHopefully the above has disabused you of any belief that botulism is harmless. From a risk-management perspective, botulism is a severe hazard – one of the most severe hazards humans know. But there is more to assessing risk than merely identifying the degree of hazard present. After all, a shark is a hazard, but is not a risk if you’re sitting in a corn field in rural Iowa.\nRisk is the combination of hazard and exposure. Exposure to botulism spores is common as they are found in many foods (honey as one example), the soil, and even the air. However, we rarely encounter the vegetative (growing) bacteria, or conditions where spores can begin to grow. As such, cases of botulism are very rare – in the US there are ~15 cases of food-associated botulism per year; the remaining ~110 cases/year are in infants (who are very susceptible to the bacteria) or IV drug users who develop wound infections.\nWill Botulism Grow in Wort or Must?\nOf course, none of the above matters if the bacteria cannot grow in wort or must. The good news for mead makers is that botulism is unlikely to be able to grow in must, as there is not enough protein present. So even though the spores are common on honey, even a prolonged delay in the onset of fermentation should not present a risk. Ciders and wines are even more protected, as they have both a low protein content and a starting pH below 4.0. That said, the making of so-called prison wine has led to cases of botulism, largely due to the use of approaches that lead to higher pH’s and poor sanitation.\nBeer wort is a very different beast. Beer wort has a high protein content and a pH permissive to the growth of botulism (>5.0). It is unclear whether hops inhibit growth of botulism, although inhibition has been observed with highly purified extracts.\nThe good news for conventional beer brewers is that normal brewing practices will prevent botulism from growing. The oxygen levels achieved by normal oxygenation processes are inhibitory to growth, while the acidificaiton during fermentation will suppress botulism long before it produces toxin. In other words, if you quickly chill your beer, oxygenate well, and immediately pitch a good dose of yeast, your risk is essentially zero.\nThere are, however, two brewing practices which may increase your risk of exposure:\n- Coolship brewing. Beer chilled via a coolship has the potential for exposure to spores in the air. It may also create ideal fermentation conditions through low oxygen pickup, delayed fermentation, and prolonged time at optimal growth temperatures.\n- No-chill brewing. This creates an ultra-low oxygen environment. Risk may be further increased due to delayed fermentation and prolonged time at optimal growth temperatures.\nNormal brewing practices eliminate risk, but the question of whether we should stop coolship or no-chill brewing remains unanswered. The good news is that there is not one recorded case of botulism arising from either of these brewing practices, indicating that these processes can be regarded as safe. However, it is trivial to eliminate the risk, and given the extreme hazard represented by botulism, it is reasonable to take these precautions.\nCoolship Brewing: Eliminating the risk during coolship brewing is trivial, and I would argue, is a natural result of best brewing practices. Pre-acidifying wort you intend to coolship by adding lactic or phosporic acid during the boil is sufficient to eliminate the risk. pH’s below 5.0 inhibit botulism, with pH’s below 4.5 reducing the risk of other pathogens. Pre-acidificaiton also has the advantage of suppressing bacteria that can produce unpleasant and toxic biogenic amines. Many home and commercial brewers have adopted the practice of pre-acidifying coolshipped worts for these reasons. This is a practice I both endorse and use myself.\nNo-Chill Brewing: The risk of botulism during no-chill brewing is largely overstated. Keep in mind that under ideal conditions it takes ~3 days for botulism to produce toxin. So if you are “no-chilling” overnight, or even for a day and a half, you are well within the safe period. So long as you oxygenate well and pitch a healthy dose of yeast the risk should be eliminated. However, some no-chill brewers store wort for prolonged periods of time. This represents an increased risk over conventional no-chill approaches. You can eliminate this risk by pre-acidifying the wort to a pH below 5.0, or by ceasing the practice of storing no-chill wort for more than a day.\nOne Final Note\nI’ve thrown a lot of numbers and facts at you in this article. As much as possible I’ve linked to my sources so that you can check them out yourself. However, the bulk of the numbers regarding factors such as the time to toxin production came from a single printed source.

32	Which takes longer to prepare: slab pie or mini Victoria sandwiches?	A slab pie takes longer to prepare, requiring 40-55 minutes of baking time plus 45 minutes of cooling time. Mini Victoria sandwiches take about 15 minutes to bake, with just a brief cooling period of letting them cool completely on a wire rack.	"[""If you like it, save it!\nSave and organize all of the stuff you love in one place.Got it!\nIf you like something…\nClick the heart, it's called favoriting. Favorite the stuff you like.Got it!\nAuthor Notes: A slab pie is simply a shallow pie that's made in a rimmed baking sheet, usually a jelly roll pan. It feeds more revelers than a standard 9-inch pie will, with less mess and fuss. Martha Stewart has made all kinds of versions -- below is a distilled template that can work with any berry or stone fruit that's in season near you. Adapted slightly from Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook (Clarkson Potter, 2005) - Genius Recipes\nMakes one 15-by-10-inch pie\n- All purpose flour, for dusting\n- Pate Brisee (recipe below)\n- 6 cups fresh sour cherries, stemmed and pitted; or 6 cups fresh mixed berries; or 7 medium peaches, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 8 cups)\n- 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar\n- 1/4 cup cornstarch\n- Juice of 1/2 a lemon (about 1 tablespoon)\n- 1/4 teaspoon salt\n- 1/4 cup sanding sugar (or granulated sugar)\n- Heat oven to 375 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface or between two large, floured pieces of plastic wrap, roll out larger piece of dough to an 18-by-13-inch rectangle, trimming excess dough. Fit into a 15-by-10-inch rimmed baking sheet, pressing into corners (pastry will hang over sides). Chill while assembling filling.\n- In a large bowl, stir together fruit, granulated sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and salt. Spread mixture over chilled pie shell. Chill again while you roll out the top crust.\n- On a lightly floured surface or between two large, floured pieces of plastic wrap, roll out remaining piece of dough to a 16-by-11-inch rectangle; drape over filling. Fold edge of bottom dough over top dough. Crimp if desired. Prick top dough all over with a fork. Brush entire surface of pie with cream (thinned with a little water if necessary), and sprinkle with sanding sugar.\n- Bake until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling, 40 to 55 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, and let pie cool until it is just warm to the touch, about 45 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature, cut into 12 pieces. Slab pie is best eaten the same day it is baked, but it can be kept at room temperature, loosely covered with plastic wrap, for up to 2 days.\nSlab Pie Pate Brisee\n- 5 cups all purpose flour\n- 1 tablespoon coarse salt\n- 2 teaspoons sugar\n- 1 pound (4 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes\n- 12 to 16 tablespoons ice water\n- Process flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor until combined. Add butter. Process until mixture resembles coarse meal, about 10 seconds. With machine running, add ice water in a slow, steady stream just until dough comes together. (Do not process more than 30 seconds.)\n- Turn dough out in two portions onto two pieces of plastic wrap, with one slightly larger than the other (this will be your bottom crust). Flatten dough, and shape into rectangles. Wrap in plastic. Refrigerate at least 1 hour (or overnight).\n- This recipe is a Community Pick!"", 'Mini Victoria Sandwiches, Lemon Tartlets and Scones\nClearly, scones and the Victoria sandwich are quintessentially British (although the word scone may be derived from the Middle Dutch word schoonbrood — among other theories — meaning “fine white bread,” but even that probably arrived in the British lexicon by way of Scotland). The lemon tart, on the other hand, could be considered more of a mongrel in terms of its origins.\nLemons traveled the Silk Route from India — where they’ve been cultivated for more than 2,500 years — through the Middle East, North Africa and the Mediterranean, arriving in Europe around 200 AD. Some thousand years later, it was Queen Eleanor, wife of England’s Edward I, whose longing for the fruits of her youth in Castile (now part of Spain) brought 15 lemons, 7 oranges and 230 pomegranates to England in 1289.\nApparently, lemon curd was developed in England in the 18th century by Quakers and brought to America in 1774 by the Shakers, a breakaway sect of the Quakers. An American cook, Elizabeth Goodwell, is credited with the first known written recipe, in 1806, for lemon custard pie with a pastry crust. From there, it seems to have traveled full circle to France, where lemon tarts (aka tartes au citron) began proliferating in restaurants and patisseries in the 19th century. Still, the lemon tart has roots in Britain, so I’m calling this challenge the Trifecta of Classic British Bakes.\nThis “back to basics” challenge may seem simple enough, but it takes a lot of knowledge and time management skills to juggle three bakes at once — let alone with a pared-down recipe containing very little instruction. The bakers in the Great White Tent had to know how to: (1) make jam, (2) make a Victoria sponge, (3) make short crust pastry, (4) make lemon custard, (5) make perfect scones, and (6) accomplish all of it in two hours.\nHaving spent nine weeks under the steely glare of Paul Hollywood and the motherly but perfectionist gaze of Mary Berry, however, these bakers had proved themselves worthy of the challenge. Yes, they hit some bumps in the road — Richard had never made lemon tarts before and ended up scrambling the custard, and Luis had some problems with his pastry crust — but they all accomplished the task at hand, albeit some with better results than others. (In the end, Nancy’s were deemed the best. The only criticism Mary could come up with was that she hadn’t piped the whipped cream onto her Victoria sandwiches.)\nI took notes on how the bakers multitasked so I could follow their lead. Here’s the order in which they accomplished this trio of bakes:\n- Make pastry dough and chill.\n- Make strawberry jam for Victoria sandwiches.\n- Make Victoria sponges.\n- Roll out pastry dough for tartlets and blind bake them.\n- Make scones.\n- Make lemon custard.\n- Fill and bake tartlets.\n- Whip the cream for Victoria sandwiches.\n- Assemble Victoria sandwiches.\n- Decorate tarts with chocolate piping.\nAs always, it took me longer than the time they were allotted, but I was pretty proud of my results. Not having the individual tart and cake pans they used, I improvised by using muffin tins. That means my lemon tartlets were smaller than theirs. My custard had a few cracks and bubbles on top, but they weren’t completely scrambled. My scones got a good rise, but Mary probably would have said they were too pale. (Also, the last few that I had to cut from mushed together scraps of dough kind of fell apart when they baked.) The only problem with my Victoria sandwiches is that I didn’t whip my cream enough, so it was rather droopy.\nI love making things in miniature because they’re fun and easy to share. The Victoria sandwiches and lemon tartlets were a hit with my neighbors as well as my fellow Great British Bake Off fans, Lori and Dan. I confess that I kept all the scones for myself and my husband to enjoy for breakfast, but their petite size would be perfect for an afternoon tea with friends.\nLinks to each of these recipes can be found here, here and here, but I’ve adapted them for American bakers below.\nRECIPE NOTES: I have specified extra-large eggs for these recipes because they are the U.S. equivalent of large eggs in the UK. In recipes that call for fewer than four eggs, the size of eggs used often won’t make much difference in the results, but there are exceptions. For instance, a Victoria sponge is traditionally made with equal weights of flour, sugar, eggs and butter. Therefore, the size of the eggs used can throw off the ratio.\nTROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE: In looking over my photos, I realize now just how many bubbles my lemon tarts had (although a dusting of powdered sugar goes a long way in hiding them!). I did a little research, and found this helpful article, which recommends stirring the eggs and sugar together rather than whisking, then letting it sit for half an hour to let the sugar dissolve, stirring occasionally, before adding the cream, lemon juice and zest. It also suggests skimming off any air bubbles before pouring the mixture into the tart shells. I will definitely try that next time!\nMary Berry’s Mini Victoria Sandwiches\n(Adapted for American bakers)\nFor the jam:\n- 1 lb. strawberries, hulled and halved\n- 2 c. + 2 T. sugar\n- 1½ t. pectin (like Sure-Jell)\nFor the sponge:\n- ¾ c. unsalted butter, room temperature\n- ¾ c. + 2 T. superfine (baker’s) sugar\n- 3 extra-large eggs, beaten\n- 1 t. vanilla extract\n- 1 1/3 c. all-purpose flour\n- 2 t. baking powder\n- 1 c. heavy cream\n- Powdered sugar, for dusting\n- To make the jam, place strawberries in a large saucepan and crush with a potato masher. Stir the pectin into the sugar and add to the saucepan. Heat gently, stirring continuously, until the sugar dissolves.\n- Keep stirring, increasing the heat, until it comes to a full rolling boil — one that bubbles vigorously, rises in the pan and cannot be stirred down. Boil for four minutes. (For a firmer set, bring to 220°F.) Remove from heat and set aside to cool.\n- Next, make the cakes: Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease 12 individual cake tins. (I used a standard-size muffin pan, placing a circle of parchment paper in the bottom of each cavity.)\n- Cream butter and sugar together until the mixture is pale and light. Add the beaten eggs in three or four increments, mixing well between each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl from time to time. Add vanilla extract and mix to combine.\n- Sift flour and baking powder into the bowl and fold in until the mixture is glossy and smooth. Divide the mixture between the cake pans and level with a spoon.\n- Bake on the middle shelf of the oven for about 15 minutes or until golden-brown and springy to the touch. Leave cakes to cool in the pan for two minutes and then ease onto a wire cooling rack and let cool completely.\n- Right before serving, cut each cake in half horizontally with a serrated knife. Whip the cream to stiff peaks and spoon into a piping bag fitted with a small plain nozzle. Pipe one dollop of cream in the middle of each cake base and smaller dots around the edges. Drizzle about a teaspoon of jam over the cream, then place the cake tops on and lightly sift powdered sugar over the cakes.\nMary Berry’s Individual Lemon Tartlets\n(Adapted for American bakers)\nSee troubleshooting guide (above recipes) for helpful hints to avoid ending up with bubbles on top of your tarts.\nFor the pastry:\n- 1 1/3 c. + 1 T. all-purpose flour\n- 7 T. cold butter, cut into small cubes\n- 2 T. powdered sugar\n- 1 egg yolk\n- 1 T. cold water\nFor the filling:\n- 4 extra-large eggs\n- 3½ fl. oz. (7 T.) heavy cream\n- ¾ c. superfine (baker’s) sugar\n- Zest and juice of 3 lemons\nFor the decoration:\n- 3½ oz. chocolate (36% cocoa solids), chopped\n- powdered sugar, for dusting\n- To make the the pastry, place flour, butter and powdered sugar into a food processor. Pulse briefly until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs, then add the egg yolk and cold water. Pulse again until the mixture sticks together in clumps, then tip it onto a work surface and gather it into a ball with your hands. (If you don’t have a food processor, use a hand pastry blender or fork to cut in the butter until it resembles breadcrumbs, then mix gently with a fork.)\n- Knead the pastry briefly to bring it into a smooth ball. Flatten it into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 15-30 minutes.\n- Grease 12, 3-inch fluted tart tins. (Alternatively, grease a 12-cup muffin tin.) Roll out the pastry to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Cut out circles with a 4-inch round cutter and use to line the tins, re-rolling the pastry to cut more, as needed. (If using a standard-size muffin tin, use a 3½-inch fluted cutter. I also cut 24 strips of parchment, about ½ inch by 6 inches, and placed two of them crosswise in each cavity of the muffin tin. This helped me center the pastry circles in each cavity and remove the tarts after they were baked.) Place pastry shells in the fridge to chill.\n- Preheat oven to 400°F. Place a piece of foil or parchment inside each pastry shell and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 7 minutes, then remove the parchment and weights. Return the pastry shells to the oven for another 4-5 minutes or until they are light golden-brown and completely dry. Set aside to cool while you make the filling. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F.\n- To make the filling, break the eggs into a large bowl and whisk together with a wire whisk. Add the rest of the filling ingredients and whisk again until well-combined. Pour filling mixture into a measuring pitcher. To prevent spilling, place the tart pans on a baking sheet and partially fill the cooled baked pastry shells with the filling, carefully transfer the baking sheet and tarts to the oven shelf, then top up with the rest of the filling to completely fill the shells. (Be careful not to overfill so it doesn’t spill over the edge!)\n- Bake for about 7 minutes, or until just set but with a slight wobble in the center. Leave in pan to cool slightly, then carefully ease the tartlets from their tins and place on a wire rack to cool completely.\n- For decoration, melt the chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. (Do not allow the bottom of the bowl to touch the surface of the water.) (Alternatively, melt chocolate in microwave, following package directions.) Spoon melted chocolate into a small piping bag fitted with a writing tip. Pipe the word ‘citron’ or a decoration of your choice on top of the tarts.\nMary Berry’s Teatime Scones\n(Adapted for American bakers)\n- 2 c. all-purpose flour\n- 1 T. + 1 rounded teaspoon baking powder\n- 3 T. softened butter\n- 2 T. superfine (baker’s) sugar\n- 1 extra-large egg\n- 3-4 T. milk\n- Preheat oven to 425°F. Put flour and baking powder into a large bowl. Add the butter and rub it in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar.\n- Beat the egg in a measuring pitcher. Add enough milk to make 3½ fl. oz. (7 tablespoons) of liquid. (This should be 3 to 4 tablespoons of milk, depending on the size of the egg.) Stir until well-blended, then set aside 1 tablespoon of the mixture for glazing the scones later.\n- Gradually add the remaining egg and milk mixture to the butter and flour mixture, stirring until you have a soft, slightly sticky dough.\n- Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured surface and pat out until it is about ¾ inch thick. Use a 1½-inch fluted cutter to cut out the scones. (Make sure you don’t twist the cutter or the scones will not rise evenly.) Gently gather the trimmings together and pat out again to cut out more scones. Arrange the scones on a greased baking sheet and brush the tops with the reserved egg-milk mixture.\n- Bake for 8-10 minutes or until well risen and golden-brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. To serve, cut each scone in half and top with strawberry jam and clotted or whipped cream.\n3 thoughts on “The Trifecta of Classic British Bakes”\nMarilyn, Another baking job well done.

34	Why do people burn young longleaf pine forests?	There are two main reasons for burning young longleaf plantations: to control competing vegetation that can keep the pines in the grass stage for years, and to control brown spot needle blight, a fungal disease that can kill seedlings. Burning removes infected needles and kills the spores of the disease.	['Controlling competing vegetation and brown spot disease are two main reasons we prescribe burn young longleaf plantations:\n- Longleaf pine seedlings do not like competing vegetation and will stay in the grass stage for years if vegetation is not controlled by fire, mowing or herbicides. Using improved containerized seedlings along with good vegetation management can release longleaf pines from the grass stage in 2-3 years.\n- Longleaf pines are the only species of southern pines susceptible to brown spot needle blight. Seedlings are infected in the grass stage and can die from the disease. Prescribe burning is an effective method for controlling this fungus disease. Burning removes the infected needles and kills the spores. Brown spot can be identified by yellow bands on the needles, which eventually turn brown as shown below.\nDecember thru March is the typical burn window for this activity. Older longleaf pine stands can be burned into late spring with the right weather conditions and understory. If turkey management is important to you, wait until nesting season is over to burn mature longleaf stands. We get better control of understory brush and hardwoods burning in the spring.\nThe link shown here shows an example of a control burn in 5 year old longleaf pine that is in the sampling stage. Good forest management practices have got these pines off to a good start. The key is not to damage the bud in the tip of pines or the newly formed candles in the spring.\n*Make sure and get a burn permit from the local state forestry service before you light your fire.\n“Timing of Prescribed Fire in Longleaf Pine” http://www.southernfireexchange.org/SFE_Publications/etc/Clemsonforfl32.pdf\n“Prescribed Burning in Newly Planted Longleaf Pine.” (Alabama Guide Sheet No. AL 338 A)\nAwareness is Growing!\nPhoto by: Aprile Clark\nThat is, when it comes to lights on our homes and businesses near their nesting beaches. Humans have long-known that artificial light can have negative consequences for many nocturnal animals, including nesting and hatching sea turtles. However, it has only been through fairly recent research that we are beginning to understand the reasons behind some of these effects and developing better lighting (or non-lighting) strategies and alternatives to protect our treasured marine turtle species.\nMother sea turtles that nest on Florida Panhandle beaches are “hard-wired” for nighttime activity when it comes to digging their nest cavities and depositing eggs. Likewise, their babies typically leave their sandy nests under cover of darkness, scampering to the Gulf of Mexico. This nocturnal behavior is important for avoiding predators that would have an easy meal of a baby turtle crossing the open beach in the light of day. However, even hatchlings emerging at night face a number of other obstacles. Once in the water there are a many aquatic predators that will not hesitate to gobble up a baby turtle. On average, it is estimated that only about 1 in 1000 babies survive to reach adulthood. With those odds, it would be wise for us to do anything we can to minimize additional threats or hazards during the short but crucial time these marine reptiles spend on the narrow thread of beachfront that we share with them.\nOne thing we can do involves reducing the disorienting effects of artificial light near our sea turtle nesting beaches. The term “phototactic” is used to describe organisms that are stimulated to move towards or away from light. Nesting females have been shown to avoid bright areas on the beach but hatchlings tend to be attracted to the brightest source of light when they emerge from the sand. On a nesting beach with no artificial lighting, any natural light from the moon or stars is reflected off the water, creating a much brighter horizon in that direction. This naturally attracts the hatchlings in the right direction. Lights from human sources can appear very bright in comparison and quite often draw babies over the dunes and into harm’s way on roadways, from predators, or simply by exposure once the sun comes up.\nMany beachfront property owners have learned about this threat and have taken this issue to heart by reducing the amount of light on their property and eliminating or replacing lights visible from the nesting beach with sea turtle-friendly lighting. There are three rules to follow when retrofitting or installing new lighting near the beach.\n- Keep it Long: Long-wave-length lighting that is still in the portion of the spectrum visible to humans includes amber, orange and red light. Manufacturers are now making highly efficient LED bulbs that are certified by the FWC as turtle-friendly.\n- Keep it Low: Many times lighting needed for safety of access can be placed low enough to be unseen from the nesting beach.\n- Keep it Shielded: Fixtures that are in line-of-site to the nesting beach need to be recessed to shield the bulb from being directly visible. The correct long-wave-length bulb should also be used in these shielded fixtures.\nRemember, exterior lighting is not the only danger turtles face from our lights. Unobstructed interior lights seen through windows and doors can be just as detrimental. The best solution here is to tint beach-facing glass with a 15% transmittance tinting product. This will save money on cooling bills as well as protect interior furnishings and avoid the possibility that someone in your house might leave the blinds or curtains open accidentally during turtle season. If you have questions regarding turtle-safe lighting practices in Florida there are many resources available through the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Sea Turtle Conservancy, and your local UF/IFAS County Extension offices. If you really want to get into the nitty-gritty of turtle lighting and ways to protect turtles check out this FWC publication on assessing and resolving light pollution problems and this model lighting ordinance from UF’s Levin College of Law. Most Florida coastal counties have already adopted sea turtle lighting ordinances so you should also check your local county codes for this issue. Let’s help keep sea turtles in the dark, where they need to be.\nManaging a pond can be both rewarding and challenging.\nPhoto Credit: Mark Mauldin\nPonds can be a source of great enjoyment. However, properly managing them to meet your desired goals can be challenging. Panhandle Pond Management, a two part series being offered by UF/IFAS Extension, is designed to help pond owners/managers become more successful in reaching their goals. Specialists from campus will be onsite to share their expertise. Dr. Chuck Cichra, UF Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, will lead session 1 and Dr. Stephen Enloe, UF Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants, will lead session 2.\nSession 1 – May 31st Fish Management will focus on decisions that the pond owner can make that directly relate to the success and productivity of the fish population in a pond. Stocking, harvesting, feeding, aeration and other topics will be covered.\nSession 2 – June 7th Aquatic Weed Management will involve weed identification, control options, and herbicide application techniques. If you have problem weeds bring samples for identification and control recommendations.\nPanhandle Pond Management will be held at the Washington County Agricultural Center, 1424 Jackson Ave, Chipley FL. Each session will begin at 6:00pm; a meal will be served. To ensure we have enough food advanced registration is strongly encouraged. There is a $10 registration fee per session. To register call the Washington County Extension Office (850-638-6180) or use the links below for online registration. Session 2 attendees will receive a copy of Weed Control in Ponds a bound book sold through the IFAS bookstore.\nSession 1 – https://goo.gl/Rwn9dk\nSession 2 – https://goo.gl/zj58o6\nALL PHOTOS: MOLLY O’CONNOR\nContinuing our “ecotour” of the Florida Panhandle along the ICW, this month’s stop is in Walton County. Arguably one of the fastest growing counties in the state, South Walton has become a favorite with many. Relatively undeveloped (as compared to neighboring counties) Walton has an opportunity to develop smarter… and for a lot of it – they have.\nEntering Walton County from the west you leave the concentrated tourism of Destin and enter Sandestin. Though still highly developed it slowly gives way to the Point Washington area and more open ground. Here you begin to encounter the famous Dune Lakes. There are no barrier islands along the coastline of Walton County. Instead the Gulf meets the peninsula separating it from Choctawhatchee Bay to the north. Along the Gulf there are magnificent dune fields and freshwater lakes that periodically are open to the Gulf. The lakes are unique in that they have freshwater habitats and tannic waters as well as saltmarsh and seawater when their “mouths” are open. This unique situation provides an ecosystem found in few places in our state. The now famous 30-A travels along these dune lakes across the entire of South Walton. Two state parks, a state forest, a bike trail, and small communities dot this famous trail.\nBetween 30-A and the Intracoastal Waterway to the north lies the Point Washington State Forest. Here lie acres of well managed pine forest. There are many trails that can be hiked, driven, or traversed by horseback. There are several trails here that are part of state forest’s Trailwalker Program. A major part of this well managed forest is prescribed burning.\nThis dune lake at Topsail State Park is one of many “stretched” across South Walton County.\nThe state park provides kayaks for exploring the dune lake at Topsail. It can be reached by hiking or a tram they provide.\nThe beautiful beaches of south Walton.\nHere is one of the many state forest trails used by hikers and joggers.\nThe Florida State Forest hiking trail system provides a lot of information about their trails that is very useful.\nThe Florida State Trailwalkers Program is a neat way to encourage locals to visit their “natural landscape”. You must hike 10 of the selected trails (on their website provided in this article). There is a log you can download and when you have logged your 10 hikes mail it in. You will receive a free patch indicating you are a “Florida Trailwalker”! This is a great way to explore your “natural Florida”.\nThere are trails that cross Point Washington State Forest that can be driven, hiked, or even explored on horseback.\nSignage educating the public about the benefits of prescribed burning.\nThis is the renovated Wesley House at Eden Gardens State Park. The Wesley’s were in the timber industry.\nEden Garden State Park is located north of Highway 98 in south Walton County. It borders the south side of the ICW near Choctawhatchee Bay and is a beautiful getaway.\nPartly due to successful bear management and partly due to the increase population of humans in the Florida panhandle, bear encounters are in the increase. This sign at Eden Garden State Park provides information on how to deal with an encounter.\nFrom Eden Garden State Park you can look across the bayou to the point where the ICW leaves Choctawhatchee Bay and enters a manmade canal locals refer to as “the ditch”. Notice the prescribed burn occurring across the bay.\nNow days many are aware of the forest management tool we call “prescribed burning”… but not all. For many people, fires are “wild” and the smoke they generate is an unwanted pain. Much of the southeast, particularly Florida, encounter thunderstorms with frequent lighting. These lighting strikes spark fires which burn across acres of forest. The frequency of the lighting storms – and fires – actually kept the understory below the pines cleared and so the fires typically burned low and slow. The result was an understory of grasses and wildflowers that supported a wide variety of species including deer and quail. When he traveled through the southeast in 1775, William Bartram described the longleaf forest as “open and monotonous – going on for miles”. And this was the case… you could literally see up to a mile across the landscape. But this “monotonous” landscape was misleading in that there were thousands of species found here – many feel one of the most biological diverse systems anywhere.\nToday 90% of the longleaf has been logged and much of what remains is fire suppressed. For the reasons mentioned above, residents have resisted the natural burns and many species – gopher tortoises, quail, and indigo snakes to name three – have suffered as well. There is a move across the southeast to restore the old longleaf pine forest. These trees produce excellent timber – though it takes longer to grow than the loblolly and slash pine currently grown – and many are managing their property for quail and deer hunting. Yes… the smoke is a problem but the state forestry system plans their burns to reduce the impact it has on the local community as best they can. If you really want to see the benefits of a well-managed pine forest, take a hike through one – it truly is amazing.\nThe Annual Tupelo Honey Festival will be held on Saturday, May 21st from 9 AM – 4 PM at Lake Alice Park in Wewahitchka. It’s an exciting event, and your chance to take part in this local delicacy. Area honey producers will be on hand, selling their honey in a variety of sizes. There will also be food, art & crafts, and live music.\nFor decades, tupelo honey has been synonymous with Gulf county. The pollen from the tupelo gum tree (Nyssa ogeche), produces some of the finest honey in the world. The common name “tupelo” is derived from language of the Muscogee Nation, also known as the Creek Indian Nation. The meaning of the word is “swamp tree”, as this tree flourishes in areas of wet soils and seasonal flooding. Gulf county, especially in the Dead Lakes and Apalachicola river region, provides prime habitat for one of the largest tupelo forests on earth.\nThe tupelo pollination process kicks off during April. The tupelo bloom begins to form as a small bud. Within a few weeks, the bud explodes into a cluster of many nail or spike like attachments. At this point, honeybees begin to descend and capture the pollen.\nFigure 1. Honeybee visiting tupelo blossoms.\nCredit. Gulf County Tourist Development Council.\nThe tupelo bloom season lasts from approximately mid-April to the end of May. This is an anxious time for beekeepers. Tupelo blooms are very temperamental and delicate in nature. For this short period, beekeepers hope for little wind or rain and no cold temperatures, as any of these factors can decimate tupelo honey production. Regardless of seasonal impacts, the demand for Gulf County’s tupelo honey never subsides.\nA bonus to honey’s great taste, is the medicinal value. Honey has been used for medicinal purposes throughout time and cultures. Ancient Egyptians used honey in the embalming process, wound dressing and treatment for burns. Honey can be used as an antimicrobial agent. This is mostly due to low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide produced naturally from sugar compounds. Honey contains large amounts of sugars, approximately 97%. Most of the sugar content is glucose and fructose. Honey also contains smaller amounts of vitamins and minerals.\nThe color of honey is a factor when grading content. Generally, a darker honey will have a higher concentration of polyphenols. This means the honey is higher in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. Exposure to area honey has been thought to help people who suffer from area specific seasonal allergies. However, there is no consensus among the scientific community to support the claim. Though there is research supporting honey as medicinal purposes, please consult with your physician before using as a medical treatment.\nEnjoy tupelo honey and see you at the festival!\nFor more information on Gulf County Tupelo Honey, please visit:\nSupporting information for this article can be found in the UF/IFAS EDIS publication “Health Benefits and Medicinal Value of Honey” by Sara Marshall, Liwei Gu and Keith R.

35	what are main components types techniques signal intelligence used secure communication protection methods analyzed	Signal intelligence (SIGINT) encompasses several key components and techniques for secure communications. The main types include COMINT (intercepting foreign communication), ELINT (gathering electronic signals), RADINT (radar intelligence), non-imaging infrared intelligence, and LASINT (laser intelligence). Protection methods include cryptosecurity (using trusted cryptosystems), emission security (preventing unauthorized data interception), transmission security (protecting from interception through methods like frequency hopping), and physical security (protecting classified equipment and materials). These techniques are used alongside basic communication security principles like making message content unreadable, hiding message meaning, avoiding traffic analysis, and preventing knowledge of communication channels.	"['What is a Secure Communication?\nThe goals of secure communications are the following. Some of these are surprisingly difficult to achieve:\n- Make the content of a message unreadable to parties other than the intended one(s)\n- Make the meaning of a message inaccessible to parties other than the intended one(s)\n- Avoid traffic analysis — don’t let other parties know that a connection exists between the communicating parties\n- Avoid knowledge of the communication — don’t let other parties know the communication channel or pathway exists\nThe first and second objectives can be accomplished using some combination of cryptography and coding. Unfortunately, this is the easy part. The more complicated and difficult component of a secure communications infrastructure is achieving the third and fourth objectives. For now, however, I will focus only on the first two issues: protecting content, and meaning.\nFirst lets define our terms so we can discuss the subject with clarity:\n- Cryptography systems that use transformation processes to turn signal into noise, by obscuring the symbols used for communication\n- Coding systems that substitute or alter meaning, and thus hide the real message\nThe Eagle Has Landed\nCodes are extremely useful mechanisms for sending small messages, although as they are plain text their hidden mean can be revealed once the key is cracked. Another issue with codes is that they are inflexible, compared to a cipher system. Coding requires pre-arranged mappings of meanings (what symbols or words translate to what), or at least pre-arranged mechanisms to derive the mappings (e.g., book codes).\nTo be effective, a code must maintain proper grammar, be consistent, and fit a plausible pretext. If it fits these requirements, and is used appropriately (briefly, consistently, with cover for action) then a code system is an excellent choice for simple signalling purposes.\nDoing It Right\nDuring World War II the BBC cooperated with the intelligence services to send open code signals to operatives in the occupied territories. These signals were prearranged with the operatives, and then sent out at two scheduled times. This signalling channel was used exclusively for indicating whether an operation was going to take place.\nThe BBC would broadcast the signal for the first time at 1930, and then confirm the signal at 2115. If the operation had been canceled before the second scheduled signal window, the code phrase would not be repeated.\nDuring the early phase of the war, the code system was slightly more complex. There would be a positive code, and a negative code, for example: “Jeanne sends her greetings” might be a “go code”, and “Jeanne says hello” might be the “abort code”. Later this was simplified to just the positive code (a tradition that, apparently, the CIA still follows).\nDoing It Wrong\nThere are problems when codes are used inconsistently. For example, some mafia codes used oblique references to the boss as “aunt”, or “Aunt Julia”. This was very ineffective when the mafioso suffered pronoun slippage and called their “aunt” “he”.\n- “Ah, Aunt Julia said he wanted to help me out, too.”\nCodes Gone Wild\nI’ve collected some examples of real al Qaida codes that were used actively used prior to the 9/11 attacks. Other types of basic open code are “business code”, which is also used by some criminal groups, where the actors are refered to as business interests or rivals, and criminal activities are described as “projects” or other innocuous business terms.\nA simple code that was used by two KGB operatives was the phrase “I think we should go fishing now”, which indicated that they should discuss business.\nKGB Says What?\nDuring the early stages of the KGB handling of their FBI penetration Hanssen, they had a mishap with locating and loading the deaddrop for his payment. To correct this error, they had to contact Hanssen by phone and use a code that was not pre-arranged (there was no contingency in place for “what happens if we cant find the dead drop”). The dead drop location was underneath a footbridge and the KGB operative had placed his load underneath the wrong corner.\nSince they had used a pretext of purchasing a used car for their initial contact, the KGB continued to use that pretext for their “oops!” communique. The KGB operative prepared his telephone conversation thoroughly before hand so that it would sound natural and plausible:\nKGB: The car is still available for you as we have agreed last time, I prepared all the papers and left them on the same table. You didn’t find them because I put them in another corner of the table.\nHanssen: I see\nKGB: You shouldn’t worry, everything is okay. The papers are with me now.\nKGB: I believe under these circumstances, its not necessary to make any changes concerning the place and time. Our company is reliable, and we are ready to give you a substantial discount which will be enclosed in the papers. Now, about the date of our meeting. I suggest that our meeting will take place without delay on Febuary 13, one, three, 1:00 PM. Okay? Feburary 13\nHanssen: …. Okay.\nThe conversations is clearly stilted and strange, but no so strange as to draw attention to itself. It also doesn’t reveal anything of the meaning that is being relayed.\nWhen creating a signaling code, it is important that the pretext for the signal be broad and widely applicable. Generally it is better that the code be a specific subject, rather than a specific phrase. Phrases are easy to mixup, forget, or otherwise confuse. They are also more rigid and hard to work into a conversation. A subject, on the other hand, is very easy to raise and discuss in a plausible fashion without seeming forced or unnatural.\nA final short code example. This is a signaling code, adapted from a novel, however it accurately conveys how simple these codes can be. This is phone call between two colleagues, where Alice has to signal an emergency has occured:\nAlice: Hi, sorry to call so late\nBob: No problem\nAlice: Is our meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 8:30, or at 9?\nBob: It is 8:30, bright and early.\nAlice: Ok, right. Just checking. Thanks, bye\nOpen Codes Fail Open\nWhen using a code to refer to a classified subject, even though unclassified terms are used, the subject is still classified. This is a breach of security. See the US Army handbook on COMSEC section dealing with ATTEMPTS TO DISGUISE INFORMATION (Section 8.4).\n“Talking around” is a technique in which you try to get the information across to the recipient in a manner you believe will protect it. However, no matter how much you try to change words about a classified or sensitive subject, it is still classified or sensitive.\nself-made reference system. This is an attempt to encipher your conversation by using your own system. This system rarely works because few people are clever enough to refer to an item of information without actually revealing names, subjects, or other pertinent information that would reveal the classified or sensitive meaning\nThese are concerns to keep in mind when developing a code system for discussing sensitive information.\nCodes: keep them generic, keep them consistent, limit their use to simple signalling.', 'Good Signal Intelligence Research Paper Example\nCommunication Security (ComSec)\nCommunication security is an important section of modern telecommunication systems where signal intelligences and other methods are used to provide secure communication among peers to be connected. Signal intelligence falls into the category of cryptography where the encrypted signal is collected and analyzed for propagating secure communication. This research work will explain the requirements of communication security and will discuss how signal intelligence can be used in communication security. These solutions can be used practically in communication security of the military services.\nSignal intelligence is introduced and evolved by military services where signals from foreign communication systems are observed and analyzed . Signal intelligence has found its applications in the military services and it has become an important component of the battlefield today.\nThe rest of the document is formulated as follows. Next two sections will explain the basic concepts of communication security and signal intelligence. In the coming sections, we will explain common threats faced by communication system and their possible solutions while using signal intelligence.\nCommunication security is the field of keeping unapproved interceptors from getting to the information in a clear structure, while conveying information to the proposed receivers. In the United States Department of Defense culture, it is generally abbreviated as COMSEC. The field incorporates transmission security, cryptosecurity and physical security of COMSEC gear.\nCOMSEC is utilized to ensure both classified and unclassified movement on military communication systems, including many modes like video, voice and data. It is utilized for both wired and remote connections, and both analog and digital applications.\nVoice over secure internet protocol VOSIP has proven to be the true standard for securing voice communication, supplanting the requirement for Secure Terminal Equipment (STE) in a great part of the U.S. Department of Defense. USCENTCOM moved totally to VOSIP in 2008. COMSEC equipment is designed to provide security to the telecommunication using cryptography.\nCommunication Security has following major fields:\nCryptosecurity: The field of communication security that is related with the accessibility of highly trusted cryptosystems and their authentic use. This doesn’t only include the confidentiality, but its authenticity as well.\nEmission Security: The assurance that is possible with the help of all measures taken to preclude unapproved personal data that may be obtained from communication frameworks and cryptographic gear intercepts and investigation of trading off transmissions from cryptographic tools, data frameworks, and telecommunication systems\nTransmission Security: It is the field of communication security that results with the help of applications that are specifically designed to ensure the the transmissions from getting intercepted and exploited by other ways from cryptoanalysis like frequency hopping.\nPhysical Security: The part of communication security that results from all physical actions important to protect characterized equipment, material, and records from access of unapproved persons.\nThe most protected form of communication is through cable which can be over land or underwater. Correspondences or different signs transmitted through such links can\'t be grabbed out of the air. Interception of data from cable has included physically tapping of the links or utilizing ""induction"" gadgets that are set in the vicinity of the links and upkeep of equipment at the time of access. This may not be possible because of hardened and ensured internal landlines, the kind of landline that conveys much high-priority, secret commands and control interchanges. Undersea links are most defenseless since the messages transmitted by them are then transmitted by microwave hand-off once the link achieves land.\nSignal intelligence that is often abbreviated as SIGINT is the technique that is used to gather signals by intercepting. It can be communication between humans which is known to be communication intelligence abbreviated as COMINT. Other form can be the interception from electronic signals known as ELINT. Signal intelligence is the sub-domain of intelligence collection management. As delicate data is mostly encrypted signals intelligence frequently includes the utilization of cryptanalysis to decode the messages. Traffic analysis is the investigation of people communicating with each other and the amount of data shared is additionally used to determine information.\nHistory: the interception of the encrypted written information started soon after the evolution of writing. For example, Caesar Cipher is the basic encryption system\nThe interception for electronic signals started during the Boer Wars in early 1900. Some of the British radios were captured by the Boers and as no other country was transmitting other than Britain hence it was easy to interpret the transmission.\nIt has been observed that signal intelligence caused serious threats even in peacetimes. Events like USS Liberty Incwident, USS Pueblo incident and shooting down of flight 60528 has involved loss of lives.\nSIGINT has five major sub-domains classified as:\nCOMINT: By its name one can assume that it is the intelligence obtained by intercepting the communication of foreign governments or groups and then processing and analyzing it. It can be encrypted or plain transmission like voice or Morse Codes. Commonly the information gathered with the help of COMINT is the diplomatic communication from nations all over the world to their diplomatic establishments.\nELINT: is the electronic intelligence gathered from the electronic signals other than the communication signals. For example, ELINT was used in WWII in order to locate the radars with the help of signals emitted by them. The information required for electronic intelligence is signal strength, frequency and pulse lengths etc.\nRADINT: Radar intelligence is similar to electronic intelligence in which no electronic signal is intercepted from any other object but signals are transmitted by the radar itself and then information is gathered by receiving the same deflected signal. Intelligence that can be obtained include trajectory, flight paths, maneuvering and angle of descent.\nNon-imaging Infrared: is the intelligence obtained with the help of change in temperature. One can detect the absence or presence of any object or its motion with the help of non-imaging infrared intelligence\nLASINT: laser intelligence is the sub-domain that gathers information from the interception of laser transmissions.\nAbove explained techniques can be used in signal intelligence in order to analyze enemy transmission. Different techniques can be applied in different circumstances and a hybrid combination of these techniques can also be used. In order to have a brief introduction of real time issues of communication system, we have explained some common threats to be faced by the communication system in battlefield and possible solutions offered by signal intelligence are also explained.\nCommon Threats to Communication System\nCommunication system can face many challenges in the form of threats which include physical as well as logical attacks to the system. In this section, we will explain such common threats faced by the communication system. Communication security can have problems of external interruption, detection, monitoring or collection of secure information with the help of wireless signals. Signal intelligence involves collection of data which can be used for the benefits of a country after analyzing data with the help of signal intelligence tools as described in the above section. Signal intelligence can cover the communication going on wireless channels and it cannot be used for wired communication. Signal intelligence will also fail to work in an environment when enemy conducts an operation in radio silence where no radio transmission is used for communicating among different enemy groups. Geographical locations and terrain conditions also affect the performance of proper signal detection to be used by signal intelligence. Another main and common issue of signal intelligence is encrypted or cyphered signal used by the enemy. Such signals are to be deciphered in order to get useful information .\nMost common threats faced by signal intelligence are detection of wireless communication devices by the enemy, communication, monitoring, false communication, involvement in actual communication and creating noise in the communication medium between two entities. Detection of wireless communication devices can be used to find the location and identity of communicating entity. Communication monitoring can be used to extract useful information in terms of future plans and actions of the enemy along with the current status of logistics and capabilities. False communication, involvement can be used to distract the enemy from actual intentions and can be used to fail the actual plan. Noise creation or interrupting the communication medium can help to break the communication medium between enemy lines and can significantly affect the performance of enemy operations. Interrupting the communication medium with the help of noise is considered an easiest section of utilizing signal intelligence in communication security for damaging communication system of the enemy. For that purpose, electronic attacks are used. It must be kept in mind that both electronic attack and signal intelligence can’t be used at the same time. Electronic attack can ruin the signal to be used for signal intelligence and therefore there must be coordination between both operations .\nSolution to Threats with the help of Signal Intelligence\nSignal intelligence is the analysis of captured signal in order to get useful information hidden in the signal. In order to reveal such hidden information, deciphering or the decryption techniques are used as explained in the above sections. Some common threats faced by communication security are explained in the previous section. Signal intelligence can be used both for creating these threats as well as to overcome such issues in communication systems. Encryption and decryption techniques have been used for past few years in order to deal such issues of network security and communication security. Redundant bits are required in order to provide a high level of security for transmitting information that increases the overhead on actual data significantly. This overhead can be reduced with the help of signal intelligence by sending minimum required redundant or overhead bits with actual data.\nSignal intelligence is used for finding the location of the signal emitting entity with the help of intercepting the wireless signal. It is also used for future threat detection by locating the position of aircrafts or military convoy and can be used as a replacement of a radar system in some cases.\nIt is recommended to military personals to avoid extra communication through wireless channels in order to prevent from the vulnerabilities caused by signal intelligence. Enemy signals can be used to locate their position and find useful information from their communication.\nCommunication security is a common issue of today’s telecommunication networks and it faces several types of vulnerabilities while securely transmitting data from one place to another. Many possible solutions have been proposed for providing optimal communication security for telecom networks. Signal intelligence is a famous solution to the problem which deals with communication security while analyzing signal encryption and decryption techniques. This research work has explained the working of such techniques used by signal intelligence. Common threats to communication security and their solution provided by signal intelligence are explained in this paper.\nAgency, National Security. Signals Intelligence.

36	what are the three main categories tools monetary policy uses to influence credit explain each category	The three main categories of monetary policy tools for credit influence are: 1) Tools to influence the volume of credit, which include open market operation and reserve requirement, 2) Tools to influence the cost of credit (borrowing), which include discount/bank rate, and 3) Tools designed to influence the directions of credit, which include special deposit, selective credit control, moral suasion, credit ceiling and exchange rate.	['Monetary policy refers to the combination of measures designed to control the supply of money and credits conditions in an economy for the purpose of achieving macroeconomic goals.\nIn other words, it is the regulation of money supply, interest, and exchange rate through the monetary authorities with the view of achieving macroeconomic objectives.\n- Price stability (domestic prices)\n- Economic growth and development\n- Firms employment\n- Equitable distribution of economic income and wealth\n- Favorable balance of payment equilibrium\nTools of Monetary Policy\n- Open Market Operation (OMO): This involves the power of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to purchase or sell securities in the financial markets in order to influence the rate of money supply. It is the injection and withdrawal of money in circulation by the CBN through the sales and purchase of the government securities and treasury bills to or from the commercial bank and the general public e.g. when supply of money is too high the CBN sell securities in order to reduce the money in circulation, excess reserves (liquidity) and vice versa.\n- Reserve Requirement: In a nutshell, it is the amount that commercial bank must have in reserve with the CBN. It also refers to the proportion of total deposit liabilities which the commercial and merchant banks are expected to keep as cash against unforeseen development in their operations. Reserve requirements are of two types:\nCash Reserve Ratio: This is the certain proportion of commercial and merchant bank deposit kept with the central bank in form of cash balances. They are not for lending.\nLiquidity Ratio: This is the proportion of a deposit to be kept in short-term investment (liquid assets) e.g. shares\n- The Discount Rate or Bank Rate: This is the interest rate charged by the Central Bank on its loan to commercial or merchant bank. It is also called a Minimum Rediscount Rate (MRR).\n- Special Deposits: These are separate account opened and maintained by the CBN on behalf of the banks. It is used to influence bank deposit.\n- Selective Credit Control/Special Directives: This implies that the CBN controls commercial and merchant bank to give credit to a particular sector of the economy with a certain percent of agricultural, and manufacturing sector etc., here the CBN gives directives on the size composition of their credits. It could be done through threat.\n- Moral Suasion: This is a means of appealing by the CBN (monetary authority) to the bank that adheres to its monetary policy guidelines e.g. to lend money to a particular sector e.g. Industrial Agricultural Sector this is usually done by CBN governors.\n- Credit Ceiling (Direct Credit Control): This involves the fixation or stabilization of bank credit to domestic economy by the CBN to either increase/decrease money supply. It is used to mop up an excess fund and stabilize credit operation. Raising the ceilings is to increase supply while lowering the credit ceiling will reduce the money supply.\n- Exchange Route Rate: This is the rate at which a countries currency is exchanged for another country’s currency. It controls foreign exchange earnings and deficit in the balance of payment includes:\nFree or Floating Exchange Rate: This is the exchange rate that is determined by the foreign demand and supply i.e. it is not influenced by the government policy of any country.\nPegged Exchange Rate: This is an exchange rate that is determined by the government.\nIt should be noted that amongst the instrument tools of monetary policy are:\n- Tools to influence the volume of credit e.g. open market operation and reserve requirement\n- Tools to influence the cost of credit (borrowing) e.g. discount/bank rate\n- Tools design to influence the directions of credit e.g. special deposit, selective credit control, suasion, credit ceiling and exchange rate.']	['<urn:uuid:ef7d1f7a-69e4-41a9-95dc-de2250f39787>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	16	65	629
37	I'm setting up a school workshop and I'm wondering about 3D printers. What are the learning benefits for students using these machines, and what health precautions should we take when using them?	3D printers provide valuable learning opportunities - students can develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills through hands-on projects like creating gallery exhibits, engineering designs, and inventions. However, proper safety measures are essential. The printers should be used in well-ventilated areas, ideally with HEPA/carbon filtration systems, as they emit particles and chemical vapors that could potentially cause cardiovascular effects and lung damage. Having proper ventilation is especially important in schools since occupational exposure limits are designed for adults, not children. Additionally, basic safety practices include inspecting electrical cords, allowing sufficient cooling time, and using printers with protective covers to prevent injury from moving parts.	['Marymount School is an independent, Catholic day school that seeks to educate young women who continue to question, risk, and grow—young women who care, serve, and lead—young women prepared to challenge, shape, and change the world.\nMarymount is a college preparatory school for girls, committed to the development of the lifelong skills of critical thinking and problem solving. A wide range of extracurricular activities complements the academic program and provides opportunities for creativity, self-expression, leadership, and collaboration. These experiences foster social skills, sportsmanship, a sense of responsibility, independence, and self-confidence. The School promotes in each student a respect for her own unique abilities and a commitment to responsible living in a changing world. Marymount welcomes diversity and draws upon it to foster cultural sensitivity, religious understanding, and a global perspective.\nDescription of Maker Space\nMarymount School has four specific, yet distinct, makerspaces.\nThe Fab Lab at 97th Street is our original design and makerspace. The space is outfitted with several 3D printers, a laser cutter, a CNC milling machine and vinyl cutter, among other tools. The space also has a substantial materials library, for students to use in designing wearables and other projects. The space is also a registered Fab Lab.\nAt our Fifth Avenue campus, we have two makerspaces. The Tinkering Space is coordinated by our Art Department, and allows lower school students the opportunity to explore, design, tinker and play. This space also has a substantial materials library, design tools such as sewing machines and typewriters and a complete Little Bits Pro Library.\nAlso at Fifth Avenue is the IDEA Lab. Students from Classes PreK through V and IX through XII use this space. It features five 3D printers, a 3D scanner and Epilog Laser Cutter. Classes such as Engineering: Interactive Design and clubs such as Marymount Makers meet in this space.\nThe STEAM Lab is at our 82nd Street Campus and is used by students and faculty in Classes III through V. Outfitted with two 3D printers, a mini 3D printer and a variety of materials for use in design and innovation.\nWhile each design space is associated with a specific division, students and faculty are free to do design work at any of the spaces. In general, the Fab Lab and IDEA Lab are open to students and faculty all day and it is not uncommon to see older students using these spaces during their free time. Safety is also important; the Fab Lab specifically has adult supervision at all times. Yet all students have the opportunity in each space to design, tinker, create and innovate.\nDescription of Program\nWe are often asked to share our “maker curriculum” and our answer is, “we don’t have one.” Moreover, we have not limited ourselves to a “maker program,” but a philosophy in which maker education and design thinking are infused into appropriate places in the curriculum. As noted by Gary Stager and Sylvia Martinez, “the Maker Movement overlaps with the natural inclinations of children the power of learning by doing. By embracing the lessons of the Maker Movement, educators can revamp the best student-centered teaching (and learning) practices) to engage learners of all ages.” By doing so, we are creating a “vibrant, collaborative community of global problem-solvers.”\nWe first ventured into the world of Maker Education almost five years ago. Our program has grown both internally and externally by word of mouth. Our faculty and students are encouraged to explore and uses our makerspaces at times when it is appropriate to meet specific learning objectives. We also do very little training in these spaces. In the same way we expect students to collaborate as part of the learning process, we expect teachers to do the same. Students and teachers both learn from each other.\nAs such, our program has grown organically over the past five years. Maker projects, both big and small, have been infused into the curriculum in all disciplines and in all divisions. It is not uncommon to see a Class III student and teacher at the laser cutter, producing something for the Invention Convention, standing next to a Class XI student at the 3D printer, working on a project that integrates physics, design and social justice.\nExamples of How the Space is Being Used\nAs with “traditional technology,” makerspace projects do not drive the curriculum but thoughtfully support and enhance the connection between learning objectives and learning outcomes. Our makerspaces are places where students can explore, tinker, play, ideate, create and innovate. For example:\n- Our senior elective, Engineering: Interactive Design, is an introduction to human-computer interaction. Students take engineering projects from concept to design to construction and execution. This year, students are designing a 3D printed human equipped with interactive wearables and sensors.\n- The Curators’ Gallery, as part of the Class IX Humanities program, requires students to design and construct their own gallery for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Students use tools such as the 3D printer and software such as Google SketchUp and Tinkercad to produce their own pieces (or replicas of pieces) for their galleries.\n- Open Studio in Class VIII and IX gives students the opportunity to design their own learning experiences in the FabLab under umbrella themes such as Site Specific and Gamification.\n- The Class VIII physical science curriculum has been retooled and redesigned with engineering, making and programming framing the study of physic through projects such as the botBallet.\n- The Upper Middle School Integrated Projects is a cross-grade, student-centered, interdisciplinary project that allows students to design their own learning. Projects this year included a physical version of the videogame, Minecraft.\n- In Lower Middle School, the STEAM Lab is also a lab for exploring experimental technologies. Students use tools such as the Oculus Rift, Hummingbird Robots and Sparkis, a newly-released robot, to collect data from their world.\n- In Lower School, the Invention Convention provides students the opportunity to design and construct their own inventions. The design process is augmented by the use of WeDos and PicoCrickets. This year, students produced their own commercials for their products in our Media Lab.\nWe all know that the paradigm of teaching and learning is changing. How that change occurs and what that change will look like remains unknown. At Marymount, we are quite confident that a continued focus on student-centered learning will allow our students to be successful in “challenging, shaping and changing the world.”\nWe are currently planning the construction of the School of the Future, a new building with innovative, flexible, dynamic teaching and learning spaces, that should open by 2021. In the short term, though, we see making and design education as continuing to support and enhance our already, rich, vigorous curriculum.\nIn the fall of 2014, we started the Making and Learning Institute (MLI). Supported by a generous grant from the E.E. Ford Foundation, the Making and Learning Institute offers a new paradigm in professional development. Instead of self-contained, teacher-centered workshops, you will be immersed in an experience that will allow you to observe innovative practices in an innovative school setting.\nThe MLI includes:\nHalf-day immersion experiences. These experiences may include: classroom visits; making and learning conversations with our students and teachers; tours of our two digital fabrication labs and tinkerspace; and design in education experiences.\n- Maker Day at Marymount. An annual event for students, teachers, designers, makers and doers.\n- Design, Do, Discover. We’ve partnered with Castilleja School in Palo Alto, CA to offer a two-day workshop for educators who are passionate about hands-on learning and interested in the practical implementation of these experiences in the classroom.\n- Maker Education Impact Summit. We will be hosting this one day conference in May to promote maker education in schools.\nMore information on the Making and Learning Institute may be found at making.marymountnyc.org.', 'The NIOSH on 3D Printer Fumes and Health. Your Guide to 3D Printers and Health, Best Practices.\nThe NIOSH is a part of America’s CDC (Centers for Disease Control). The NIOSH itself is The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for the United States. It is the part of the government tasked with researching into the safety of workers in many professions. At 3DPrint.com we noticed a number of very interesting articles come out by NIOSH researchers about 3D printing. We were especially impressed with their thoughtful and thorough research on carbon nanotubes in 3D printer filaments. There is also a very informative post about 3D printers and safety on the NIOSH website. We’ve always been worried about 3D printing safety including fine particles and especially fumes from 3D printers. At 3DPrint.com we think that we are potentially creating significant health issues with some 3D printing practices. We, therefore, reached out to the NIOSH for some guidance. A group of NIOSH researchers took the time to respond to us with some best practices for 3D printer safety. We’re very thankful for their well thought out and clear answers to our questions. We must, as they have, qualify their statements as an initial response but we do believe that this is the clearest and most extensive look into 3D printing safety online.\n“It is important to note that there is a current lack of data on 3D printer emissions. In addition, the rapidly shifting description of the “workplace/production environment,” the availability of this technology beyond industrial applications, and the tremendous variety of feedstock polymers that are commercially available or can be made by consumers mean that additional research is needed to evaluate these emissions’ possible health effects.”\n1) If I 3D print with FDM at home should I get a fume hood or HEPA/Carbon filtration just in case?\n‘NIOSH focuses on worker health and our research is performed in the laboratory and in occupational settings, which can be quite different from homes. Consideration of whether to use a fume hood or filtration will depend on several factors, including the design of the 3-D printer, the type of filament being extruded (filaments are materials (plastic, nylon or other) that are fed into the printer in order to create the final object), the size and air movement in the room in which it is being used, and who is occupying the room (children, adults, people with pre-existing health problems).\nWhile there are no occupational exposure limits for the small particles emitted by 3-D printers, there are some exposure limits for specific chemical vapors that are emitted during printing. For occupational settings, these chemical exposure limits can be used to guide the selection of appropriate controls to reduce exposures to a safe level. In workplaces, NIOSH research has shown that appropriately designed and operated local exhaust ventilation with HEPA/carbon filtration reduces the amounts of particles and chemicals in air. It is important to understand that occupational exposure limits are intended to protect adults in workplace settings and, at this time, we do not know what levels of particles or chemical vapors would be safe for children and others in homes. Given this uncertainty, it is difficult to recommend specific levels that should be achieved when trying to reduce emissions in homes, though use of a printer in a well-ventilated area could help lower emissions.”\n2) What are the risks of 3D printing?\n“For FDM 3-D printers, there are risks related to the printer itself and potentially from the emissions. Risks related to the printer are similar to those associated with working with other types of machines and may include electrical shock from damaged power cords, burns from touching hot surfaces such as the extruder nozzle, and injury such as cuts from contact with sharp edges or contusions from contact with moving parts. At this time, our understanding of risks from particle and chemical vapor emissions from 3-D printers is limited.\nIn one study done by NIOSH, rats exposed for 1 hour to particle and vapor emissions from a FDM 3-D printer using ABS filament (a type of plastic material) developed acute hypertension, indicating the potential for cardiovascular effects. In another NIOSH research study, lung cells exposed to FDM 3-D printer emissions from printing with ABS and polycarbonate for about 3 hours showed signs of cell damage, cell death, and release of chemicals associated with inflammation, suggesting potential for adverse effects to the lungs if emissions are inhaled. These in vitro findings need to be confirmed with more extensive in vivo studies. It is important to understand that exposures used in toxicology studies may not be the same as those encountered by workers or in homes for a number of reasons, including the use of ventilation in workplaces or the amount of fresh air brought into homes by the heating and cooling system.”\n3) How would I best protect myself against 3d printing risks?\n“Risks related to the printer itself can often be eliminated by safe work practices and the design of the 3-D printer. For example, as with any electrical device used at work or in the home, daily inspection of the electrical cord can help to identify if the cord is damaged and should not be used. After an object is printed, allowing sufficient time for the extruder nozzle to cool down before removing the object from the build chamber will reduce the risk of burns. NIOSH researchers often observe smaller 3-D printers being used in workplaces that are also purchased by consumers for private use. Using a 3-D printer with a cover or doors that prevent the user from reaching in while machine parts are moving will help reduce the risk of injury.\n- At this time we do not know what levels of exposure causes adverse health effects, so we can’t recommend safe levels of exposure to 3-D printer emissions whether in the workplace or in homes. In occupational settings, we use the “hierarchy of controls” to protect workers from risks on their jobs. The hierarchy of controls specifies, from most preferred to least preferred, the types of controls that should be used to reduce occupational exposures:\n- The most preferred method is to substitute or eliminate the hazard. For example, in the case of FDM 3-D printing with filaments that contain carbon nanotubes, the emission of plastic-particles that contain carbon nanotubes can be eliminated by not using that type of filament if it is not necessary for the performance of the built object.\n- If a risk cannot be eliminated, engineering controls such as a fume hood or local exhaust ventilation (a system that specifically ventilates the printer rather than the air in a room) with HEPA/carbon filtration would be the next preferred method to reduce emission levels. Some 3-D printers are now being sold with built-in filtration units.\nAlternatively, a printer owner may purchase an after-market fan/filter systems to reduce emissions. However, NIOSH researchers have not yet evaluated how well these built-in or after-market filtration systems work. It is important to understand that for engineering controls such as fume hoods or local exhaust ventilation with filtration to be effective, these systems must be properly designed, built and operated.\nIn one workplace, NIOSH researchers showed that an appropriately designed and operated local exhaust ventilation with HEPA/carbon filtration reduced the amounts of particles and chemicals in air. NIOSH researchers have also observed that in some workplaces where the ventilation system is not built correctly that the chemicals are released back into the room air. Additionally, systems that use carbon filters to remove organic chemical vapors need to be monitored over time because the charcoal has a finite capacity to adsorb chemicals. Once this capacity is reached, the charcoal filter needs to be replaced or it will not capture additional organic vapor emissions.\n- If engineering controls cannot reduce the risk to an acceptable level, administrative controls may be used. An example of an administrative control is that NIOSH researchers have observed in some workplaces that employees do not enter the room where 3-D printers are operating unless it is necessary (e.g., to perform maintenance or to retrieve a built object).\nFinally, if none of these controls can reduce emissions to an acceptable level, the least preferred control is the use of personal protective technologies such as respirators or dust masks. In workplaces, respirators are the least preferred means of control because they do not remove the exposure, they only reduce the amount that might be inhaled; this depends on the proper selection of filters and cartridges that remove contaminants while breathing. Additionally, to be effective, respirators rely on the worker to properly wear and use the mask. To wear a respirator, a user must be medically cleared by a physician and it must be properly fitted and retested each year to ensure fit. The user must be properly trained on how to wear, remove, and maintain the respirator. NIOSH researchers have observed in some workplaces where 3-D printers are used that some employees with facial hair will put on a respirator, but the hair prevents the respirator from forming a tight seal with their face so the mask does not provide any protection to the worker.”\n4) If I had a 3D printer at a school what should my safety precautions be?\n“NIOSH focuses on worker health and our research is performed in the laboratory and in occupational settings, which can be quite different from environments such as homes or schools. For example, 3-D printers may be used with different frequency in schools and there may be only one printer operating in a large classroom as opposed to many printers in a small workspace. These differences will influence the types of controls implemented to reduce emissions.\nThere are no occupational exposure limits for the small particles emitted by 3-D printers but there are some exposure limits for specific chemical vapors that are emitted during printing. For occupational settings, these chemical exposure limits can be used to guide the selection of appropriate controls to reduce exposures to a safe level.\nIt is important to understand that occupational exposure limits are intended to protect adults in workplace settings. At this time, we do not know what levels of particles or chemical vapors would be safe for children in schools. Given this uncertainty, it is difficult to recommend specific levels that should be achieved when trying to reduce emissions in schools. In workplaces, NIOSH research has shown that appropriately designed and operated local exhaust ventilation with HEPA/carbon filtration reduces the amounts of particles and chemicals in air. If exhaust ventilation is not feasible, use of a printer in a well-ventilated area could help lower emissions.”\nYou May Also Like\nShould Vented Enclosures Become A Mandatory Safety Standard for FFF 3D Printers?\nWith innovation always comes unintended consequences.

The stomach's acids also help prevent bacteria from entering the blood. The second line of defense involves white blood cells, which include phagocytes that counter all invaders, and lymphocytes that target specific pathogens. These white blood cells travel through the bloodstream and tissues to search for and attack microorganisms and other invaders.	"['For the immune system,\nlife is hard.

Such invaders include microorganisms (commonly called germs, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi), parasites (such as worms), cancer cells, and even transplanted organs and tissues (see see Plan of Action). To defend the body against these invaders, the immune system must be able to distinguish between what belongs in the body (self) and what does not (nonself or foreign). Any substances that are identified as nonself, particularly if they are perceived as dangerous (for example, if they can cause disease), stimulate an immune response in the body. Such substances are called antigens. Antigens include any substance that can be recognized by the immune system.\nAntigens may be contained within or on bacteria, viruses, other microorganisms, or cancer cells. Antigens may also exist on their own—for example, as food molecules or pollen. A normal immune response consists of recognizing a potentially harmful foreign antigen, activating and mobilizing forces to defend against it, and attacking it. If the immune system malfunctions and mistakes self for nonself, it may attack the body's own tissues, causing an autoimmune disorder, such as rheumatoid arthritis, thyroiditis, or systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus).\nDisorders of the immune system occur when\nLines of Defense\nThe body has a series of defenses. Defenses include physical barriers, white blood cells, and molecules such as antibodies and complement proteins.\nThe first line of defense against invaders is mechanical or physical barriers:\nAs long as these barriers remain unbroken, many invaders cannot enter the body. If a barrier is broken—for example, if extensive burns damage the skin—the risk of infection is increased. In addition, the barriers are defended by secretions containing enzymes that can destroy bacteria. Examples are sweat, tears in the eyes, mucus in the respiratory and digestive tracts, and secretions in the vagina.\nWhite blood cells:\nThe next line of defense involves certain white blood cells (leukocytes) that travel through the bloodstream and into tissues, searching for and attacking microorganisms and other invaders. This defense has two parts: innate and acquired immunity.\nInnate (natural) immunity (see Innate Immunity) does not require a previous encounter with a microorganism or other invader to work effectively. It responds to invaders immediately, without needing to learn to recognize them. Several types of white blood cells are involved:\nIn acquired (adaptive or specific) immunity (see Acquired Immunity), lymphocytes (B cells and T cells) encounter an invader, learn how to attack it, and remember the specific invader so that they can attack it even more efficiently the next time they encounter it. Acquired immunity takes time to develop after the initial encounter with a new invader because the lymphocytes must adapt to it. However, thereafter, response is quick. B cells and T cells work together to destroy invaders. Some of these cells do not directly destroy invaders but instead enable other white blood cells to recognize and destroy invaders.\nInnate immunity and acquired immunity interact, influencing each other directly or through molecules that attract or activate other cells of the immune system—as part of the mobilization step in defense (see Activation and mobilization). These molecules include cytokines (which are the messengers of the immune system), antibodies, and complement proteins (which form the complement system). These substances are not contained in cells but are dissolved in a body fluid, such as plasma (the liquid part of blood).\nSome of these molecules, including some cytokines, promote inflammation. Inflammation occurs because these molecules attract immune system cells to the affected tissue. To help get these cells to the tissue, the body sends more blood to the tissue. To carry more blood to the tissue, blood vessels expand and become more porous, allowing more fluids and cells to leave blood vessels and enter the tissue. Inflammation thus tends to cause redness, warmth, and swelling. The purpose of inflammation is to contain the infection so that it does not spread. Then other substances produced by the immune system help the inflammation resolve and damaged tissues heal. Although inflammation may be bothersome, it indicates that the immune system is doing its job. However, excessive or long-term (chronic) inflammation can be harmful.\nThe immune system includes several organs in addition to cells dispersed throughout the body. These organs are classified as primary or secondary lymphoid organs.\nThe primary lymphoid organs are the sites where white blood cells are produced and/or multiply:\nWhen needed to defend the body, the white blood cells are mobilized, mainly from the bone marrow. They then move into the bloodstream and travel to wherever they are needed.\n|Lymphatic System: Helping Defend Against Infection\nThe lymphatic system is a vital part of the immune system, along with the thymus, bone marrow, spleen, tonsils, appendix, and Peyer patches in the small intestine.\nThe lymphatic system is a network of lymph nodes connected by lymphatic vessels. This system transports lymph throughout the body.\nLymph is formed from fluid that seeps through the thin walls of capillaries into the body's tissues. This fluid contains oxygen, proteins, and other nutrients that nourish the tissues. Some of this fluid reenters the capillaries and some of it enters the lymphatic vessels (becoming lymph). Small lymphatic vessels connect to larger ones and eventually form the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct is the largest lymphatic vessel. It joins with the subclavian vein and thus returns lymph to the bloodstream.\nLymph also transports foreign substances (such as bacteria), cancer cells, and dead or damaged cells that may be present in tissues into the lymphatic vessels and to lymph organs for disposal. Lymph contains many white blood cells.\nAll substances transported by the lymph pass through at least one lymph node, where foreign substances can be filtered out and destroyed before fluid is returned to the bloodstream. In the lymph nodes, white blood cells can collect, interact with each other and with antigens, and generate immune responses to foreign substances. Lymph nodes contain a mesh of tissue that is tightly packed with B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Harmful microorganisms are filtered through the mesh, then identified and attacked by B cells and T cells.\nLymph nodes are often clustered in areas where the lymphatic vessels branch off, such as the neck, armpits, and groin.\nThe secondary lymphoid organs include the spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils, appendix, and Peyer patches in the small intestine. These organs trap microorganisms and other foreign substances and provide a place for mature cells of the immune system to collect, interact with each other and with the foreign substances, and generate a specific immune response.\nThe lymph nodes are strategically placed in the body and are connected by an extensive network of lymphatic vessels, which act as the immune system's circulatory system. The lymphatic system transports microorganisms, other foreign substances, cancer cells, and dead or damaged cells from the tissues to the lymph nodes, where these substances and cells are filtered out and destroyed. Then the filtered lymph is returned to the bloodstream.\nLymph nodes are one of the first places that cancer cells can spread. Thus, doctors often evaluate lymph nodes to determine whether a cancer has spread. Cancer cells in a lymph node can cause the node to swell. Lymph nodes can also swell after an infection because immune responses to infections are generated in lymph nodes. Sometimes lymph nodes swell because bacteria that are carried to a lymph node are not killed and cause an infection in the lymph node (lymphadenitis).\nPlan of Action\nA successful immune response to invaders requires recognition, activation and mobilization, regulation, and resolution.\nTo be able to destroy invaders, the immune system must first recognize them. That is, the immune system must be able to distinguish what is nonself (foreign) from what is self. The immune system can make this distinction because all cells have identification molecules on their surface. Microorganisms are recognized because the identification molecules on their surface are foreign. In people, the most important self-identification molecules are called human leukocyte antigens (HLA) or the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). HLA molecules are called antigens because if transplanted, as in a kidney or skin graft, they can provoke an immune response in another person (normally, they do not provoke an immune response in the person who has them). Each person has an almost unique combination of HLAs. Each person's immune system normally recognizes this unique combination as self. A cell with molecules on its surface that are not identical to those on the body's own cells is identified as being foreign. The immune system then attacks that cell. Such a cell may be a microorganism, a cell from transplanted tissue, or one of the body's cells that has been infected by an invading microorganism or altered by cancer. (HLA molecules are what doctors try to match when a person needs an organ transplant.)\nSome white blood cells—B cells (B lymphocytes)—can recognize invaders directly. But others—T cells (T lymphocytes)—need help from other cells of the immune system (called antigen-presenting cells). These cells ingest an invader and break it into fragments. The antigen fragments from the invader are combined with HLA molecules as they are assembled in the antigen-presenting cell. The combination of antigen fragments and HLA molecules is moved to the cell's surface. T cells that come into contact with the antigen-presenting cell can then learn to recognize the invader's antigen fragments. T cells are then activated and can begin fighting the invaders that have that antigen.\nActivation and mobilization:\nWhite blood cells are activated when they recognize invaders. For example, when the antigen-presenting cell presents antigen fragments bound to HLA to a T cell, the T cell attaches to the fragments and is activated. B cells can be activated directly by invaders. Once activated, white blood cells ingest or kill the invader or do both. Usually, more than one type of white blood cell is needed to kill an invader.\nImmune cells, such as macrophages and activated T cells, release substances that attract other immune cells to the trouble spot, thus mobilizing defenses. The invader itself may release substances that attract immune cells.\nThe immune response must be regulated to prevent extensive damage to the body, as occurs in autoimmune disorders. Regulatory (suppressor) T cells help control the response by secreting cytokines (chemical messengers of the immune system) that inhibit immune responses. These cells prevent the immune response from continuing indefinitely.\nResolution involves confining the invader and eliminating it from the body. After the invader is eliminated, most white blood cells self-destruct and are ingested. Those that are spared are called memory cells. The body retains memory cells, which are part of acquired immunity, to remember specific invaders and respond more vigorously to them at the next encounter.\nLast full review/revision March 2013 by Peter J.

39	As someone over 50 interested in hiking, how often should I do strength training, and how should I time my protein intake around these workouts?	For outdoor athletes over 50, you should complete a full-body sport-specific strength workout twice a week for 30-45 minutes each (2-3 sets of 6-8 exercises for 8-15 repetitions), plus a weekly weighted backpack walk. Studies show that 2 days of strength training can be as effective as 3, especially since older adults need more recovery time between hard efforts. Regarding protein timing, consume 30-40 grams of protein within 30 minutes after exercise to maximize protein synthesis and enhance recovery. Additionally, taking 20-25 grams of protein 30-45 minutes before bedtime can help limit muscle loss while sleeping.	['Train Today for\nMore Training Info > Over 50 Strength Training\nOver 50 Strength Training\nBy Courtenay Schurman, MS, CSCS\n“I’m always the last one back to the car.” “My hips hurt whenever I carry a heavy pack.” “I can’t keep up with the 20-somethings.” “I can go forever but I also take forever.” “My knees tend to give out on steep terrain.” “My balance sucks.”\nSound familiar? I hear comments like these all the time from clients over 50 who lament about how their bodies are not keeping pace with their minds past the half-century mark. Every one of these complaints can be erased by embarking on a properly designed strength training routine specific to your sport and particular weaknesses.\nIf you hear yourself making the same comments, answer the following questions: 1) Have I changed my training routine in any way in the past 2 years? 2) Do I currently do any resistance (i.e. strength) training? 3) Do I know what muscle groups I need to work on to improve my performance? 4) Am I satisfied enough with where I am physically to keep doing what I’m doing?\nIf you answered “no” to any one of the four, then read on! First in a new 3-part series, below, we discuss the importance of strength training for outdoor athletes over 50.\nStrength and speed\nIf you feel like you are slowing down and can no longer keep pace with your younger mountaineering or hiking partners, the first thing to do is change your training routine. Your body adapts to whatever stimulus you give it within about 3-6 weeks. After that you really are simply maintaining.\nIf you are not doing any strength training, start. If you think that strength training is for younger people, or for those trying to impress someone, get over yourself! Strength training is crucial for increased sports performance, especially if you have never done any form of resistance training before.\nProper resistance training will help you develop strength, power, and speed in the uphill propulsion muscles (glutes; hamstrings; hips; calves; core and lower back muscles) to enable you to go uphill faster, more safely, and more easily. It will increase your confidence on the downhill portions (when most older athletes feel the front of the thighs, the quadriceps, and other muscles around the knees) and you ultimately will have a better shot at keeping up with younger partners and feeling less discomfort doing so.\nSuitable Strength Programs\nWhere can you find a suitable strength training routine for the lower body?\n- Hiking Strength offers sport-specific exercises\n- The training programs page includes examples of programs\n- The Outdoor Athlete book offers complete sport-specific programs for 17 different sports and includes cardiovascular training information, flexibility and strength exercises, and sport-specific tips.\nTo gauge how your resistance training program is affecting your development of speed, strength and power, find a hike or route that you can do every other week or so and time yourself from car to car, including rest breaks and lunch. The time it takes on your first outing becomes your baseline measurement. Each time you hike the same trail, try to increase your speed (or carry more weight in the same amount of time). By having some sort of consistent benchmark hike, you can chart how your strength training program is affecting your speed and performance and adjust accordingly for optimal results.\nBelow are some conditioning tips specific to hiking which will help with speed development:\n- Heavier pack weight – the key to getting results is to change something in your program. If you always go out with a light day pack, try increasing your pack weight every so often and doing a shorter hike. By adding weight, you tap into harder-to-access muscle fibers that do not get recruited as easily or as often. While doing so may result in a little soreness, and may slow you down the first time you do it, the next time you hike, your usual pack will feel that much lighter.\n- Lighter pack weight – the converse of (1) above: if you always carry a fairly heavy pack, try going lighter for more elevation gain, greater distance, or shorter time. A longer hike will result in greater strength endurance. A change in terrain steepness will cause you to work the muscles differently (specifically glutes and quadriceps). A lighter pack weight will allow you to increase leg turnover rate and pick up your speed. The next time you hike you will feel like you are a tad faster.\n- Leg turnover rate training – “Random speed play,” otherwise known as Fartlek intervals (see www.bodyresults.com/e2fartlekintervals.asp), is great for helping increase your leg turnover rate (i.e. how fast you can take steps). During your training hikes, attack steeper portions of the trail with long, powerful strides. Choose several short segments (<200 yards or meters) partway through the outing and push yourself to 90% of your maximal effort. The remaining segments of the hike at base pace will feel easier in comparison, and you will have decreased your total hike time. The more you can include random bursts of speed among your bouts of steady hiking, the more fit you become.\nStrength recommendations for athletes over 50\nWhether you are male or female, young or old, a goal is a goal; if you cannot carry a heavy pack (35-55 pounds) while gaining 10,000 feet of elevation on Mount Rainier, Washington, in 2-4 days, you simply will not be able to reach the summit. The requirements for each individual remain the same, but how you go about achieving those requirements change as we age.\nThe American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends that “able-bodied adults” do resistance training 2-3 times a week for at least 20 to 30 minutes. Since outdoor athletes are embarking on more rigorous end goals than “pick up the grandkids” or “walk 18 holes of golf,” they require far more than the relatively sedentary “able population.”\nStrive for completing a full body sport-specific strength workout (2-3 sets of 6-8 exercises for 8-15 repetitions for 30-45 minutes each) twice a week and a weekly weighted backpack walk (for an hour or longer). Such a program constitutes your minimum maintenance resistance training program for backpacking, scrambling, hiking, climbing, trekking and mountaineering.\nRemember that as we age, we need more recovery time between hard efforts. That refers to pack-loaded workouts as well as higher intensity cardiovascular training and strength training. If you were able to do three or more strength workouts per week when you were younger, you may wonder about how decreased frequency will affect your results.\nStudies actually show that 2 days of strength training can be as effective as 3. Since outdoor athletes require a balance in programming that also takes into consideration sufficient coordination, balance and flexibility training, aerobic and anaerobic conditioning, skill development, and sport-specific training, removing one 45-minute training block can actually free up time for other fitness components that may allow for greater improvement. Furthermore, never underestimate the benefit of adequate recovery; by training smarter, not more, you may actually see performance increase.\nNovice strength trainee\nIf you are over 50 and have never done any organized strength training before, find a reliable resource (online trainer, exercise video, personal coach, or knowledgeable friend) who will help you learn how to perform exercises with proper form. While you may feel as though it is faster, easier, or more comfortable to use strength machines on your own, such machines may actually end up fitting your body poorly, contributing to higher strain rates. Furthermore, by relying on the machines for support, you often do not have to work as hard, and all the stabilizing muscles that help you in the natural 3-D environment get short-changed.\nWith just a few minutes of instruction, you can learn some simple free weights exercises that will be far more beneficial for preparing you for your sport. Such basic free-weights leg exercises that are crucial for all outdoor athletes over 50 include the a) 1-leg Deadlift (www.bodyresults.com/e2gluteusmedius.asp); b) Reverse step up (www.bodyresults.com/e2kneetest.asp); and c) Step ups.

Links to all three parts are below:', 'The following article is part two of a three part series on the importance of muscle strength as it relates to one’s health and longevity. The first article discussed the relationship between muscle strength and maintaining healthy body functions as one ages, along with tips and advice for how to start an exercise-training program to increase muscle strength. This second article will discuss how aging changes one’s response to exercise training and nutrition, and explain how diet and nutrient supplementation can be modified to improve exercise training adaptation. The third article will discuss the role of nitric oxide in muscle function and development, and explain the need to maintain adequate nitric oxide levels to bring about desired training adaptations. It is not exaggerating when I say that following the simple recommendations provided in these articles can have a profound effect on your quality of life.\nMuscle Mass, Strength and Function with Aging\nFrom birth until about 30 years of age, there is a continued development in strength, muscle mass and quality. After age 35, a gradual decline in muscle mass and strength begins and is associated with a reduction in strength, power and speed of movement. This decline accelerates at about 50 years of age and then again at 70 years of age. After the age of 70, this decline continues to accelerate 25-30% per decade.\nAside from a loss in muscle mass and strength, other alterations in muscle occur with age include reductions in mitochondrial and capillary density. Mitochondria are the power plants of the cell. They are responsible for aerobic (in the presence of oxygen) energy production in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the energy currency of the cell and is required to run all energy requiring metabolic processes in the body including muscle contraction. The capillaries surrounding the muscle fibers are where the transfer of oxygen and nutrients pass from the circulatory system into the muscle fiber, and where metabolic waste products are transferred out. As muscle mitochondrial and capillary density increases, the ability of the body to perform prolonged endurance exercise increases and efficiency of exercise recovery improves. Conversely, as mitochondrial and capillary density decrease, exercise endurance decreases.\nThe decline in muscle mass and strength with age is genetically controlled. However, a decline in physical activity with age also contributes. If muscle is not physically challenged regularly, it will atrophy. Think “ if you don’t use it you loss it.” This is why, as one ages, it is important to participate in a regular resistance exercise training program. Another reason for the decline in muscle mass and strength is due to “anabolic resistance”. Characteristics of anabolic resistance include a blunted protein synthesis response to resistance exercise and dietary protein including protein consumed immediately post exercise.\nTherefore, with advancing age the amount of dietary protein necessary to maintain muscle mass increases.\nDr. John Ivy on connection between aging, protein, and muscle mass.\nDietary Protein Requirements\nDietary protein is a vital nutrient that supplies needed amino acids that are used to make enzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters, antibodies, and serve as the building blocks for repair and growth of all tissues of the body including muscle. There are 20 amino acids that the body requires for these purposes. Of these 20 amino acids, 11 can be produced in the body itself and are referred to as non-essential amino acids, while 9 are referred to as essential amino acids because they have to be obtained through dietary means.\nNot all dietary proteins are equal in nutrient value. As mentioned above, protein is made of amino acids and each protein has a unique amino acid profile. Proteins can be classified as complete or incomplete proteins.\n- A complete protein is one that has an adequate proportion of all 9 essential amino acids necessary for the dietary needs of humans. Complete proteins are typically animal-based proteins such as meat, fish, milk, cheese and eggs. However, there are some plant sources of protein that are considered complete such as soy, quinoa, buckwheat, hemp, and spirulia.\n- An incomplete protein is one that lacks one or more of the essential amino acids or does not have an adequate proportion of one or more of the essential amino acids. However, just because a protein is incomplete does not mean that it is not beneficial. Meals are not generally made from a single food item, and combining the right combination of incomplete proteins can provide the necessary essential amino acids required by the body. Proteins that are combined to provide a complete amino acid profile are known as complimentary proteins. Examples are brown rice and black beans or kale and almonds.\nAs mentioned above, the RDA for protein is 0.36 g per lb. of body weight, and represents the quantity of protein that should be consumed daily to meet population needs and to prevent deficiency. However, factors including physical activity pattern, body type and age can have a significant influence on protein need. For example, young individuals competing in sports who are likely involved in a rigorous training program require a greater amount of dietary protein than the RDA. Likewise, as individuals approach 45 to 50 years of age there is an increased requirement for dietary protein. In fact, once one reaches middle age, the requirement for dietary protein approximately doubles to between 0.55 to 0.68 g of protein per lb. of body weight.\nIncreasing protein consumption in middle-age provides many benefits for both men and women. It has been found to slow muscle loss with age, increase skeletal muscle mass and strength, and to enhance training adaptation when combined with a resistance or aerobic exercise training program. Consuming additional protein while lowering carbohydrate and fat consumption when dieting has also been found to reduce muscle loss while increasing fat loss in overweight individuals.\nTiming Protein Consumption for Best Results\nThe timing of protein consumption is also an important consideration as it can have a significant impact on how effective whole body protein synthesis can be activated. Protein that is consumed at daily meals should be spread out evenly. That is, the protein at breakfast, lunch and dinner should be about the same volume.\nResearch indicates that consuming a moderate amount of protein at each meal stimulate muscle protein synthesis more effectively over a 24 hour period than skewing protein intake toward the evening meal.\nIn addition, eating a well balance breakfast consisting of an adequate amount of protein reduces appetite and is associated with a reduced caloric intake over the course of the day.\nConsuming a protein snack such as Greek Yogurt, turkey breast, or low fat chocolate milk or a sports protein supplement before bedtime can also be beneficial. During sleep there is usually a loss of muscle protein as muscle is broken and the amino acids released are converted by the liver to glucose in order to prevent blood glucose from falling. Recent research indicates that taking a protein supplement before bedtime will actually promote protein synthesis while sleeping and increase muscle mass. Moreover, subjects who participated in a 12-week resistance exercise training program and who received a pre-bedtime protein supplement were found to had significantly greater increases in muscle mass and 20% greater increase in total body strength than subjects that received a non-caloric placebo.\nPost exercise is another important time to consume protein. Following a workout, the body is highly sensitive to certain nutrients. Consuming a protein supplement within 30 minutes post exercise has a much greater effect on stimulating muscle protein synthesis than at any other time. This is because after exercise the muscle is better able to take up amino acids from the blood due to an increase in amino acid transporters on the outer membrane of the muscle. Taking up more amino acids, particularly L-leucine, results in a greater activation of muscle protein synthesis. Stimulating protein synthesis post exercise accelerates muscle tissue repair, reduces muscle soreness and increases the rate of training adaptation. For individuals preforming resistance exercise this translates to an increase in muscle mass and strength. For individuals training aerobically, it translates to a greater increase in muscle mitochondria and capillarity.\nType of Protein Post Exercise\nThe type and quantity of protein consumed post exercise is also important. Proteins that are easily digested and high in L-leucine produce the highest rates of protein synthesis. The single best protein for a post workout supplement is whey. In comparison tests against other quality proteins such as soy and casein, whey accelerated protein synthesis significantly faster. However, other vegetable proteins such as pea or rice are also beneficial. The amount of protein required to maximize protein synthesis post exercise is between 20 to 25 grams for adolescents and young adults. For middle aged and older individuals it appears to require as much as 35 to 40 grams of protein. However, it is possible to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis in older individuals with 20 to 25 grams of protein if about 2 to 3 grams of L-leucine is added to the supplement.\nTo summarize, individuals who are physically active, competing in sports or middle-aged or older should increase their daily protein intake to 0.55 to 0.68 g of protein per lb. of body weight. Protein consumption should be evenly distributed across the 3 basic daily meals. Taking a protein snack or supplement containing 20 to 25 grams of protein 30 to 45 minutes before bedtime should also be considered as this will help to limit muscle loss while sleeping. If engaged in a regular exercise-training program, it is important to also consume a post exercise protein supplement as soon after the completion of each exercise session. This will limit muscle damage and soreness, promote muscle protein synthesis and enhance the rate of training adaptation. Protein supplementation post exercise should be about 20 grams for young individuals and 30 to 40 grams for middle-aged and older individuals. The amount of protein post exercise for older individuals can be reduced by adding 2 to 3 grams of L-leucine. If weight reduction is a goal, caloric restriction should be accompanied with an increase in protein consumption. This requires that the percentage of protein in the diet be increased to about 35% of total macronutrients.\nSuggested Daily Protein Consumption\nDistribution of Daily Protein Consumption Based on a 2,500 Caloric Diet with Protein encompassing 30% of the Total Macronutrients:\n- Basic 3 meals of the day\n- Breakfast – 40 grams\n- Lunch – 45 grams\n- Dinner – 55 grams\n- Post Exercise Workout\n- Within 30 minutes post exercise – 25 grams\n- Approximately 30 to 45 minutes before bedtime – 25 grams\nTotal Daily Protein Consumption – 190 grams\n- Beasley JM et al.

40	What significance do the numbers 40 and 22 have when comparing Kraftwerk's 'Autobahn' song length and the standard Top 40 radio format?	Kraftwerk's 'Autobahn' was 22 minutes and 30 seconds long and had to be shortened to 9 minutes for single release, while 'Top 40' was the standard number of songs that a radio station could play in about three hours, becoming the shorthand term for hit-oriented pop music radio in the 1960s.	"['BRIEF OVERVIEW: KRAFTWERK: THE MODERN IGOR STRAVINSKY\nKraftwerk (German for ""power plant""), formerly Organisation, are the fathers of electronica and one of the most important and influential musicians of the 20th century. With many lineups spanning their entire career (typical in rock bands), they started out as a krautrock band before they became experimenal-avant garde and eventually electronic, a journey that would forever impact electronic music.\nEmerging from the experimental rock seeds of German bands Can and Tangerine Dream in the late 60s and educated in the classical music world and diving into the progressive rock era, Florian Schneider Esleben and Ralf Hutter of Dusseldorf, Germany were the principal members of the group, debuting in 1970 with their RCA records album Tone Float under the moniker Organisation. However, album sales flopped, and it wasn\'t before long when they changed their name to Kraftwerk and began to delve more into minimal electronic music, a time when most other artists stayed with their traditional instruments.\nKraftwerk\'s 1970 debut album Kraftwerk 1 really scratched the surface, but it was the 1974 single ""Autobahn"" from the album of the same name that got heads looking their way (by this time, important members Wolfgang Flur and Klaus Roeder joined the duo). A track comprising 22 minutes and 30 seconds, the song had to be shortened down to 9 minutes to be released as a single and the results proved fruitful: an international Top 10 smash. The song became a breakthrough in music history because for one it established a pop-structured electronic song and helped boost their album Autobahn into Top 40 chart success.\n""Autobahn"" paved the way to 1975\'s Radioactivity (boasting the hit single ""Radio-Activity""), Trans-Europe Express (boasting the seminal title track), and their masterpiece, the 1978 album The Man Machine.\nThis particular album was the height of their career in terms of musical performance and was the inspiration for their robotic image which they fully showcased to the public, be it through photo sessions or concerts.\nAfter a nearly three year hiatus from The Man Machine, Kraftwerk came back in 1981 to release Computer World just as the new decade was overtaken by the Electronic a.k.a. Computer Age. Their double single ""Computer Love"" b/w ""The Model"" may have topped the British charts in December of that same year, but the most important song off the album was ""Numbers"" which many songs, including Afrika Bambaataa\'s ""Planet Rock"", sampled from.\nIn 1986, Kraftwerk came back to release Electric Café, an album that fared well in sells. However, the music world was already deeply immersed in electronic music for Kraftwerk to really make any impact or concoct any recording novelties and from their disappeared from the scene.\nBy the late 90s, Kraftwerk began to tour again and worked on new material, releasing their first single in 13 years by the end of 1999 titled ""Expo 2000"". In August 2003, the band released their first album in more than 15 years. Despite the longevity and significance of the band\'s career, Kraftwerk has remained an underrated and underappreciated fixture in music history as a whole. Although some do acknowledge Kraftwerk\'s importance, many can\'t explain how and why they are truly one of music\'s most important artists. They helped make synthesized music mainstream and created the basic foundation for electronica, impacting modern music alongside giants such as Igor Stravinsky. The biggest genres, from rock, rap, R&B, and dance, owe some of their success to these legends.\nKohoutek 7"" single 1973\nTrans Europe Expresss 1977\nMusically, Kraftwerk dealt with postwar European urban life and technology, celebrating (such as in the beautiful track ""Neon Lights"") but at the same time cautioning the world about machinesÕ advantages and disadvantages. Through their lyricism, rhythms, and vocoder-processed voices, they tried to reflect the minimalism and lackluster characteristics of machines into their works. They were one of the several people who predicted that technology would dominate the world and were surely way ahead of their time musically.\nDuring Kraftwerk\'s beginning stages, their music was known as ""techno"" (which the band used for a while) or ""robot pop"". However, purists also called it ""robo sh*t"" or ""noise"", a term that would later affect hip hop and dance/electronica.\nUsing their skills, creativity, and talent, Kraftwerk created a fundamental electronic track with ""Autobahn"". This song incorporated sounds from their drive in an auto-bahn recorded through a microphone which they later synthesized to give their record a more crisp and pleasant sound. Breaking through internationally, this is the song (or one of the songs) that gave dance/electronica its basic structure.\nAlso, another important fundamental electronic track was Hot Butter\'s 1972 summer anthem ""Popcorn"" which also broke through and helped set the basic foundation for electronica. However, Kraftwerk\'s ""Autobahn"" really gave the music more of a strutcture which would virtually rule all of dance/electronica in the coming decades.\nON \'TRANS-EUROPE EXPRESS\'\nAlthough only a moderate hit during its 1977 release, this is still another brilliant record that has stood the test of time. More electronic than ""Auto-Bahn"", this would become one of Kraftwerk\'s most sampled records alongside giants such as ""Numbers"" and ""We Are the Robots"". Afrika Bambaataa and The Soul Sonic Force used the song\'s beat to as the backbone for their hit ""Planet Rock"".\nAnother important and sampled record, ""Numbers"" has also stood the test of time. Afrika Bambaataa also used the beat and certain phrases from the song in ""Planet Rock"".\nHOW ABOUT PINK FLOYD ET AL.?\nYes, there were several other artists in the late 60s and 70s experimenting with electronics such as Yes, Frank Zappa & The Mother\'s Invention, King Crimson, Brian Eno, Jean Michel Jarre, Gary Numan, Emerson, Lake, & Palmer, David Bowie (he even created a tune called ""V-2 Schneider"" in honor of Florian), Genesis, The Grateful Dead, The Beatles (their album Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band contains electronic manipulation and samples), and Pink Floyd (whose influential The Dark Side of the Moon included loops, synthesizers, and sampling), but Kraftwerk was a band that fully dealt with electronics and took it beyond human thought with their skills and music innovation, bridging the classical music of Karlheinz Stockhausen with electronic music and became important avant-garde enthusiasts. Therefore, they are the fathers of dance/electronica.\n(First LP) 1970\nThe Man Machine 1978\nElectric Cafe 1986\nKraftwerk influenced many artists. In the 70s, it was rockers David Bowie, Gary Numan, Giorgio Moroder, and Iggy Pop and DJs such as Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash who played their records before interested black audiences. Later, artists such as Herbie Hanock, The Human League, Depeche Mode, OMD (Orchestral Manouevres in the Dark), Michael Jackson, Whodini, The Balanescu Quartet, New Order, Bauhaus, Throbbing Gristle, and Arthur Baker also began to be influenced by them.\nThe secret to Kraftwerk\'s sound lies in their inspirations from classical composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, rock outfits Tangerine Dream and The Beach Boys, and the influence of Art Deco (a major style/decorative art movement in Europe from the 1920s that particularly affected architechture).\nKraftwerk is the most sampled band of all time with James Brown being the most sampled artist of all time. In artists being sampled as a whole, they\'re still second place to James Brown.\nArtists that sampled Kraftwerk:\nArtists that covered Kraftwerk:\nTour De France\n(We Are) The Robots\nMusique Non Stop\nThe Telephone Call\nThe Fearless 4\nThe Treacherous 3\nDe La Soul\nThe Bloodhound Gang\nBig Audio Dynamite\nMeat Beat Manifesto\nThe 2 Live Crew\nThe Village People\nThe Chemical Brothers\nBalanescu Quartet (classical group)\nOrchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark\nSiouxsie and The Banshees\nTo discuss Kraftwerk with others, sign up for our\nforum and check out the \'Favorite Artists\' section.', '(Pictured: The Beach Boys do a public appearance to promote their latest album, 1979.)\nThe concept of the Top 40 dates back to the early 50s, and the famous epiphany of Todd Storz, who sat in an Omaha restaurant for several hours one night listening to patrons play the same songs on the jukebox over and over. At the end of the night, a waitress went over to the box, put in a couple of coins, and played the same songs she’d been hearing all night long. It dawned on Storz that perhaps his radio station might prosper by concentrating on currently popular songs repeated frequently.\nBy the 1960s, “Top 40” was the shorthand term for hit-oriented pop music radio—a manageable number of songs that a station could turn over entirely in three hours or so—and it stuck until the early 80s, when it was replaced by “contemporary hit radio,” or CHR. If you cruise through the charts at ARSA you’ll see that playlist and/or chart sizes vary widely; some radio stations charted more than 40 songs and some less. But 40 is the number that captures the imagination. And so reaching the Top 40, especially the Top 40 in Billboard magazine, the bible of the recording industry, is an accomplishment.\nAll of this is the introduction to another ongoing series. I’ve done a couple similar series in the past. Down in the Bottom was about the one-hit artists to peak between #90 and #100 in Billboard from 1955 through 1986. Bubbling Under Adventures looked at all of the songs to peak at #101 from 1955 through 1986. The new series that starts today (and which will appear intermittently, whenever I get around to it) will examine every song that spent just a single week in the Top 40 between 1964 and 1986.\nThere about 150 such songs. Almost exactly half came between 1964 and 1969, while the other half came between 1970 and 1986. The year 1964 had the most, with 17, just nosing out 1965 with 16; the fewest came in 1982 and 1986, with only one each. Ten artists have two songs on the list; everybody else has just one. Some of the songs are quite famous despite their relatively low placing on the Hot 100; others have been completely forgotten.\nRather than going through the list in chronological order, we’ll jump around. Let’s start with some of the most famous acts in history.\nThe Beatles are on the list with “I Don’t Want to Spoil the Party,” which appeared in the Top 40 at #39 during the week of March 20, 1965. It needs an asterisk, however: “I Don’t Want to Spoil the Party” is the separately listed B-side of “Eight Days a Week,” which was at #1 for the weeks of March 13 and March 20.\nOn the subject of asterisks, Bill Haley and the Comets’ “Rock Around the Clock,” which had reached #1 in the summer of 1955, returned to the Top 40 for the week of May 25, 1974, hitting #39 thanks to its use as the theme song for the first season of Happy Days. Later that year, the Beach Boys’ “Surfin’ USA,” a #3 hit in 1963, spent the week of September 28 at #36, thanks to its inclusion in the Endless Summer compilation, which would reach #1 on the album chart one week later.\nThe Beach Boys are one of the acts who appear on this list twice. In 1979, “Good Timin’,” from L.A. (Light Album), spent the week of June 9 at #40. It had been sitting in the vaults since 1974 and has those glorious Beach Boys harmonies, but it’s a little sleepy.\nElvis Presley and Bob Dylan are also on the list. The Elvis version of “Until It’s Time for You to Go” spent the week of March 11, 1972, at #40. Written by Buffy Sainte-Marie, “Until It’s Time for You to Go” was covered by a lot of people in the 70s. Versions by Neil Diamond and the R&B group New Birth also made the Hot 100; Glen Campbell, Barbra Streisand, Cher, and others cut it, too. Dylan’s “Subterranean Homesick Blues,” despite being one of his most famous singles, made only #39 for the week of May 15, 1965 (although it went to #6 on the Easy Listening chart).\nIn the next installment: artists whose lone Top 40 hit was their lone Hot 100 hit.']"	['<urn:uuid:bd9df048-d42e-49fb-bae4-9b45109454e4>', '<urn:uuid:3fed004e-43ea-427d-bc78-4d761f0ca6a5>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	22	51	2017
41	I'm planning an event and looking at different venues in Portland - what's the current size of Aura and how much did they expand it from before?	Aura is currently 24,000 SF, having expanded from its original size of 15,000 SF. The expansion was achieved by adding 2.5 stories to the main event space to accommodate a new balcony level.	['Aura, a 24,000 SF concert and event venue in downtown Portland, received a MEREDA Top 10 Notable Project Award at MEREDA’s 2018 Annual Spring Conference in May.\nMEREDA, the Maine Real Estate and Development Association, selects Maine’s Top 10 Notable Projects each year. Selection criteria include the project’s significance, environmental sustainability, economic impact, difficulty of development, energy efficiency, job creation, and uniqueness.\nAura, owned and developed by Tedlum Associates, is the transformation of a 1960s-era nightclub into a sophisticated, high-tech performance venue in the heart of downtown Portland, Maine. The $10 million project was designed by WBRC Architects Engineers and built by Consigli Construction and opened for business in April 2016.\nBackground: After nearly 20 years in business, Aura’s owners wished to expand and modernize its iconic entertainment venue, formerly known as Asylum. This “labor of love” presented many logistical challenges, including a tight urban footprint in a historic district, and the need to fast-track the project to keep staff employed during construction.\nA key project objective was to increase audience capacity. To accomplish this, the existing 15,000 SF building was expanded to 24,000 SF by adding 2.5 stories to the main event space, accommodating a new balcony level. The owners also wished to expand the facility’s appeal for special events. Additions such as two multi-purpose pre-function areas, as well as renovations to the existing sports bar and dance club, make Aura an exciting option for meetings and celebrations.\nAura’s new exterior design grounds the building in traditional masonry and contrasts it with a modern form above. A multi-story curtainwall creates an aperture into the main event space, with additional dazzle from accent lights and color-changeable signage. Inside, design choices across the venue, from floor to ceiling, seating to signage, all work together to help fulfill Aura’s mission: To bring its guests a high-quality user experience and an unmistakable sense of “wow.”\nTo improve the sightlines, the stage was raised four feet and a horseshoe-shaped balcony was added to the upper level. Performer amenities include a new loading dock and lift and VIP suite with a separate entrance.\nPerformance technology is also a major differentiator at Aura. The venue now offers regional audiences state-of-the-art audio, lighting, and video technology, achieved with remarkably little sound emission, through carefully-designed acoustical wall construction, panels, and glazing.\nEnergy efficiency increased significantly at Aura by improving the existing envelope and adding new HVAC systems. The building envelope exceeds the energy code insulation values and utilizes high-performance glazing. Other green design choices include LED lighting throughout, low VOC finishes, zoned heating, and automation of major building systems.\nPrior to Aura’s renovation and expansion, not all areas of the venue were accessible and ADA seating options were less than ideal. Aura is now completely accessible, starting with ground-level entrances and continuing inside to seating, counters, restrooms, and a six-stop elevator.\nThe economic ripple effect of each Aura concert is significant. Direct, indirect and induced purchases including transportation, parking, food, lodging, and additional staff wages all contribute to the positive economic impact of the project. Aura now employs 35-40 professionals serving the company in talent booking, technical support, food and bar service, accounting, and maintenance.\nProject Team: Owners: Tedlum Associates; Design: WBRC Architects Engineers; Construction: Consigli; Brand Consultants: Blaze Partners']	['<urn:uuid:6a8aacbe-4e51-4275-9686-b42c0969008a>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	27	33	542

43	As athletes focused on mental discipline, how do Ven. Em Hong and Yul Moldauer approach their training?	Both emphasize mental and physical discipline in their training. Ven. Em Hong views karate as similar to meditation, helping nourish mind and body, practicing twice daily. Moldauer approaches gymnastics with a focused mindset, ignoring distractions and negative energy, emphasizing the importance of mental preparation while maintaining intense physical training schedules.	['Cambodian monk with a penchant for Karate\nBy Ravi Nagahawatte, The Ntion (Sri Lanka), 25 November 2012\nColombo, Sri Lanka -- Relationship between Cambodia and Sri Lanka from Buddhist perspective runs into several centuries. Sri Lanka has been a great influence on Cambodia, especially because the island’s Buddhist monks have made a huge contribution towards establishing the religion in this South East Asian country.\n<< Ven. Em.Hong - “Karate is similar to meditation and helps nourish mind and body.” Pic by Ravi Nagahawatte\nOver the years Sri Lanka has been witnessing a steady flow in the arrival of Buddhist monks from Cambodia. All of them are here to study Buddhism. But The Nation caught up with one monk who is a little different from the others. He allocates some time each day to learn karate when he is not studying Dhamma.\nA 27-year-old Cambodian monk, Ven. Em Hong is here to finish his degree in Buddhism. He arrived in Sri Lanka in 2010 with the blessings of his parents, both farmers. He told this writer that he wanted to continue his higher studies and that his entering priesthood presented him with ample opportunities to follow his dream.\n“Back in Cambodia, life is hectic and people are exhausted when they return home after work, hence devoting time for studies is out,” said Ven. Hong and added, “I hate the hectic lifestyle back in Cambodia.”His wish is to finish his degree here in Sri Lanka and return to Cambodia. But there will be a huge change in his choice of lifestyle in the future. He wants to become a layman again.\n“After finishing my studies, I will continue being a priest for a few more years before I disrobe. The final goal is to be a teacher and serve the community. The years I spend in learning the Dhamma as a priest will help me step into society as a good layman,” he affirmed.Before becoming a priest, Ven. Hong was an English teacher in Cambodia. He seemed not to impose restrictions upon himself when talking about education in Cambodia. “It’s not the country for studies. There are so many negativities,” he stressed.\nNevertheless, he was quick to point out that he enjoyed the freedom experienced by monks in Sri Lanka compared to the strict lifestyles led by Cambodian monks. “Back in my country I wouldn’t have been allowed to practice karate as a monk,” he said.He is one of the most promising students in the Toyo Kai Karate Federation of Sri Lanka (Situated in Nugegoda) and has excelled in all grading tests since he joined the class three years ago. “I practice karate twice a day. Thanks to the healthy lifestyle I lead I can’t remember the day I last fell ill. Karate is similar to meditation and helps nourish mind and body,” explained Ven. Hong who sports a brown belt in Karate.\nThough he is a monk he doesn’t impose restrictions on his diet because he believes serious sport demands solid nutrition. He lives the life of a monk as much as possible and survives on two meals a day. When he arrived in Sri Lanka he lived in a temple in Homagama. But now he lives in a rented room in Pitipana and the rental expense is borne by the Association of Cambodian Buddhist Monks in Sri Lanka.\nHe brings up the topic of Buddhism when he is with his karate friends and teaches them vital lessons. Ven, Hong says he loves philosophy too.From his talk and approach to the Buddhist way of living one can realize that he is putting all he has in reaching his potential as a human being. “I believe the eight-fold path taught by Lord Buddha is the way forward. You do good, you get good,” he said.Like Sri Lanka was terrorized by Tiger rebels, Cambodia too experienced a dark period when the Khmer Rouge troops reigned supreme. “Buddhism can help promote peace in all countries,” concluded Ven. Hong.', 'Yul Moldauer realizes his Olympic ambition with strategy and attitude | By Martha Vickery (Summer 2021 issue)\n“The 24-year-old was the only national title winner not named Mikulak between 2013 and this year,” one story declared, referring to Moldauer’s USA Olympic teammate Sam Mikulak, who with Brody Malone and Shane Wiskus competed this summer in the (late) 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\nThe one-year-late Olympics means the Paris 2024 summer Olympic Games are only three years away, instead of four, a fact that Moldauer considers with optimism now that the Tokyo Games are in the rear-view mirror.\nStarting gymnastics at age seven, because his parents wanted a way for him to channel his abundant energy, Moldauer, a Korean adoptee, soon became a child gymnast. Then, he became a teen rising star in the sport. At age 16, he advanced to the U.S. Junior National team and got gold at the 2013 International Junior Mexican Cup.\nAt the University of Oklahoma, which has a top-ranked gymnastics program, he won the All-Around category at the National College Athletics Association (NCAA) Championships as a freshman. After that, he led Oklahoma to three straight national team titles and earned seven individual titles. In 2017, he took the U.S. Championships by winning the all-around title, and was a bronze medalist in the floor exercise.\nIn June 2021, he got the second-best overall score at the U.S. Olympic Gymnastics Team Trials, which automatically put him on the team.\nThe NBC Sports videos of Moldauer’s June Olympic Trials are a fun watch. Moldauer is all showmanship after each event, letting off a roar and a few claps and fist pumps, releasing clouds of chalk dust into the air. “He is a sticking machine,” one of the commentators says of his consistent ability to land a jump solidly on both feet. “Oh, come on!” the other commentator yells in disbelief as Moldauer soars over the vault, and flawlessly sticks the landing facing backwards.\n“You are a madman, dude,” his teammate Sam Mikulak tells him, while high-fiving after Moldauer aces his elaborate and difficult ring routine.\nMikulak had to be talking about his teammate’s showmanship, not his personality. In a career that has a short window of time, going from International Junior champion to Olympic Trials in eight years is not a madman’s pace in the scheme of things. It is more like an uphill journey for this persistent and talented athlete who is now at the top of his career.\nThe men’s team acquitted itself excellently, although it did not return from the Tokyo Olympics with a medal. The team came in fifth; Russia (or Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) as it is referred to in the scorecards) got gold, Japan silver, and China bronze. Within about a point in the overall score were Great Britain fourth, and U.S. fifth. Moldauer contributed the second-highest overall point score for the U.S. men behind Mikulak.\nThe hard worker\nIn conversation, Moldauer is a rather serious and soft-spoken type, quite different than his stage persona. He describes his life in terms of personal best, and games of inches, the reality he has inhabited as a high school and college top-ranked athlete. During the six years between age 18 and the July Olympic games, his energy has been focused on getting himself to the Tokyo Olympics.\nPeople always said to him ‘you could go far in this sport,’ he said, but it took awhile to see it on the horizon. “When I was about 10, I watched my teammate Alexander Artemev compete in the Olympics where they won a bronze medal, and I remember …saying to myself that I wanted to do that one day.” At age 18, he said, it began to look like it could happen.\nIn 2016, Moldauer went to the Olympic trials as a sophomore in college, probably the youngest contestant there, he guessed. That experience reinforced his dream. “I remember telling myself that I wanted to be a person actually contending to be on the team, not just a kid trying to get the experience.”\nAnd then, he said, “there’s a certain time period where you figure you really need to work hard. You think ‘this is my chance. I’m going to do everything I can.’” That happened in the last couple years leading up to the Tokyo Olympics. But there were bumps and swerves along the road to get there.\nEmbrace the grind\nMoldauer’s favorite expression is “Embrace the grind.” That says a lot about the reality of being at the top of a sport. There is fun teamwork involved, and moments of excitement. There are also plenty of long days of grinding away at strength training, cardio training, and practicing the same move over and over again. There are exciting things going on – activities with friends, events, staying out late — that athletes have to pass up. The work becomes too demanding to spend time on other things. In addition to workouts, sleep, food, hydration, and rehabbing the body from small injuries are all part of the workload.\n“We have no off season,” Moldauer said. “Summer can be even more difficult than the competition season. You are conditioning more, you are trying new skills, you have to keep your endurance up. It is like playing a chess game. What move are you going to take to win this game?”\nGymnastics in the time of pandemic\nAs soon as he heard the gyms would shut down, Moldauer was texting his coach at the University of Oklahoma. “I asked if I could grab some stuff from the gym — a set of weights and some parallettes [portable parallel bars used for training],” he said, “and I said by the way, I need a [pommel] horse in my garage – just jokingly.” His coach was also doing some creative problem solving. “A couple days later, he texted and said ‘I know a guy willing to loan you a horse for your garage.’”\nFor three or four months, Moldauer trained full time in his garage. “It got pretty cool. I got some eye hooks and screwed them into the ceiling, put in a set of rings so I could do ring strength.” At the same time, he said, the Air Track company sent him an inflatable gymnastics tumbling strip, and he set up a tumbling run on his front lawn. A video company, Sideline Scout, “actually came to my house and let us use their video replay system” so he could watch his form on video.\nHe moved permanently from Oklahoma to Denver and joined the 5280 Gym in Wheatridge, Colorado. Being at home helped a lot over the past year. He worked on his routines without distractions.\nAfter he got back into the gym, he said, “there were times the schedule was super-hard, because of all the time I took off. They say if you take one day off in gymnastics, it takes two days to get back,” he said, which he found to be true. “I had to change gyms, change coaches, move states, so it was a pretty packed year for me.”\nThere were certain things he could practice in his garage gym, but many things he could not do. Doing moves on a portable inflatable mat was one of those things. The air mat won’t hurt your body like a hard floor, so it can be a useful tool, he said, “but going onto a real hard surface and doing handsprings is a lot different, and a lot different on your joints.” Back on the gymnastics floor, he said “I felt like I was playing catch-up, and I was sore all the time, at some points I had minor little injuries, that I knew was just part of the training.”\nThe trial of a lifetime\nCrunch time was the Olympic trials in June. “I think the Olympic trials can in some sense be harder than the Olympics themselves,” he said. It is a make-it-or-break-it moment for every gymnast – a few will make the team, and the rest will not. “There are no second chances,” he said, and not getting on the team could mean waiting another four years. Depending on the gymnast’s age, that competition may be the last Olympic trial they ever do.\nAt the Olympics, he said, “you’re stressed and nervous, but it is a different type.” The big difference – you are actually at the Olympics, he said. “It was a huge honor to represent the country at the Olympics and it was a huge honor to be on the team,” he said. He felt a lot of joy and wonder, and all the restrictions and protocols did not dent his mood at all, he said.\nMoldauer talks a lot like a coach. He is his own coach in his head, he said, but his teammates often tell him he talks coach language, he said. “When I am in the gym, I give my teammates corrections and ask them how they are feeling. And I try to feel what they’re feeling, and try to give my sense of their words to help them,” he said, “so I guess I am kind of like a coach, but I just want to be a good teammate who helps their teammates get better.”\nHis self-talk about getting to the Olympics went something like this: “You can’t let the distractions overwhelm you,” he said. “You can’t let the name of the competition get to your head. At the end of the day, whether it is world championships, the Olympic Games or just another home meet, you gotta go in there with a purpose. The more you go to every meet with a purpose, instead of just for the competition name, that’s when you start doing a lot better as a\nMoldauer makes sure he is ready, he said, and then he lets the distractions just fall away. When he got ready to go to Tokyo, well-meaning people peppered him with questions like “Are you nervous?” and “It’s your one chance in four years,” he recalled, “and for me it doesn’t matter. As an athlete you are always going to have to go through situations that are unusual, and situations that you have to rise to.” It’s all part of being a competitor. “At the end of the day, that’s who I want to be, that athlete that looks at a competition and is not afraid. I want to be an athlete that takes on what other people might be scared of, and see it in a different perspective.\n“Yeah, I know the games come only every four years. Everyone hears that at every Olympic games. But why focus on that? You’ve worked for years, probably the hardest you ever worked, so this is the time to show it off.”\nIgnoring the negatives\nMoldauer said his philosophy for any competition is to “put on a show.” Why not enjoy it? “You know, you train seven hours a day. I often wake up sore. I have to follow a diet. I have to separate myself from decisions that take me away, like skiing or maybe it’s not a good idea to go hang out with my friends this weekend. I have to make these crucial decisions because of my sport, and this is my time to show off how hard I work, and all the effort I’ve put in, so I never\nfocus on the negative stuff.”\nThere were many negatives to deal with at the Olympics, and in terms of the year leading up to the Olympics, for all of the athletes. People talked about it having to stay in their rooms all the time they were not at practice or at some other required activity. They talked about having to take a COVID test every 12 hours.\nMoldauer said he just blew it off. In self-talk style, he said “Yes, there are going to be protocols, yes, there are going to be circumstances not usual to the normal Olympic games, but you’re going, and that should be enough for anything that comes your way. …I just told myself ‘look this is the Olympic games. I don’t care what I have to do. This is my time to show the world why I’m here.’”\nThe team moved around as a self-contained pod. “We couldn’t do a lot. That’s why it was nice to have great teammates there. We really entertained each other. …We would all Facetime or snapchat or play video games in one room, so we wouldn’t be bored.”\nMoldauer is into the showmanship of being in front of a big stadium crowd. Not having that experience at the biggest event of his life could have been a disappointment. “It wasn’t disappointing!” he insisted. “I just accepted it! It motivated me for Paris. I want to make the  Paris team so hopefully by then everything will be normal and we’ll get to really enjoy the Olympics. It’s just three years,” he said, “which is good.”\nThe new focus on mental health\nOlympic tennis player Naomi Osaka refused the press conferences, and then stepped out of the Olympic trials in the spring citing a need to protect her mental health. After that, gymnast Simone Biles stepped aside in mid-competition, saying she was not mentally prepared to compete. Both of these incidents caused public reaction across the spectrum, from vilification to total support.\nMoldauer said he felt his duty was to try to understand the position of the athletes, and support them. He felt special empathy for Biles. “Simone has done so much for the United States and gymnastics, and it surprised me to see all the hard comments about her just because she pulled out.” The pressure of comments about her on social media, the pressure of preparation, the extra year of waiting for the Games, the long and lonely hours in the gym – she was facing it all at the same time. “Just, as a normal person, these past two years have sucked mentally for everyone. It has been draining. Imagine what Simone has been going through on top of what everyone else has been dealing with?” he said.\nIn fact, her awareness about her own mental state may have upped the team’s chances too, he said. “What if Simone went in and fell a couple more times? I don’t think they would have been on the podium.”\nAs for the fickle beast of social media, Moldauer said he lives with it, and frequently ignores it, for his own mental health reasons. “People can be so nice on there, and in one second, they can be so mean. If I get a rude comment, I don’t even look at it. If people are going to think that way, they’re just going to do it. But I am not going to put anything into this negative energy. I’m just going to keep doing my thing. People can say whatever they want, but the real followers will always follow me.”\nThe adoptee perspective\nAs a Korean adoptee, Moldauer said, he thinks often about where he ended up, and stereotype of the driven, achieving Type A Korean adoptee. He’s not sure exactly what drives him, but “yes, I think what helps motivate me is about my parents, and that they gave me a second chance in life.” He wonders sometimes what would have happened if he would have been adopted by a different family, one that didn’t raise him to be an independent thinker or weren’t supportive of him following his dream. “It plays a role in the fun I have in this sport. I know that if I was not adopted or if I was not adopted in the right family, maybe would not be doing gymnastics at all.” A diverse group of athletes got on the teams of various countries for the 2020 Olympics, Moldauer said, which was validating. “You don’t have to look a certain way to represent a country,” he said. Countries are showing by the athletes they are sending that they are sending the people they want to do the job.\nMoldauer’s family, and his entire gym got up at 4 a.m. to watch the USA men compete. The Olympics channel showed it all in real time. His phone started blowing up with photos and snapchats. It reminded him, he said, that in gymnastics “you can never say you did anything alone. When you take a step back, you can see all the people that helped you.” Moldauer thinks his own example to model is not the typical athlete who gets to the Olympics, but the unlikely one. “I hope it shows anyone who has a dream, but who feels that they can’t do it because they come from somewhere , or look some way – that none of that is true. You have to take on the journey, and embrace the grind, and work hard, and you never know – your dreams might come true.”\nFor the next three years, Moldauer will be in his hometown of Arvada, Colorado, embracing the grind at 5280 Gymnastics. His goal will be to ace the Olympic trials a second time, and make the Paris team, hopefully with some of the same 2020 teammates, but it could be a different group. The team talked about their goals after Tokyo – they’re in it to win it. “The younger guys on the team are really motivated to get the team on the podium this next quad,” he said. “We want to be contenders. We don’t want to be fourth or fifth place, and we talked about what we have to do\nand I think we are all really determined to be there.”\nYul Moldauer has his own website (complete with crowd roars) at: yulmoldauer.com']	['<urn:uuid:42438afb-329d-478b-bd70-30c38edfc819>', '<urn:uuid:5c11ea2e-5baa-4e8a-a054-7388b678137f>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	17	50	3630
44	For my research on sustainability - which sector uses most water?	Agriculture looks set to remain the biggest user of water into the middle of this century.	"['The water-food-energy nexus is central to sustainable development. Demand for all three is increasing, driven by a rising global population, rapid urbanization, changing diets and economic growth. Agriculture is the largest consumer of the world’s freshwater resources, and more than one-quarter of the energy used globally is expended on food production and supply.The inextricable linkages between these critical domains require a suitably integrated approach to ensuring water and food security, and sustainable agriculture and energy production worldwide.\nRising demandWater is a finite resource having to serve exponentially more people and usages, and so ensuring everyone has access to a reliable supply is crucial to human survival and sustainable progress.As water resources become more stretched, the energy and food sectors’ dependence on water, and the fact that all three underpin several of the Sustainable Development Goals, means that decision-makers in all three domains are now increasingly focusing on water resource management, ecosystem protection and water supply and sanitation as part of their policy and practice. 2011 celebrations of the birth of the 7th billionth baby. UN projects world population to reach 8.5 billion by 2030. UN Photo/Eskinder Debebe Wind energy windmills near highway and sea shore.\nEnergy mixFossil fuel production, still a dominant and growing part of the global energy mix, is highly water intensive, as is biofuel production and the growing practice of shale gas extraction – or ‘fracking’. There will need to be much more support for the development of less water-intensive renewable energy, such as hydropower and wind, before it makes a significant impact on water demand. For instance, geothermal energy has great potential as a long-term, climate independent resource that produces little or no greenhouse gases and does not consume water.\nAgriculture looks set to remain the biggest user of water into the middle of this century.\nAgricultural efficiencyAgriculture looks set to remain the biggest user of water into the middle of this century. While the shift to biofuels is generally welcomed, their production could demand as much water as fossil fuels. In terms of food, the volume of demand is growing with population expansion, and we are seeing a significant global move away from a mainly starch-based diet to an increasing demand for more water-intensive meat and dairy as incomes grow in many countries.Efficiency measures along the entire agrifood chain can help save water and energy, such as precision irrigation based on information supplied by water providers, which can motivate farmers to invest in their systems to ensure the best returns from their water investment.

45	How do UV rays affect both safety glasses and car headlight covers, and what protective measures can be taken for both?	UV rays can affect both safety glasses and car headlight covers significantly. For car headlights, UV rays cause a chemical reaction with the plastic cover that leads to dimming and hazing over time. For safety glasses, photochromic lenses (which react to UV light) can be used in industrial settings, but they only change color when exposed to natural UV light, not indoor lighting. To protect against UV damage, car headlight covers can be treated with UV sealant, clear coat, or wax as preventative measures. For safety eyewear, proper maintenance is crucial - this includes regular cleaning, proper storage in a clean dry place, and replacing damaged parts with identical components from the original manufacturer to maintain safety ratings.	"[""Ask an Optician\nWhat does an optician do?\nAn optician fits eyeglasses and contact lenses. They analyze and interpret prescriptions written by ophthalmologists or optometrists to determine which eyeglasses are best suited to the patient's lifestyle and visual needs. They take eye measurements to insure proper lens placement in the eyeglasses' frame and verify the accuracy of the finished product. They may manufacture (grind) lenses from raw materials and cut them to fit into the frame.\nWhy are safety eyewear fittings important?\nProper fit ensures maximum eye protection. Safety glasses should rest firmly on top of the nose and close to, but not against, the face. If the glass slides down even a small amount, the user will lose some protection. Your safety glasses have a three-point fit, meaning the frame should touch the face in three places - at the nose bridge and behind each ear. Temples should wrap around the head, with slight pressure behind the ear, not above the ear.\nWhy are my safety glasses fogging up?\nTypically, your safety glasses fog up when they are exposed to an extreme variation in temperature or humidity - like when someone drives a forklift from inside a warm factory out on the loading dock in the winter. But it can also happen when you're working hard physically and your body temperature rises compared to the air around you. This can be avoided by treating your safety eyewear with an anti-fog coating.\nWill safety eyewear weaken or ruin my eyesight?\nNo. If you do not wear prescription glasses, safety eyewear is no different than wearing non-prescription sunglasses. And if you do wear glasses, safety eyewear can be made to your prescription.\nCan contact lenses be worn at work?\nContacts can be worn in conjunction with non-prescription safety eyewear.\nHow should I maintain my protective eyewear?\n- Clean your safety glasses daily. Follow the manufacturer's instructions. Avoid rough handling that can scratch lenses.\n- Store your safety glasses in a clean, dry place where they cannot fall or be stepped on. Keep them in a case when they are not being worn.\n- Replace scratched, pitted, broken, bent or ill-fitting glasses. Damaged glasses interfere with vision and do not provide protection.\n- Replace damaged parts only with identical parts from the original manufacturer to ensure the same safety rating.\nCan my protective eyewear be sterilized?\nYes. An ultraviolet light sterilizer is the simplest way to sterilize them.\nI have a smaller head; can I still wear any style of frame? Or should I avoid certain ones?\nThere are hundreds of prescription safety frames available. It is important that you have a good fit and a safety frame that can carry your particular prescription. The type of work and environment can also dictate which frame style would be your best choice.\nMy nose has a small bridge. Can you help me find the right safety eyewear for me?\nYes, it is very important that the frame fits properly on your bridge. With adjustable nose pads and proper adjustments, most frames can accommodate a person with a small bridge.\nCan photochromic lenses be worn in an industrial environment?\nYes, sunsensor or photochromatic can be worn in the industrial environment. Lenses can now be made in polycarbonate or industrial strength material for use in an industrial setting. You need to keep in mind that sunsensor or photochromatic lenses are activated by UV or the sun. The lenses will not change inside without natural light.\nGot a question of your own?

even if the dimness isn’t severe, the fact that you’re experiencing dimness at all is a clear warning sign that your headlights are in need of a good cleaning.\nyour headlights will accumulate dirt and grime as you operate your vehicle on a daily basis. the change is usually very gradual, but over time your headlights will begin to dim, and before you know it you’ll begin to notice a physical difference in headlight intensity.\ndim lighting typically occurs for two reasons:\n- the dust and grime you pick up from regular wear and tear.\n- the chemical reaction that occurs from the plastic on your headlight cover reacting to uv rays.\nwhy cleaning your headlights is so important\nimagine driving at night. the road is dark, and it’s difficult to see. you throw on your hi-beams to illuminate the road and realize that the light is so dim and foggy that you can barely see a few feet in front of you. it would be frightening if something were to jump out at you in those conditions. it would be even more frightening to hit another car because you couldn’t see where you were going.\nthis is why cleaning your headlights is important. the better you can see, the less likely you’ll get into an accident. with that being said, let’s jump into how to clean your car’s headlight covers properly. we’ll talk about how to properly prep, what products you’ll need, and the actual process of cleaning your headlights.\nbefore you really get in there to give your headlight cover a truly thorough detailing, you should begin with a good prewash. spray down your headlights (and likely the front of the car while you’re at it) and wash away the excess muck and other debris covering your headlights.\nduring this phase, you should clean both the surrounding panels as well as the headlights themselves. after you’ve washed the appropriate\nzones, dry the vehicle until you’ve eliminated every droplet of water.\nonce you’ve cleaned and dried the front of your car, proceed to tape the perimeter of the headlights. painter’s tape will do just fine. essentially you’re looking for something that isn’t too sticky (like duct tape). trace the perimeter of the headlight, avoiding any\nzones you intend to polish.\nkeep in mind that cleaning your turn signals are optional. your turn signals are typically yellow and don’t haze nearly as quickly as your clear headlights. protect any\nzones that you don’t wish to be damaged as you proceed to the polishing phase.\ndifferent ways of cleaning your headlight covers\nit might come as a surprise that one of the easiest and cheapest ways to go about cleaning your headlight covers is to use toothpaste. toothpaste is a light abrasive. thus it’s great at cleaning up any debris that may be sitting on the surface area that you’ll be cleaning.\nfirst, spread the toothpaste over the entire length of the headlight cover using a washcloth. then rinse it off and dry thoroughly. that’ll definitely get the job done, and it’ll save you a ton of money. toothpaste can be found at your local 99 cents store for less than a dollar.\navoid toothpaste with any sort of abrasive material within, such as crystals and cooling beads as this could lead to potential scratching.\nsoap, sandpaper, and polish\nthis step is a bit more expensive than using toothpaste, but it certainly gets the job done. first, use some elbow grease and get rid of as much buildup as possible using soap and water. you’ll basically be cleaning up anything you’ve missed with the initial prewash.\ndry very thoroughly and then use sandpaper to get the gunk that’s really stuck in there. the best sandpaper to use is 400 or 800 grit. after initially sanding down your headlight cover, go back over the same surface with finer sandpaper. afterward, polish until it’s clear as possible. you can either use toothpaste again, or you can go for a commercial polish that you can buy at your local automotive store.\nif you’re willing to spend the money, you could always stock up on commercial cleaning solutions. this is the most expensive method, though it typically brings the peace of mind that your headlights will shine sparkling clear when you’re finished with your detailing job.\nthere are numerous cleaning commercial products out there that all pretty much do the same thing. most headlight commercial cleaning solutions are fairly affordable. despite being the more expensive option, commercial products work just as good as tooth paste or soap and water.\nkeeping your headlights clean with preventative care\nat this point, your headlights should be clean and looking as good as new. hooray! but how do you stop your headlights from getting dirty all over again? preventative care is just as important as the act of cleaning.\nthere are three products you can use to keep your headlights clean for the long term:\nthese products will form a shield that protects your headlights from the harmful effects of uv rays.\nonce you see that your headlight covers are getting dirty again, don’t wait until the situation gets critical. clean them quickly. with constant upkeep and preventative products in place, your headlights will look like new every day.\nfeatured image credit: mikesphotos / pixabay\nin post image credit: sasint / pixabay""]"	['<urn:uuid:ab313412-133b-4ff1-9517-03849329c8ef>', '<urn:uuid:a3288f10-8b0d-40bf-9583-c481b646c79d>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	21	118	1514
46	As a music historian researching the relationship between Di Vittorio and Respighi's work, what significant contribution did Di Vittorio make to Respighi's unfinished compositions?	Di Vittorio completed Respighi's first Violin Concerto (in A) and other works upon invitation from Respighi's great nieces Elsa and Gloria Pizzoli and archive curator Potito Pedarra.	['Music Director & Composer\nSALVATORE DI VITTORIO\nBorn in Palermo, Italy, composer and conductor Salvatore Di Vittorio is heir to the Italian neo-classical orchestral tradition, “following in the footsteps of Ottorino Respighi” – Luigi Verdi, Philharmonic Academy of Bologna. He gained considerable attention with his completion of the first Violin Concerto (in A) and other works of Respighi by invitation of his great nieces Elsa and Gloria Pizzoli and archive curator Potito Pedarra.\nDi Vittorio is founding Music Director of Chamber Orchestra of New York, which debuted in 2007 at Carnegie Hall’s Zankel Hall. His Naxos recordings with the orchestra continue to air worldwide, receiving much critical praise. He has worked with numerous orchestras, including San Diego Symphony, Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia, Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana, and Teatro Massimo Opera Palermo.\nDi Vittorio is fascinated with the world of storytelling and best known for his lyrical symphonic poems, including program symphonies, which are often inspired by classical antiquity and show connections to the Italian Renaissance and Baroque. Under his baton, Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia world premiered his Ode Corelliana in 2017, after the successful premiere of Venus and Adonis in 2016. “Di Vittorio’s Venus was an orchestral song, and often a beautiful one.” – Philadelphia Inquirer. “Venus…recalls Respighi, and is infused with Di Vittorio’s original imagination and ability to build musical architecture that ultimately fades, like Venus’s own loveliness. There is an appealing heft to this work [influenced by] Bach and Ravel.” – Broad Street Review. In 2015, San Diego Symphony world premiered his orchestral Fanfara del Mare “Su un Tema di Monteverdi”, commissioned for the centennial of Balboa Park at Copley Symphony Hall.\nIn 2012, Di Vittorio made his conducting debut with Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana at Teatro Politeama Garibaldi. Giornale di Sicilia praised the evening “From Pines of Rome to the Temples of Sicily”, depicting Di Vittorio’s third symphony as “a commemorative memorial with a dimension of insularity, which during great peaks reveals suggestions of an international musical palette.” La Repubblica acknowledged Di Vittorio’s neo-classical works and in particular his third symphony, as “his first composition to capture Respighi’s impressionism, together with [influences of] Berlioz and Richard Strauss.” Mayor Leoluca Orlando awarded Di Vittorio the Medal of Palermo, recognizing “the great importance of Di Vittorio’s work as a promoter of Palermo around the world” – Il Moderatore.\nDi Vittorio began his musical studies at an early age with his father Giuseppe, who introduced the operas of Verdi and Puccini. He studied composition with Giampaolo Bracali (later, conducting) and Ludmila Ulehla at Manhattan School of Music, and philosophy at Columbia University. He is a protégé of such esteemed conductors as Piero Bellugi (of Florence). His compositions are published by Panastudio/Casa Ricordi (Universal Music), recorded on Naxos Records, and listed in David Daniels’ Orchestral Music. With La Villa d’Este a Tivoli in 2016, Di Vittorio reached a significant milestone when he became the first composer to dedicate a work to The Morgan Library & Museum, and the first Italian composer during his lifetime to be invited to donate an autograph manuscript to the museum’s world-renowned music archive – followed in 2019, by donations of manuscripts of his completions of Respighi’s Violin Concerto in A and Tre Liriche.']	['<urn:uuid:77e9e1ca-4f8d-47b5-9ff5-be475a37726b>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	24	27	535
47	new to fishing which line has less visibility underwater braided or fluorocarbon	Fluorocarbon has less visibility underwater compared to braided line. This is because fluorocarbon's refractive index is almost the same as water, making it nearly invisible underwater. While braided line is stronger and thinner, it doesn't offer the same level of invisibility as fluorocarbon.	['Bass fishing without a leader can be a great way to catch some large bass. There are some important things you should know about this type of fishing, including the types of line you should use.\nOne of the most popular lines for bass fishing is fluorocarbon. This line provides the perfect balance of strength, low stretch, and line sensitivity. Fluorocarbon line is also abrasion resistant. It’s the perfect line for finesse rigs and slow rolling magnum-sized spinnerbaits.\nDespite its benefits, there are also disadvantages to using a fluorocarbon fishing line. First, it’s much harder to see than monofilament line. Second, it’s more expensive. Third, the abrasion resistance isn’t as good. The abrasion resistance is the ability of a line to resist damage from friction.\nAnother disadvantage is the amount of stretch. Compared to monofilament line, fluorocarbon is much stiffer. That can be a plus or a minus depending on how you intend to use it.\nAside from its stiffness, fluorocarbon is also abrasion resistant. So if you plan to fish in a harsh environment, this is probably one of the best options.\nAlthough fluorocarbon fishing line is tough, it does have some knot issues. In order to prevent line damage, wet the knots before tying them.\nSingle-strand wire is the oldest form of fishing wire. Although it has its flaws, it is still the preferred choice of most experienced anglers. It has several advantages that other wires do not.\nThe first and simplest advantage of using single-strand wire is that it doesn’t get tangled in your hook during casting. Unlike other forms of wire, it is also very easy to work with and has a very low tendency to break. Another advantage of the wire is that it is available in a variety of colors and sizes.\nWire can be used for many different fishing situations. For example, there are various types of wire leaders that are sold. Some of these are made of fluorocarbon, which is a material that is less visible in water, as well as strong. However, they can be expensive.\nOther wire materials include braided and monofilament. Braided wire is tougher than monofilament and is more expensive. To tie braided wire, you’ll need quality wire snips.\nSwivels can make a big difference in the way your lure performs in the water. They also provide you with a break-off point.\nSwivels come in several different sizes. For general saltwater use, a swivel rated between #1 and 2/0 should be used. The larger the swivel, the heavier the weight that it can support. Using a heavy swivel can allow you to cast bigger and heavier lures.\nSome fishermen find swivels to be a nuisance. They get jammed in rod guides. This can cause lost fish. Another concern is that a swivel can spook a finicky fish.\nSnap swivels are another option for those who do not like swivels. These are also used to connect the hook to the line. However, snap swivels are not recommended for tournaments or casting. A snap swivel can add “stuff” to the line and spook a fish.\nIf you are not sure whether you need a swivel, you should ask an experienced angler for advice. When fishing in rough waters, swivels are a must.\nMonofilament is the most common material used for bass fishing leaders. It’s easy to work with, has a wide range of stretch, and is relatively inexpensive. However, it’s also susceptible to abrasion damage, and it’s not designed to float.\nBraided wire is a more expensive option. While it’s tougher and more abrasion resistant, it’s not as strong or transparent as monofilament. Plus, braided fishing lines can be easily snagged in water.\nFluorocarbon is another material that is popular for bass fishing leaders. This material is made of carbon molecules and resists sunlight and harsh chemicals. The refractive index of fluorocarbon is almost the same as that of water.\nAlthough both materials are great for bass fishing, there are some major advantages and disadvantages. When choosing a leader for your line, consider how clear the water is and what kinds of fish you’ll be targeting.\nFor example, if you’re going to be casting a jerkbait into a hole, you need a leader that’s heavy enough to prevent bites. Also, you’ll need one that’s durable enough to withstand sharp teeth.', 'Choosing the right fishing line\nFew aspects of bass fishing have changed more rapidly, or more dramatically, in recent years than the development of new fishing lines. Now, anglers are faced not only with choosing which strength of line the need but also which type of line.\n“Each type of line we use today, braid, fluorocarbon or monofilament, has both advantages and disadvantages,” explained veteran tournament pro Terry Scroggins, who’s been climbing the line-learning curve since he began fishing braids more than a decade ago. “For example, fluorocarbon is nearly invisible underwater and has less stretch than monofilament, and braid has a very thin diameter and extra strength, but virtually no stretch.\n“I believe every bass fisherman has to look at his own style of fishing and the conditions he’s actually facing, and then choose a line that best meets those conditions. The chances are, if you fish very often with several different techniques, you’re going to use all three types of lines.”\nScroggins uses all three, on occasion he combines braid with either a monofilament or fluorocarbon leader to suit the technique he’s using. Here’s how he rigs his rods for a variety of different lures and presentations:\nTopwaters – “Being from Florida, I have always fished a lot of prop baits like a Devils Horse and Boy Howdy, and for these types of lures I prefer 40 pound braid with a four to five foot leader of 15 pound monofilament.\n“Monofilament floats, and with prop baits we often use a very slow presentation during which the lure may sit motionless on the surface for 15 or 20 seconds, so a floating line gives the lures better action. The stretch in the mono also acts as a type of shock absorber for the non-stretching braid.”\nLipless Crankbaits – “I prefer 40 pound braid with a four- to five-foot leader of 15 to 17-pound fluorocarbon. “That’s because I frequently use these lures over hydrilla or milfoil, and many strikes come when you rip the bait out of that vegetation. The fluorocarbon has very little stretch and recovers quickly, while the braid helps cut through the grass.\n“I use the same combination when I’m yo-yoing these lures. Strikes come as the bait is falling, and the braid gives you instant hook-setting; you almost never lose a bass this way.”\nDeep Crankbaiting – “Here I use 10-pound monofilament. It’s strong enough to handle big bass, and the small line diameter allows the lure to reach maximum depth. It has just enough stretch to let the fish engulf the lure for a good hook-set, too.\n“Remember, we used monofilament for years before braids and fluorocarbons were developed, and we caught a lot of bass with it. There are still applications where I think mono out-performs these other lines. Some pros will use fluorocarbon line for deep cranking, but I like mono.”\nFlipping – “When I’m flipping, I use the ‘¾-ounce rule’. If I’m using a ¾-ounce or lighter sinker, it generally means the cover I’m fishing is not very thick nor is it very deep, so I’ll normally use 20-pound or heavier fluorocarbon for its strength and lack of stretch.\n“If I’m fishing slightly deeper and heavier cover, I’ll use 40-pound braid without a leader. Even in the clear water of a lake like Amistad, I’ll use braid because the fish are deeper in submerged timber and I need the strength of braid to get them out.”\nSpinnerbaits – “Depending on the type of cover, I’ll use 14- to 20-pound fluorocarbon. Because I’m in tight contact with the lure, I don’t think there’s a need for braid, although a number of pros do choose it when spinnerbaiting over vegetation. I prefer fluorocarbon because it’s more sensitive and I can feel the blades better.\n“We used to think monofilament was perfect for spinnerbaits, but once you get accustomed to fluorocarbon, using these lures with mono feels like fishing with a big rubber band.”\nShaky Head – “I use six-pound fluorocarbon exclusively with this technique, because I’m not trying for a big bass, but rather, for numbers of fish that are usually in deeper water. I don’t like mono because it has too much stretch.”\nShallow Crankbaits – “When I’m target fishing crankbaits in water six feet or less, I prefer 12- to 15-pound monofilament. It has better castability because it is usually more limp than fluorocarbon, and the visibility of monofilament is not really an issue because I’m usually fishing stained water.”\nSpoons – “My normal choice here is 40-pound braid with a four- to six-foot leader of 14- to 16-pound fluorocarbon. This allows me to make long casts, and because bass nearly always hit this lure while it falls, the braid/fluorocarbon combination gives good hook-sets because of the lack of stretch.”\nCasting Jigs – “With a football-style jig I work on the bottom, I prefer 12- or 14-pound fluorocarbon because of the lack of stretch and visibility, and if I’m working particularly heavy cover, I’ll use 20-pound fluorocarbon. If I’m swimming a jig, however, I’ll use braid without a leader because I’m usually working the lure shallower and want direct contact with it.”\nCarolina Rigs – “I nearly always choose 40-pound braid with a 14- to 17-pound monofilament leader. Mono floats better than fluorocarbon, and in this presentation, it should help my lure as it swims near the bottom.\n“You don’t really lose any sensitivity with mono here, because all your feel comes from your sinker. Most bites on a Carolina rig are nothing more than a ‘heavy’ feeling, and when you learn that bite, it doesn’t mater whether you’re using a monofilament or fluorocarbon leader.\n“The only real advantage I see with a fluorocarbon leader in this case is that it’s invisible. You need a shock absorber in your line system, and because fluorocarbon has such little stretch, you may realize you have to change to a lighter rod for Carolina rigging. To me, that’s a disadvantage, so my choice is monofilament.”\n“When I’m fishing my 10-inch Big Show worms, I use 16-pound fluorocarbon. Again, the advantages are low stretch and near invisibility underwater.”\nWhile most pros have chosen 65-pound braid as their standard, Scroggins feels 40 pound braid is more suitable for his fishing style. The advantage of the smaller size is that it casts easier since he can spool more of it on his reels. Even with 50-pound braid, Scroggins can practically empty a spool on a long cast, which translates into far less cranking power when a bass hits far away\n“I believe the real keys to choosing lines are analyzing both the situations you’re fishing, and then trying different lines and line sizes. Eventually, you’ll settle on some that work best for you, and they may not necessarily be the same choices I use. Each line has distinct characteristics that may or may not be an advantage in your own personal fishing style\n“The best part is that today we all have far more options to choose from than we did just a few years ago.”\n©2015 Bass Edge, Inc.

48	How do both recycling and gardening affect water pollution?	Recycling helps prevent water pollution by keeping hazardous waste out of landfills, where the EPA estimates 0.1% to 0.4% of surface aquifers are contaminated by leaching metals and toxic substances. In urban gardening contexts, water quality is also a concern as rainwater in urban areas can concentrate pollutants that are harmful to plants and gardeners, while municipal water may contain minerals and additives like fluoride that can damage sensitive plants.	['Recycling is the process of turning old used materials into new ones. Through recycling and reusing waste, energy and raw materials are saved.\nWith the continuously increasing population and use of disposable products and packaging, our finite natural resources are being depleted at an alarming rate.\nCurrently less that 25% of our waste is being recycled, with the remaining being buried or incinerated in landfills. This seems absurd when we could be reusing and/or recycling more than 70% of the waste we produce.\nNearly everything we use in our everyday lives can be recycled including aluminum cans, aluminum foil and bake ware, steel and tin cans used for soup and coffee, cardboard including milk and juice cartons, magazines, office and newspaper, phone books, most glass products, plastics bottles, jars, and jugs, car and household batteries, light bulbs, electronics, and even food.\nIf just half of Americans recycled on a regular basis, it would reduce greenhouse emission by the same factor as taking 25 million cars off the road.\nBy recycling we could reduce exploitation of natural resources, save money, reduce pollution and waste, and create jobs and boost the economy.\nThis article will discuss the many benefits of recycling including environmental and economic benefits.\n1. Preserves Natural Resources & Prevents Habitat Destruction\nMost of the world’s natural resources are finite, meaning they are limited and will run out at some point. Preserving these natural resources is a primary concern for those concerned about the longevity of natural resources available for human use.\nWe can reduce the consumption of natural resources by using recycled materials to make new products and packaging. Preventing waste through source reduction before it is generated can further reduce the need for disposal and save more resources.\nRecycling can result in products better than those made by the virgin materials. For example, after being processed for recycling, the tin in bimetallic cans is more refined and as a result more valuable.\nFor every ton of steel recycled, 40 pounds of limestone, 1000 pounds of coal, and 2,500 pounds of iron ore are saved. By recycling tin we can reduce the need for raw material which reduces mining and its associated pollution.\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Department of Natural Resources, in 2005 the state saved 1.4 million tons of iron ore, 829,786 tons of coal, and 71,124 tons of limestone by recycling over 1.2 million tons of steel.\nBy reducing land disturbances and pollution associated with mining and extraction of new materials we are decreasing the degradation of natural ecosystems and wildlife habitats.\nPaper recycling plays a direct role in the preservation and biodiversity of forests, by lowering the demand for wood.\nThe longleaf pine forest in the southern United States used to cover 90 million acres, but today less than five percent remains due to harvesting mature longleaf pin for the production of wood, paper, and other paper products.\nThe longleaf pine forest is home to more than 20 endangered species. By recycling paper and paper products we are reducing the pressure on the remaining longleaf pine forest and preserving habitat for these endangered species.\n2. Creates Jobs & Benefits the Economy\nRecycling plays an important role in the economy by ensuring waste is re-used and reduced.\nStudies have shown that for every one job in waste management there are four jobs in recycling. After the recycling process, even more jobs are created for making new goods out of the recycled materials.\nIt has been estimated by the Office of the Federal Environmental Executive that recycling and remanufacturing industries create more than $1 billion in revenue and hundreds of thousands of jobs in manufacturing. Jobs range from high quality product manufacturing to materials handling and processing, employing low-, medium-, and highly-skilled workers.\nAccording to the most recent census data, recycling and reuse activities in the United States in 2007 created 757,000 jobs, $36.6 billion in wages, and $6.7 billion in tax revenues.\nTo put these numbers into better perspective, for every 1,000 tons of recycled material 1.57 jobs are created with an average wage of $76,030, and $14,101 in local and state tax revenue is generated.\nRecycling also saves communities money in waste handling, landfill production, and incineration costs associated with burning garbage because waste is being recycled and reused rather than put into the landfills.\nBy buying recycled products and packaging we can create an economic incentive for recyclable materials to be collected, recycled, and manufacture into new products. This creates a closed loop system that reduces the costs of recycling.\n3. Saves Energy, Reduces Pollution, & Preserves Landfill Space\nRecycling reduces pollution because manufactures are reusing materials instead of creating new ones, which also saves energy, and toxic chemicals and greenhouse gases aren’t being released into the atmosphere though incineration in landfills.\nBy recycling hazardous waste, it is prevented from making it to the landfills where it can potentially contaminate water sources through seepage, which has been known to happen.\nThe EPA estimates that 0.1% to 0.4% of surface aquifers are contaminated by landfills and industrial impoundments leaching metals, mineral, explosives, bacteria, viruses, and other toxic substances.\nAnything more than 0% is unacceptable.\nAccording to Stanford University, the amount of energy that is lost by throwing away recyclables such as aluminum cans and newspapers is the equivalent to the annual output of 15 power plants.\nFor every one ton of recycled newsprint 1.7 barrels of oil, 7,000 gallons of water, 4.6 cubic yards of landfill space, 601 kilowatts of energy is saved, and 60 pounds of air pollutants are prevented from being released into the atmosphere.\nOne ton of recycled news print saves 9.0 barrels of oil, 7,000 gallons of water, 3.3 cubic yards of landfill space, 601 kilowatts of energy, and 60 pounds of air pollutants from being released.\nRecycling one ton of plastic saves 16.3 barrels of oil, 5,774 kilowatts of energy, and 30 cubic yards of landfill space.\nFor every one ton of glass 0.12 barrels of oil, 42 kilowatts of energy, and 2 cubic yards of landfill space are saved, and 7.5 pounds of air pollutants are prevented from being released into the atmosphere.\nRecycling one glass bottle saves enough energy to power a light bulb for 4 hours.\nWhen you recycle aluminum, 95% of the energy required to make the same amount of aluminum from its virgin source is saved. Recycling one ton of aluminum saves 40 barrels of oil, 14,000 kilowatts of energy and 10 cubic yards of landfill space.\nWith this type of data, recycling should seem like a no-brainer.\nAs you can see by recycling you are reducing pollution, conserving resources, saving energy, promoting the economy, and creating jobs.\nWhen we are only recycling a quarter of what we produce in waste, not only are we wasting precious natural resources and polluting the environment, but we are also basically throwing away energy and destroying land and habitats just to create more energy to waste.\nThe problem of waste may be the most worrying concern for the environment and overall health of human beings, but there is a way to solve and mitigate this problem. Think about nature and your own family’s well-being as well as the health of future generations and reduce, reuse, and recycle.\nIt is our responsibility to ensure that waste is recycled, and to protect the environment for future generations. By instilling the morals of recycling into our own lives, community, and children we can create an increased awareness on necessity to prevent waste and recycle.\nIf you have ideas on recycling, please continue this conversation in the comments.\nFeatured Image Credit: Homard.net @ Flickr', 'Growing produce in your own backyard or a community garden can be an amazing experience that allows you to not only choose the produce you consume, but have control of the process from seed to harvest. Issues affecting urban gardens aren’t usually at front of mind when you decide it’s time to open up the soil in your yard or rent a garden plot, but there’s a lot more to consider than just where to buy your seeds.\nProblems with Urban Gardens\nMost urban garden problems aren’t readily apparent when you first dig the soil, but they are very real. Here are some of the most common things to consider before you plant:\nPermits. Depending on where your garden is located, you may need a permit for tearing up the grass, building a fence or keeping urban livestock like chickens, bees and goats. Check with your local municipality before putting in the garden of your dreams to avoid finding out the hard way that it’s not allowed. A lot of urban gardening problems can be prevented by procuring the right permits the first time.\nThe human element. We all want to assume that our neighbors are both helpful and supportive of our garden efforts, but that’s not always the truth. It’s a good idea to talk to neighbors before starting a front yard garden and to erect a fence where there’s a lot of foot traffic. Produce theft is a real thing and happens to disappointed urban gardeners everywhere.\nSun protection. Urban community gardens are especially susceptible to problems with sunscald and radiant heat because many are constructed in areas littered with plenty of concrete, pavement and large structures. When these surfaces warm up through the day, they can literally hold onto the heat for hours and cook your plants well beyond nightfall.\nContaminated soils. Even if the soil in your urban garden is healthy and rich, it may be hiding secret contamination from the past. Lead contamination is by far the biggest risk, and although most vegetable plants won’t uptake lead into their systems, it can be a problem if you don’t wash produce thoroughly or a child eats the soil in the garden. Having a soil test for heavy metals is good practice before you get to gardening.\nOzone. Burning gasoline and other fossil fuels can result in ozone pollution near the ground. Although there’s little you can do to protect plants from this hazard, knowing ozone is a problem can help direct your gardening efforts. Ozone-resistant garden plants are being developed, but aren’t available to the public yet. Until then, you may want to move gardens to areas further away from roads and sources of pollution.\nWater supply. Rainwater gardening is romantic and earthy, but not every area has rainwater that’s safe to use for gardening. Pollutants can concentrate in rainwater in urban areas, injuring plants and causing potential harm to gardeners. Municipal water may also be suspect, depending on native minerals and additives, like fluoride, which can hurt sensitive plants. Accessing useable water can be a trick in some areas, especially where drought and water rationing are common. Plan ahead for water long before you start to plant.']	['<urn:uuid:b495e812-e00b-4cff-91fe-df63d0adae3a>', '<urn:uuid:08ac9338-96d1-4325-a16f-720d0cbea998>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	9	70	1803
49	What are the key differences between how Cajarc in France and Slokenbeka castle in Latvia dealt with invading forces during wartime conflicts in their history?	Cajarc and Slokenbeka experienced different outcomes during wartime conflicts. Cajarc successfully resisted attacks by the English during the Hundred Years War, though it later fell to Protestant forces during the Wars of Religion, which resulted in the destruction of the thirteenth-century church of Saint-Etienne. In contrast, Slokenbeka castle was looted by Swedish troops in 1605 and 1622 during Swedish-Polish wars, but managed to avoid major damage during the Great Northern War as it was located away from the main military operations. During World War I, Slokenbeka was used as a German army military hospital and, despite the frontline being nearby, the castle fortunately did not suffer significant damage.	"['For walkers following the traditional pilgrims’ route along the GR 65 Chemin de Saint-Jacques du-Puy between Figeac and Cahors, two days of walking (or one big day) brings you to the busy market town of Cajarc.\nA map of the town drawn in 1382 bears a striking resemblance to the current map. The Boulevard du Tour de Ville, which today forms a ring road around the town, is shown as a moat that once provided additional protection to the heavily fortified village.\n(Published July 2013, updated April 2020.)\nCajarc successfully withstood attacks by the English during the Hundred Years War, but fell to the Protestants two centuries later during the Wars of Religion. It was during this period that the thirteenth-century church of Saint-Etienne was largely destroyed and all that remains today from the original church is the base of the bell tower.\nIn the early seventeenth century, the church was rebuilt and the moat filled in with earth. Plane trees, which were planted two hundred years ago, still form a guard of honour along the boulevard.\nDespite the battles and destruction Cajarc has endured over the last eight hundred years, it still boasts more than its fair share of picturesque alleys and historic houses—many dating from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\nThe oldest building here dates from the twelfth century, although some newer windows show evidence of alterations in the thirteenth and eighteenth centuries.

Nowadays one can stil see an impressive defensive wall which encloses large quandrangular area. Inside the wall mainly along the walls there are located several buildings. Most are built in 19th century. Interesting elements of Slokenbeka castle are both gatehouses with towers built in 1688 an 31 portholes in defensive wall.\nMost often used German name - Schlockenbeck, for the first time mentioned in 1544 as an der beke der hörten Schloke.\nThere is no convincing information about the time when there was constructed Slokenbeka fortification. Slokenbeka as a manorhouse next to a stream named Sloka is mentioned in documents first in 1544. It is known that lands in Tukums province were leased by Livonian Order to Buttlars in 15th century. There is mentioned in literature (without a reference to original source of information) that the first fortifications here have been built by Werner von Buttlar and this action was initiated by attack of Rigans on Tukums castle in 1484.\nSurroundings of Tukums and, most likely, manor of Slokenbeka were owned by family of Buttlars until 1537 - in this year master of Order took away the right of lease, accusing Dietrich von Buttlar of breach of duty and of initiating the so called Saaremaa rebellion. Master of Order Hermann von Brüggeneye issued rights of lease to Dietrich Schenking on 19th January 1544 thus handing over rights to govern all manors in those parishes which were leased to Buttlars before. This is the first written document where is mentioned manor of Slokenbeka.\nWhen there was established Duchy of Courland and Semigallia in accordance with so called privilege of Gotthard the former fief of Livonian Order in 1610 became a property of Schenking family. Dietrich von Buttlar died in 1610 and Slokenbeka was inherited by his son Thies Schenking - his brother Otto Schenking became Cesis Bishop in Polish governed Vidzeme.\nDuring Swedish-Polish wars Swedish troops on their way to Tukums looted Slokenbeka castle in 1605 and 1622.\nSlokenbeka became a property of Courland and Semigallia Duchy Chancellor K.H.Putthammer in 1678 - he owned the castle until 1701 and managed to carry out significant rebuilding of the castle complex. Centre of manor at this time had lost its significance as a fortification and was arranged for household needs. In this time there was built a barn at the defensive wall in the western side and there were built northern and southern gate towers in 1688. Most likely in the times of Putthammer inside the walls there were built also distillery, shed for bullox and other household buildings. Castle complex did not suffer much during the Great Northern War - it was located aside from the main zone of military operations.\nSlokenbeka castle got several owners during the 18th century and first half of the 19th century - Brüggens, Grothuss (almost for 100 years), Medems (1818 - 1840), Bulmerings. There took place larger works of rebuilding in 1752 - in this time there were built French roofs for both gate towers. Portals of gates got new features in Classicism style. There was built also a barn at the northern wall in the end of 18th century. There was built a new apartment building at the southern wall in 1841-1845 in the place where earlier there was an apartment house for servants. Matthias von der Recke purchased Slokenbeka in 1848 and his family owned it until 1920. He was successful procuder of spirits, each year exporting 15 000 buckets to Germany and England. He built a new storehouse in 1863, near Slokenbecka there was built also a school and municipal offices (1862), watermill (1867).\nPainter Juliuss Dering stayed in Slokenbeka manor for a while in 1865 and described it. According to him there was seen only fundament of the old dwelling house in the middle of courtyard. Old portholes were left only in the western wall. In some room above the gate there was located also an old chest of documents.\nDuring the First World War there was established a military hospital of German army in Slokenbeka. For a while the frontline was alongside the castle but happily it did not suffer in warfare. After the war in 1920 the manor was allocated to forest district of Tukums, buildings were ill managed.\nThere was placed road machinery station in Slokenbeka manor in 1949. As the complex of buildings was poorly maintained roof of several buildings caved in and they turned into ruins. There was initiated restoration of the manor complex in 1977 after a design of architect E.Kalnins. Nowadays in the premises of Slokenbeka manor there are located the following institutions - administration of road construction company ""Slokenbeka"" (in the former distillery), guest house, ambulatory (northern tower), Latvian Road Museum (Hill Cart-house and Lower Cart-House), restaurant (former barn). Archive of the manor is located in the fund No 6999 of Latvian State History Archive.\nFortified centre of Slokenbeka manor is built on the right bank of Slocene, in the inner side of prolongated bend. Buildings have been constructed on easy slope - northwestern corner is located 5 metres higher than the southeastern corner at the river. Least protected was the western side of fort - it is possible that in earlier times here was a moat.\nThe castle is shaped with a large quadrangle of defensive wall, length of its sides are 128; 111,5; 123 and 84 metres. Defensive wall is approximately 1 m thick, built of boulders. Bricks have been used only in the rims of portholes. Size of bricks - 24-25 x 13-14 x 7-7,5 centimetres.\nBefore the restoration of 1970ies only the western wall was comparatively free of buildings and only this wall had portholes preserved. During the restoration works there were found portholes in the other walls as well - these were bricked up in earlier times. Total number of portholes is not possible to find anymore as the original defensive wall during the rebuildings has been partly torn down and replaced with newer wall without portholes. In the western wall there is another porthole each 5 metres. In the inside they are 175 cm high, 80 cm wide. In the outside they are 142 cm high, only 15 cm wide. Now there are seen 11 portholes in the western wall, in northern wall - 5, eastern - 7 and southern - 8.\nSlokenbeka castle is unusual also because there is not preserved an older manor-house. Along the walls there are lined newer buildings from 19th - 20th century. In the southwestern corner there is located the wooden dwelling house from 1841 - 1845. This building has got veranda, spatious basement with barrel vault, basement for spirit. There have been built two gate towers in 1688 - these are the main entrances in the castle also nowadays, usually only the northern gate is opened.\nIt is known that the old manor-house was located in the middle of courtyard. During the first construction period the castle most likely had just one gate with drawbridge or drop-bars.\nIn total inside the walls there are two barns, small and large cart-houses, 2 gate towers and manor house.\nIn earlier times similar complexes were located also in Biksti, Varve, Zlekas, Stukmani.\nWeather-wanes above both gates of castle (1688).\nSon Matthias of the new baron of Slokenbeka and Durbe fell in love with daughter of Slokenbeka miller. Both had secret meetings at the dam of Slokenbeka watermill. Old baron got to know this and got furious about this. He grabbed his shot-gun and galloped to the lake. There was a beautiful moonlight. Both youths were sitting on the rim of dam when at the other side of the lake appeared baron and wanted to kill the girl. Young people did not want to be separated by death - they joined hands and jumped in the lake.\nBaron suffered a lot about the death of his son and ordered to build a small memorial obelisk with inscription Matthias 1867. This monument is still standing at the mill, close to the lake. Newlyweds stop here often and leave a bouquet in remembrance of unfortunate lovers.\nDrowned maiden is haunting the manor. She is nicknamed - White dame. (2)\nMatthias Dietrich Rheinhold von der Recke (28 May 1791 - 29 August 1869) really was the first baron who owned both Slokenbeka and Durbe. He built a watermill in 1867 - legend goes about this mill. Matthias von der Recke and his wife are buried in Kalna graveyard of Tukums. All his posterity got a name Matthias.

50	what biggest challenge day to day work routine radio production professional major station canada	The main challenge in day-to-day radio production work at major stations is balancing multiple projects while maintaining distinct styles for different formats. Professionals need to focus on one project at a time to avoid mixing styles inappropriately, such as accidentally giving a sports promo a country music feel. While there's no fixed blueprint to each day, they must balance commercial projects, meet with program directors about upcoming promotions, and stay current with industry trends. They also need to handle urgent requests that require immediate attention while maintaining ongoing project schedules.	['Sports History in the making – Sports Imaging reloaded or…\nI was stunned by Elisabeth’s Kobe tribute on soundlcoud and reached out. We chatted for a while and thought I needed to share her learnings, findings and awesome way of marrying plug and play to songs with you. Enter Elisabeth!\n1. Can you give me a bit background on yourself, your career, achievements.. I am sure a lot of the readers will know you or of you, but it puts a lot of the below in context I assume.\nWell, my name is Elisabeth Hart, and I graduated from the Radio Broadcasting program at Fanshawe College too many years ago. (Not THAT many years ago…) I started my full time radio career at 1240 CJCS in Stratford, Ontario, and a few years and the launch of 1 new station (107.7 Mix FM) later, I moved onto what at the time was CHUM Peterborough (Country 105/1420 CKPT). 9 years, 2 management changes and 1 station flip later (1420 became Energy 99.7), I moved on up to Rogers Radio Toronto. I was hired as a Commercial Producer for 98.1 CHFI, KiSS 92.5, Sportsnet 590 the FAN and 680 News. During my time there, my role has evolved, and I am currently the Imaging Producer for Sportsnet 590 the FAN. I still do some Commercial Production, as well as assisting with Imaging for the Country stations that Rogers has across Canada, and I’ve done Imaging for the News, AC and CHR stations as well. I also do a lot of voiceover work for commercials and various other projects within Rogers, so all of that keeps me hopping!\n2. How is it to work for some of the biggest radio and sports brands in Canada? How do the task differ between the different stations / brands? What is the stylistic approaches and how difficult is it to change hats?\nIt’s great to get to work with some of the best brands in Canada – but they don’t get to BE the best brands in Canada without the best people. It really is about having the best team around you to help you and support you. If I need help with something I’m working on, I know that I can go to any of my co-workers and ask for their help, and they’ll offer their advice. It’s then up to me to decide whether that advice works stylistically with what I’m working on or not. We’re not doing heart surgery here where the patient lives or dies by whether we cut the promo the right away – everything is open to interpretation and is subjective. But knowing that you can get different feedback from really talented people is always a help.\nAs far as changing hats, for me it’s important to focus. As much as I may need to multi-task in the course of a day, if I’m sitting there working on a Sports promo while I’m thinking about what I’m going to do with the Country splitters I need to work on, then there’s a chance that the Sports promo might accidentally end up with a Country feel to it. And for me, that’s not the right move. Plan things out, set aside the time to work on and focus on that one project for that format before you move on. And if an idea comes to me for something different than what I’m working on, I’ll write it down so that I remember it for later, rather than abandoning what I’m in the middle of to see that idea through. There will always be times where fires come up and something needs your immediate attention, but as much as you can, focus on one project at a time.\n3. How do your days look like? Is there a blueprint? A routine ?\nMy days are usually pretty different, which I like. There are, of course, always some projects that need to get completed every day, and I have to balance what commercial projects I’m working on that need my attention as well, but there’s not necessarily a blueprint to each day. I usually meet a couple of times a week with the Assistant Program Director of the FAN to talk about what’s happening that we might need to promote, any shows coming up that need our attention, any new seasons starting, etc. I usually try and get some time in a couple of times a week as well just to scour the internet and see what’s out there that other people are doing that’s cool that I can take inspiration from.\n4. What is your baby? Most fun project?\nFor me, every year my favourite project is the Season Opener for the Toronto Blue Jays baseball season. I’ve been a Blue Jays fan ever since I was young (wait, does that mean I’m not young anymore? DAMMIT!!), and to this day I still even hold a part time job through the summer working at the Jays games. As a very passionate fan, and someone who listened to the game broadcasts growing up, to be able to produce the big season opener piece that kicks off the season across the network, is just amazing. There’s NHL teams in 7 different markets across Canada, and while the whole country rallied behind the Raptors when they won the NBA Championship title, there’s still nothing quite like the way Canada supports the Blue Jays, no matter HOW good or bad the team is doing. So being able to hype people up for another baseball season all across the country like that is pretty special to me.\n5. How important is institutional knowledge for a format like sports?\nTo be honest, it’s not the most important thing. Again, it comes down to the people you have around you, and also your willingness to research. The guy who was doing Imaging for Sportsnet before me is an incredibly talented producer named Anthony Conte. He’s now imaging 98.1 CHFI, and is the AC Imaging Lead for Rogers Radio. He was doing an amazing job with 590, to the point that I was intimidated when I took over the job – I wasn’t sure I’d be able to keep up his standard! But he isn’t a big sports guy. He was able to do such a great job because he would research – and because the other people – the assistant PD, the writer, the jocks, the show producers, etc. would all help out too. Even with myself, I’m not a huge basketball fan. So when it came to producing that Kobe Bryant tribute that you heard, I had to do a lot of research. I knew of Kobe Bryant in the same way everyone did, but not in the same way a basketball fan knew him. So I Google’d him, I watched Youtube videos, I asked my Assistant PD what the *most* important thing for Kobe was, and we had people pulling audio clips from different sources and sharing them with me. While it may have been a piece that “I” produced, there were a bunch of different people involved in it. Can you do great Imaging without having an incredible knowledge of sports? 100%. As long as you’re willing to put in the time and effort to research what you don’t know.\n6. What DAW do you use?\nProTools 12 for PC.\n7. What are your favorite plugins?\nWell, I was recently introduced to a plug-in called RX7, and I’m really excited about it. It’s an audio repair plug-in that can create near-studio quality instrumentals and acapellas from just about any song. It’s way better than the Vocal Remove feature in Adobe, or any other commonly-used attempt to create instrumentals. Previously, I was always limited to using songs where I could find a really good quality instrumental version, so I’m excited to get to play around with this plug-in, and expand my horizons!\n8. What are new learnings? Ideas you work on? Inspirations?\nAn idea I’m working on right now is the Season Opener piece for the 2020 Blue Jays season, but it’s actually an idea I’ve been working on since October. I heard a song that I liked and thought would be cool to use in something, so I found an instrumental version, threw it into ProTools, started putting some play by play with it, and thought hey – this could really work to kick off next season! So I’ve been working on it as I have time, and even though it’s almost done, I still go back to it from time to time just to listen to it with fresh ears, and make sure it all still works. I get my inspiration a lot from commercial music – even if it’s not using that exact track in my material, because you can’t use artist songs in EVERYTHING – it’s how can I get that same emotion? I’ll go on Youtube and search for fan videos – there’s no end of hype videos that fans have made for their favourite sports teams, and they’ve often used great hype music in the background. It not only gives me ideas of what music to use, but also helps me connect with what sort of emotions those fans have tied to their favourite teams.\n9. Any new tools you discovered lately?\nThe tool I’ve been using quite a bit is actually nothing related to ProTools or production at all – it’s actually an app on my iPhone. I’ve found Shazam has been extremely helpful. If I’m watching those hype videos on Youtube and I don’t recognize the song, I can just Shazam it. I’ve even been sitting at home watching TV and heard a commercial with a song that had a cool beat to it that I didn’t know, so I just Shazam it. A few months ago, I was watching a hockey game and just before puck drop, they were playing a piece of music in the arena that I wanted to use in something. I wasn’t able to Shazam it at the time, and it took me about three days to FINALLY find out what the song was (I’d gone through Spotify playlists, Youtube, all looking for songs played at hockey games and come up empty.) Finally, I was able to find a broadcast of that game, find where that play happened, and there was enough of the song coming through that Shazam was able to pick it up. (It was Tsunami by DVBBS, but where it kicks in at 1:17, in case you’re wondering!)\n10. Your favorite piece of imaging / production ever?\nMy favourite piece ever is probably a piece that Chris Pottage, my boss, produced in 2015 back when the Blue Jays were doing really well and made it into the post season.He managed to weave together Eminem’s “One Shot” with the Beatles “Come Together” WITH the Ok Blue Jays theme song, along with play by play calls in an absolutely incredible way that really captured the excitement of the Blue Jays run, and hearing that piece takes me right back to those sold out crowds and the energy in the stadium. It was electric, and his promo was just as electric.\nBut if you mean my favourite piece of MY Production – that’d probably be the 2019 Season Opener for the Blue Jays – that season was all about the team re-setting, and all of these young prospects finally coming up to the big leagues, and I just love how I was able to find a song that not only captured that theme, but worked so well with the play by play, and I was super happy with how it turned out. The opener for the 2020 season may actually be even better, but it won’t air until the end of March, so I can’t share it just yet. And if you’re wondering if I’m biased that all of my favorite projects are based around the Blue Jays – absolutely I am. I still try and connect to the emotions for other sports for the listeners, but they don’t connect emotionally the same way for ME. There’s a difference between “Hey, that’s a really cool piece of Production”, and “Oh, I love the memories and feelings that that piece of Production connects me to.”\n11. What would be your career advice for a youngster your twenty year old self trying to enter the radio biz?\nIt’s not too late for law school.\nBut if you really MUST try to enter the radio biz – then stay passionate. Even if you find yourself working with a format that you don’t really like, find a way to discover passion within it. You spend so much of your life working, there’s no sense in spending all that time doing something you don’t enjoy, so always find a way to find the fun within a job. And when you DO get stressed out, always remember…we’re not dealing with life-or-death situations here. We get to PLAY Radio for a living. And that’s a pretty fun thing to do!\nCheck out Elisabeth’s soundcloud for more of her work:']	['<urn:uuid:d4e20ee9-919f-4425-a58e-00e51f51fcda>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	14	90	2197
51	I'm helping take care of my grandmother with Alzheimer's at home - what are the most important things I should do with water temperature and lighting to keep her safe?	For water safety, you should set water temperature to warm in showers and faucets to prevent scalding. Label hot-water faucets red and cold-water faucets blue, or write 'hot' or 'cold' near them. For lighting, ensure there is bright lighting where medication is stored for reading labels, install night lights in bathrooms, and make sure there's adequate lighting in the kitchen, especially around the stove and oven area where sharp appliances may be used. Also verify that proper light bulbs and wattage are used throughout the home.	['Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia causes problems with memory, thinking and behaviour. A person diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease experiences memory loss, difficulties with thinking, problem-solving or language as the brain is damaged by this. Because Alzheimer’s is a progressive disease, gradually over time, more parts of the brain are affected, damaged and become more severe.\nMemory loss due to Alzheimer’s disease often interferes with daily life. As their condition progresses, it is common for these patients to lose items such as keys or glasses around the house, struggle to speak in a conversation and even forget about recent events and much more. Around the house, people with Alzheimer’s disease can forget how to use household appliances. They are also unable to recognize or find familiar areas in the home. As their physical ability decreases, they will have trouble with balance and will depend on a walker or wheelchair to get around. Due to this, caring for a person with Alzheimer’s disease can be challenging as it calls for patience, creativity, knowledge and skills.\nTo make the home a safe place for a person with Alzheimer’s, the first thing to do is to prevent. Because it is nearly impossible to predict what might happen, it is vital to look at every possible angle. Look at the home through the eyes of a person with Alzheimer’s. Identify possible dangerous areas and objects. This will help you take control of some of the potential problems that may create hazardous situations.\nNext, lock or disguise hazardous areas. If you cannot lock the kitchen, staircase, workroom and storage areas, cover the doors with cloth or a painted mural. Lock up all medicines, alcohol, cleaning products and dangerous chemicals, weapons such as scissors and knives and all other potential hazardous items. If you have not installed safety devices such as fire extinguishes and smoke detectors, it is time you do so. If you have, then make sure they are in working order.\nIt is also best to simplify the home and remove tripping hazards. Minimise the amount of furniture you have, remove all clutters and furniture such as magazine racks, coffee tables and floor lamps. The key here is to allow them to move freely. If you have stairs, install a sturdy handrail and add carpets to stairs. Make sure floor surface has good traction for walking. Good traction lowers the chances that people will slip and fall.\nBe also mindful of the temperature of water and food. It is best to set water temperature (in shower and other places) to warm to prevent scalding. Because a person with Alzheimer’s is still able to read until the late stage of the disease, use signs with simple instructions to remind them of danger. Label hot-water faucets red and cold-water faucets blue or write “hot” or “cold” near them. You can also put signs such as “Stop!” or “Don’t touch” or “Very Hot!” near oven, toaster, iron and other appliances that get hot. Be mindful that the signs are not too close as they might catch on fire.\nMinimising danger can maximise independence. Making the environment safe can make a person with Alzheimer’s feel less restricted and experience increased security and mobility. As they become increasingly unable to care for themselves, it is important to adapt to every change of behaviour.', 'Where are the HIDDEN HAZARDS for at home seniors?\nThere could be hidden hazards to your aging loved one in their home. It is essential to recognize and remedy these hazards to keep your senior safe at home.\nHome is not always a sweet home. There could be hidden hazards to your aging loved one in their very own home. It is essential that these hazards are recognized and remedied to keep your senior safe and sound at home.\nStairs can pose a dangerous risk if they aren’t carefully evaluated.

Bathtub and Shower\nGetting in and out of the bathtub or shower can be tricky and create a potential safety hazard. Water adds an extra slippery element and steps in showers or tubs can make this an especially challenging area.\nTips to minimize risk with bathtubs and showers:\nSkid-proof the bathtub and make sure bath mats have a non-slip bottom\nAdd grab bars to the bathtub and/or shower\nUse a shower seat or a bathtub transfer bench if necessary\nHave hot and cold faucets clearly marked\nGetting on and off the toilet can become increasingly difficult as mobility declines. Make sure your loved one can easily sit on the toilet and then stand up to prevent injuries.\nTips to minimize risk with toilets:\nAdjust the seat height if necessary so it isn’t too low or too high\nAdd grab bars near the toilet so your senior can grab onto them as they go on and off the seat\n6. Obstructed Walkways\nKeeping walkways and living spaces clean and clutter-free can help keep individuals from tripping and falling and can help mobility, especially if the adult is in a wheelchair or walker.\nTips to minimize risk with walkways:\nMake sure furniture is not too large that it is obstructing walking paths\nKeep walkways and general areas clean and free from clutter\nHaving improper seating makes it more difficult for seniors to stand up from a seated position and increases the chances of falling or straining muscles.\nTips to minimize risk with seating:\nHave chairs with armrests so seniors can utilize armrests to help them up\nAdjust seat height if necessary to make it easier to sit and stand up\nCheck that all chairs and tables are sturdy and stable\n8.

52	What are the main components of compensation that are typically included in executive producer agreements for film projects?	Executive producer agreements typically include three main compensation components: development fees, guaranteed fees, and contingent compensation. Development fees are advanced during development periods against guaranteed compensation. Guaranteed fees, also known as producer fees, compensate the producer for their production services throughout the project. Contingent compensation provides the producer with a percentage of a movie's net proceeds in addition to guaranteed fees, commonly ranging from 25 to 50 percent.	"['All aspects of executive producer agreements are negotiable and vary widely, because there is no regulatory agency or union that dictates the role of an executive producer. Executive producer is sometimes a credit given to stars in a movie that may or may not substantially contribute to production activities, or contribute little more than the power established by attaching their name to the film. With regard to producers that contribute to the production of a project, executive producer agreements generally establish the relationship between a studio and a producer. These agreements may cover production requirements, compensation, credit, approval rights, first negotiation rights, insurance, travel expense, premieres and festivals, videos and DVDs.\nProduction requirements may include picture length, budget, screenplay conformity, ratings, cover shots and end credits. Picture length dictates the minimum and maximum run time of the finished project. Budgets are approved by studios, and producers are required to stay within the approved budget. Studios often require that producers conform to approved shooting scripts. Studios specify the rating for the film. Studios often require cover shots that are used to replace explicit or crude content in movies when a movie airs on public broadcast television and other non-theatrical mediums. Sometimes studios impose a maximum end credit run time.\nCompensation clauses may cover the development fee, guaranteed fee and contingent compensation. Development fees are advanced to producers during development periods against their guaranteed compensation. Guaranteed fees are known as producer fees, and are the producer\'s compensation for providing his production services through the course of the project. Contingent compensation rules establish the compensation a producer is entitled to as a percentage of a movie\'s net proceeds in addition to guaranteed fees. A common contingent compensation agreement pays the producer 25 to 50 percent of a movie\'s net proceeds.\nWith regard to credits, executive producer agreements may cover how the producer\'s credit appears on the screen and on advertising materials in addition to the font size or relative font size of the credit. Placement may be secured on a ""separate card"" that is displayed by itself, and without any other credits on the screen. Some executive producer agreements secure a presentation credit that appears as, for example, ""a Jim Henson Production"" or ""in association with Lucasfilm.""\nSome executive producer agreements grant approval rights to producers. These rights usually depend on the producer\'s experience, because they grant control over the creative elements of a production. For example, approval rights may grant a producer control over the principal cast, key crew members, final screenplay, budget, music, shooting locations, marketing campaign and the distribution release pattern.\nThe first negotiation clause in an executive producer agreement usually grants a producer the first opportunity to begin negotiations as a producer on subsequent productions derived from the original. Subsequent productions covered in first negotiation clauses include prequels, sequels and remakes.\nInsurance and Expenses\nExecutive producer agreements often include the specific insurance coverage a studio provides for the producer. Executive producer agreements often guarantee reimbursement for additional expenses incurred by a producer. These guarantees are negotiated for, and depend on the budget and perceived expenses associated with fulfilling the producer\'s responsibilities.\nPremieres and Videos\nExecutive producer agreements often contain guarantees that the producer is invited to all premieres and festival showings of a movie. These guarantees may require a studio to cover a producer\'s travel, lodging, meals and ground transportation expenses. Executive producer agreements usually guarantee the producer receives a copy of the movie on home video when it becomes commercially available.\n- ""Hollywood Dealmaking: Negotiating Talent Agreements""; Dina Appleton, Daniel Yankelevits; 2002\n- Photo Credit film clapper image by Nicemonkey from Fotolia.com\nHow to Become a Movie Producer\nThere are many kinds of movie producers, including executive producers, producers, co-producers, associate producers and hyphenates, like writer-producers.

53	My throat hurts after drinking coffee - why is that?	Excessive caffeine has a diuretic effect that depletes the body of needed water - water that is required to keep the larynx lubricated for maintaining voice quality. It's recommended to drink a cup of water after having any drink containing caffeine.	['When you have problems with your voice, sometimes folk wisdom and the advice of friends will not do. It may be time to become a detective, looking more deeply into vocal health than you ever have before.\nVoiceCouncil Magazine has asked leading voice scientists, doctors, therapists and teachers to help us discover the causes behind one’s voice getting trashed—and to show the way forward to vocal health.\nYou aren’t hitting those high notes like you used to. Something is “off” with the tone of your voice. Perhaps there’s some pain. But you are in the middle of a busy schedule. Your manager has expectations—so does the audience—so do you. It’s damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead. But what is the cost to your voice?\nUnderstanding some basic facts about vocal health and vocal function should be required for anyone relying upon their voice to make a living. VoiceCouncil Magazine will explore some central issues below and we invite you to go to our forums to keep the discussion alive as we continue exploring the health of your voice.\nWhat’s Going On Down There?\nIn Voice Science 101 students learn that vocal folds (a.k.a. the vocal cords) are muscles in the larynx that are responsible for producing sound. You can feel them at work: just hold your fingers on your throat and make a “zzzz” sound; those vibrations you feel are the vocal folds hitting against each other.\nVocal folds slap together at high speeds and with forces which vary according one’s volume and tone. Voice problems often have something to do with these folds; there is swelling due to stress or illness and a subsequent loss of vocal abilities. A singer wants vocal folds that are not swollen and able to produce sounds naturally, without undue stress. Healthy vocal folds are perhaps the singer’s greatest ally.\nBut vocal folds are not the whole story. Dr. John Rubin, a leading ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon and clinician, observes that it takes a whole body to produce a sound. Understanding how vocal folds work is just one part of a much larger picture that involves emotional, physical, social and nutritional dimensions: “When people come to me with vocal problems I need to look at which parts of the body have gone wrong. This is why I spend a lot of time with my patients; we look at diet, patterns of sleep, the medication they are on and the environment in which the singer works and plays—the number of things than could be contributing to voice problems is almost endless. Sometimes what is going on with vocal folds is not the central issue at all.”\nWhile there can be many causes behind one’s voice getting trashed there are only 2 main enemies of vocal health.\nVocal Enemy #1: Stress\nThere are many ways to put stress on one’s voice: by talking too loudly, using a technique or style that doesn’t “fit”, and by singing in environments that force the voice to push more than it can handle. Dr. Ronald Scherer, well-known voice scientist and educator, says: “The main point is that whatever is making sound in the throat should be created specifically, but with healthy technique—the more training one has, the more one should be able to control the variety, color, loudness, and degree of clarity of one’s voice, without undo fatigue; that is performance vocal health”.\nDr. Rubin underscores the fact that vocal stress can happen without people even thinking about it. “A singer may be causing chronic stress to their voice by competing against a lot of background noise; singing in the car or getting into extended conversations in noisy pubs or clubs, for example”.\nNoted vocal coach Melissa Cross says that the biggest cause of vocal stress is the vocalist thinking that they have to have someone else’s voice: “A singer can sometimes have someone else’s voice in their head—it’s like driving from the passenger seat. A good vocal teacher is someone who can identify natural sensations that are essential to voice production and translate them into a language of the imagination so that it can be used in performance without thinking”.\nVocal Enemy #2: Disease\n“Disease” can be perceived as a frightening term, conjuring up images of an army of microorganisms attacking the throat – forces against which the singer is powerless. However, “disease” simply means that a part of the body is not functioning well. The causes of disease can certainly include microorganisms but they can just as easily be related to nutritional, environmental and toxic factors, all of which can be treated. In the case of singers, there are common ailments and proven paths back to health.\nA magazine article cannot pretend to be the place where a singer can diagnose an illness. Laryngologists (or ENT doctors who specialize in the larynx) can locate problems and prescribe cures. Whether it’s the common cold or some form of “itis”, it may be essential that singers see their doctor so that the cause can be isolated and the path to healing begun.\nDr. Scherer notes that one disease that shows up often with singers is reflux (laryngopharyngeal reflux, LPR, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD): “Reflux is where the gastric juices from the stomach move up the esophagus and onto the vocal folds. It is quite common in vocal performers and always suspected as part of a person’s vocal problem.”\nSometimes, Scherer notes, reflux has no consistent symptoms. That is, with disease we expect to feel pain, but reflux can occur without pain, yet cause inconsistencies in voice quality and vocal range.\nFor people with reflux, Dr. Scherer says there is very good news: “Both medicine and lifestyle change can often allow a person to manage this problem well. Eventually, lifestyle choices may be all that is required to maintain vocal health. The problem is definitely one for which a person should see a laryngologist and other health professionals to receive the most appropriate care”.\nLifestyle Over Medicine\nVoice scientists, doctors, therapists and teachers are unanimous: while there are effective medicines that can be used to treat stress and disease, there is much a vocalist can accomplish through diet, rest and new habits.\nControlling cigarette, alcohol and caffeine consumption will have a direct effect on vocal health. “Think of the process of smoking” observes Dr. Rubin. “You are taking heated materials down into the larynx—this causes irritation. Nicotine is a drug that causes drying in the larynx, not to mention the relationship between smoking and cancer”.\nThe vocalist would do well to see alcohol more as a voice irritant than as a balm for nervousness: alcohol can have a drying effect on the throat and excess consumption can be a factor in reflux.\nExcessive caffeine has a diuretic effect, depleting the body of needed water—water that is needed, in part, to keep the larynx lubricated, so that the quality of singing voice can be maintained. People get tired and so drink a cup of coffee or have a coke to stay awake –unaware that this puts stress on their voice.\nEven the beloved latte has drawbacks for the singer, says Dr. Marcus Coneys. The diuretic effect remains the same as this is caused by the caffeine and is not mitigated by the milk. In addition to this, the milk tends to stimulate the formation of mucus on the larynx, producing a “phlegmy” sounding voice. Singers should ensure that they drink a cup of water after having any drink containing caffeine.\nIn the case of reflux, one can reduce the intake of foods and drink that are acidic: eat less tomato based products, hot spicy foods and drink less orange juice. Not eating 3 hours before sleep and having one’s head slightly elevated keeps acidic fluids where they should be kept—in the stomach.\nEating healthy foods, drinking adequate amounts of water (6 cups a day), getting adequate rest and not being harsh with your voice is not a moralistic message—professionals say that it’s essential to support a lifestyle that depends on the voice.\nIs Devotion to Health Realistic?\nUnderstandably, there can be a fear that in addressing medical issues the singer will fall down an endless pit of medical appointments, lost time and rigorous self-analysis leading to compulsions about diet and environmental noise. The last thing any singer wants to be is so obsessed about health that important opportunities are lost, demanding schedules are held up and performances are cancelled.\nYet, the advice that comes from professionals is straightforward: simple lifestyle choices combined with learning how to use the voice more naturally in performance is achievable. Voice and speech therapist Dr. Ruth Epstein maintains that any treatment has to be sensitive to the demands on the singer’s life. “A doctor or therapist needs to build trust with the singer—this is not accomplished by demanding immediate changes that interrupts essential work, causing even greater stress for the performing artist.”\n“Sometimes we practice some ‘SOS management’, acute treatments that keep a singer on track for the short term. However, we want the singer, over time, to adopt a lifestyle that will support their vocation—that makes economic as well as medical sense”.*\nThe Team Behind the Singer\nThe professionals whose voices you heard in this article see themselves as a part of a anti-voice-trashing support network for the singer. Laryngologists (or ENT docs) take the time needed to diagnose the problem; they work closely with speech therapists who examine behavior changes that can be developed to increase vocal health. Voice teachers extend the work of both doctors and therapists by helping the singer to find more natural ways to use their voice.\nSometimes the “back-up” a singer needs is not musical. Even a determined soloist may need to be in harmony with this team.\n* The first occupational voice symposium focusing on protecting the voice in the workplace, will take place in London on the 25-26 March 2009.

54	after seeing how popular weed is getting i wonder if big companies like marlboro own any marijuana patents	Yes, Philip Morris, through its European subsidiary Philip Morris Products S.A., has obtained patents related to cannabis, specifically for plants producing terpenes including Cannabis sativa. The company has also been actively patenting various vaping devices and e-cigarettes that closely resemble popular marijuana dispensary products. Additionally, Philip Morris International invested $20 million in Syqe Medical, an Israeli company that manufactures 3D-printed cannabis inhalers.	['“We are in the business of relaxing people who are tense and providing a pick up for people who are bored or depressed. The human needs that our product fills will not go away. Thus, the only real threat to our business is that society will find other means of satisfying those needs.”\nWe don’t know which employee of tobacco giant Philip Morris wrote the above words as part of a memo sent to company brass in 1970. But we do know the next sentence s/he typed.\n“Many regard marihuana as an alternate, and perhaps a superior, method of satisfying the needs that cigarette smoking satisfies,” as the internal company memo obtained decades later by tobacco-industry researchers at the University of California, San Francisco reads.\nThe context was an earlier inquiry from the federal Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement. The agency asked if Philip Morris would help provide a chemical analysis of cannabis smoke. The company was weighing whether to comply. The answer, the memo author argued, was obvious: “In this situation, business theory strongly suggests that we should learn as much as possible about this threat to our present product.”\nHow much of a threat marijuana truly presented to a highly addictive product already used by nearly 40 percent of American adults is unclear, but cigarette-makers took notice. Philip Morris and its competitors, British American Tobacco and RJ Reynolds, all considered entering the weed game at various times, according to other internal documents unearthed by UCSF.\nAs it happened, the government intervened, to tobacco companies’ benefit. Later that same year, Congress passed and President Richard Nixon signed into law the Controlled Substances Act. By 1973, the smallish narcotics bureau was replaced by the Drug Enforcement Administration, a global police force that would wage what Nixon described as “an all-out global war on the drug menace.”\nDecades of military-style raids compared unironically to the Nazi occupation of Europe followed. Cannabis became so hard to find that the entrepreneurial-minded turned to other commodities. “You just couldn’t get it,” lamented would-be pot-seller Rick Ross, who instead sold an estimated $600 million worth of crack cocaine. You know the rest: punitive and nakedly racist drug laws, more and more radically militarized policing, accelerated urban decay, overcrowded prisons, seizures of Americans’ property and assets without trial.\nFifty years of all that served only to delay what tobacco-company researchers and the unnamed memo-writer knew was inevitable. Cannabis, the country’s most valuable cash crop, is now a legal commercial commodity in eight states. Tobacco is still a banner business—how can it not be, when entry is so strictly regulated the result is a near-monopoly?—but in the meantime, Americans’ tobacco use has declined by more than 50 percent.\nIt doesn’t take a stable brain genius to figure out how the company pivoted. The annual report of the Altria Group, Philip Morris’s $26 billion parent company, does not mention marijuana as a threat to its bottom-line—its main “challenges” are anti-smoking restrictions, from the same government that gave it a generation’s reprieve from weed—but the company has absolutely moved toward legal marijuana, directly and indirectly.\nAfter telling VICE that the company had “no plans to sell marijuana-based products” in 2016, later that same year, Philip Morris International sunk $20 million into Syqe Medical, an Israeli-based firm that makes 3D-printed cannabis inhalers. In the years prior, the company’s European subsidiary, Philip Morris Products S.A., applied for and received a patent for plants “producing terpenes of interest… including…. Cannabis sativa.”\nSince then, the company has been busy marking as its intellectual territory a slew of vaping devices, patenting a potential future hoard of e-cigarettes and other solid and liquid vapes—many of which bear a striking resemblance to marijuana dispensaries’ most popular products.\nBesides tobacco, cannabis also poses a threat to other popular chemical unwinding methods. Molson Coors is only the most recent big alcohol company to tell its investors that, hey, legalization could hurt our bottom line. Other firms, like Constellation Brands, reacted with the “join ’em” method, investing in cannabis companies.\nIf the patent rush is any proof, tobacco companies may go the hostile takeover route. Instead of buying out existing marijuana outfits, they have the money and the power to bury them in court.\nWill they succeed? Should they be allowed to succeed? And if they do, will it be bad?\nMore so than the market, the answers to the above rely on the same government regulators who have steered the ship thus far.\nThere’s a rational argument to be made that if Altria went to cannabis, the world would benefit. If tobacco companies sold marijuana instead, that would probably be good for public health. Tobacco kills over 480,000 people a year. Weed kills nobody. Add economics—and emotion, and equity—and the question is harder to answer.\nIn 2010, when California voters were a few months away from deciding whether their state would be the first to re-legalize recreational cannabis for adults, an old and nasty rumor started swirling around cannabis circles. Philip Morris was up in Humboldt County, buying up old timber land. Big Tobacco was moving in—legalization was a front to take away small growers’ livelihoods.\nThe stories were wrong in the details—why buy rocky and remote land in the woods, where pot growers went to hide, when you have factories and processing facilities near population centers?—but they did capture an essential truth.\nWhere you find money, you will find Big Something, and the flip of the nation’s most popular illicit drug into the latest legal industry absolutely means big money.\nIn the report summarizing tobacco companies’ aims on marijuana, the UCSF researchers provided a warning—and a possible path forward. “Policymakers should learn from their successes and failures in regulating tobacco,” they wrote.\nThat should be read from a policy standpoint, not one of public health—and these are the policymakers on whom Altria sprinkles more than $100 million a year in lobbying. That’s a bad sign, and there’s reason to fear for a monopolized marijuana industry. Thus far in California, high taxes and onerous government regulations have created a thriving underground market and kept nearly all of those conspiracy-minded small growers away from the legal market.\nBig Tobacco’s power move on marijuana was inevitable—a 50-year itch. It’s just beginning, but so far it’s looking like Marlboro Greens will turn from an April Fool’s joke to a 4/20 special in the near future.']	['<urn:uuid:248adb83-6486-49cd-800c-8ea8c8a4bca2>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	18	62	1063
55	How do engineers test train safety systems before hardware exists?	Engineers develop plant models of train hardware components and run closed-loop simulations to verify the control design functionality before prototype hardware is available. This allows them to test features that would be difficult or time-consuming to verify on actual trains.	['Modern railway vehicles, carriages, and other rolling stock are equipped with sophisticated train control and management systems (TCMS). The TCMS is responsible for safety-critical tasks, such as emergency braking and emergency engine shutdown, as well as for passenger comfort systems, such as heating and ventilation.\nBecause of its safety-critical nature, TCMS software must meet stringent requirements. The software must be certified compliant with functional safety standards such as EN 50128, which covers software for railway control and protection systems. Thorough and continuous testing is key to a successful certification process. In traditional development processes, however, testing cannot begin until hardware is\nAt PESA, we use Model-Based Design to develop real-time TCMS software for locomotives, electric multiple units (EMUs), and diesel multiple units (DMUs) (Figure 1). Our engineers model low-level software requirements in Simulink® and Stateflow®, run simulations to verify their\nModeling and Simulating the TCMS Software\nWe begin by defining the initial system requirements in ALM software Polarion. These requirements include safety features, such as emergency braking, traction control, and diesel engine shutdown, and non-safety-critical features, such as control of lighting, heating, ventilation, and other passenger comfort systems.\nWe then model low-level software requirements in Simulink and Stateflow. State transition diagrams in Stateflow clearly show all the states in the system as well as conditions to be checked and actions to be performed (Figure 2). Whenever possible, we reuse components from our custom Simulink library, which includes a regulator that adjusts diesel engine speed based on the current power demand.\nIn addition to developing control models, we also develop plant models for hardware components of the train. We use these plant models to run closed-loop simulations in Simulink to verify the functionality of our control design before prototype hardware is available. Even when the hardware is available, we continue to use simulations to verify features that would be difficult or time-consuming to verify on the actual train (Figure 3). For example, it can take days to discharge a battery and hours to increase the temperature inside the passenger car to a specific set point. In Simulink, we can simulate drops in voltage or changes in temperature within minutes to quickly verify the functionality of electrical and passenger comfort systems under a variety of operating conditions.\nGenerating and Testing the Structured Text\nAfter verifying the design via simulation, we generate Structured Text from our Simulink and Stateflow models using Simulink PLC Coder™. Because the generated code is never modified manually, we are 100% confident that it matches the requirements and design captured in the models. We then compile the Structured Text in our PLC integrated development environment (IDE), where we run limited tests before deploying to the actual PLC for real-time tests. In the past, these tests were our first opportunity to verify the design. With Model-Based Design, we run extensive simulations before reaching this point. As a result, we detect problems much earlier and have significantly fewer problems later in development. Our tests are now focused on those aspects of the design not readily verified through simulation, enabling us to reduce testing time by more than 30%.\nThe ability to generate Structured Text from our models not only eliminates defects introduced by hand-coding, but it also gives us the flexibility to target different PLC hardware. We currently use PLCs from three vendors. We can use the same Simulink models to generate Structured Text—or even C code—for implementation on any of the PLCs.\nOur testing process is based on the EN 50128 standard. In this process, we create software components tests based on our software component design specification (SCDS). This document describes component data types, value ranges, and safety integrity levels as well as interactions between software components. Because the SCDS defines how input variables affect output states, test engineers can test each software component using a black-box model that includes a PLC functional block containing the Structured Text generated with Simulink PLC Coder (Figure 4).\nOur test environment consists of a PLC controller that has the same processor and input/output modules as those used on the railway vehicle, simulating devices, and testing software. The testing software includes an array of simulated switches and LEDs as well as elements for specifying and displaying analog values, such as vehicle speed and coolant temperature (Figure 5). Test engineers use this software to set inputs according to established test scenarios for the component and then verify that the outputs displayed in the software match those defined in the scenarios.\nPursuing Certification EN 51028 and Next Steps\nWe are in the process of certifying our safety-relevant software as compliant with EN 51028 safety integrity level (SIL) 2 standards with TÜV SÜD. We expect our use of Model-Based Design in documenting, simulating, and verifying the software to expedite this process. If the certification authority reviewers want to compare two versions of our system, we can use the models and documentation to show that design changes were implemented exactly as we have described. In the past, reviewers had to rely on examining the source code.\nAs a next step, we are going to further streamline the certification process by linking our system requirements in Polarion to the model components that implement them in Simulink. We also plan to expand our use of Model-Based Design to the development of advanced driver assistance systems. For example, we are exploring the combination of image processing and machine learning techniques to process input from thermal cameras and other sensors for a collision-avoidance system that will detect obstructions on the tracks and automatically apply the brakes.']	['<urn:uuid:194616a3-be44-4c69-8479-bbbfa9c9a76c>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	10	40	924
56	compare cuts meat preparation rome britain tradition	In Roman tradition, meat preparation focuses heavily on specific cuts prepared with aromatics and herbs, such as rigatoni con la pajata using beef intestine, and pork preparations using fennel, garlic, and fresh herbs. British butchery tradition, as practiced in places like Donald Russell, divides beef into four main cuts (rib, sirloin, fillet, and rump) and emphasizes precise portioning and aging of meats. While Roman cuisine tends to integrate these cuts into complex dishes with multiple ingredients and seasonings, British butchery focuses more on the technical aspects of breaking down the meat and achieving optimal aging times - 28 days for beef and up to 10 days for lamb. Both traditions maintain high standards for meat quality but approach preparation and serving differently.	"['The national capital of Italy, Rome, is a sophisticated city full of international political emissaries and wealthy travelers. These visitors naturally expect some of Italy’s best food.\nDinner often begins with a lavish antipasti that features fresh seafood, preserved meats, ripe produce, baked goods and fragrant olives and olive oils. Brothy soups are offered, though rarely are they plain. Pasta e ceci is a rosemary and garlic scented broth with pasta and chickpeas. Hot beef broth is flavored with nutmeg and has ragged strips of egg stirred throughout before garnishing with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Stewed white beans, flavored with prosciutto, pork rind, garlic, onions and rosemary are also popular.\nRoman cooking uses fresh produce abundantly. Artichokes may be served raw or fried, either with garlic and mint or deep fried according to the traditions of the Jewish community. Local rocket (arugula) is prized for fresh salads. Puntarella, or endive, is seasoned with anchovies and garlic before serving cold. Another popular vegetable dish is pomodori ripieni, tomatoes that are stuffed with rice or potatoes, seasoned with garlic and basil and baked.\nRecipes may use fresh or dried pasta in many different shapes. Fresh pasta is eaten in lasagna or Rome’s famous, Fettuccine al Burro. This dish takes strips of pasta egg dough and gently coats them in butter. Cream and freshly grated Parmesan cheese are then added. Roman recipes for pasta often call for tubes, as this shape is more effective for holding onto hearty sauces. Bucatini all’amatriciana tosses thin tubed spaghetti with a spicy pork sauce and grated Pecorino cheese, sometimes garlic or tomatoes are added for flavor. Penne all’arrabbiata is topped with a tomato sauce seasoned with chili peppers and garlic. Chunky tubes are served with a filling meat sauce that contains beef intestine and is flavored with herbs, garlic and salt pork to make rigatoni con la pajata. Simple spaghetti is dressed with extra virgin olive oil that has been heated with garlic, parsley and chili peppers for spaghetti all ‘aglio olio e peperoncino.\nOther starchy dishes are made from wheat, potatoes, rice and polenta. Potato or semolina gnocchi dumplings are popular foods. Suppli al telefono are hand held balls of rice stuffed with mozzarella cheese and sometimes flavored with liver, veal or anchovies. When they are eaten, the cheese is said to stretch out in strings resembling telephone wires.\nSome of Rome’s best dishes are the sautéed, braised, boiled or roasted vegetables that are served with most meals. Called contorni, these flavorful dishes round out meat and fish main courses. They are also served as antipasti, before meals. Trattorie all over town serve braised cardoons (a cousin of the artichoke) with mixed local greens. Classic contorni are common in home cooks’ repertoires as well, though many Romans like to purchase them by weight at a tavole calde (literally “hot table” shops).\nHopefully this dinner menu will make you feel like you are in Rome.\nBeet and Onion Salad\nInsalata di barbabietole e cipolle\nUsually served as an antipasto in Rome. A variation of the salad can be made by slicing the beets thin and marinating them for 2 hours with 10 fresh basil leaves, salt and vinegar. Mix with sliced fennel and olive oil.\n- 2 lbs beets with stems and leaves\n- 1 medium white onion\n- Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper\n- 1/4-cup extra virgin olive oil, or more to taste\n- 2 tablespoons wine vinegar, or more to taste\nLeave about 2 inches of stem on the beets. Wash, then place the beets in cold water to cover, bring to a boil and gently boil for about 1 hour, or until tender. Or cook in a pressure cooker with cold water to cover for 10 minutes or in a 325°F oven until tender, 1 to 2 hours, according to size. Test with a fork to be sure they are cooked through.\nCool and slip off the skins. Slice the beets and onion thinly and place them in a salad bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste and dress with the oil and vinegar.\nNOTE: This can be prepared several hours in advance.\nPasta e Ceci (Pasta with Chickpeas)\n- 1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped\n- 1 stalk of celery, trimmed and finely chopped\n- 1 clove of garlic, peeled and finely chopped\n- Extra virgin olive oil\n- A sprig of fresh rosemary, finely chopped\n- 2 – 14-oz. cans of chickpeas\n- 2 1/4 cups of chicken stock\n- 3 1/2 oz. ditalini or other small Italian “soup” pasta\n- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper\n- Fresh basil or parsley leaves for garnish\nPlace the finely chopped onion, celery, rosemary and garlic into a saucepan with a little extra virgin olive oil and cook as gently as possible, with the lid on, for about 15-20 minutes, until all the vegetables are soft. Do not brown.\nDrain the chickpeas well, rinse them in cold water and add them to the pan with the chicken stock. Cook gently for half an hour and then, using a slotted spoon, remove half the chickpeas to a bowl.\nPuree the soup remaining in the pan using a handheld immersion blender. If you don’t have one, you can use a food processor instead, then pour it back into the pan. Add the reserved whole chickpeas and the pasta, season the soup with salt and pepper and simmer gently until the chickpeas are tender and the pasta is cooked.\nServe drizzled with good-quality extra virgin olive oil and garnish with basil or parsley.\nFennel and Garlic Crusted Pork Roast\n- 1 small head fennel with 2 inches of fronds attached, coarsely chopped\n- 1/2 cup coarsely chopped onion\n- 6 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced\n- 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme\n- 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary\n- 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh sage\n- 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh oregano\n- 2 teaspoons fennel seeds\n- 1 1⁄2 teaspoon coarsely ground white pepper\n- One 4 1/2-lb. pork rib roast, tied with kitchen twine\n- Coarse salt to taste\nIn a food processor fitted with the metal blade, combine the fennel and fennel fronds, onion and garlic. Process to a paste. Add the thyme, rosemary, sage, oregano, fennel seeds and pepper and pulse to combine.\nWith a small, sharp knife, make shallow crosshatch cuts in the skin of the pork roast. Season it all over with salt, rubbing it in well. Rub the fennel–garlic paste over the roast to cover it with a layer about 1⁄4” thick. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours.\nAbout 20 minutes before cooking, remove the roast from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature.\nPreheat the oven to 500° F. Transfer the pork to a roasting pan. Roast the pork for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. Continue roasting the pork for 35-40 minutes longer or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the meat registers 155°. Remove the roast from the oven and cover it loosely with foil. Let it rest for 15 minutes before removing the butcher twine and slicing it into thick chops.\nBroccoli Strascinati (Broccoli with Garlic and Hot Pepper)\nThis Roman dish, which pairs beautifully with pork, can be made with regular broccoli or broccoli rabe.\n- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil\n- 1 bunch broccoli (about 1 lb.), stemmed and cut into florets\n- 3 cloves garlic, smashed\n- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red chile flakes\n- Kosher salt, to taste\nHeat oil in a 12″ skillet over medium-high heat.

Diana Pilkington gets to know the cuts during a crash course in butchery, and picks up some tips from real-life butcher (and one half of TV\'s Fabulous Baker Brothers) Henry Herbert. Plus, some tasty meat recipes.\nBy Diana Pilkington\nYou don\'t expect to walk into your local butcher\'s shop and see a glamorous TV star behind the counter.\nBut Henry Herbert, one half of Channel 4\'s Fabulous Baker Brothers, is juggling his TV career with running family business Hobbs House Butchery in Chipping Sodbury, Gloucestershire.\nAnd he has seen such a rise in people who want to learn some basic butchery skills that he\'s in the process of opening a school to teach them.\n""There\'s a thirst for people wanting to learn how to do it themselves,"" he says.\n""They might not do it every time, but understanding the skill behind it helps you appreciate what the trade involves. It\'s like when people want to do a bit of DIY at home but won\'t necessarily do the whole house.\n""If you cook a leg of lamb that you had boned out yourself, there\'s kudos in that.""\nThere can also be financial benefits to getting handy with a knife at home.\nHerbert says: ""A small chicken is about £5. It\'s about the same price as two skinless chicken breasts, but there\'s quite a big difference in size.\n""It\'s so quick to learn how to chop that chicken up and get two breasts, two legs, wings and a carcass to make a soup, so suddenly you\'ve gone from two meals to five meals. I could teach someone that in five minutes and they\'ve got that for life.""\nEven if home butchery is not your thing, the star is supporting a campaign to encourage people to use their local butcher and tap into their expert knowledge about which cuts to buy and how to use them.\nAfter all, trained chef Herbert took over his family butcher\'s in the first place to help keep the trade alive when the shop became vacant.\nThe number of butcher shops in Britain has declined sharply since the Seventies, dropping from 25,300 in 1977 to just 6,811 in 2006. However, according to Eblex, which represents the English beef and sheep industry, the drop in numbers is tailing off and there are around 6,600 today.\n""I felt it was a real shame to see another butcher shop that had been trading for 150 years close down and become a card shop or a charity shop,"" he says.\n""I thought even if I can breathe some new life into it and help inspire someone at least I\'ve done something rather than watch it shut down.""\nA butcher\'s at how it\'s done\nI admit it, I love red meat. But I don\'t think I\'m alone in being a bit clueless about how a juicy sirloin steak or comforting Sunday roast correspond to the animals they start out as.\nWith this in mind, I take a trip to the Donald Russell butchery in Aberdeenshire, proud holder of a Royal Warrant, for a tour of the premises and a crash course in butchery skills.\nLed by the aptly-named Steve Lamb, I wander through the ice-cold maturation room, where hundreds of headless carcasses hang side by side. Beef is typically hung for around 28 days to give it maximum flavour, and lamb, which I learn is anatomically very similar to a cow, is hung for up to 10 days.\nThroughout the factory are a staggering number of white-coated people hard at work, some carefully weighing and portioning the steaks, others chucking meat into a mincer, lining pastry with sausage meat or packing up the cuts.\nThey all carry out their tasks with impressive speed and precision. And then it\'s my turn.\nIn the demonstration room, I watch as butcher Dave Bergin uses a saw and various knives to break down the \'roasting\' (a side of beef) into the four main cuts of rib, sirloin, fillet and rump.\nIt is quite a transformation, and what starts out as a generous, multi-coloured bit of fillet, for example, is trimmed down into a sleek piece of pure red meat that resembles a fish to look at.\nNext is the fun part. With my left hand encased in a chainmail glove, I have a go at cutting these newly-butchered slabs into steaks. It\'s satisfying to sink the knife in, but my task - to chop them to an optimum 220 grams - is not easy, and I keep missing the mark. Fellow butcher Andy Grant, on the other hand, gets it right every time.\nThere\'s also a baffling array of words to come to terms with. As well as the familiar steaks, I hear terms like ""pave"", ""picanha"" and ""tafelspitz"" bandied about.

57	What crops did people grow in El Mirador?	The inhabitants of El Mirador cultivated corn, beans and squash for agriculture.	['Located in the Central Maya Lowlands in what is now northern Guatemala, the Preclassic city of El Mirador was a giant compared to most of its contemporaries. Its massive ruins still tower above the rainforest canopy. They are silent witnesses to Maya ingenuity and the Maya’s ability to sustain such a massive settlement so early in their history. Agriculture involving the cultivation of corn, beans and squash enabled its inhabitants to thrive.\nManmade plaster-lined catchment areas collected water, making up for the absence of rivers. Even in such apparently mundane aspects of city life, the Maya showed their artistic nature.\nIn March 2009, archaeologists discovered a series of panels made of carved and modeled-lime plaster that lined a water collection system in an area of the city known as the Central Acropolis. The panels and water collection tanks date to the Late Preclassic period, from 300 B.C. to the beginning of our era. The panels, which flank the series of pools in this unique water control system, depict two “swimming” individuals that are framed by cosmic monsters of great importance in ancient Maya art.\nAccording to Dr. Richard Hansen, who led the team of archaeologists at El Mirador: “[T]he ‘swimmers’ represent the Hero Twins of the Popol Vuh.” He is referring to the Quiche Maya text of the Maya creation story, which was found in the highland town of Chichicastenango in A.D. 1700 and transcribed by a Dominican monk named Francisco Ximenez by about 1704 A.D.\nDr. Stephen Houston, who has worked at the neighboring site of El Zotz, says, “These figures represent god impersonators and bear no secure connection to twins in the Popol Vuh.” Instead, he argues,”Perhaps the artists commemorated a narrative of the first rainmakers and their watery assistants. In this way the rulers of El Mirador, through the mechanism of deity impersonation, presented themselves as supernatural agents who controlled the rain.”\nWhat we have here is one of the earliest representations to mythical characters we know from the Popol Vuh. The problem is that there is a huge time gap between this plaster panel and the earliest-known document referencing the Popol Vuh. The Newberry Library’s manuscript of this creation story is one of the most widely known and possibly the earliest surviving copy. It was transcribed between 1700 and 1715 in Chichicastenango, Guatemala, by the Dominican priest Francisco Ximénez. Father Brasseur de Bourbourg published a French translation of the text in1861. Images of the title page and first page of the text of the Ximenez manuscript are also on display. An original print of the latter, dating back to 1861, is currently also on display at our Maya 2012: Prophecy Becomes History exhibit.\nAn alternative interpretation of what we see in the panel is that it illustrates the role of Maya royalty. As intermediaries between our physical world and the supernatural one, Maya rulers were called upon to ensure plentiful rains.\nProponents of either hypothesis have reasons to support their line of thinking. Because there are no inscriptions clearly identifying these characters in the water as either mythical heroes or historical rulers from El Mirador, I would favor a third interpretation: we just do not know who is represented here.\nVisit Maya 2012: Prophecy Becomes History through March 31 and draw your own conclusions.']	['<urn:uuid:3937137f-7252-4009-b6c1-214d26cba807>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	8	12	548
58	Who wrote more books, Winston Churchill or Wilkie Collins?	Wilkie Collins wrote more books. He published 30 novels, over 60 short stories, 14 plays, and over 100 pieces of non-fiction, while Churchill's published works mainly consisted of historical volumes and some speech collections, with only one novel called Savrola.	"[""There weretroops trapped on there, with the Nazis surprisingly halted. Early on Churchill wanted to go into politics like his dad, but he did not have much money.\nAlthough Churchill is best remembered as prime minister of England during World War II, he was also an accomplished historian, having published dozens of volumes on the history of England and Europe. Additionally, he has been noted as a master of oratory.\nAlthough interest in his written works has been immeasurably enhanced by Churchill's status as a statesman, they are considered worthy of study in their own right. He was educated at the private school Harrow, where he did not distinguish himself academically. Sensing that his son held more promise in military activity than in intellectual pursuits, Lord Randolph enrolled him at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst.\nRecognizing that he needed to earn a living, Churchill turned in to journalism and worked as a war correspondent in South Africa during the Boer War; he was captured by the Boers and held in a prisoner-of-war camp but escaped.\nDuring the early years of the twentieth century, Churchill gained much notice as a journalist and writer, and he was able to support himself on that income for many years.\nIn he was elected to Parliament and served in a variety of official capacities throughout his career. Churchill married Clementine Hozier in ; he had proposed to her four times before she accepted. He saw active service in the trenches of World War I, confessing later that he loved the sound of bombs going off.\nBy the s Churchill became intensely interested in politics; some have suggested that this was a posthumous attempt to live up to his father's high expectations.\nHe devoted himself to many of his father's causes, including democracy, social reform, and the reduction of military expenditure in times of peace. However, Churchill's outlook was always aristocratic, and his genuine reformist sentiments retained a strong element of paternalism.\nHis experience in the military gave him a background different from that of most politicians at the time. In particular, Churchill's martial expertise and his enthusiasm for making war caused alarm among many of his colleagues during World War I, but they provided the makings of the Churchill legend of World War II.\nWhile many of Churchill's political ideals in the s led to his alienation in government, at the outbreak of World War II in he was recognized as an important force in a crisis and was made first lord of the Admiralty.\nWhen the English government was reorganized inChurchill succeeded to the position of prime minister. Churchill's untiring work ushering England through the war led to legendary status; later, however, his commitment to militarism was harshly criticized.\nIn the midst of military victory at the end of the war inChurchill lost the prime ministry when the Conservatives were defeated in the election, but he regained the office in He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in Plagued by the infirmities of age, including a series of strokes, Churchill resigned as prime minister in and did not run for Parliament in the election of He died in Major Works Churchill was unusual for a politician of his time in that he also supported himself with a viable writing career.\nIn he made an excursion into melodramatic fiction with his novel Savrola. Though the book sold well, he did not choose to repeat the experiment. Instead he chose to concentrate on historical works.\nOthers deal with the history of his own family, such as Lord Randolph Churchill and Marlborough In other works, such as A History of the English-Speaking Peopleshe filtered history through his own political experiences and came up with an unabashed Whig interpretation.\nAs a historian he has been most admired when describing events with which he had an intimate connection, even given his biases and air of self-promotion. Early in his political career he began, with Liberalism and the Social Problemthe practice of publishing collections of his speeches; throughout his career, Churchill was greatly admired for his ability to rally public and governmental support with his impassioned speaking.\nWith the early establishment of his reputation as a vivid writer and political figure, Churchill was in considerable demand as a contributor to newspapers. A collection of his best newspaper and journal articles, plus his Romanes Lecture delivered inwas published in as Thoughts and Adventures.\nMany of his biographical essays originally published between and were collected in as Great Contemporaries, which was republished several times with additions and deletions. Critical Reception As a politician, Churchill has been both praised and excoriated. As a writer, he has been largely admired since his earliest publications despite the obvious biases of much of his work.What was even more surprising was that Winston Churchill had been posted both as a war correspondent as well as a serving soldier in India and in Sudan, and it was here that the young man revealed two other aspects of his character: he had a literary bent of mind, and he also had a keen interest in public affairs.\nThe analysis of Winston Churchill leadership traits is based on the characteristic and qualities of the leaders as defined by the Malaysian Army Leadership Doctrine (Provisional) While it is easy for us in the calm clarity of perception to discern historical influences on his character and behavior.\nIf you are the original writer. Winston Smith is the everyman character who is the protagonist in the story.\nUnder the oppressive regime of the Party led by Big Brother, Winston lives a life characterized by hatred for the Party. Winston Churchill: The Great Communicator Essay - Winston Churchill was perhaps one of the greatest public speakers in history. Some of the best speeches have come from being in life or death situations, Winston was known best for this.\nWinston Churchill was a legendary orator, a prolific writer, an earnest artist, and a long-term British statesman. Yet Churchill, who twice served the as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is best remembered as the tenacious and forthright war leader that led his country against the seemingly undefeatable Nazis during World War II.\nSix Leadership Traits of Sir Winston Churchill The study of leadership theories ascertains that Winston Churchill portrayed a number of characteristics, traits and ."", 'This Day In Writing History\nOn January 8th, 1824, the legendary British novelist Wilkie Collins was born in London, England. He was born William Collins, Jr. His father, William Sr., was a well-known Royal Academician landscape artist.\nWilliam, Jr. called himself by his middle name, Wilkie, to honor his godfather, the renowned Scottish painter, David Wilkie. After spending his early childhood in London, at the age of twelve, Wilkie Collins went to live with his parents in Italy, an experience he enjoyed greatly.\nHe returned to London three years later. At the age of seventeen, Collins left school and took a job as an apprentice clerk for a tea merchant firm. He hated it. During the five years he worked for the tea company, he wrote his first novel, Iolani. It would be published posthumously in 1999.\nCollins switched gears and entered Lincoln\'s Inn to study law. In 1847, after his father died, he produced his first published book - Memoirs of the Life of William Collins, Esq., R.A.\nAs he continued his law studies, he considered a career in painting, having exhibited a picture at Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1849. However, the following year, his first published novel Antonina was released, thus beginning his career as a writer.\nAlthough it was a work of historical fiction, Antonina introduced Wilkie Collins\' distinctive style of ""sensation novel,"" which is what suspense novels and crime thrillers were called at the time.\nAntonina is a young woman who finds herself caught up in the struggle between the old pagan and new Christian religions of 5th century Rome, which are seen as equally destructive.\nAntonina\'s father, Numerian, wants to restore Christianity to its founder\'s ideals. His steward, Ulpius, a pagan, secretly plans to restore Rome\'s old gods to prominence.\nMeanwhile, Numerian\'s neighbor, the wealthy Vetranio, has become enamored with Antonina. When Numerian catches them in an apparently compromising position, Antonina flees Rome - just before the city is encircled and seized by the Goth army.\nIn 1851, through a mutual friend, Collins was introduced to the legendary novelist Charles Dickens - an event that would have a huge effect on Collins\' life and writings, as the two men became lifelong friends and collaborated on plays and short stories.\nMost of Collins\' novels and novellas would first appear in serialized format in the pages of Dickens\' weekly literary magazine, All The Year Round. Collins\' younger brother, Charles Allston Collins, would marry Dickens\' daughter, Kate.\nThroughout his life, Wilkie Collins suffered from rheumatic gout, a form of arthritis. To relieve the pain, he frequently took laudanum (opium tincture) and became severely addicted to it. He began experiencing delusions and came to believe that he had a subjective doppelganger, whom he called ""Ghost Wilkie.""\nOpium use and addiction would play a part in his most famous novel, which is considered the first major detective novel in English literature. Published in 1868, it was called The Moonstone.\nThe Moonstone is a legendary large yellow diamond, acquired by corrupt British soldier Colonel Herncastle through theft and murder. Shunned by his family, Herncastle wills the diamond to his niece, Rachel, as a gift for her 18th birthday.\nIn addition to its monetary value, the Moonstone has huge religious significance, as it came from the head of a statue of Vishnu in India. The stone\'s guardians - three Hindu priests - are determined to get it back.\nAt Rachel\'s birthday party, she wears the Moonstone to show it to her guests. Later that night, the gem is stolen from her room. Suspicion first falls on Rosanna, a maid and ex-thief.\nAfter Rosanna commits suicide, evidence is found implying that Franklin Blake - whom Rachel had become enamored with - is the real thief. Despite the efforts of brilliant detective Sergeant Cuff, the crime goes unsolved.\nBelieving that Rachel suspects him of theft, Blake meets with her and she tells him that she saw him steal the gem and has been protecting his reputation. Blake has no memory of stealing the Moonstone. He decides to do some detective work himself.\nHe discovers that he was secretly drugged with laudanum at the party by Dr. Candy, in retribution for Blake\'s criticisms of medicine. Then, in a drug-induced trance, Blake took the Moonstone in a subconscious attempt to move it to a safe place.\nThe stone has disappeared again, turning up later at a London bank, sending Blake on the trail of more skulduggery as he tries to solve the crime. The Moonstone was a huge hit with both Victorian literary critics and readers.\nRightfully considered one of the all-time classics of crime fiction, it was considered shocking at the time of its publication due to its sensationalized depiction of opium addiction.\nIt would prove to be Collins\' last great success, coming at the end of his most productive period, where four previous novels, including The Woman In White (1860), No Name (1862), and Armadale (1866) also proved to be bestsellers.\nThe Black Robe, published in 1881, would prove to be Collins\' most controversial novel. It told the story of a scheming Catholic priest, Father Bentwell, who plots to swindle nobleman Lewis Romayne out of his estate, Vange Abbey, which once belonged to the Church.\nRomayne is racked with guilt after accidentally killing a man - an opponent in a card game who had challenged him to a duel. Romayne goes to London to visit his old friend, Lord Loring. There, he meets Stella Eyrecourt, who falls in love with him.\nThe Lorings\' spiritual adviser is Father Bentwell, a Jesuit priest. When he learns of Romayne\'s position and situation, he plots to induce Romayne to convert to Catholicism, then manipulate him into willing his estate to the Church.\nTo achieve this end, he employs young priest Father Penrose to befriend Romayne and offer him spiritual support. After Romayne marries Stella, Father Bentwell does all he can to undermine the marriage.\nHe succeeds, and Romayne changes his will, leaving his estate to the Church instead of his wife and child. When Romayne learns that he\'s dying, he finally decides to visit his wife and son. Father Bentwell brings a lawyer to Romayne\'s deathbed to make sure the Church inherits his estate.\nSeeing through the priest\'s scheme, Romayne proclaims his love for Stella and his son and has the new will destroyed. After he dies, as stipulated in his original will, his wife and son receive his estate.\nAlthough not considered one of Collins\' best works, The Black Robe remains a strong and searing indictment of religious hypocrisy and corruption. It was denounced as anti-Catholic when it was first published.\nAfter the publication of The Moonstone in 1868, Collins\' laudanum addiction worsened over the years, affecting his health and his writing. The death of his close friend Charles Dickens in 1870 devastated him.\nWilkie Collins died in 1889 at the age of 65. He never married, but he fathered three children with his girlfriend, Martha Rudd. In his prolific career, he published 30 novels.\nHe also wrote over 60 short stories, 14 plays, and over 100 pieces of non-fiction, establishing himself as one of the greatest English writers of all time.\nQuote Of The Day\n""I have always held the old-fashioned opinion that the primary object of a work of fiction should be to tell a story."" - Wilkie Collins\nToday\'s video features a reading from Wilkie Collins\' classic novel, The Moonstone.

59	What challenges do both Korean scholars and crypto mining face?	In Joseon Korea, scholars like Im Yunjidang faced societal restrictions due to gender discrimination, limiting their ability to display their talents. Similarly, crypto-asset mining faces restrictions and challenges due to environmental concerns, with operations potentially hindering U.S. climate commitments and requiring new standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and local community impacts.	['Women can Become Saints\nJoseon society was deeply rooted in Confucianism. At the time, women blessed with great talent couldn’t display their abilities properly due to barriers of gender discrimination.\nEven in the male-dominated era, however, some women did overcome restrictions and made their presence felt. Im Yunjidang was one of those brave and intelligent women. She maintained that there was no difference between men and women in characteristics they were given. She struggled to free herself from the shackles worn by women and took a leap into her dream.\nIm was born in 1721 in Yangseong(양성) in Gyeonggi province. After her father Im Jeok(임적) died in 1728, she moved to Cheongju with her family.\nThere, Im learned Confucian classics and history from her second elder brother Im Seong-ju(임성주), who became a prominent Confucian scholar in the late Joseon period. Her eldest brother Im Myeong-ju(임명주) was also a man of great learning, who served as the official of the Office of the Censor-General.\nIn a family with renowned tradition in erudition, Im Yunjidang also showed outstanding ability in her studies. She stood out among her siblings for her logical thinking and deep insight. They even lamented that she hadn’t been born as a man.\nIt was her brother Im Seong-ju who gave her a penname ‘Yunjidang.’ The title derived from Chu Hsi’s comment, “I respect Tairen and TaiSi.” Tairen and TaiSi were King Wen’s mother and wife, respectively, in the Zhou Dynasty of China. They were considered highly respected women of ancient China.\nIm’s life as a woman was lonely, though. She married Shin Gwang-yu(신광유) in 1739 when she was 19 years old. But her husband, who was a year younger than her, died eight years after they got married. She had a baby after a difficult delivery but the child died very young. The childless widow adopted a son of her husband’s younger brother, but the boy also preceded her to the grave. Im sublimated her lonely life into scholarly attainment.\nConcentrating on Studies All her Life\nAn episode tells how deep Im’s philosophical insight was. When she stayed at her brother’s house, her nephews came to her in the evening to say hello to her. She asked them how they were doing with their studies. They said it was so hot that they used fans to cool off. Im scolded them, saying “If you concentrate on reading, the feeling of the cool air will naturally permeate into your hearts. You are just chanting an empty prayer only by your lips.”\nTo better understand the profound principle of the universe and people’s true nature, Im logically explored the theories of ‘reason and energy’ and the ‘Four Beginnings and Seven Emotions,’ which comprised the key of Neo-Confucianism.\nShe cultivated her mind constantly and built high character through moral practice before she died in 1793 at the age of 73. Three years later, Im’s younger brother Im Jeong-ju(임정주) and her husband’s younger brother Shin Gwang-woo(신광우) collected materials and compiled [The Remaining Writings of Yunjidang], which is viewed as the essence of Im’s philosophy.\n[The Remaining Writings of Yunjidang]\nThe book contains her research of Confucian classics, interpretations of the theories of Neo-Confucianism, comments on Chinese historical figures and instructive verses. The well-written texts with high literary value merited great attention. In particular, Im believed that people can all become saints as long as they restore their good and pure nature. In practicing the universal character, she didn’t differentiate between men and women. Rather, she thought men and women were in complementary relations, like yin and yang. Her idea was as progressive as today’s view of different genders.\nIn contrast to other female intellectuals in the Joseon era, who wrote mostly about love or the suffering of life, Im wrote her opinions about Confucian classics or great Confucian scholars. She led a lonely life as a woman, but her hard life inspired her to devote herself to studies all her life. The female Confucian scholar marked her presence in the history of Korean women as a big star that shined brightly amid the ordeals of the times.', 'FACT SHEET: Climate and Energy Implications of Crypto-Assets in the United States\nClimate change is one of the most pressing problems confronting our nation and our world, and President Biden has taken bold steps to address it with legislation and policy. Among the President’s commitments are: protecting communities from pollution, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, achieving a carbon pollution-free electricity grid by 2035, and reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050.\nTo achieve these ambitious goals, we must ensure that emerging technologies contribute to a net-zero, clean energy future. The use of digital assets based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) is expanding. Digital assets are a form of value, represented digitally. As an emerging technological innovation, digital assets have provided some benefits and value for some residents and businesses in the United States, and have the potential for future benefits with emerging uses.\nCrypto-assets are digital assets that are implemented using cryptographic techniques. Crypto-assets can require considerable amounts of electricity usage, which can result in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as additional pollution, noise, and other local impacts to communities living near mining facilities. Depending on the energy intensity of the technology and the sources of electricity used, the rapid growth of crypto-assets could potentially hinder broader efforts to achieve U.S. climate commitments to reach net-zero carbon pollution.\nIn March, in Executive Order 14067 on Ensuring the Responsible Development of Digital Assets, President Biden made clear that the responsible development of digital assets includes reducing negative climate impacts and environmental pollution. The Executive Order directed the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in coordination with other federal agencies, to produce a report on the climate and energy implications of crypto-assets in the United States. OSTP assembled an interdisciplinary team of experts to assess and extend existing studies with new analysis, based on peer-reviewed studies and the best available data.\nToday, OSTP published its report, examining the challenges and opportunities of crypto-assets for the United States’ clean energy and climate change goals, and providing a set of recommendations to further study and track impacts of the sector, develop potential performance standards, and provide tools and resources to reduce negative impacts. This report’s assessment and recommendations align with federal actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions to protect public health and welfare, grow a clean energy economy with good-paying jobs, and improve environmental justice.\nCrypto-Assets Can Be Energy-Intensive, and the United States Has a Major Crypto-Asset Sector\nFrom 2018 to 2022, annualized electricity usage from global crypto-assets grew rapidly, with estimates of electricity usage doubling to quadrupling. As of August 2022, published estimates of the total global electricity usage for crypto-assets are between 120 and 240 billion kilowatt-hours per year, a range that exceeds the total annual electricity usage of many individual countries, such as Argentina or Australia. This is equivalent to 0.4% to 0.9% of annual global electricity usage, and is comparable to the annual electricity usage of all conventional data centers in the world.\nNearly all crypto-asset electricity usage is driven by consensus mechanisms: the DLT used to mine and verify crypto-assets. The dominant consensus mechanism is called Proof of Work (PoW), which is used by the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Bitcoin and Ether combined represent more than 60% of total crypto-asset market capitalization. The PoW mechanism is designed to require more computing power as more entities attempt to validate transactions for coin rewards, and this feature helps disincentivize malicious actors from attacking the network. As of August 2022, Bitcoin is estimated to account for 60% to 77% of total global crypto-asset electricity usage, and Ethereum is estimated to account for 20% to 39%.\nThe energy efficiency of mining equipment has been increasing, but electricity usage continues to rise. Other less energy-intensive crypto-asset ledger technologies exist, with different attributes and uses. Switching to alternative crypto-asset technologies such as Proof of Stake could dramatically reduce overall power usage to less than 1% of today’s levels.\nThe United States is estimated to host about a third of global crypto-asset operations, which currently consume about 0.9% to 1.7% of total U.S. electricity usage. This range of electricity usage is similar to all home computers or residential lighting in the United States. Crypto-asset mining is also highly mobile. The United States currently hosts the world’s largest Bitcoin mining industry, totaling more than 38% of global Bitcoin activity, up from 3.5% in 2020. Despite the potential for rapid growth, future electricity demand from crypto-asset operations is uncertain, demonstrating the need for better data to understand and monitor electricity usage from crypto-assets.\nCrypto-Assets Can Have Significant Environmental Impacts\nGlobal electricity generation for the crypto-assets with the largest market capitalizations resulted in a combined 140 ± 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year (Mt CO2/y), or about 0.3% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions. Crypto-asset activity in the United States is estimated to result in approximately 25 to 50 Mt CO2/y, which is 0.4% to 0.8% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. This range of emissions is similar to emissions from diesel fuel used in railroads in the United States.\nBesides purchased grid electricity, crypto-asset mining operations can also cause local noise and water impacts, electronic waste, air and other pollution from any direct usage of fossil-fired electricity, and additional air, water, and waste impacts associated with all grid electricity usage. These local impacts can exacerbate environmental justice issues for neighboring communities, which are often already burdened with other pollutants, heat, traffic, or noise. The growth of energy-intensive crypto-asset technologies, when not directly using clean electricity, could hinder the ability of the United States to achieve its National Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, and to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change. Broader adoption of crypto-assets, and the potential introduction of new types of digital assets require action by the federal government to encourage and ensure responsible development. This includes minimizing negative impacts on local communities, significantly reducing energy intensity, and powering with clean electricity.\nDistributed Ledger Technologies May Help with Climate Monitoring or Mitigation\nDLT may have a role to play in enhancing market infrastructure for a range of environmental markets like carbon credit markets, though other solutions might work as well or better. The potential benefits of DLT would need to outweigh the additional emissions and other environmental externalities that result from operations to merit broader use, relative to the markets or mechanisms that DLT displaces. Use cases are still emerging, and like all emerging technologies, there are potential positive and negative use cases yet to be imagined. Responsible development of this technology would encourage innovation in DLT applications while reducing energy intensity and minimizing environmental damages.\nKey Recommendations of the Report\nTo help the United States meet its climate objectives, crypto-asset policy during the transition to clean energy should be focused on several objectives: reduce greenhouse gas emissions, avoid operations that will increase the cost of electricity to consumers, avoid operations that reduce the reliability of electric grids, and avoid negative impacts to equity, communities, and the local environment.\nTo ensure the responsible development of digital assets, recommendations include the following actions for consideration:\n- Minimize greenhouse gas emissions, environmental justice impacts, and other local impacts from crypto-assets: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Energy (DOE), and other federal agencies should provide technical assistance and initiate a collaborative process with states, communities, the crypto-asset industry, and others to develop effective, evidence-based environmental performance standards for the responsible design, development, and use of environmentally responsible crypto-asset technologies. These should include standards for very low energy intensities, low water usage, low noise generation, clean energy usage by operators, and standards that strengthen over time for additional carbon-free generation to match or exceed the additional electricity load of these facilities. Should these measures prove ineffective at reducing impacts, the Administration should explore executive actions, and Congress might consider legislation, to limit or eliminate the use of high energy intensity consensus mechanisms for crypto-asset mining. DOE and EPA should provide technical assistance to state public utility commissions, environmental protection agencies, and the crypto-asset industry to build capacity to minimize emissions, noise, water impacts, and negative economic impacts of crypto-asset mining; and to mitigate environmental injustices to overburdened communities.\n- Ensure energy reliability: DOE, in coordination with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and its regional entities, should conduct reliability assessments of current and projected crypto-asset mining operations on electricity system reliability and adequacy. If these reliability assessments find current or anticipated risks to the power system as a result crypto-asset mining, these entities should consider developing, updating, and enforcing reliability standards and emergency operations procedures to ensure system reliability and adequacy under the growth of crypto-asset mining.\n- Obtain data to understand, monitor, and mitigate impacts: The Energy Information Administration and other federal agencies should consider collecting and analyzing information from crypto-asset miners and electric utilities in a privacy-preserving manner to enable evidence-based decisions on the energy and climate implications of crypto-assets. Data should include mining energy usage and fuel mix, power purchase agreements, environmental justice implications, and demand response participation. OSTP could establish a National Science and Technology Council subcommittee to coordinate with other relevant agencies to assess the energy use of major crypto-assets.\n- Advance energy efficiency standards: The Administration should consider working with Congress to enable DOE and encourage other federal regulators to promulgate and regularly update energy conservation standards for crypto-asset mining equipment, blockchains, and other operations.\n- Encourage transparency and improvements in environmental performance: Crypto-asset industry associations, including mining firms and equipment manufacturers, should be encouraged to publicly report crypto-asset mining locations, annual electricity usage, greenhouse gas emissions using existing protocols, and electronic waste recycling performance.\n- Further research to improve understanding and innovation: For improved analytical capabilities that can enhance the accuracy of electricity usage estimates and sustainability, the National Science Foundation, DOE, EPA and other relevant agencies could promote and support research and development priorities that improve the environmental sustainability of digital assets, including crypto-asset impact modeling, assessment of environmental justice impacts, and understanding beneficial uses for grid management and environmental mitigation. Research and development priorities should emphasize innovations in next-generation digital asset technologies that advance U.S. goals in security, privacy, equity, and resilience, as well as U.S. climate goals.']	['<urn:uuid:be9db2b5-c519-4982-8d75-b61f3e28b472>', '<urn:uuid:c2b3e9e1-0ef3-465d-9a23-92fdbe2309a6>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	10	52	2402
60	biofuel plant efficiency power heat improvement techniques	Palm oil mills can achieve very high energy efficiency levels through several key improvements. The main techniques include optimizing the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system, addressing high steam consumption in sterilization, managing steam demand fluctuations, and lowering process steam temperature from 143°C to near 110°C. CHP systems can reach up to 90% efficiency by utilizing both electricity and heat, compared to 35% in conventional generation. The optimization potential includes improving air removal methods during sterilization, isolating steam demand fluctuations from affecting the CHP plant, and configuring the CHP plant for higher power output while maintaining heat supply for processing.	['Palm oil mills can unleash renewable energy at enormously high energy efficiency levels arising from the unique characteristics of their operating parameters.\nPalm oil mills are in an enviable position to harness increased quantities of renewable energy at very high efficiencies, the potential of which remains largely unrealised.\nAt the moment, palm oil mills tend to focus on milling operations. They are predominantly concerned with the core business revolving around the processing of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) and oil extraction rates. However, a new premise envisions mills operating as centres of energy efficiency.\nThe bulk of the FFB mass from the field transported to the mill for processing is discharged as biomass residue. Of this residue, the energy content of the mesocarp fibre and palm kernel shells are being used in inefficient ways to provide the energy needs of the mill. In actual fact, palm oil mills can unleash renewable energy at enormously high energy efficiency levels arising from the unique characteristics of their operating parameters.\nThe extraction and utilisation of renewable energy inherent in the fibre and shells performed at high efficiencies can meet not only the energy needs of the mill but yield abundant surplus clean energy for other use. Optimising the harnessing of the renewable energy at the mill serves to reduce the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of palm oil production, and hence its carbon footprint.\nMills are still continuing to run processes that were designed at a time when the awareness of renewable energy and energy efficiency was not at the fore.\nToday, however, innovative methods and systems are readily available to release this inherent renewable energy potential through vastly improved energy efficiencies at mills. A pioneering approach involves addressing four problem areas, namely, high steam consumption for process heating, rapid and sharp fluctuations in process steam demand, relatively high process steam temperature and low power-to-heat ratio of the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant employed in the mill energy system.\nThe current steam consumption of the palm oil extraction process is excessive arising from the sterilisation process. The initial process in the extraction of palm oil involves thermal treatment of the FFB in large steriliser vessels which consumes a major portion of process steam. The effective removal of residual air at the onset of the sterilisation process from within the stack of FFB placed in cages in the steriliser vessel is necessary for it to attain timely adequate and uniform temperature to effect thermal treatment. However, palm oil mills employ outdated air release methods that are not efficient and incur a vastly inefficient use of process steam leading to its high consumption. Innovation avails an opportunity for efficient air removal at the commencement of the sterilisation cycle at those mills using conventional horizontal sterilisers. This permits adequate thermal treatment with a shorter time for sterilisation, use of process steam at a lower temperature and a lower steam consumption, all of which translate into drastic improvements in energy efficiencies and water consumption.\nAnother major and common problem in palm oil mills today is the rapidly fluctuating process steam demand with sharp peaks and troughs, originating from the sterilisation of FFB as a batch process. This leads to an unsteady operation of the CHP plant and steam blow off to the atmosphere at several locations, wasting large amounts of energy and water. It could also lead to upsets in process steam pressure that may affect process temperatures. A simple method is available to tackle the fluctuations in process steam demand of the palm oil extraction process to allow the plant to operate in steady state and efficiently. The method involves isolating the fluctuations from affecting the steam boiler and the steam turbine of the CHP plant.\nAt present steam for process heating is set at a temperature of 143 ºC and 4 bar pressure. However, the palm oil extraction process requires temperatures of no more than 110 ºC. Hence the current temperature of steam use should be questioned. On the contrary, if the pressure is held steady at all times, the process steam temperature can be safely lowered close to 110 ºC with a lower pressure by way of improving heat transfer to various processes. The lowering of process steam pressure could vastly improve power output by the CHP plant and achieve a higher energy-efficiency usage of the biomass.\nThe most efficient way of exploiting biomass for energy is through the principle of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) or otherwise known as Cogeneration where the residual heat from a power generation process is recovered as usable heat for a downstream process. This allows making more efficient use of fuel inputs to achieve high energy conversion efficiencies and maximise carbon emissions reduction.\nWhile palm oil mills have already been using the cogeneration principle for quite some time and are now mostly self-sufficient in energy supply, the full potential of the biomass energy has yet to be optimised.\nAt present CHP plants are configured to generate low power output to cater for the low power-to-heat demand ratio of the palm oil extraction process at the mill. However, the requirement to supply usable heat to the palm oil extraction process at a low temperature presents a potential to configure and operate the CHP plant at much higher power output, except that this capability is currently impeded by the fluctuating demand for process heat and high process steam pressure. Achieving a steady state operation of the CHP plant together with the lower process steam pressure as proposed above paves the way to generate large additional power at the mill for export commensurate with the process heat consumption levels and provides high energy-efficiency conversion for the biomass to optimise the energy usage at the mill. However this potential can only be realised in those locations where the additional power can be exported and distributed to the local networks and grid. A lack of power export facility may therefore be a limitation to achieving the optimal energy conversion potential of the CHP at the mill.\nIt is a misconception in the palm oil industry that mills cannot contribute to energy efficiency by way of additional power generation (via CHP using surplus biomass) unless there are adjacent heat consuming plants to utilise the additional heat output arising therefrom. On the contrary, the existing low power to heat demand ratio of the mill already provides the opportunity to generate more power, maximising energy conversion efficiency, regardless of whether or not there are nearby heat users. In other words, more electric power can be generated with the existing amount of steam flowing through a steam turbine.\nCHP plant at the mills need only be optimally configured to fit the usable heat needs of the mill, while the surplus biomass could be conserved for CHP implementation at a location elsewhere, wherever there is a heat consumer. Such operating practice would not result in any loss in energy or carbon emissions reduction potential in the biomass utilisation. What matters for carbon emissions reduction is the high efficiency of energy usage at the mill rather than the quantum of renewable energy produced at the mill.\nIf the above innovative approach is implemented in a palm oil mill it could demonstrate that mills can be converted into centres of clean energy production unleashing its hidden potential. This can increase the availability of renewable energy at palm oil mill and thereby reduce the carbon footprint of palm oil production by 0.79 tCO2e per tonne of crude palm oil.\nAdditional revenue streams from the sale of electricity and biomass fuel can represent a significant hike in income for a mill at present energy prices. The twist here is that environmental improvements can surprisingly, also improve profits.\nThis article originally appeared in Sustainable palm oil conversation and debate', 'Combined heat and power systems in the biomass industry means the simultaneous generation of multiple forms of useful energy (usually mechanical and thermal) from biomass resources in a single, integrated system. In a conventional electricity generation systems, about 35% of the energy potential contained in the fuel is converted on average into electricity, whilst the rest is lost as waste heat. CHP systems use both electricity and heat and therefore can achieve an efficiency of up to 90%.\nCHP technologies are well suited for sustainable development projects because they are socio-economically attractive and technologically mature and reliable. In developing countries, cogeneration can easily be integrated in many industries, especially agriculture and food processing, taking advantage of the biomass residues of the production process. This has the dual benefits of lowering fuel costs and solving waste disposal issues.\nCHP systems consist of a number of individual components—prime mover (heat engine), generator, heat recovery, and electrical interconnection—configured into an integrated whole. Prime movers for CHP units include reciprocating engines, combustion or gas turbines, steam turbines, microturbines, and fuel cells. A typical CHP system provides:\n- Distributed generation of electrical and/or mechanical power.\n- Waste-heat recovery for heating, cooling, or process applications.\n- Seamless system integration for a variety of technologies, thermal applications, and fuel types.\nThe success of any biomass-fuelled CHP project is heavily dependent on the availability of a suitable biomass feedstock freely available in urban and rural areas.\n|Rural Resources||Urban Resources|\n|Forest residues||Urban wood waste|\n|Wood wastes||Municipal solid wastes|\n|Crop residues||Agro-industrial wastes|\n|Energy crops||Food processing residues|\nReciprocating or internal combustion engines (ICEs) are among the most widely used prime movers to power small electricity generators. Advantages include large variations in the size range available, fast start-up, good efficiencies under partial load efficiency, reliability, and long life.\nSteam turbines are the most commonly employed prime movers for large power outputs. Steam at lower pressure is extracted from the steam turbine and used directly or is converted to other forms of thermal energy. System efficiencies can vary between 15 and 35% depending on the steam parameters.\nCo-firing of biomass with coal and other fossil fuels can provide a short-term, low-risk, low-cost option for producing renewable energy while simultaneously reducing the use of fossil fuels. Biomass can typically provide between 3 and 15 percent of the input energy into the power plant. Most forms of biomass are suitable for co-firing.\nSteam engines are also proven technology but suited mainly for constant speed operation in industrial environments. Steam engines are available in different sizes ranging from a few kW to more than 1 MWe.\nA gas turbine system requires landfill gas, biogas, or a biomass gasifier to produce the gas for the turbine. This biogas must be carefully filtered of particulate matter to avoid damaging the blades of the gas turbine.\nStirling engines utilize any source of heat provided that it is of sufficiently high temperature. A wide variety of heat sources can be used but the Stirling engine is particularly well-suited to biomass fuels. Stirling engines are available in the 0.5 to 150 kWe range and a number of companies are working on its further development.\nA micro-turbine recovers part of the exhaust heat for preheating the combustion air and hence increases overall efficiency to around 20-30%. Several competing manufacturers are developing units in the 25-250kWe range. Advantages of micro-turbines include compact and light weight design, a fairly wide size range due to modularity, and low noise levels.\nFuel cells are electrochemical devices in which hydrogen-rich fuel produces heat and power. Hydrogen can be produced from a wide range of renewable and non-renewable sources. A future high temperature fuel cell burning biomass might be able to achieve greater than 50% efficiency.']	['<urn:uuid:a1d564eb-b7de-4744-9e2a-e0f2dd4a7bb2>', '<urn:uuid:974ee8db-3411-4176-be50-6e30befa03ae>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	7	100	1913
61	Is cloud storage or Kudu better for atomic operations?	Cloud storage is less suitable for atomic operations, as it doesn't support transactions. Kudu, while not fully atomic for multi-row operations, does provide strict-serializable semantics for single-tablet writes and ensures changes are made visible atomically after replication.	"[""It’s important to choose the right storage mechanisms, both for local device storage and for cloud based server storage. A good storage engine makes sure your information is saved reliably, reduces bandwidth, and improves responsiveness. The right storage caching strategy is a core building block for enabling offline mobile web experiences.\nThis article provides a brief foundation for evaluating storage APIs and services, after which we’ll provide a comparison table and some general guidance. In the near future, we plan to add resources for understanding selected storage topics in greater depth.\nLet’s start by understanding some of the dimensions by which we can analyze data storage for web apps. Later, we’ll use this framework to enumerate and evaluate the many storage options available to web developers.\nThe model for storing units of data determines how data is organized internally, which impacts ease of use, cost and performance of storage and retrieval requests.\nStructured: Data stored in tables with predefined fields, as is typical of SQL based database management systems, lends itself well to flexible and dynamic queries, where the full range of query types may not be be known a priori. A prominent example of a structured datastore in the browser is IndexedDB.\nKey/Value: Key/Value datastores, and related NoSQL databases, offer the ability to store and retrieve unstructured data indexed by a unique key. Key/Value datastores are like hash tables in that they allow constant-time access to indexed, opaque data. Prominent examples of key/value datastores are the Cache API in the browser and Apache Cassandra on the server.\nByte Streams: This simple model stores data as a variable length, opaque string of bytes, leaving any form of internal organization to the application layer. This model is particularly good for file systems and other hierarchically organized blobs of data. Prominent examples of byte stream datastores include file systems and cloud storage services.\nStorage methods for web apps can be analyzed according to the scope over which data is made persistent.\nSession Persistence: Data in this category is retained only as long as a single web session or browser tab remains active. An example of a storage mechanism with session persistence is the Session Storage API.\nDevice Persistence: Data in this category is retained across sessions and browser tabs/windows, within a particular device. An example of a storage mechanism with device persistence is the Cache API.\nGlobal Persistence: Data in this category is retained across sessions and devices. As such, it is the most robust form of data persistence. An example of a storage mechanism with global persistence is Google Cloud Storage.\nDevelopers should choose an API best suited to their problem domain; however, they should also take into account the fact that standardized and well established APIs are preferable to custom or proprietary interfaces, because they tend to be longer lived and more widely supported. They may also enjoy a broader knowledge base and a richer developer ecosystem.\nOften, it is important for a collection of related storage operations to succeed or fail atomically. Database management systems have traditionally supported this feature using the transaction model, where related updates may be grouped into arbitrary units. While not always necessary, this is a convenient, and sometimes essential, feature in some problem domains.\nSome storage APIs are synchronous in the sense that storage or retrieval requests block the currently active thread until the request is completed. This is particularly onerous in web browsers, where the storage request is sharing the main thread with the UI. For efficiency and performance reasons, asynchronous storage APIs are to be preferred.\nIn this section we take a look at the current APIs available for web developers and compare them across the dimensions described above.\n|API||Data Model||Persistence||Browser Support||Transactions||Sync/Async|\n|File system||Byte stream||device||52%||No||Async|\n|cloud storage||byte stream||global||100%||No||Both|\nAs noted above, it’s wise to choose APIs that are widely supported across as many browsers as possible and which offer asynchronous call models, to maximize interoperability with the UI. These criteria lead naturally to the following technology choices:\nFor offline storage, use the Cache API. This API is available in any browser that supports Service Worker technology necessary for creating offline apps. The Cache API is ideal for storing resources associated with a known URL.\nFor storing application state and user-generated content, use IndexedDB. This enables users to work offline in more browsers than just those that support the Cache API.\nFor global byte stream storage: use a Cloud Storage service.\nThis combination satisfies the basic storage needs for many mobile web apps.\nDebugging storage in Chrome DevTools\nCheck out the following docs to learn more about using Chrome DevTools to inspect and debug your web storage API of choice. APIs not mentioned here are either not supported in DevTools or are not applicable.\nIf you're using multiple storage APIs, check out the Clear Storage feature of DevTools. This feature lets you clear multiple stores with a single button click. See Clear service workers, storage, databases, and caches for more information.\nWhere to go next…\nNow that we’ve reviewed some of the relevant ways to think about storage mechanisms and compared the most popular APIs and services available today, we'll be adding more content soon to dive more deeply into one or more topics of interest:"", 'Apache Kudu Transaction Semantics\nThis is a brief introduction to Kudu’s transaction and consistency semantics. Kudu\'s core philosophy is to provide transactions with simple, strong semantics, without sacrificing performance or the ability to tune to different requirements. Kudu’s transactional semantics and architecture are inspired by state-of-the-art systems such as Spanner and Calvin. For an in-depth technical exposition of what is mentioned here, see the technical report.\nKudu currently allows the following operations:\nScans are read operations that can traverse multiple tablets and read information with some consistency or correctness guarantees. Scans can also perform time-travel reads. That is, you can set a scan timestamp from the past and get back results that reflect the state of the storage engine at that point in time.\nWrite operations are sets of rows to be inserted, updated, or deleted in the storage engine, in a single tablet with multiple replicas. Write operations do not have separate ""read sets"", that is, they do not scan existing data before performing the write. Each write is only concerned with the previous state of the rows that are about to change. Writes are not ""committed"" explicitly by the user. Instead, they are committed automatically by the system, after completion.\nWhile Kudu is designed to eventually be fully ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable), multi-tablet transactions have not yet been implemented. As such, the following discussion focuses on single-tablet write operations, and only briefly touches multi-tablet reads.\nSingle Tablet Write Operations\nKudu employs Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) and the Raft consensus algorithm. Each write operation in Kudu must go through the following order of operations:\n- The tablet\'s leader acquires all locks for the rows that it will change.\n- The leader assigns the write a timestamp before the write is submitted for replication. This timestamp will be the write’s tag in MVCC.\n- After a majority of replicas have acknowledged the write, the rows are changed.\n- After the changes are complete, they are made visible to concurrent writes and reads, atomically.\nAll replicas of a tablet observe the same process. Therefore, if a write operation is assigned timestamp n, and changes row x, a second write operation at timestamp m > n is guaranteed to see the new value of x.\nThis strict ordering of lock acquisition and timestamp assignment is enforced to be consistent across all replicas of a tablet through consensus. Therefore, write operations are ordered with regard to clock-assigned timestamps, relative to other writes in the same tablet. In other words, writes have strict-serializable semantics.\nIn case of multi-row write operations, while they are Isolated and Durable in an ACID sense, they are not yet fully Atomic. The failure of a single write in a batch operation will not roll back the entire operation, but produce per-row errors.\nWriting to Multiple Tablets\nKudu does not support transactions that span multiple tablets. However, consistent snapshot reads are possible (with caveats, as explained below). Writes from a Kudu client are optionally buffered in memory until they are flushed and sent to the tablet server. When a client’s session is flushed, the rows for each tablet are batched together, and sent to the tablet server which hosts the leader replica of the tablet. Since there are no inter-tablet transactions, each of these batches represents a single, independent write operation with its own timestamp. However, the client API provides the option to impose some constraints on the assigned timestamps and on how writes to different tablets are observed by clients.\nKudu was designed to be externally consistent, that is, preserving consistency when operations span multiple tablets and even multiple data centers. In practice this means that if a write operation changes item x at tablet A, and a following write operation changes item y at tablet B, you might want to enforce that if the change to y is observed, the change to x must also be observed. There are many examples where this can be important. For example, if Kudu is storing clickstreams for further analysis, and two clicks follow each other but are stored in different tablets, subsequent clicks should be assigned subsequent timestamps so that the causal relationship between them is captured.\nKudu’s default external consistency mode is called CLIENT_PROPAGATED. This mode causes writes from a single client to be automatically externally consistent. In the clickstream scenario above, if the two clicks are submitted by different client instances, the application must manually propagate timestamps from one client to the other for the causal relationship to be captured. Timestamps between clients a and b can be propagated as follows:\n- Java Client\nCall AsyncKuduClient#getLastPropagatedTimestamp() on client a, propagate the timestamp to client b, and call AsyncKuduClient#setLastPropagatedTimestamp() on client b.\n- C++ Client\nCall KuduClient::GetLatestObservedTimestamp() on client a, propagate the timestamp to client b, and call KuduClient::SetLatestObservedTimestamp() on client b.\nKudu also has an experimental implementation of an external consistency model (used in Google’s Spanner), called COMMIT_WAIT. COMMIT_WAIT works by tightly synchronizing the clocks on all machines in the cluster. Then, when a write occurs, timestamps are assigned and the results of the write are not made visible until enough time has passed so that no other machine in the cluster could possibly assign a lower timestamp to a following write.\nWhen using this mode, the latency of writes is tightly tied to the accuracy of clocks on all the cluster hosts, and using this mode with loose clock synchronization causes writes to either take a long time to complete, or even time out.\nThe COMMIT_WAIT consistency mode may be selected as follows:\n- Java Client\n- C++ Client\nRead Operations (Scans)\nScans are read operations performed by clients that may span one or more rows across one or more tablets. When a server receives a scan request, it takes a snapshot of the MVCC state and then proceeds in one of two ways depending on the read mode selected by the user. The mode may be selected as follows:\n- Java Client\n- C++ Client\nThe following modes are available in both clients:\nThis is the default read mode. The server takes a snapshot of the MVCC state and proceeds with the read immediately. Reads in this mode only yield \'Read Committed\' isolation.\nIn this read mode, scans are consistent and repeatable. A timestamp for the snapshot is selected either by the server, or set explicitly by the user through KuduScanner::SetSnapshotMicros(). Explicitly setting the timestamp is recommended.\nThe server waits until this timestamp is \'safe\'; that is, until all write operations that have a lower timestamp have completed and are visible). This delay, coupled with an external consistency method, will eventually allow Kudu to have full strict-serializable semantics for reads and writes. However, this is still a work in progress and some anomalies are still possible. Only scans in this mode can be fault-tolerant.\nSelecting between read modes requires balancing the trade-offs and making a choice that fits your workload. For instance, a reporting application that needs to scan the entire database might need to perform careful accounting operations, so that scan may need to be fault-tolerant, but probably doesn’t require a to-the-microsecond up-to-date view of the database. In that case, you might choose READ_AT_SNAPSHOT and select a timestamp that is a few seconds in the past when the scan starts. On the other hand, a machine learning workload that is not ingesting the whole data set and is already statistical in nature might not require the scan to be repeatable, so you might choose READ_LATEST instead for better scan performance.\nKnown Issues and Limitations\nThere are several gaps and corner cases that currently prevent Kudu from being strictly-serializable in certain situations.\nSupport for COMMIT_WAIT is experimental and requires careful tuning of the time-synchronization protocol, such as NTP (Network Time Protocol). Its use in production environments is discouraged.\n- If external consistency is a requirement and you decide to use COMMIT_WAIT, the time-synchronization protocol needs to be tuned carefully. Each\ntransaction will wait 2x the maximum clock error at the time of execution, which is usually in the 100 msec. to 1 sec. range with the default settings, maybe more. Thus, transactions would take at\nleast 200 msec. to 2 sec. to complete when using the default settings and may even time out.\nA local server should be used as a time server. We’ve performed experiments using the default NTP time source available in a Google Compute Engine data center and were able to obtain a reasonable tight max error bound, usually varying between 12-17 milliseconds.\nThe following parameters should be adjusted in /etc/ntp.conf to tighten the maximum error:\nserver my_server.org iburst minpoll 1 maxpoll 8\ntinker dispersion 500\ntinker allan 0\nOn a leader change, READ_AT_SNAPSHOT scans at a snapshot whose timestamp is beyond the last write, may yield non-repeatable reads (see KUDU-1188).\n- If repeatable snapshot reads are a requirement, use READ_AT_SNAPSHOT with a timestamp that is slightly in the past (between 2-5 seconds, ideally). This will circumvent the anomaly described above. Even when the anomaly has been addressed, back-dating the timestamp will always make scans faster, since they are unlikely to block.\nImpala scans are currently performed as READ_LATEST and have no consistency guarantees.\nIn AUTO_BACKGROUND_FLUSH mode, or when using ""async"" flushing mechanisms, writes applied to a single client session may get reordered due to the concurrency of flushing the data to the server. This is particularly noticeable if a single row is quickly updated with different values in succession. This phenomenon affects all client API implementations. Workarounds are described in the respective API documentation for FlushMode or AsyncKuduSession. See KUDU-1767.']"	['<urn:uuid:7103c55e-e25e-4825-9dab-1dcd6063569b>', '<urn:uuid:57063ce4-4e18-4c41-a70c-78b7d9f59d67>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	9	37	2471
62	manufacturing benefits drawbacks 3d printing cars quality assurance tradeoffs mass production quality control	3D printing in car manufacturing offers benefits like reduced tool production costs (up to 90% for companies like Opel) and the ability to target smaller niche markets with customized designs. However, current technology has drawbacks - it's slower than traditional methods, taking minutes or hours compared to seconds for injection molding. From a quality control perspective, while 3D printing enables on-demand manufacturing and reduces inventory costs, strict quality control checkpoints are crucial to ensure consistency, meet industry standards, and maintain high product quality. This oversight of manufacturing processes helps reduce resource consumption and prevents costly recalls, though the technology currently makes 100% 3D-printed vehicles impractical for mass production.	['Car manufacturers and designers are already familiar with 3D printing because they’ve been using it for prototyping for decades. But will the technology ever be a practical way to mass-manufacture vehicles?\nFor drivers, perhaps the ultimate sci-fi 3D printing dream would be to view a few cars on a screen, choose one, and tweak the design. Maybe you want more legroom or a larger engine, or add a few tastefully positioned shark fins. When you’re satisfied, the system checks your design for problems, your personalized car is printed at your local 3D printing service, and it delivers itself to you later the same day.\nManufacturers, understandably, have a more practical view of 3D printing’s current promise. As the scale of a production run is reduced, 3D printing’s production cost per unit eventually becomes cheaper than traditional mass manufacturing, because there’s no need to build specialized tools, molds, and so on. However, at the current early stage of the technology, the actual cost per unit is still rather expensive for most use cases.\nNevertheless, 3D printing could soon allow manufacturers to target smaller niche markets than current manufacturing methods, including niches based on design, functionality and performance. And eventually, 3D printing might permit niche “markets” that consist of only one person—who likes shark fins.\nReshaping the auto industry\n3D printing also promises to reshape the auto industry in other ways, some of which could be disruptive for traditional business models. On-demand manufacturing of individual vehicle parts reduces inventory and storage costs, smooths out manufacturing cycles, and may reduce transport costs by moving production facilities closer to end users. Those production facilities could also be smaller, because a single 3D printer could produce a variety of components for different vehicles, without retooling. Small-scale, just-in-time manufacturing may prolong vehicle life and reduce environmental waste, by allowing production of replacement parts to continue indefinitely.\nThose product pipeline changes are still very much in the future, however. Current 3D printing technology tends to be slow, requiring minutes or hours, unlike injection molding, or stamping and cutting a metal sheet, which takes a few seconds.\n3D printing has also tended to focus on making small components, but companies developing automotive manufacturing techniques, such as Local Motors (in cooperation with Cincinnati Inc.) and Stratasys, are already working with machines large enough to print an entire car.\nRethinking design, for new materials\nTo make the most of 3D printing, designers will need to rethink how they work with materials. Some materials traditionally used in vehicles may never be suitable for 3D printing. Meanwhile, some materials that are ideal for current 3D printing techniques are not suitable for automotive use, for reasons of appearance, durability, or safety.\nYet, 3D printing offers new opportunities for materials that are difficult to handle with traditional techniques. For example, cheap and lightweight aluminum can be laser sintered into complex, seamless shapes that offer attractive new possibilities for car styling. 3D printing offers designers’ new freedom in shaping components, so they can improve strength while reducing weight, by printing precisely designed parts.\nWith current 3D printing technology, making 100% of a vehicle probably isn’t possible, nor is it practical. However, 3D printing of vehicle bodies and numerous smaller components is already happening, for small-scale test projects. For example, the LA Times recently reported that Disney World is considering deploying visitor shuttle vehicles from companies including Local Motors. The latter company’s Olli autonomous electric shuttle has a body and chassis which is largely 3D printed, and it’s being trialed on public roads. (Mouser is cooperating with Local Motors on a project that combines the Strati 3D-printed electric car with a self-launched semi-autonomous drone camera.)\nWhile 3D printers aren’t building many cars yet, they are making the machines that make cars. Responding rapidly to changing demands and new designs, a 3D printer can quickly produce new tools, jigs, and fixtures, which are then used in more conventional production processes to make thousands of vehicle parts.\nGerman car-maker Opel was able to reduce tool production time from weeks to days and cut costs by up to 90%. “Besides the cut in tool production time and considerable cost reductions, customized tools are a third important benefit of 3D printing. We can now produce more complex shapes than we could via conventional manufacturing. This lets us adapt the tool to the worker and the specific car,” said Sascha Holl of Opel’s Tool Design department.\nWhat’s next for automotive 3D printing? During the next few years, large manufacturers will likely introduce a hybrid process combining some 3D printing with traditional manufacturing techniques. As time goes by, the vehicle’s 3D-printed proportion will increase, as the technology improves and designers figure out how to make the best use of it.\n3D printing seems particularly suited for manufacturing the cars’ cosmetic features, such as body panels and interior features. These features allow wide variability and have greater potential for customer input, compared to functional components such as engine parts. So, offering customers a semi-personalized vehicle built around a standard mass-produced chassis seems achievable. Car manufacturers like Ford are already running preliminary trials of such processes.\nExtreme customization raises issues of safety, fuel economy, and roadworthiness. Giving end-user customization the same legal status as aftermarket modifications could be a solution. So, if you do add those shark fins to your car, you might have to sign a waiver absolving the manufacturer of responsibility.\nRudy Ramos is the Project Manager for the Technical Content Marketing team at Mouser Electronics.

The most important aspect of a good QC program is that it ensures the items being manufactured meet the standards set by the industry, our company, and of course the customer. By putting a QC program in place both the parts being manufactured and the master engineers creating them are being monitored. This system not only ensures our customers receive parts of the highest quality, QC also helps us to save money by increasing efficiency and reducing costs.\nHow Quality Control Should Work\nBefore implementing a quality control program, you should approach the program with a certain amount of caution. If the method of implementation doesn’t work as planned, it could cost the company a lot of money. To get things started you need to know what the quality standards for each product are. Establish how many of the items being manufactured will be tested during a production run. The company will also need to establish a system of communication between the shop floor and management when flawed parts are found.\nStandard QC Roles in US Manufacturing\nThere are many ways to reduce the risks involved in the manufacture of parts. While risk reduction is often associated with having the right safety training and equipment, there is more to it than this. When a series of parts fail or simply don’t meet the required standards set by the client, a recall or a run of replacement parts can be very costly, not only in dollars and cents but also in reputation. Having a quality control system in place helps ensure the client always receives parts that meet their standards.\nReduced Consumption of Resources\nBy ensuring that each part coming from the production line meets the necessary quality standards, fewer raw materials are used. Not only will this help reduce overhead costs, but it will also improve your reputation with your clients as a company focused on protecting the environment.\nEffective and Efficient Compliance\nEach industry such as CNC machining has its own standards with regard to the quality standards in place. If the company fails to follow the compliance standards and methods for the industry, it could end up with a production bottleneck. Having numerous QC checkpoints not only reduces the risk of bottlenecks but also helps reduce overall costs by stopping the process at the earliest point along the production line.\nConsistency Is Crucial\nThe quality of parts turned out play a large role in the reputation of the company. Along with affecting the company’s reputation, lack of consistency leads to higher overhead costs as the failed parts must be remanufactured. QC plays a major role in ensuring the consistency of the parts being made.\nBetter Final Quality Products\nOf course, when a strict quality control program is in place, the end result is consistent quality parts coming from the production line. QC is designed to ensure that each item made meets the appropriate standards. The final result is parts of the highest quality, happy customers, and increased profits without increased costs.']	['<urn:uuid:c1577ff0-046e-46d4-855c-4392bc385f62>', '<urn:uuid:05e5929c-f6ed-449b-81f3-d768e45864ad>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	13	108	1500

64	What makes Carson City Mint coins valuable?	Carson City Mint coins are highly valued due to their rarity and historical significance as links to the American West. The mint operated from 1870 to 1893, during a time when most coins were used solely for commerce and few people collected them. Most Carson City Mint coins were produced in very limited numbers, making them particularly scarce today. The value of these coins is demonstrated by pieces like the Liberty Seated half-dollar, which starts at $40 in Good-4 condition, and exceptional pieces like the unique 1873-CC No Arrows dime that sold for $1.84 million, becoming the most expensive Carson City Mint coin ever sold at auction.	['We write about products and services that we use. This page may contain affiliate links for which we receive a commission.\nIn the 19th century, Christian Gobrecht’s popular “Liberty Seated” design was the most prominent image on a coin. It also had the greatest longevity of the United States coinage of the time.\nThe Seated Liberty design was first seen in 1836 on a limited number of silver dollars. It entered widespread use in 1837, when the half-dime and dime were first struck with obverses bearing the Seated Liberty design.\nThe Liberty Seated design was used on several coins — including the quarter and the dollar coin.\nGobrecht, The Engraver Of Seated Liberty Coins\nChristian Gobrecht was a German-American born in Hanover, Pennsylvania in 1785.\nHis early life saw him develop as an artist and engraver. He was also an apprentice for a clockmaker, during which time he honed his skills as a respected engraver.\nAfter moving to Philadelphia in 1811, he eventually became well known for his engraving work.\nBy the 1820s, Gobrecht had begun engraving dies and had an interest in working as an engraver for the U.S. Mint. Though he was not offered the position of head engraver for years, he did do some important work for the U.S. Mint producing some punches.\nIn the late summer of 1835, Gobrecht was officially hired as a second engraver after primary engraver at the time, William Kneass, suffered a debilitating stroke.\nSeated Liberty Silver Dollars\nWork soon began on a new design for the silver dollar — which became the first coin to bear the Seated Liberty design that famously adorned most of U.S. coin denominations during the bulk of 1800s.\n- Silver dollars produced from 1836 through 1839 are popularly referred to as Gobrecht dollars.\n- Silver dollars produced from 1840 to 1873 are called Liberty Seated dollars, even though they still bear the Seated Liberty design.\nSeated Liberty Design On All Coins\nBy 1840, the Liberty Seated design had been placed on the obverse of all coins — ranging from the half dime through the silver dollar.\nThe Liberty Seated design also appeared on the briefly struck 20-cent piece (1875-1878).\nGobrecht passed away in 1844, but his renowned Seated Liberty design would go on to grace our nation’s coins until 1891.\nSeated Liberty Coin Changes\nLiberty Seated coins have a very strong following of dedicated collectors.\nOf interest to coin collectors are the several minor varieties that were made to various aspects of the Seated Liberty coins over the several decades that the design remained in use.\nLiberty Seated coin varieties include:\n- The addition or removal of arrows around the date on the obverse\n- The addition and removal of stars and rays\n- The addition of a ribbon bearing the motto “In God We Trust” over the eagle on the reverse of quarters, half-dollars, and dollars\nSeated Liberty Type Values\nValues of for Liberty Seated coins vary. “Type” values for each of the Seated Liberty denominations can be found below.\nThese are the lowest average prices you can expect to pay for certain Liberty Seated coins in a grade of Good-4 (which is generally considered the lowest-acceptable grade for collecting these coins). Prices run higher for many of the varieties and scarcer dates:\n- Liberty Seated Half-Dime (1837-1873): $15+\n- Liberty Seated Dime (1837-1891): $15+\n- Liberty Seated 20-Cent Piece (1875-1878): $90+\n- Liberty Seated Quarter (1838-1891): $20+\n- Liberty Seated Half-Dollar (1839-1891): $40+\n- Gobrecht Dollar (1836-1839): $12,000+\n- Liberty Seated Dollar (1840-1873): $250+\nAll values above are from the Guide Book of United States Coins by R.S.

The highlight of the night was the coveted ‘1873-CC No Arrows Liberty Seated’ dime, which sold for a record $1.84 million USD – the most expensive dime ever sold at auction. Attended by nearly 250 enthusiasts, collectors, investors and dealers and resulting in nearly $10 million in total sales, the auction of the Battle Born Collection took place as part of the Stack’s Bowers Galleries ‘Rarities Night Auction’ at the American Numismatic Association (ANA) World’s Fair of Money held at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia.\nThe Unique 1873-CC No Arrows Liberty Seated dime, graded MS-65 by PCGS and pedigreed to the famous Louis E. Eliasberg, Sr. Collection, is the only example known to exist; it is the “holy grail” among collectors of the extremely popular Carson City Mint. It is now the most expensive circulation strike federal silver coin sold at auction, the most expensive Liberty Seated coin sold at auction, and the most expensive Carson City Mint coin ever sold at auction. “Most coins from the Carson City Mint were used solely for commerce,” says Chris Napolitano, president of Stack’s Bowers Galleries. “The mint existed from 1870-1893, and at that time most people were just trying to survive. Coin collecting was a hobby ill-suited to those forging a new West.” Today, coins from the Carson City Mint are highly valued and widely collected due to their rarity and historical significance. Most Carson City Mint coinage issues were originally produced in very limited numbers, and the surviving coins form an indelible link to the romance and history of the American West. As a unique rarity, the 1873-CC No Arrows dime is of even further importance, and its presence in the Stack’s Bowers Galleries 2012 Philadelphia ANA Auction created additional excitement.\nRusty Goe, chief architect of the Battle Born Collection over the last 11 years, purchased the unique 1873-CC No Arrows dime in 2004 for $891,250 from a Bowers and Merena auction. He later sold it into the Battle Born Collection, thus completing the collection. “The sale of the Battle Born Collection is the most significant event in the history of Carson City Mint coin collecting,” commented Goe. “It sets a new standard of excellence in numismatics, and pays homage to the history, legacy and lore of the famed Carson City Mint. The Battle Born Collection appeals to not only Carson City Mint collectors, in fact, but gold coin enthusiasts, specialists in silver coins such as Liberty Seated and Morgan silver dollars, and more generalized collectors with an appreciation for the history of the coinage of the Old West.” The Battle Born Collection is one of just two complete sets of Carson City Mint coinage ever assembled, and it is the only one ever to be sold intact in one auction. All 111 regular issue Carson City Mint coins were sold as part of the Battle Born Collection, including the legendary and unique 1873-CC No Arrows Liberty Seated dime.\nThe Battle Born Collection was sold ‘without reserve,’ meaning all 111 coins were sold to the highest bidders. “The sale of this dime was incredibly exciting,” says Napolitano. “People from all around the world participated in the Rarities Night auction, in person, over the phone, and online through the Internet. There were a few bidders continuing their bids after the million-dollar mark, which kept everyone in the room on the edge of their seats. To be a part of this history making occasion of selling the most expensive dime ever sold at auction is nothing short of extraordinary!” The Battle Born Collection, in particular, certainly saw spirited bidding, as the coins in this collection are so rare and desirable that their inclusion in this year’s ANA World’s Fair of Money Auction represented a once-in-a-lifetime bidding opportunity for many Carson City Mint, silver dollar, and gold coin enthusiasts.\nStack’s Bowers Galleries’ official 2012 Philadelphia ANA Auction started on August 4 and ran through August 10. The live auction featured more than 5,500 lots of U.S. coins and paper money, in addition to the approximately 1,300 lots of world paper money and coins presented by Stack’s Bowers and Ponterio.\nStack’s Bowers Galleries is currently accepting consignments for the Official Auction of the November 2012 Whitman Coin and Collectibles Baltimore Expo and the January 2013 Americana Sale. Stack’s Bowers Galleries is also the Official Auctioneer of the August 2013 ANA World’s Fair of Money that will take place in Chicago, and we are currently accepting consignments for that event, as well.\nAbout Stack’s Bowers Galleries\nStack’s Bowers Galleries, a division of Fortune 500 Company Spectrum Group International Inc., was launched in January 2011, combining the extraordinary histories of Stack’s, the oldest rare coin auction and retail company in America, with Bowers and Merena Auctions, one of the world’s pre-eminent auctioneers of rare coins and paper money. The two companies unite to share a combined legacy that spans more than 100 years, and includes the cataloging and sale of many of the most valuable collections to ever cross an auction block – the John. J. Ford, Jr. and Louis E. Eliasberg collections, the Harry W. Bass, Jr. Collection, and the Norweb Collection, to name just a few. Topping off this amazing numismatic history is the inclusion of the world record for the highest price ever realized at auction for a rare coin, the legendary 1933 Saint Gaudens Double Eagle which realized an astounding $7.59 million (sold in partnership with Sotheby’s). The company is headquartered in Irvine, California, with offices in New York, New Hampshire and Hong Kong. Stack’s Bowers Galleries is the Official Auctioneer for several important numismatic conventions, including the ANA World’s Fair of Money pre-show and convention auctions, and the Whitman Coin and Collectibles Expos in Baltimore, three times yearly, and Philadelphia.']	['<urn:uuid:edf494f5-46da-43d9-9dfe-0392986b2acd>', '<urn:uuid:8b783b6b-7e55-469b-afde-482be82330ce>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	7	107	1809
65	I work at a desk all day - what's the link between posture and office ergonomics?	Posture and office ergonomics are closely connected. Good posture keeps joints and bones in optimal alignment, reducing neck and back pain. To support this, ergonomic products like electric adjustable desks can help improve posture, reduce fatigue, and prevent repetitive motion injuries. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recommends standing at least once every hour to move around, which helps prevent back pain in office workers.	['What is Posture?\nPosture is in reference to how you place your body when you’re sitting, standing or lying down. Having good posture means your body is in proper alignment, and involves training yourself to position your body, against gravity, with the least amount of strain and tension. Sporting the correct posture involves:\n- Your joints and bones all being in optimal alignment\n- Maintaining the spine’s natural curvature\n- Your neck straight\n- Your shoulders parallel with the hips\nWhen the body is in optimal alignment, it decreases the wear and tear on your supportive bodily structures. If you wish to find out about the different types of posture imbalance, and how to correct them, read this NHS article.\nWhy is Posture so Important?\nThe reason posture is so important is because it keeps your joints and bones in optimal alignment, reducing long term neck and back pain. It also allows for painless movement, with your body supporting your weight easily. Any poor posture can result in tension on your tendons, muscles and ligaments, in turn harming your neck and back. Here are some additional benefits of good posture:\nWhen you slouch, your body is in an unnatural position for your abdominal organs. Stooping, hunching over and slouching can interfere with proper digestion, increasing the risk for acid reflux. If you’re experiencing heartburn when you’re slouching, sitting up and correcting your posture can be a simple form of relief.\nImproving muscle and joint function\nGood posture equates to your muscles and other structures functioning properly, avoiding abnormal wear and tear. The manner in which you carry your body dictates how much stress is placed on your joints. Research suggests that correcting posture in the form of physical therapy can help arthritis patients too, stressing the important link between posture and joint health. Correct body alignment can reduce muscle fatigue and strain, helping your joints remain healthy and lubricated.\nWhen thinking about things which improve your mood, posture isn’t one we think of frequently. Looking at it from a physical perspective, your brain and body have two-way communication, meaning your mood affects your posture and vice versa. Studies have shown that slumped and stooped postures can worsen negative thoughts and feelings. Next time you notice your mood sinking, try standing up, sitting up right, having a stretch and taking deep breaths. You may notice a gentle lift in your mood after doing so.\nHow Can I have Correct Posture in my Kindseat?\nTraditionally in meditation, the notion of “uprightness” has been explored as human beings evolved into upright creatures. It relates to the upper body when sitting during meditation and the feeling of being upright. This is applicable to the main five seated positions of meditation as shown below. If you wish to understand more about the history of posture in meditation, read this research paper.\nWhen analysing them more closely, all of the leg positions are different, however from the waist up the structure is very much the same. This is where posture is most important; the same posture can be used in nearly every practice, making it even more important to get it right.\nImportance of a sturdy base\nWhen sitting cross legged, having a strong triangular base for your body to rest on is vital. There are three important parts of your lower body that need to be in the correct position in order to have the best posture:\n- The pelvis\n- The tailbone\n- The sit bones\nThe pelvis needs to be level when meditating in order for everything resting on top of it to be aligned, reducing the risk of injury. The tailbone, found above the pelvis, has a habit of tucking in. This forces the spine to bend into a C shape: the waist falling backward as the head and jaw comes forward. This position is bad for your joints, digestion and can create long term damage. This can also be because of your sit bones being poorly positioned. The centre of your body sits directly above the sit bones meaning if your sit bones aren’t centred, your posture has no stability.\nCreating a solid base for the body to rest on is most easily achieved using a meditation bench, such as the Kindseat; the height provided supports the pelvis and tailbone, whilst aligning the sit bones. When the sitting bones are aligned with the ground by using the Kindseat, the body enters the desired state of “uprightness”.\nHow do I ensure a sturdy base?\nWhilst the support from the Kindseat should make the rest of your posture naturally fall into place, correcting your upper body from the start of your practice is very important. Being correctly aligned in all areas of the body makes for long, comfortable practices. Here is how to achieve just that:\nStep 1: Elongate the spine\nYour spine plays the vital role of uplifting the upper body, think of a string pulling up through your spine to the top of your head when getting into the correct position on your Kindseat.\nStep 2: Resting your hands\nSimply rest them in your lap, or if you prefer on your thighs – whatever feels most natural. If you wish to look into different ways to rest your hands, and the effect this has on your energy, read this Yoga Journal article.\nStep 3: Relaxing your shoulders\nIt’s common to carry a lot of tension in your shoulders, relax them by letting the muscles in your shoulders and back shift away from your neck downwards. You should be creating slight tension pushing your shoulders backwards, strengthening your back whilst opening up the front of your body.\nStep 4: Tucking in the chin\nWhen tucking in your chin, make sure you’re not going too far and looking at your lap. The intention is to find a neutral position for your head and remove the strain of having it lifted.\nStep 5: Opening the jaw\nLoosening the jaw can help the muscles in the face feel more relaxed. Let your jaw hang open, avoid clenching it during your practise\nStep 6: Resting the gaze\nMeditation is a very personal experience, and everything you choose to do should be what feels best for you. This is the same with your gaze, you can either close or open your eyes. From a practical perspective, closing them means a greater chance of falling asleep. If you leave your eyes open, try to not focus too heavily on what’s happening in front of you. Focus on your breath and what you’re feeling.\nWhilst this may seem like a daunting process, by taking time to establish your posture correctly, you will find it much easier to reset your mind, and connect with your practice.', 'Computers can perform repetitive tasks faster and with fewer mistakes than humans, so the first few years of computers being used in the business world were concentrated on automating a wide range of industrial processes.\nThe statistics speak for themselves: Worker productivity in the United States had been increasing at an annual rate of 1 percent to 1.5 percent since the early 1970s, but the productivity rate started to increase dramatically in the mid-1990s, and averaged 2.9 percent from 1995 to 2000. Many economists, noted that this rise in productivity occurred during the same period when computers became common in workplaces, and credit computer-related information technology for the increase.\nWhy Ergonomics Matters\nErgonomics is a science that helps align products to users and jobs to workers. The word ergonomics comes from a combination of two Greek words: ergon, which means “work,” and nomos, which means “natural laws.” Sometimes ergonomics can be referred to as human engineering, biotechnology, or human factors.\nNot only does ergonomics cover items that improve working conditions, it also includes how the products you use in your daily life are designed. But ergonomics can refer not only to the way objects are designed, but also the way they are arranged for optimum use.\nIt’s easy to look at ergonomics as an expense rather than an investment. But think about it this way: many people choose a car for its safety features, believing those features are worth the cost of protecting themselves and their families. Businesses who purchase ergonomic products for their employees demonstrate their commitment to their health and well-being. More and more organizations are beginning to realize the importance of helping their people prevent injuries that can be more costly down the line, when weighed against the costs for sick time, short- or long-term disability, and insurance premiums.\nOne of the most important employee perks is workplace ergonomics, which fosters a safety and health culture as a core value. People recognize the value of walking into a safe workplace; with the knowledge that their employer wants to keep their team healthy, employees are likely to be happier at work. Reducing ergonomic problems leads to fewer sick days, fewer injuries, and can reduce long-term, cumulative issues that can shorten a worker’s career. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons says office workers can help prevent back pain by standing at least once every hour to move around—at least stretch, if not walk around a little.\nErgonomics and Computer Workstations\nA lot of early ergonomics research was directed toward industrial professions. For example, the risks of musculoskeletal disorders for someone who operates a jackhammer may be high, that doesn’t negate the risk for office workers; however, risks to office workers wasn’t immediately recognized. In more recent years, experts have learned that ergonomic products are important in all types of workplaces.\nRepetitive motion injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome can occur when workers are improperly positioned or uncomfortable while working. Musculoskeletal problems can occur in workers in all industries, from the assembly line to the office. And the latest research demonstrates that too much sitting can be detrimental to your overall health.\nMore and more companies are creating ergonomic products for the workplace, like electric adjustable desks and under-desk keyboard trays. These products can help you work more comfortably, which translates into working more safely. Improving your workstation’s ergonomics can help you improve your posture, which in turn helps reduce fatigue, stiffness, and soreness.\nWhether you want to modernize your home office or your workplace, ergonomic products are the way to go—especially electric height adjustable computer workstations. These desks not only have the latest features, they’re ergonomically friendly and will blend perfectly with your modern design.']	['<urn:uuid:31d12d86-4d47-437c-b326-d8247646caf6>', '<urn:uuid:102397f4-0955-41cb-80e5-b678cb44e4a1>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	16	65	1741
66	measuring flour weight vs volume accuracy and types of flour differences for professional baking	Weight measurements are more precise than volume for flour since factors like humidity and sifting affect volume measurements but not weight. Using a scale with 1g resolution ensures consistent results regardless of flour type. Different flours have varying properties - for example, cake flour has 8-10% protein content and is best for fine-textured cakes, while bread flour has 12-14% protein content making it ideal for yeast products. All-purpose flour is a blend with 8-11% protein that works for many purposes but cannot be freely substituted for specialized flours without affecting results.	"['AND MEASURES USED IN RECIPES AND COOKING\n& COOKING ARTICLE\nme, one of the most frustrating times is when I give\nsomeone a recipe and the first thing they ask me to\ndo is to convert all the measurements. Theyre\nnot asking me to convert tablespoons to teaspoons, but\nsome weight measurement to a volumetric measurement.\nFor example, how many cups of flour should be used when\nthe recipe calls for 750 grams? Or, how many tablespoons\nof salt is 20 grams? In cooking, various measurements\nare used depending on need. These include volume, length,\nweight, temperature, and descriptive measurements. Then,\nthere is added confusion when Americans use English\nunits of measure while most of the rest of the world\nuses the metric system.\nMeasuring by weight instead of volume:\nhome cooks have a tradition of using volumetric measures\nfor dry ingredients. Home recipes will list ingredients\nsuch as flour or sugar by volume, e.g. cups or tablespoons,\nwhereas commercial recipes will measure these ingredients\nFrance, weight is generally used for larger quantities.\nVolume is used for a few tablespoons or less, especially\nif the amount is not critical. The problem with measuring\ndry ingredients, such as flour, by volume lies in\nthe fact that the type of flour, humidity, and whether\nor not it is sifted can affect the amount of flour\nactually used. Whether sifted or not, a pound of flour\nis always a pound of flour. Lack of precision in ingredient\nspecifications can also lead to differences when using\nsalt as an example, I measured two tablespoons, five\ntimes, of two different types of salt commonly used\nin French cooking, fin sel (fine salt) and\ngros sel (coarse salt). For each measure, a\ntwo tablespoon measuring cup was dipped into a larger\ncontainer of salt to produce an amount greater than\ntwo tablespoons. A small spatula was then used to\nlevel the top of the salt. In the case of the gros\nsel, the salt was also packed into the measure\nslightly to make sure there were no air pockets. The\nfive gros sel measurements ranged from 21 to\n24 grams (g). All of the fin sel measurements\nweighed 25 g. On average, two tablespoons of fin\nsel weighed 12% more than the gros sel.\nAdditionally, because of the structure of gros\nsel and its inherent moisture, the measurements\nhad a fair amount of imprecision. If a recipe calls\nfor 20 g of salt, it is possible to measure 20 g of\nsalt without the imprecision induced by a measuring\nshaped dry objects like dried fruit and nuts are also\ndifficult to measure precisely with volumetric measures.\nI have seen too many recipes call for a cup of walnuts\nwithout specifying whether they were coarsely chopped,\npieces, halves, or whatever. By weight, no matter\nwhich type of nut was measured, the result would be\nthe same amount of nut meat, whereas measuring with\na measuring cup, varying results would be produced.\nSimply weighing ingredients increases the accuracy\nof the measurement process compared to using volumetric\nmeasures, if good weighing technique is used.\nthe right scale:\nare a number of types of scales currently available\nfor kitchen use.\nscales are the easiest to use and the most accurate,\nassuming the user remembers to zero the scale\nscales are less expensive than electronic scales,\nbut lack precision when measuring small quantities.\nare traditionally the most accurate kitchen scale,\nbut these are usually only found in commercial\nkitchens, and even less and less there.\nchoosing a scale suitable for home cooking, be sure\nto get one with a resolution of 1g (or 0.125oz). There\nare scales with resolutions of 2g (0.25oz) or greater,\nbut this resolution is not good enough for small portions\nof dry ingredients. The maximum capacity should be\nat least 2000 g (4 pounds). There should also be a\n\'tare\' feature so you can zero out the weight of the\nbowl being used to hold the item being measured.\nscale I use measures in either English or metric units\nto a precision of 1g or 0.1oz. It has proved to be\ninvaluable on many occasions, and after my knives,\nis probably the most important device I use in the\nkitchen, and I use it daily. Grams are more convenient\nto use for most weight measurements because in the\nquantities used for cooking, fractions are not required.\nWith the English system, fractions of ounces would\nbe required to equal the precision obtainable with\nwhole grams. Although less common, it is not unheard\nof to measure liquid ingredients by weight instead\nthe French havent settled on a single unit for\nfractions of a liter (l). Some recipes will be in\ncentiliters (cl) or 0.1 l. Others will be in deciliters\n(dl) or 0.01 l, while some are even in milliliters\n(ml), or 0.001 l. By design, one milliliter (ml) of\nwater weighs 1g. If you are already using a scale\nto measure the dry ingredients and the recipe calls\nfor 250 ml of stock, this will weigh very close to\n250g and can be measured quickly on the scale without\ngetting a measuring cup dirty.\nAmerica, where liquid measurements may be in cups,\npints, quarts, etc., or fractions thereof, the conversion\nto weight is more difficult. The old saying, A\npint is a pound the world round, is close\nto the truth, but the error is about half an ounce\n(or one part in 32). But using a pint to measure a\npound is often close enough. Two volumetric measures\nthat French and American recipes have in common are\nthe tablespoon, cuillere à soupe, and\nthe teaspoon, cuillere à café.\nIn France, a tablespoon is equal to 15 ml, and a teaspoon,\nto 5 ml. In the United States, these measures are\nslightly smaller - about 1%. In older French cook\nbooks, sometimes a verre, a glass, or tasse,\na cup, is found as a unit of measure. I have not found\na standard definition for either of these measures.\nFurthermore, for Americans, the use of milliliters\nis simple because standard U.S. measuring cups all\nhave fractions of cups, ounces, and milliliter graduations.\nlong and the short of measuring:\nmeasurements of length, America and France are also\nin disagreement. Americans use feet and inches. The\nFrench use the metric system - millimeters, centimeters,\nand meters. Once again, with the metric system, it\nis possible to easily measure most things in the kitchen\nwithout needing to use fractions since the smallest\ncommon unit, the millimeter (mm), is approximately\nequal to 1/25 of an inch. It is rare that a recipe\nspecifies a measurement smaller than a millimeter.\nWith the English system, fractions of inches are used,\nand abused, all the time. Most rulers in America come\nwith both English and metric units, and every kitchen\nshould have at least one ruler in its armamentarium.\nhot and the cold of measuring:\nwith measurements of temperature, most digital thermometers\nread in either Centigrade or Fahrenheit. Although\nI find Centigrade measurements more convenient, it\nis harder to make a case for Centigrade measurements\nover Fahrenheit. This is especially true since ovens\nin the United States are usually only able to be set\nin Fahrenheit units. In France, some ovens are set\nin Centigrade units, but others use \'thermostat\' settings\nof 1 to 10.\nme what you really mean:\nleast standardized form of measurements is descriptive\nmeasures. Some of these measures, such as dollop,\nhandful, and spoonful, have thankfully gone the way\nof the buggy whip. Others are firmly with us. Adjectives\nsuch as thinly, finely, and coarsely combined with\ninstructions like mince, slice, dice, and chop are\nfound in many recipes, including my own. Each assumes\nthe reader possesses knowledge that only can be gained\nby first making the dish described by the recipe!\nthese descriptive measurements were combined with\nstandardized length measurements, instructions would\nbe clearer. For example, 1 mm thick slices"".\nThere are cases, however, where adding a length measure\nis inappropriate. If a recipe calls for finely minced,\nI assume the instruction means for the cook to mince\nthe ingredient as finely as they can. Another problem\nbrought about by descriptive measures is cultural.\nA large, medium, or small apple, onion, or tomato\nmay not mean the same thing to all readers. It is\nmuch better to apply a description of weight to ingredient\nspecifications like these.\nthe pros do it:\nof my background, I may emphasize precision a bit\nmore than necessary, but I bristle when someone says\nto me that professional chefs dont measure.\nIn every kitchen Ive been in Ive seen\nchefs measuring everything they do. Sometimes it may\nnot appear that they are measuring, but they use a\ncombination of their eyes and experience to measure.\nIf you ask them how much of an ingredient they just\nadded to a pot, they can usually tell you a quantity.\nSometimes the amount is based on taste, another means\nof measuring. Portion control is very important in\na commercial kitchen, so measuring is done all the\ntime and at all stages of preparation. If measuring\nwas not taking place, the chef would not know how\nmuch raw ingredients to order for a planned number\nof portions. This is especially important when special\ndishes are prepared for banquets - the chef neither\nwants material left over, nor to finish the meal service\none portion short!\nit clear in recipes:\ntesting and transcribing recipes, I have adopted a\npattern that may not appear obvious to the reader.\nFirst of all, I attempt to work with the units of\nmeasure as they appeared in the original recipe. Metric\nunits remain metric, except I have standardized on\nmilliliters for volume and grams for weight. Thus\ncentiliters and deciliters are converted to milliliters\nand kilograms are converted to grams. I have done\nthis for two reasons. First, using a smaller variety\nof units is less confusing. Second, my measuring equipment\nfavors grams and milliliters. English units usually\na measure is really intended to indicate an amount\npurchased rather than an amount to be measured in\nthe kitchen, I will usually (but not consistently)\nstate the amount in the form that it is purchased\nin at my local market, for example, 1 pound asparagus\nor 1/2 pound onions. In some cases, when small amounts\nof ingredients are specified as tablespoons or fractions\nof tablespoons, I will convert (visit the site to\nconvert) these measurements to grams to obtain consistency\neach time the recipe is prepared. If the amount is\nnon-critical, I will usually leave it unmodified.\ntheir very nature, recipes tend to be imprecise. In\nmost cases, this is not a problem because the experience\nof the cook will overcome the lack of precision. In\nsome cases however, the lack of precision leads to\nthe evolution of a different dish than originally\nintended by the recipe author, or the lack of precision\nleads to disappointment and another addition to the\ntrash bin. I hope my efforts at the art of recipe\nwriting do not contribute to your local landfill.\nwith this article Peter has created an excellent weight\nconversion facility on his web site -\nhere to use weight conversion.\narticle comes from the web site of Peter Hertzmann,\nla carte.

The type of flour used is vital at getting the right results in the end product. Different types of flour are suited to different items, and all flours are different. You cannot switch from one type to another without consequences that could ruin the recipe. To achieve success in baking, it is important to know what the right flour is for the job!\nAll-Purpose Flour – A blend of hard and soft wheat; it may be bleached or unbleached. It is usually translated as “plain flour.” All-Purpose Flour has 8% to 11% protein (gluten). All-purpose flour is one of the most commonly used and readily accessible flour in the United States. Flour that is bleached naturally as it ages is labeled “unbleached,” while chemically treated flour is labeled “bleached.” Bleached flour has less protein than unbleached. Bleached is best for pie crusts, cookies, quick breads, pancakes and waffles. Use unbleached flour for yeast breads, Danish pastry, puff pastry, strudel, Yorkshire pudding, lairs, cream puffs and popovers.\nAlmond Flour (Gluten Free) – Just a touch of this flour (about 1/4 of the flour mixture) is all you need to add moistness, a little binding, light almond flavor, and density to baked goods. It is especially good in pastry crusts, cookies, and quick breads.\nAmaranth Flour (Gluten Free) – Amaranth is an ancient grain and the word amaranth means “everlasting” in Greek. Amaranth contains more protein than any other gluten-free grain and more protein than wheat flour. You can substitute up to 20 to 25% of the flour used in your recipe with this flour.\nBarley Flour (Low Gluten) – A non-wheat flour made from grinding whole barley. It is a popular alternative to wheat flour because, unlike many non-wheat flours, it contains some gluten. This flour has a mild, but very slightly nutty taste. This flour also has slightly fewer calories and more than 4 times the fiber of all-purpose. By using barley flour instead of all-purpose flour, you triple your fiber intake. When making yeast bread recipes, there is not enough gluten in barley flour to properly develop the bread, and it is recommended swapping only one quarter of all-purpose flour for barley flour in yeast bread recipes. Great in quick breads and pancakes.\nBread Flour – Is white flour made from hard, high-protein wheat. It has more gluten strength and protein content than all-purpose flour. It is unbleached and sometimes conditioned with ascorbic acid, which increases volume and creates better texture. Bread flour has 12% to 14% protein (gluten). This is the best choice for yeast products.\nBuckwheat Flour (Gluten Free) – It is packed with nutrients, readily available, easy to work with and has a nice nutty flavor.\nCake Flour – A fine-textured, soft-wheat flour with a high starch content. It has the lowest protein content of any wheat flour, 8% to 10% protein (gluten). It is chlorinated (a bleaching process which leaves the flour slightly acidic, sets a cake faster and distributes fat more evenly through the batter to improve texture. When you’re making baked goods with a high ratio of sugar to flour, this flour will be better able to hold its rise and will be less liable to collapse. This flour is excellent for baking fine-textured cakes with greater volume and is used in some quick breads, muffins and cookies. If you cannot find cake flour, substitute bleached all-purpose flour, but subtract 2 tablespoons of flour for each cup used in the recipe (if using volume measuring).\nChickpea Flour (Gluten Free) – Also know as garbanzo flour, gram flour, and besan. Made from dried chickpeas ground into a flour. Used in many countries, it is a staple ingredient in Indian, Pakistan, and Nepal cuisines. You can use this flour as an egg substitute in vegan cookery. You can substitute up to half the amount of all-purpose flour called for in a recipe with chickpea flour. It is also very easy to make your own Chickpea Flour by processing dried chickpeas in your blender or food processor.\nCoconut flour (Gluten Free) – It is ground from dried, defatted coconut meat. It is high in fiber, and low in digestible carbohydrates. It has a very light coconut flavor. Coconut flour can replace up to 20% of the flour in a recipe, but you will need to add an equal amount of liquid (oil) to compensate as this flour soaks up the liquid. You will also need more eggs – usually double the eggs (or more).\nCorn Flour (Gluten Free) – It is a powdery flour made of finely-ground cornmeal and is milled from the whole kernel. Corn flour comes in yellow and white and is used for breading and in combination with other flours in baked goods. White corn flour is used as a filler, binder and thickener in cookie, pastry and meat industries.\nInstant Flour (Wondra from Gold Medal) – Is granular and formulated to dissolve quickly in hot or cold liquids. It will not work as a substitute for all-purpose flour, although there are recipes on the container for popovers and other baked goods. It is used primarily in sauces and gravies.\nFarina Flour or Meal: Flour or meal (of grain or starchy roots.) Also sold as Cream of Wheat, farina is made from the endosperm of the grain, which is milled to a fine granular consistency and then sifted. Although the bran and most of the germ are removed, this cereal is sometimes enriched with B vitamins and iron. Farina is most often served as a breakfast cereal, but can also be cooked like polenta. Its name comes from the Latin word for meal or flour, which in turn traces to far, the Latin name for spelt, a type of wheat. Farina was the first genuine flour before milling stones.\nMillet Flour (Gluten Free) – Millet is one of the oldest foods known and possibly the first cereal grain to be used for domestic purposes. Millet flour is most commonly used in desserts and sweet breads largely because of the grain’s naturally sweet flavor. When substituting for wheat flour, it is usually best to start with about a 3-to-1 ratio of wheat to millet.\nOat Flour (Gluten Free) – This flour tends to make a baked good more moist than wheat flour. It is made from ground whole oats – yes the old-fashion oats used for cereal. It is very easy to make your own oat flour. Just place the dried oats in your blender and grind. 1 1/4 cups rolled oats makes 1 cup oat flour.\nOrganic Flour – Used in the same way as regular flour. It must follow U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations to be labeled “organic.” Using this flour is a matter of personal preference.\nPastry Flour – Also is made with soft wheat and falls somewhere between all-purpose and cake flour in terms of protein content and baking properties. Pastry flour (also known as cookie flour) has a protein (gluten) of 9% to 10%. Use pastry flour for making biscuits, pie crusts, brownies, cookies and quick breads. Pastry flour makes a tender but crumbly pastry. Do not use it for yeast breads. Pastry flour (both whole-wheat and regular) is not readily available at supermarkets, but you can find it at specialty stores and online. You can try to mimic it by using a 2-to-1 ratio of all-purpose flour to cake flour.\nPumpernickel Flour (Low Gluten) – This flour is made from coarsely-ground whole rye berries. It is the rye equivalent of whole wheat flour. Pumpernickel breads tends to be dense, dark, and strongly flavored.\nQuinoa Flour (Gluten Free) – It is one of the most nutritious grain flour available. Quinoa is considered a grass/seed and not a grain. This powerful little grain is a great addition to any diet, but is an ideal solution for those following a gluten free, vegan or vegetarian diet. You can substitute this flour for 1/2 of the all-purpose flour in many recipes or completely replace wheat flour in cakes and cookie recipes. This is a very expensive flour to purchase.\nRice Flour (Gluten Free) – Rice flour is a form of flour made from finely milled rice. This flour can be made from either white or brown rice and can be used interchangeably. White Rice Flour (also called Mochik) is lighter, milder, and easier to digest than wheat flour. Some people find white rice flour to be slightly gritty, but many find it preferable to bean flours. It is great as a thickening in sauces. You can also make your own rice flour – just place rice of your choice (white or brown) in your blender and process until it forms a powder.\nRye Flours (Low Gluten) – There are light, medium, and dark colored varieties of rye flour. The color of the flour depends on how much of the bran has been removed through the milling process. It is also a low gluten flour. Rye bread may be a better choice than wheat bread for persons with diabetes. Because rye flour is low in gluten, a general rule suggests substituting 1/3 of the amount of rye with wheat flour to ensure the bread will rise properly.\nSelf-Rising flour – Also known as Raising Flour and sometimes as phosphated flour, is a low-protein flour with salt and leavening (baking powder) already added. About 1 1/4 teaspoons of baking powder and a pinch of salt have been added during milling for every cup of flour. It is especially suited for biscuits, muffins, cakes, and pastries. It is also available bleached or unbleached. It is most often recommended for biscuits and some quick breads, but never for yeast breads. Exact formulas, including the type of baking powder used, vary by manufacturer. Recipes that call for self-rising flour do not call for the addition of salt or leavening agents.\nSemolina Flour – It is used in making pasta and Italian puddings. It is made from durum wheat, the hardest type of wheat grown. The flour is highest in gluten. When other grains, such as rice or corn, are similarly ground, they are referred to as “semolina” with the grain’s name added, i.e., “corn semolina” or “rice semolina.” There are difference grades.\nSorghum Flour (Gluten Free) – A very good substitute for wheat flour in many recipes, especially if combined with other, more denser, flours.\nSoy Flour (Gluten Free) – Made from ground soy beans. Full-fat and low-fat soy flours work best in sweet, rich, baked goods like cookies, soft yeast breads, and quick breads. Soy flour can be substituted approximately 10% to 30% of the wheat or rye flour in your recipes.\nSpelt Flour (Low Gluten) – One of the most popular and widely available of alternative baking flours. The full name of spelt is Triticum aestivum var. spelta. Triticum denotes that it is of the wheat family, but the fats are more soluble and the nutritional content higher than traditional wheat flour. People who have issues with wheat digestion, but who are not gluten, will tolerant often do well with Spelt. Spelt flour has a nutty and slightly sweet flavor similar to that of whole wheat flour. It does contain gluten and is a popular substitute for wheat in baked goods.\nTapioca Flour (Gluten Free) – It is also known as tapioca starch. It is a starchy white flour with a slight sweet flavor. This flour is make from the starch extracted from the South American cassava plant. It helps bind gluten-free recipes plus improves the texture of baked goods and is also an ideal thickening agent. Use tapioca for thickening a wide variety of baked goods, sauces, and desserts. This flour can also be used to replace corn starch (use 2 tablespoons tapioca flour for each 1 tablespoon corn starch).\nTeff Flour (Gluten Free) – Teff is an ancient and intriguing grain, tiny in size yet packed with nutrition. It is simple to prepare and similar to millet or quinoa in cooking. Teff is a great addition to your diet for nutrition, taste, and variety. It is higher in protein than wheat and has a high concentration of a wide variety of nutrients, including calcium, thiamin, and iron. Since the grains are so small, the bulk of the grain is germ and brand. It is very high in fiber and is thought to benefit people with diabetes as it helps control blood sugar levels. Teff is excellent in making dark breads and rye breads.\nWhole-Wheat Flour (Low Gluten) – Also called graham flour. It is made from the whole kernel of wheat and is higher in dietary fiber and overall nutrient content than white flours. It does not have as high a gluten level, so often it’s mixed with all-purpose or bread flour when making yeast breads. Whole wheat flour is equivalent to British whole meal flour.\nHow To Buy Different Types of Flour:\nLook for tightly sealed bags or boxes. Flours in torn packages or in open bins are exposed to air and to insect contamination.\nHow To Store Flour:\nFlour must be kept cool and dry. All flours, even white flour, have a limited shelf life. Millers recommend that flours be stored for no more than 6 months. The main change that occurs is the oxidation of oils when flour is exposed to air. The result of this is rancid off flavors. During hot weather, store flour in the refrigerator.\nFlour should be stored, covered, in a cool and dry area. This prevents the flour from absorbing moisture and odors and from attracting insects and rodents. Freezing flour for 48 hours before it is stored will kill any weevil or insect eggs already in the flour. It is better not to mix new flour with old if you are not using the flour regularly.\nDo not store flour near soap powder, onions or other foods and products with strong odors.\nIf freezer space is available, flour can be repackaged in airtight, moisture-proof containers, labeled and placed in the freezer at 0 degrees F. If flour is stored like this, it will keep well for several years.\nKeep whole wheat flour in the refrigerator the year around. Natural oils cause this flour to turn rancid quickly at room temperature.\nThrow away flour if it smells bad, changes color, or is invested with weevils.\nFlour is always readily available so it should only be brought in quantities that will last a maximum of two to three months.\nPut a bay leaf in the flour canister to help protect against insect infections. Bay leaves are natural insect repellents.']"	['<urn:uuid:8cf1c326-6c25-4980-8aae-1cae70873b87>', '<urn:uuid:18f3c7fe-e986-4ca0-adfb-08708b3f9629>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	14	91	4477
67	How do paralleled light towers affect color rendering quality?	Paralleled light towers, which are linked together and powered by a single source, offer zero emissions and quieter operation, while their lighting quality depends on the type of lights used. When equipped with LED lights, they can provide high Color Rendering Index (CRI) scores of 80-90, ensuring accurate color representation similar to natural sunlight, while maintaining their benefits of reduced fuel consumption and easier maintenance.	"['New Technologies Herald an Era of Commercial Excellence for Light Towers\nSince their inception, light towers have come a long way owing to advancements in technology and evolving end-user requirements. Light towers are increasingly finding applications across a host of industrial domains including construction, oil & gas, and mining among others. While these industries are expected to emerge as fertile grounds for the growth of the light tower market in the near future, widening commercial applications of light towers will also remain vital for market growth. In the past few years, LED technology, paralleling capabilities, and electric models have gained significant popularity and are tipped to strongly influence the adoption of light towers in the coming years.\nIt is hard to ignore the developments in lighting technology as they continue to evolve as per the required consumer preferences. At the back of the growing environmental concerns, stakeholders involved in the light tower market value chain are primarily focused on the development of flexible and energy-efficient lighting solutions. Moreover, at present, power and fuel systems that utilize electric, solar, and hybrid technologies in conjunction with diffused lighting alternatives to comply with the regulations of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and construction safety are set to become mainstream across job sites worldwide.\nImmediacy of Energy-efficient, Electric Light Towers to Take Centre Stage\nThe past decade has witnessed significant amendments to environmental norms and regulations pertaining to the lighting sector. Apart from minimizing the environmental footprint, these regulations also aim to curb light pollution. In their bid to gain an edge in the current market landscape, stakeholders involved in the light tower market are swaying toward the development of energy-efficient electric light towers. Despite being far becoming mainstream, electric light towers are slowly but steadily garnering a notable amount of popularity. Electric light towers are increasingly being deployed for a range of indoor applications wherein fuel emission and engine noise are a major cause of concern. Furthermore, as LED lights are predominantly used in electric light towers, they require minimal power to operate. Apart from emerging as an energy-efficient alternative, electric light towers are simpler to operate, light in weight, and can be easily maneuvered by hand.\nAnother trend that is picking up pace in the light tower market is the growing preference for paralleled light towers in which a series of light towers are linked together and powered by a single source. These chain towers are likely to gain significant acceptance as they do not require a power source and most importantly, emit zero emissions. The single source paralleled chain towers also consume less fuel, are easier to maintain, and are relatively quieter than other light tower arrangements. Participants involved in the light tower market are aiming to leverage the benefits of paralleling technology to improve efficiency and optimizing performance.\nLED Light Towers Driving Growth at Scale\nWithin the energy or the power industry, energy efficiency has remained the focal point of research and development activities. LED light towers have thus, managed to attract noteworthy attention in recent years and the trend is projected to continue over the coming decade. LED lights have time and again proved their efficacy in terms of energy efficiency, durability, performance, designs, and more. While there is a lot of coverage on these benefits of LED technology, another major benefit of LED which is often overlooked is its optimum Color Rendering Index (CRI) – which facilitates improved and accurate representation of the color.\nWhile the adoption of LED light towers continues to gain fast-paced traction, the demand for conventional incandescent light towers will remain steady. Owing to the awareness regarding the product and cost-effectiveness of conventional light towers, user preferences continue to tilt toward them particularly in the construction sector. However, with the dwindling prices of LEDs, LED light towers could potentially dent the market share of conventional incandescent light in the coming years.\nIn an era where hybrid technologies are making heads turn in an array of industrial domains, the storyline holds true for the energy sector as well. Stakeholders in the light tower market are investing resources to develop environmental-friendly technologies by deploying energy-efficient components and lighting assemblies. Many companies are rolling out new ‘hybrid’ lighting towers that comply with the regulatory norms for applications at construction sites or other major facilities including airports. Research and development activities will continue to play an integral role in the development of the future generation of light towers. Despite finding major breakthroughs as far as energy efficiency is concerned, mitigating costs of light towers will remain a major hurdle for participants involved in the light tower market.\nMost popular reports\n- Non-Destructive Testing Market Forecast, Trend Analysis & Competition Tracking - Global Market Insights 2019 to 2029\n- Sandblasting PPE Market Forecast, Trend Analysis & Competition Tracking - Global Market Insights 2019 to 2029\n- Construction Equipment Rental Market Forecast, Trend Analysis & Competition Tracking - Global Market Insights 2019 to 2029', 'What is CRI\nCRI is the color rendering Index of Light.\nGenerally,we could understand like this,\nwhen we put objects under the light,how the objects looks like been put under sun light?the more close to sun light,the CRI of the LED Light have higher CRI.\nThe Color Rendering Index & Lighting\nThe type of light bulb you use in your home could have a profound effect on the way a room looks. This is often attributed to something known as the color rendering index. Also referred to as CRI, this index measures the ability of a light source to reveal colors of objects in contrast to a natural light source, such as the sun filtering in through your windows.\nSo, what is CRI? Simply put, it\'s the measurement of light in relation to how it affects the appearance of color. This range can also depend on the ""temperature"" of the light. For example, lighting temperatures can range from infrared light to the kind coming from a skylight, all the way to ultraviolet light. Ideally, you want to use lighting that will best illuminate each room depending on your needs.\nUnderstanding the Color Rendering Index Chart\nEvery type of lighting has its place on what\'s known as the color rendering index chart. This chart measures a scale from 0 to 100, depending on how accurately it can produce light that matches a naturally referenced light source, such as the sun. In general, bulbs at the higher end of the scale will produce a more accurate color rendering of the objects around it. This can be vital for use in things like photography or lighting used in a museum setting. But it can also effect you and your home. It\'s best to choose bulbs that will make your surroundings clear, bright and as close to how they would appear in an outdoor, natural setting.\nColor Rendering Index & LED Light Bulbs\nLED bulbs have grown in popularity recently, mainly due to their energy-efficient qualities and bright light production. In terms of CRI for LED, most LED lights produce a score of about 80 to 90 on the chart. The result is a brighter room, but with a much more natural, accurate output of light. Unlike fluorescent lighting which can create an unnatural look, LEDs are better suited to indoor environments. Aside from the color rendering index, the number of lumens output, or actual light produced, plays a role in the overall effectiveness of an LED bulb too.\nConsidering CRI for Lighting Fixtures\nWhen it comes to choosing the right light bulbs for your home, CRI for lighting plays a role. You want colors to be crisp and everything to look sharp so that your décor, paint colors and furniture look the best they can. It may also affect your eyesight when you\'re doing certain task like reading a book, watching television or preparing food in the kitchen.\nThe CRI scale became more popular when LED lighting began to become prevalent in homes. Many modern light bulb manufacturers will post a ""lighting facts"" portion on the packaging to inform consumers of the bulb\'s properties. These facts should indicate the color rendering index scale, number of lumens, watts and efficiency metrics. Choose lighting that has a higher CRI rating so you can be sure you\'re getting the most accurate color portrayal in your home.\nThe Bottom Line with CRI\nWhen you choose the right lighting for your home, there are many things to consider. Of course, energy efficiency and how many hours of use you\'ll get from each bulb is important. Checking the CRI scale can also help to ensure that your environment is brighter, clearer and filled with perfect color. LED lighting is certainly a smart choice, and today\'s LED bulbs are more affordable than ever before. There are also increasing numbers of lighting manufacturers who have moved toward LED-style fixtures, which means you\'ll get to reap the benefits of a better color rendering index chart rating.']"	['<urn:uuid:877346f4-6a3f-428f-8f29-4e52a98df4c2>', '<urn:uuid:2c0214f1-5aac-4cce-b6c3-e3ea57d96ac0>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	9	65	1488

(Criminal Justice I Standard 10.2)\nIntroduction -- Context\nThe objective of this unit is to provide students with information and an appreciation of positive physical and mental health practices that lead to successful careers in the criminal justice field. Criminal Justice professionals and specifically police officers have many times been portrayed in the media as out of shape individuals that feast on fast food and donuts. This unit will introduce students to the physical and mental challenges that officers train for prior to becoming a certified police officer. Prospective police officers are trained in a variety of military-like methods while in one of Tennessee\'s law enforcement training academies. Upon completion of a POST certified police academy successful police officers continue to maintain a level of physical fitness to deal with the physical and mental challenges of police work. Police officers are exposed to physical and mental challenges daily. Many officers become desensitized to anger, violence and death. Students will be further exposed to positive mental health practices that can lead to a successful criminal justice career. Students will be exposed to statistical data showing the alcoholism, drug addiction and suicide rates of police officers and how these maladies are related to clinical depression and post traumatic stress disorder. Students will be further exposed to Critical Incident Stress Debriefing and other Employee Assistance Programs currently in place to combat these workplace dilemmas. (UG-A, B)\nThe student will:\nA.

Certified police officers must complete a police academy recognized by Tennessee Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) Commission.\nB. POST approved police academies require that cadet officers pass physical fitness testing as a requirement for graduation.\nAs you will recall, we have explored the different areas of law enforcement. We have discussed the different policing agencies in the United States the differences between Federal, State and Local Jurisdictions. What does jurisdiction mean? Correct it is a geographic region or area where a police agency or court has authority. Today we are going to begin exploring training requirements for police officers in Tennessee. Over the next several days we will examine the physical fitness and other requirements for an officer to become commissioned in Tennessee. Most police officers in Tennessee are required to complete a basic police school at one of Tennessee\'s Law Enforcement Training Academies. Many larger agencies such as Metro Police Department, Knoxville Police Department and Tennessee Highway Patrol have chosen to operate their own police training academies. Most officers, as we have seen do not work for large agencies. What size agencies do most officers work for? Correct; approximately 90% of police officers work for agencies with fewer than fifty officers. The majority of agencies in Tennessee utilize Tennessee Law Enforcement Training Academy in Donelson to train new police officers. In Tennessee police officers must be complete a police academy within their first year of employment. This is a requirement of the Tennessee Peace Officers Standards and Training (POST) Commission. The POST commission is responsible for ensuring that all police officers in Tennessee meet minimum requirements to serve as a police officer. In Basic Police School cadet officers learn law and the legal system much like we are learning in this class. Officers are also trained in driving skills, defensive tactics, weapon proficiency, and participate in structured Physical Training or PT. In order to graduate from the police academy cadets are required to take and pass a PT test. Cadets unable to pass the PT test will not be allowed to graduate from the academy and will be unable to work as a police officer in Tennessee until they can pass the PT test. Today we will begin to explore some of the physical requirements for police officers to successfully complete the police academy and become certified police officers.\nA. By linking to previous discussions of policing agencies and career opportunities in the criminal justice field the students have developed a schema to make educated assumptions of how police officers must adhere to rules and standards. Students have also demonstrated knowledge of how media depictions of police and military training can influence assumptions of how police officers are trained. (Objective A, B)\nB. Using an approximately 15 minutes of video demonstrating physical requirements for law enforcement officers, students will be led into a short lecture and a PowerPoint presentation, the students will be exposed to the minimum physical requirements for officers to graduate from Tennessee Law Enforcement Training Academy.

Practice and/or Review:\nReview for this lesson will come in future demonstration regarding physical fitness in law enforcement. The students will be given essential questions and group discussion topics to apply the information given. Internet opportunities will be given to search the State of Tennessee website to further apply the knowledge.\n6. Monitor and Adjust:\nBy listening to student feedback and by observation, adjustments will be made to focus and redirect questions and unclear information.\nIn the likelihood that students do not understand physical requirements of Tennessee POST Commission, redirection and review will be provided with positive feedback. This standard and objectives will also be revisited and reviewed in future units such as defensive tactics, patrol techniques and officer safety.\n8. Materials/Media and their use:\nA. Video demonstration to introduce topic.\nB. PowerPoint presentation for visual enhancement of fitness terms.\n9. Alternative / Supplemental Activities:\nA. Printed student copy of fitness requirements, if needed for notes.\nB. Additional time to research POST Commission requirements.\nC.

Weekly Quiz over content. (Objective A, B)\nA. Tables are arranged in grouped row seating\nB. Video Presentation System\nC. PowerPoint and presentation system\nD. Access to student computers if necessary\nCan you see now through this brief introduction that a Law Enforcement Training Academy can be a challenging experience? Would an officer want to show up at the first day of basic police school out of shape? What would he or she be risking? Tomorrow we will begin a more in depth exploration of physical fitness and decide how nutrition can help with physical training. Later in the week we will continue to explore how physical and mental training can prepare the officer for survival on the streets.']"	['<urn:uuid:d97636e0-b908-45aa-8383-65b9d676f90e>', '<urn:uuid:ab6d3427-e4b5-4d33-a29a-caeaa35a8ea8>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	7	41	1882
69	need to know ammo comparison what size tss versus lead pellet has same penetration power	A No. 9 HEAVYWEIGHT TSS pellet carries at least as much penetration energy as a No. 5 lead pellet at all ranges. This is because TSS material is 56 percent denser than lead.	['Tungsten Super Shot (TSS) is an incredibly dense shot that has taken the handloading world by storm in recent years, and it’s an integral part of Federal Premium’s HEAVYWEIGHT TSS and 3rd Degree loads. Regardless of whether you choose to shoot 12 gauge or 20 gauge in the spring turkey woods, you owe it to yourself to check out TSS.\nThat said, when developing new shotshells for 2018, Federal Premium didn’t forget about the .410 bore. In fact, the company’s engineers set out to create loads using small TSS pellets in .410 bore that would rival what handloaders have achieved. This task resulted in a 3-inch .410 load (photo below) with 13/16 ounce of No. 9 shot that uses a specialized, full-length wad designed to prevent direct contact of the super-hard TSS with the barrel.\nTSS material is 56 percent denser than lead, which means a No. 9 HEAVYWEIGHT TSS pellet carries at least as much penetration energy as a No. 5 lead pellet at all ranges. Because of this fact, Federal Premium was able to greatly increase the pellet count of a payload by using a smaller shot size, but penetrate as much or more because of the increased density.\nA 13/16-ounce .410 load of No. 9 TSS has about 295 pellets. When engineers tested the loads at the Federal Premium factory using a shotgun with a 24.5-inch barrel and fixed full choke, they averaged 125 to 150 pellets in a 10-inch circle at 40 yards. These numbers prove the load will be deadly on wild turkeys. These numbers even rival those produced by some 12-gauge turkey guns using No. 4 or No. 5 lead loads.\nTest results also showed more than 3-inches of penetration in ballistic gel. And this is not a misprint: When tested with a thin sheet of steel at 40 yards, the .410 load dented the steel deeply, and a few pellets (circled in pic below) busted completely through the sheet.\nHeavyweight TSS .410 bore loads definitely have the patterns, down-range energy and penetration at 40 yards to be effective at killing wild turkeys.\nThe photo above compares shot patterns on turkey targets: On the left is Federal Premium Grand Slam 12-gauge Copper-Plated Lead No. 5. This new ammo is fantastic with the FlightControl Flex wad, new buffer system, new hull printing and tight roll crimp. Standard loads like this one have been killing turkeys for decades. On the right is Federal Premium HEAVYWEIGHT TSS .410 Bore No. 9. This awesome new load turns the .410 into a viable turkey gun. It’s important to note that both targets were shot at 40 yards. Both loads placed more than 100 pellets in a 10-inch circle, and both placed more than 10 pellets in the vitals. The performance similarity between two strikingly different loads is incredible.\nCheck out the video below to see the new .410 HEAVYWEIGHT TSS load in action. Pay close attention to the video at the 41-second mark where it shows an old-school .410 load with No. 4 lead pellets on a turkey target. This new ammo will be amazing regardless of the shotgun you carry for wild turkeys.\nImages courtesy of Federal Premium']	['<urn:uuid:5572c858-aa91-45c2-b4a2-5ac92c7d9d6c>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	15	33	530
70	urban trees health monitoring program how work and why trees struggle survive cities	The RCRCD monitors urban tree health through citizen science programs like Operation Resilient Trees, where volunteers collect data on tree health, size, and growing conditions. Urban trees struggle to survive because they face several challenges: soil compaction, pollution, inadequate soil quality, and lack of mycorrhizal associations (which are 37% lower in urban areas compared to rural areas). Additionally, urban trees lack the network of fellow trees to share nutrients and information via their roots, making them isolated 'orphans' that live shorter lives than their forest counterparts.	"[""The RCRCD has a long and rich history of providing and facilitating opportunities for communities to participate in citizen science...\nCurrent and Upcoming Projects\nBlue Bird Nest Box Monitoring Program\nHelp Bring Back the Bluebird Population!\nDid you know that bluebirds nest in tree cavities? Unfortunately, many urban areas have few trees. We can provide cavities for bluebirds and other native birds by hanging nest boxes on trees in special urban locations, such as above irrigated lawns in parks, golf courses, and even cemeteries.\nEach spring, the Riverside-Corona Resource Conservation District seeks volunteers to hang and monitor nest boxes. Volunteers hang and check boxes weekly from February through June. Each team or individual usually monitors between three to five boxes, which takes about one hour per week. RCRCD matches volunteers to their closest nest box location to limit travel time.\nMany Western Bluebirds fledge each year thanks to our local volunteers. Some other native birds also use a few of the nest boxes, including the Ash-throated flycatcher, who's numbers are in decline. The results of our monitoring studies are sent to a national data bank at Cornell University. If you are interested in volunteering or just learning more about bluebirds, please contact Erin Snyder, at email@example.com\nAdditional sources of information about bluebirds:The North American Bluebird Society (NABS) promotes the recovery of bluebirds and other native cavity-nesting birds. California Bluebird Recovery Program is a great source of local information.\nThe Bluebird Book, the Complete Guide to Attracting Bluebirds, by Donald and Lillian Stokes.\nRCRCD is participating in the USA National Phenology Network through the Nature's Notebook program. Phenology is the study of seasonal natural phenomena, especially in relation to climate and plant and animal life. The USA-NPN brings together citizen scientists, government agencies, non-profit groups, educators and students of all ages to monitor the impacts of climate change on plants and animals in the United States. When you visit the LandUse Learning Center you can observe and record data for the species identified in the study.\nThe RCRCD has collaborated with a number of federal, state and local organizations on diverse citizen science projects...\nOperation Healthy Air\nOperation Healthy Air seeks to increase our understanding of the role of vegetation, such as trees, in decreasing air temperature and improving air quality at scales that communities make decisions. In this case, the cooling of local neighborhoods and reducing ozone formation. Operation Healthy Air engaged partners and citizen scientists to map and measure how differences in their environment–such as the number of trees or amount of pavement–affect local air quality and temperature.\nWe initiated pilot “campaigns” in Long Beach, and along the Inland Empire in the summer of 2017, and expanded in 2018 to greater Los Angeles and other cities. Funding for this program comes from grants from NASA’s Earth Sciences program and the National Science Foundation, as well as individual donors.\nOperation Healthy Air is a partnership between national and local partners, community-based organizations, universities, schools, aquaria, government agencies, and community members. The research is led by Dr. Darrel Jenerette and his lab at University of California Riverside, Dr. Jun Wang and his lab at the University of Iowa as well as Mark Chandler at Earthwatch Institute.\nOperation Healthy Air engaged 200 community members and 750 students from Long Beach, Claremont, Ontario, San Bernardino and Riverside among other communities. These community participants together with 25 local partners helped deploy over 250 temperature sensors and 18 ozone sensors and map over 60 acres of local habitat.\nYou can now explore the results from the Operation Healthy Air community science project. We’ve created a website where you can explore the air temperature data from our study including the sensors placed by community participants. The website was developed by Dr. Lorena Castro who is part of the research team at University of Iowa led by Dr. Jun Wang. Through this website, you will be able to compare the air temperature from up to six different sensors as well as against a high-resolution air temperature forecast model. You can compare backyards to front yards, streets to city parks or schools, nighttime to daytime, as well as data across days.

How much more water does a Jacaranda growing in Riverside use versus one that lives in Downtown Los Angeles? Is a tree that’s planted in a concrete median using the same amount of water as one that’s in the middle of a park? These are some of the types of questions the researchers will be seeking to answer.\nOver 100 community scientists collected data from nearly 800 trees 2015-2016, recording GPS coordinates, tree health, trunk and canopy size, and the percent permeable surface around each tree. This data provides a large enough sample size of trees to make meaningful conclusions and researchers at UC Riverside can now conduct additional analyses to determine each species’ physiological performance across different climate zones.\nResilient Trees 1.0 studied ten different tree species:\n- California Sycamore (Platanus racemosa)\n- Coast Live Oak (Quercus agrifolia)\n- Pink Dawn Chitalpa (Chitalpa taskentensis)\nClassically planted species (ones that were frequently planted in the past and are still with us today)-\n- Southern Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora)\n- Jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia)\n- Shamel Ash (Fraxinus uhdei)\nModern species (ones that are commonly planted in the present day and will be with us for years to come)-\n- Crepe Myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica)\n- Tipu (Tipuana tipu)\n- African Fern Pine (Podocarpus gracillior or Afrocarpus falcatus)\n- Brisbane Box (Lophostemon confertus)\nResilient Trees 2.0 studied another ten tree species:\n- African Sumac (Rhus lancea)\n- Olive Tree (Olea europea)\n- Strawberry Tree (Arbutus unedo)\n- Indian Rosewood (Dalbergia sissoo)\n- Chinese Pistache (Pistacia chinensis)\n- Chinese Flame Tree (Koelreuteria bipinnata)\n- Netleaf Hackberry (Celtis reticulata)\n- Engelmann Oak (Quercus engelmannii)\n- Water Gum (Tristaniopsis laurina)\n- Pink Trumpet Tree (Handroanthus impetiginosus)\nThanks to the efforts of these community scientists, the lab now has enough usable trees to proceed with its research into what the right trees are for each place- a valuable task that would otherwise be delayed by months or years without help.\nInterested in the raw data?

My research advances ecological engineering by exploring the potential of novel technologies to monitor urban ecology, particularly urban soils and forests. I believe technology can be a powerful tool—and in this series, I hope to illustrate how digitising our urban ecosystems into useful data can help us build healthier, happier, and more resilient places to live.\nIn Part 1 of Talking Trees (read here if you missed it), we asked: Do city trees talk to each other? In short, they probably don’t talk, and when they do, it’s a whisper. Even when there are tree-mycorrhizal associations, there typically aren’t enough of them to support the tree’s health.\nIn Part 2, I want to unpack why the life of a city tree is so difficult. There is a lot to unpack. For one, Bainard, Klironomos, and Gordon (2011) found mycorrhizal associations to be 37% lower in urban areas, as compared to rural areas . Why? Mycorrhizae are elusive and prefer not to ‘deal’ with urban soil issues like compaction, pollution, nutrient content, pH levels, or a lack of oxygen. For example, if polluting aluminium levels establish in the soil, the pH of the soil may be too low for effective tree–mycorrhizal associations to establish.\nTree-mycorrhizal associations may be the least of our worries, though. Even to apply the term ‘soils’ to the earth I sampled during my fieldwork is to be awfully polite. The urban soils I saw can only be described as highly variable. Often due to soil compaction, the varying contents of organic matter, or the patchy distribution of coarse natural or human-made materials such as coarse gravel or construction waste, as often even the parent material is anthropogenic in origin. In general, urban forest soil health has been little investigated due to the complexity of urban environments (e.g., variations in soil cover, land-use history, pollution, and degradation) and the difficulties of soil monitoring (e.g., limited training in accurate methods, lack of investment, and tedious and time-consuming work). Nevertheless, urban-forest soil health is the primary determinant of urban-forest health, and vice versa.\nAlthough healthy soil is fast becoming a limited commodity in cities, healthy soil, with ample microbes, should provide the foundation for healthy urban forests. However, urban trees face very different growing conditions than do forest trees; as a result, urban trees live for only a fraction of the time forest trees do. Many studies have catalogued the plight of dying urban trees, and inadequate soil quality is an important cause of this premature mortality.\nOnce the healthy-soil foundation has been established, water availability is the next consideration. Everyone knows that trees need water to live: the question is, how much?\nIf a tree has too little water during a period of drought, the tree becomes stressed. It may wilt for a little while and then bounce back—or the tree could permanently wilt. When this happens, the tree has to use more energy to recover—or it may die back completely. Watering newly planted trees is especially important, as the root zone of such a tree is not as large as that of an established tree.\nTrees that get too much water and have ‘wet feet’ for long periods can also be severely damaged. The tree will not be able to access oxygen from the soil, and the roots may begin to rot.\nPhillip Craul, a Harvard landscape ecologist once said: ‘street trees die for many reasons, but the best place to start looking for causes is in the soil.’\nIn cities, trees live fast and die young  for a number of reasons: not only smog, dog urination, insufficient soil volumes, compacted soil, and bad pruning practices, but also the fact that there is no network of fellow trees to share nutrients and information with via their roots, as mentioned above. Tree health is severely impacted by the absence of a network of close family nearby to communicate with and supply nutrients to. Some urban trees are orphans; we must foster these trees. If only we could find a way to hear what the trees had to say...\n Bainard, L. D., Klironomos, J. N., & Gordon, A. M. (2011).

71	Were Dean's accusations more damaging than the actual tapes?	While Dean's testimony was significant in claiming Nixon discussed the cover-up at least 35 times, the tapes provided the decisive evidence. When Nixon finally released tape transcripts on August 5, 1974 that clearly implicated him in the cover-up, he lost all Congressional support and resigned three days later. The tapes, not Dean's accusations, ultimately proved most damaging by providing direct evidence of Nixon's involvement.

In June 1972 five burglars were arrested after breaking into the Democratic Party's national headquarters at the Watergate Hotel complex in Washington, D.C. Within a few days of their arrest at the Watergate, charges of burglary and wiretapping were brought against the five and two others, including a former White House aide and G. Gordon Liddy, general counsel for the Committee to Reelect the President. Nixon and his aides steadfastly denied that anyone in the administration had been involved, despite persistent press reports to the contrary, and in November 1972 Nixon was easily reelected. In January 1973 the trial of the burglars was held before Judge John Sirica; five pleaded guilty and two were convicted by a jury. Sirica's direct questioning of witnesses revealed details of a cover-up by H.R. Haldeman, John D. Ehrlichman, and John W. Dean. They and Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst resigned in April. The new attorney general, Elliot L. Richardson (1920–98), appointed Archibald Cox (b. 1912) as special prosecutor. A Senate committee under Samuel Ervin held televised hearings in which the existence of tapes of conversations in the president's office was disclosed. Cox and Ervin subpoenaed the tapes, but Nixon refused to relinquish them and ordered Cox fired (Oct. 20, 1973). Richardson resigned in protest, and the public outcry eventually forced Nixon to surrender the tapes (December 8), which revealed clear signs of his involvement in the cover-up. In July 1974 the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives passed three articles of impeachment against Nixon. On August 5 Nixon supplied three tapes that clearly implicated him in the cover-up. Though Nixon continued to insist that he had not committed any offenses, he resigned on Aug. 8, 1974. He was pardoned a month later by his successor, Gerald Ford.\n* * *▪ United States history(1972–75), U.S. political scandal surrounding the revelation of illegal activities on the part of the incumbent Republican administration of President Richard M. Nixon (Nixon, Richard M.) during and after the 1972 presidential election campaign.The matter was first brought to public attention by the arrest of five men who, on June 17, 1972, broke into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate, an office–apartment–hotel complex in Washington, D.C. Within a few days of their arrest at the Watergate, charges of burglary and wiretapping were brought against the five and against E. Howard Hunt, Jr., a former White House aide, and G. Gordon Liddy, general counsel for the Committee for the Re-election of the President. All seven were tried before Judge John J. Sirica (Sirica, John), chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, in January 1973.During the months between their arrest and their trial, President Nixon and his aides had denied that anyone in the administration had been involved, despite persistent press reports to the contrary, especially in The Washington Post (Washington Post, The). As the scandal slowly unraveled, Post reporters Bob Woodward (Woodward, Bob) and Carl Bernstein received leaked information from a source that was nicknamed “Deep Throat”; after decades of conjecture, the identity of the source was revealed in 2005 as W. Mark Felt, who was, at the time of the leak, deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Of the seven, five pleaded guilty and two were convicted by a jury. At sentencing on March 23, 1973, Sirica read a letter from one of the defendants, James W. McCord, Jr., which charged that the White House had been conducting a cover-up to conceal its connection with the break-in. McCord also charged that the seven defendants had been pressured by the White House to plead guilty and remain silent. And, according to McCord, witnesses had perjured themselves during the trial. Before the reconvened grand jury, Jeb Stuart Magruder (assistant to the reelection committee director, former Attorney General John N. Mitchell (Mitchell, John)) changed his earlier testimony (i.e., that the break-in had not been approved by the committee) and said he had perjured himself at the instigation of Mitchell and John W. Dean III (Dean, John Wesley, III), counsel to the president.With the White House now clearly implicated, President Nixon on April 17, 1973, announced that he had begun a new investigation. White House press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said that all previous statements issued by the executive branch regarding Watergate were “inoperative.” On April 30 Nixon stated publicly that he took responsibility for the actions of staff members implicated in the case, and he accepted the resignations of advisers H.R. Haldeman (Haldeman, H.R.), John Ehrlichman (Ehrlichman, John D.), and Dean and of Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst. Nixon, however, denied any personal knowledge of either the campaign of political espionage or the attempts to conceal any wrongdoing.The same day Elliot L. Richardson was appointed attorney general to replace Kleindienst. Richardson then selected Harvard law professor Archibald Cox as special Watergate prosecutor. But in May the focus of the investigation shifted to the Senate, where the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities (established in February 1973 under the chairmanship of Senator Sam J. Ervin, Jr. (Ervin, Samuel J., Jr.), Democrat from North Carolina) began televised public hearings.The Ervin Committee elicited testimony establishing the culpability of White House and campaign committee personnel. Dean, however, was the only witness to accuse President Nixon of direct involvement in the cover-up. On July 16, 1973, Alexander P. Butterfield, formerly of the White House staff, disclosed that conversations in the president's offices had secretly been recorded on tape.Both Cox and the Ervin Committee promptly (July 23) subpoenaed the tapes. Nixon refused on the grounds of executive privilege and national security. When Judge Sirica ordered Nixon to turn over the tapes and that order was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals in October, Nixon offered instead to provide written summaries of the tapes in question in return for an agreement that no further presidential documents would be sought.Cox rejected the proposal, and on October 20 the president ordered Attorney General Richardson to fire the special prosecutor. Both Richardson and William D. Ruckelshaus, deputy attorney general, resigned rather than carry out the order, and Cox was finally dismissed by a compliant solicitor general, Robert Bork.A storm of public protest pressured Nixon into releasing the tapes on December 8, but of the nine tapes specified in Sirica's order, only seven were delivered (the White House claimed the other two had never existed); and one of the seven contained a gap that, according to a later report by a panel of experts, could not have been made accidentally. (See Richard M. Nixon, on releasing the Watergate tapes.—>)By the beginning of 1974, several former White House aides were either under indictment or had pleaded guilty to charges stemming from Watergate. The term itself had come to denote not merely the original break-in but also more or less related allegations of misconduct, including the purchase of governmental favours with campaign contributions, “dirty tricks” in the 1972 campaign, and an extralegal intelligence unit set up in the White House. This unit was alleged to have burglarized a psychiatrist's office to obtain the records of Daniel Ellsberg, a former employee of the Department of Defense, who had released the classified Pentagon Papers on the Vietnam War.The combined weight of these charges led to the initiation of a formal impeachment inquiry by the House Judiciary Committee in May 1974. On May 20 Judge Sirica ordered Nixon to turn over additional tapes to Cox's successor as special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski (Jaworski, Leon). On July 24 the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Nixon must provide transcripts of the tapes.Between July 27 and 30 the House Judiciary Committee passed three articles of impeachment. On August 5 the President supplied transcripts of three tapes that clearly implicated him in the cover-up. With these revelations, Nixon's last support in Congress evaporated. He announced his resignation on August 8, stating that he “no longer had a strong enough political base” with which to govern. He left office at 11:35 AM the following day, August 9.In 1975 Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Mitchell were convicted of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and perjury; they were sentenced to prison. Former President Nixon was spared any further punishment when his successor, Gerald R. Ford (Ford, Gerald R.), granted him an unconditional pardon on September 8, 1974.\n* * *\nLook at other dictionaries:\nWatergate scandal — Watergate redirects here.

72	passenger seating capacity piper meridian cessna 172s comparison	The Piper Meridian can seat four or five passengers plus a pilot in its pressurized cabin, while the Cessna 172S has a maximum occupancy of 4 people total.	['Essentially a re-engined and upgraded Piper Mirage, the New Piper Meridian 500T was announced at the NBAA convention in September 1997 and was slated to enter the market in mid-2000. The primary benefit of the turbine-powered Meridian 500T over its predecessor the piston-powered Mirage, is additional speed with a high-speed cruise of 262 kts. The Pratt & Whitney PT6A-42A turboprop engine is generously flat-rated with 500shp available for takeoff at sea level to +55 degrees C. The older Mirage was designed as Piper’s first pressurized, cabin-class piston single to compete against Cessna’s P210 Centurion and older light twins. It first flew in 1980 and was certified in 1983. The improved Malibu Mirage was its replacement in 1983 with a 350hp Lycoming engine substituting for the older 310hp Continental engine. Approximately 650 piston-engined PA-46s were delivered before the line was transitioned to its latest version, the the turbine-powered Meridian. The Meridian 500T was certified in 2000 with 18 aircraft delivered through the end of the year. As of 2008, 380 aircraft have been produced.\nThe New Piper Meridian PA-500T is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney of Canada PT6A-42A turboprop engine flat-rated at 500shp at ISA +55C. driving a constant speed, reversable Hartzell four-bladed propeller. Inspection interval on the engine is 3,600 hours.\nThe Meridian is equipped with dual installations of the Garmin GNS 530 nav/comm system with each unit incorporating a 12-channel GPS and full-color large screen moving map. The Garmin comm component includes a 8.33kHz spaced transceiver with 2,280 channel capability with integrated VOR, localizer and glideslope indicators. An S-TEC System 530 autopilot is fully coupled to the GNS 530. Two Meggit LCD engine display units are also standard. Optional is a Meggit dual Electronic Flight Display System including an LCD AHRS, Primary Flight display and Nav display. The new Meridian comes standard with the Avidyne Flight Max Entegra Integrated Flight Deck.\nThe Meridian PA-500T is a pressurized, single-engine turboprop-powered business aircraft whose airframe is primarily of aluminum construction. It is designed as a cantilever low-wing monoplane configuration with a retractable tricycle landing gear with a single wheel on each unit. The aircraft features a long, relatively high aspect-ratio wing, a roomy cabin with seating for a pilot and four or five passengers and a rear airstair-style door. The improved Meridian design incorporates a longer nose than the Mirage to accommodate the Pratt & Whitney PT6A-42A turboprop powerplant. Also distinguishing the Meridian from its predecessor the Mirage is its larger horizontal stabilizer, which improves stability at altitude and aids in airfield performance. Flaps on the Meridian are electric, the flight controls are manual and the control system is identical to the Mirage.\nThe Meridian cabin layout is configured to seat four or five passengers comfortably in a pressurized environment. Cabin dimensions are 12.3ft in length, 4.1ft in width and 3.9ft in height. A rear airstair-style entry door is aft of the port wing.\n|Years Aircraft Manufactured||2001 – current|\n|Serial Number Range||7003-(up)|\n|Retail High Price||$1,710,000.00 / 1,341,837.00€|\n|Retail Low Price||$680,000.00 / 533,596.00€|\n|External Dimensions (ft)||Meridian, PA-46-500T|\n|Internal Dimensions (ft)||Meridian, PA-46-500T|\n|Internal Length (Overall/Net Height)||12.3|\n|Internal Width (Max/Floor)||4.1|\n|Output (lbs ea.)/Flat Rating||500shp/ISA+55|\n|Data based on latest manufactured year|', 'Cessna 172 (10 Things You Need to Know)\nAsk a pilot to name a common single-engine fixed-wing aircraft, especially one that is good to learn on, and the Cessna 172 will quickly rise to the top of the list. From the original first flight in 1955 to its latest model still in production today, the Cessna 172 has been a reliable, dependable, easy-to-fly aircraft that is appreciated by students and seasoned pilots alike.\nIn this post we will explore the Cessna 172 and share ten things you need to know plus answers to the most frequently asked questions about this storied aircraft.\nBefore we delve into the things you need to know about the Cessna 172, let’s start with the basic specifications. Although there are many variations of the 172, we will share the specs for the current production model – the 172S.\nCessna 172S Specifications\n- Maximum occupants: 4\n- Maximum speed: 126 knots\n- Cruising speed: 124 knots (75% power, at 8000 feet)\n- Fuel capacity: 56 gallons\n- Maximum Range: 640 nm\n- Engine: Lycoming IO-360-L2A, 180 hp\n- Propeller: McCauley 2 blade metal, fixed pitch\n- Service ceiling: 14,000 feet\n- Maximum rate of climb: 730 fpm\n- Takeoff distance: 960 feet (ground roll), 1630 feet (total over 50-foot obstacle)\n- Landing distance: 575 feet (ground roll), 1335 feet (total over 50-foot obstacle)\n- Stall speed: 48 KCAS\n- Maximum ramp weight: 2558 pounds\n- Maximum takeoff weight: 2550 pounds\n- Maximum landing weight: 2550 pounds\n- Basic empty weight: 1680 pounds\n- Maximum useful load: 878 pounds\n- Baggage capacity: 120 pounds\n- Length: 27 feet 2 inches\n- Height: 8 feet 11 inches\n- Wingspan: 36 feet 1 inch\n- Wing area: 174 square feet\nNow that you know what to expect from the current Cessna 172 model, let’s take a look at the 172’s history and discover 10 must-know pieces of information about this aircraft.\n1. The Cessna 172 is the most-produced aircraft ever\nSince production began in 1956, over 43,000 Cessna 172s have been built with more still on the way. This legendary aircraft is well-loved, well-respected and still in demand more than sixty years after it first came on the market.\n2. There have been over 20 variations of the Cessna 172 (plus some special versions)\nOver the course of its long life, the Cessna 172 has naturally undergone a series of modifications, upgrades and enhancements while remaining true to the heart of her original solid design.\nAmong the most notable are the 172B which introduced the Skyhawk name, the 172D with its Omni-Vision rear wraparound window, and the 172S which incorporated Garmin G1000.\n3. Not all Cessna 172s were built in America\nIt is known as an American aircraft, but you may be surprised to learn that 1,436 Cessna 172s were actually built in France. From 1965-1971, Reims Cessna constructed the Cessna 172F. This model replaced a lever-operated flap system with electric flaps. It was also the basis for the U.S. Air Force’s T-41A Mescalero – a primary trainer.\n4. The “Skyhawk” name originally referred to a deluxe option package\nAlthough you may be used to hearing the name “Cessna Skyhawk,” originally, the Cessna 172 was called just that – the Cessna 172. It had no fancy name. The name Skyhawk came about in 1960 with the release of the 172B. This model had the option for a standard package or a deluxe option package – named the Skyhawk – with extra equipment and full exterior paint. Eventually the name stuck and came to refer to the entire Cessna 172 line-up.\n5. The 172’s tricycle landing gear design helps you ace your landings\nOne of the key design features of the 172 lineup has always been the tricycle landing gear design. This design was tested out on the WWII B-24, B-25 and B-26 bombers. The combination of a nosewheel in the front and moving the main wheels aft was found to make a tricycle landing gear aircraft easier to land.\nIn this configuration, the center of gravity (COG) is in front of the main wheels. What this means to you is that when you land in a tricycle gear aircraft, if you are crooked, the airplane’s weight will help to straighten you out. By contrast, a conventional landing gear setup has a center of gravity that is aft of the main wheels. Land crooked in this type of aircraft, and your mistake will just get exacerbated by the influence of the aircraft’s weight.\n6. Cessna 172s are used as trainer aircraft for many flight schools\nIf you have a private pilot’s license, odds are that you trained on a 172 at some point. Flight schools love this aircraft for several reasons. The ease of flying a tricycle landing gear configuration is a main selling point as are the forgiving handling characteristics and increased visibility of the high wing design plus rear “Omni-Vision” window.\nIn fact, the 172 is so stable that its built-in aerodynamic stability can often return a plane to straight and level flight after a spin even without input from the pilot.\n7. The world record for the longest endurance flight is held by a Cessna 172\nImagine what it would be like for a small aircraft to fly non-stop for over 64 days. Bob Timm and John Cook did just that from December of 1958 to February of 1959. Their 64-day, 22-hour, 19-minute flight out of Las Vegas still holds the endurance record.\nTimm and Cook flew a modified Cessna 172 which was named The Hacienda after the Hacienda Hotel who sponsored the $100,000 flight as a combined publicity stunt and fundraiser for cancer research.\nTo prepare for the flight, the team added a 95-gallon belly fuel tank to augment the 47 gallons carried in the wing tanks. An electric pump in the belly tank allowed fuel to be pumped into the wing tanks for refueling. Oil lines were replumbed to allow inflight oil and oil filter changes. In the cabin, the pilot seat stayed, but everything else was removed and a 4’x4’x4” foam pad was added as a bed for the off-duty pilot. An added platform off the co-pilot side allowed for better footing during refueling. A small sink in the rear was used for washing and shaving.\nAn FAA waiver allowed the overweight aircraft to operate at 350-400 pounds over the normal limit. Twice a day the Hacienda would rendezvous with a Ford truck over a straight stretch of closed off highway. Flying 20 feet above the ground, the Hacienda used an electric winch to hook a refueling hose from the truck. Three minutes later with its belly tank full, the Hacienda would release the hose and continue her flight.\nThe next time you pass through the Las Vegas McCarren Airport’s baggage claim area, look up – the Hacienda is hanging from the ceiling at the airport where her historic flight began and ended.\n8. There was (briefly) a diesel-powered Skyhawk on the market\nGiven the lower cost of Jet A and its more readily accessible nature overseas, Cessna decided to release a diesel version of the Skyhawk in 2017. The Turbo Skyhawk JT-A came powered by a Continental CD-155 diesel engine and received high marks in fuel efficiency and power.\nUnfortunately, the diesel engine also resulted in a higher purchase price ($420,000 compared to $307,000 for the 172S) and reduced payload capacity because of the added weight. Just 11 months after receiving FAA certification, the JT-A was discontinued due to poor sales.\n9. The triangle gear Skyhawk almost didn’t happen\nRumor has it that when a group of Cessna engineers approached the Cessna marketing department with their idea for a triangle gear aircraft, they were shot down. Marketing wanted to focus on tailwheel aircraft. Thankfully for Cessna and for all of us, the engineers were undaunted, and they continued work to build out the first concept version of the tricycle-geared Cessna 172 that we all know and love. Ultimately it met with approval and went into production.\n10. The Cessna 172 can be powered electrically (at least as a proof-of-concept)\nElectric Skyhawks may be in our future. In 2012, Cessna and Beyond Aviation worked together to develop an electrically powered variation of the Cessna 172. The aircraft took multiple successful test flights powered by the Panacis batteries that take the place of the back seats. One of the big advantages of an electric aircraft would be imperviousness to density altitude changes.\nBonus: Answers to Frequently Asked Questions\nFinally, we have rounded up the answers to some of the most frequently asked Cessna 172 questions.\n1. How safe is the Cessna 172 compared to other aircraft?\nThe 172 has an impressive safety record, especially when compared to the industry average. Statistically, the Cessna 172’s fatal accident rate is .56 per 100,000 hours. This is about half of the industry average rate of 1.2-1.4.\n2. How much does it cost to own and operate a Cessna 172?\nCost is an important consideration for most pilots when they are contemplating the purchase of an aircraft. Beyond the purchase price, you must also account for operational costs, storage, insurance, maintenance and more. AOPA crunched the numbers for you and put together a hypothetical operating cost calculation for a Cessna Skyhawk\nThis particular calculation was based on a 1975 Cessna 172M with a purchase price of $39,000. For comparison, the purchase price of a new Cessna 172S is around $307,000.\nLoan payments in the AOPA scenario were calculated at $290 for a $35,000 loan over 20 years at 7.9%. AOPA insurance payments came to $1200 a year, and hangar space rental was $250 a month, which equates to $3000 a year.\nYearly maintenance was estimated to be $2500 or $25/hr. for flying 100 hours or $4000 ($13.34/hr.) over 300 yearly hours.\nThe final factor to consider is any kind of projects you want to do, especially to an older aircraft.\nThe final AOPA estimate comes out to $108.10 per hour if flying 300 hours a year or $225.30/hr. for 100 flight hours.\nThe total annual cost is around $22,530 for 100 yearly hours of flight and $32,430 for 300 hours.\nThat said, keep in mind that you can save money by opting for tie-downs rather than hangars, and hangar costs vary by location. The amount you owe on your aircraft loan (should you need to take one out) is also an important variable component of this calculation.\n3. What kind of engine does the 172 have?\nThe original 1955 Cessna 172 was powered by a Continental O-300 145 hp engine. In 1968, the 172I debuted the Lycoming O-320-E2D 150 hp engine. Previous engines had used 80/87 fuel, but the 1977 Skyhawk N (172N) tried out a Lycoming O-320-H2AD 160 hp engine running on 100-octane. The performance wasn’t favorable, so starting in 1981, the 172P switched to the Lycoming O-320-D2J.\nFactory-fitted fuel-injected engines arrived with the 1996 172R’s Lycoming 160 hp Lycoming IO-360-L2A.

73	Which is easier to diagnose: nerve damage from dental work or sports hernia?	Sports hernia is typically easier to diagnose through a thorough history and physical exam by a physician familiar with the condition, sometimes aided by imaging studies. Dental nerve damage can be more challenging to diagnose, as symptoms may not appear immediately after the procedure and can develop over time.	"['Potential Causes of Nerve Damage During Dental Procedures\nThere are several potential causes of nerve damage during dental procedures. One common cause is the improper administration of local anesthesia. If the dentist injects the anesthesia too close to a nerve or applies too much pressure, it can result in nerve damage. Another cause is excessive force during dental treatments, such as when extracting a tooth or performing a root canal. This can put pressure on the surrounding nerves and lead to damage.\nIn some cases, nerve damage may also occur due to surgical errors during procedures such as dental implant placement or jaw surgery. If the dentist makes an incision in the wrong area or damages a nerve during the surgery, it can result in long-term nerve damage.\nPotential causes of nerve damage during dental procedures:\n- Improper administration of local anesthesia\n- Excessive force during dental treatments\n- Surgical errors during procedures\nImproper administration of local anesthesia:\nThis occurs when the dentist injects the anesthesia too close to a nerve or applies too much pressure, resulting in nerve damage.\nExcessive force during dental treatments:\nIf excessive force is applied during procedures such as tooth extraction or root canal treatment, it can put pressure on surrounding nerves and lead to damage.\nSurgical errors during procedures:\nMistakes made during surgical procedures like dental implant placement or jaw surgery can result in incisions made in the wrong area or nerves being damaged, leading to long-term nerve damage.\nHow Common is Nerve Damage as a Result of Dental Treatments?\nNerve damage as a result of dental treatments is relatively rare, but it can occur in certain situations. The most common cause of nerve damage during dental procedures is the accidental injury to the inferior alveolar nerve or lingual nerve, which are responsible for sensation in the lower jaw and tongue respectively. This can happen during procedures such as tooth extractions, dental implants, or root canal treatments.\nWhile the overall incidence rate of nerve damage from dental procedures is low, it is important to note that certain factors can increase the risk. These include complex or invasive procedures, anatomical variations in nerve positioning, inexperienced dentists, and pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or compromised immune systems. It is crucial for dentists to be aware of these risks and take appropriate precautions to minimize the chances of nerve damage.\nSymptoms and Signs of Nerve Damage After a Dental Procedure\nRecognizing the symptoms and signs of nerve damage after a dental procedure is essential for early detection and prompt treatment. Common symptoms include numbness or tingling sensations in the affected area, loss of taste or altered taste perception, difficulty speaking or swallowing, and persistent pain or discomfort.\nIn some cases, patients may also experience muscle weakness or paralysis in the affected area. It is important to note that these symptoms may not appear immediately after the dental procedure but can develop over time. If any of these signs are present following a dental treatment, it is crucial to consult with a dentist or oral surgeon promptly for further evaluation and appropriate management.\nPreventive Measures Dentists Can Take to Minimize the Risk of Nerve Damage\nDentists have several preventive measures at their disposal to minimize the risk of nerve damage during dental treatments. Firstly, a thorough pre-operative assessment should be conducted to identify any anatomical variations or potential risk factors for nerve injury. This may involve the use of advanced imaging techniques such as cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) to visualize the nerves and surrounding structures.\nDuring the procedure, dentists should exercise caution and precision, especially when performing invasive or complex treatments near nerve-rich areas. The use of magnification tools, such as dental loupes or surgical microscopes, can enhance visibility and aid in avoiding accidental nerve injury. Additionally, continuous communication with the patient during the procedure can help identify any discomfort or unusual sensations that may indicate potential nerve damage.\nFurthermore, dentists should stay updated with the latest advancements in dental technology and techniques that aim to minimize the risk of nerve damage. By adhering to these preventive measures and maintaining a high standard of care, dentists can significantly reduce the occurrence of nerve damage during dental procedures.\nTemporary or Permanent: Nerve Damage from Dental Procedures\nNerve damage can occur during dental procedures, leading to temporary or permanent complications. Temporary nerve damage may cause numbness or tingling sensations in the affected area, which usually resolve on their own within a few weeks or months. However, in some cases, nerve damage can be permanent, resulting in chronic pain, loss of sensation, or difficulty performing everyday tasks such as eating or speaking.\nIt is important to consult with a medical professional if you experience any symptoms of nerve damage after a dental procedure. They can assess the extent of the damage and provide appropriate treatment options. In some cases, additional procedures may be necessary to repair the damaged nerves and alleviate symptoms.\nLegal Grounds for Suing a Dentist in Cases of Nerve Damage\nIf you have suffered nerve damage as a result of a dental procedure, you may have legal grounds to sue your dentist for negligence. To establish a successful lawsuit, you must prove that the dentist breached their duty of care towards you and that this breach directly caused your nerve damage. This requires demonstrating that the dentist failed to meet the standard of care expected within the dental profession.\nAn experienced personal injury attorney specializing in dental malpractice can help gather evidence such as expert testimonies and medical records to support your case. They will also guide you through the legal process and ensure your rights are protected throughout.\nProving Responsibility: Did Your Dentist Cause Nerve Damage?\nTo prove that your dentist caused your nerve damage, several factors need to be considered. First, it must be established that there was a doctor-patient relationship between you and the dentist at the time of the procedure. Second, it needs to be shown that the dentist acted negligently by deviating from accepted standards of care.\nMedical Records and Expert Testimonies\nObtaining your dental records is crucial in proving negligence. These records may contain important information about the procedure, any complications that occurred, and the steps taken by the dentist. Expert testimonies from other dental professionals can also provide valuable insights into whether the dentist’s actions were negligent.\nCausation and Damages\nFurthermore, it is necessary to establish a direct link between the dentist’s negligence and your nerve damage. This requires demonstrating that the nerve damage would not have occurred if proper care had been provided. Finally, you must provide evidence of the damages you have suffered as a result of the nerve damage, such as medical bills, lost wages, or pain and suffering.\nTime Limitations for Filing a Lawsuit Against a Dentist for Nerve Damage\nIt is important to be aware of the time limitations for filing a lawsuit against a dentist for nerve damage. These limitations vary depending on your jurisdiction and are typically outlined in state laws known as statutes of limitations. Failing to file within these timeframes may result in your case being dismissed.\nTo ensure you meet all deadlines, it is advisable to consult with an attorney specializing in dental malpractice as soon as possible after discovering your nerve damage. They will guide you through the legal process and ensure all necessary paperwork is filed within the appropriate timeframe.\nCompensation Sought in Lawsuits for Dental-Related Nerve Damage\nIn lawsuits for dental-related nerve damage, various types of compensation can be sought depending on the specific circumstances of each case. These may include:\n- Medical expenses: Reimbursement for past and future medical costs related to treating the nerve damage.\n- Lost wages: Compensation for income lost due to the inability to work during recovery or ongoing treatment.\n- Pain and suffering: Damages awarded for physical pain, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life caused by the nerve damage.\n- Disability or disfigurement: Additional compensation may be sought if the nerve damage results in permanent disability or disfigurement.\nAn experienced attorney will assess your case and determine the appropriate types of compensation to seek based on your specific circumstances.\nAlternative Dispute Resolution Methods Before Pursuing a Lawsuit Against a Dentist\nPrior to pursuing a lawsuit against a dentist for nerve damage, alternative dispute resolution methods can be explored. These methods aim to resolve conflicts outside of court and can potentially save time and money. Two common alternative dispute resolution methods are mediation and arbitration.\nIn mediation, a neutral third party known as a mediator facilitates discussions between you and the dentist with the goal of reaching a mutually acceptable settlement. The mediator does not make decisions but helps facilitate communication and negotiation between both parties.\nIn arbitration, an arbitrator is appointed to hear both sides of the case and make a binding decision. This process is similar to a trial but is typically less formal and more streamlined. The arbitrator’s decision is final, meaning it cannot be appealed in court.\nBefore considering alternative dispute resolution methods, it is advisable to consult with an attorney who can provide guidance on which approach may be most suitable for your specific situation.\nIn conclusion, it is possible to sue a dentist for nerve damage depending on the circumstances and evidence of negligence.\nCan nerve damage from dental work be repaired?\nInjuries to nerves during routine dental and oral surgery procedures are uncommon but can be treated effectively with proper management. It is important to conduct a thorough examination in a timely manner to increase the likelihood of successful surgical repair.\nWhat is the average settlement for nerve damage?\nThe settlement amount for nerve damage claims can vary depending on the severity of your injuries, how they affect your daily life, and the financial losses you incur as a result. Generally, settlements for nerve damage claims fall within the range of $15,000 to $100,000, although your specific claim could be lower or higher than these figures.\nHow common is nerve damage in dentistry?\nIt is common for branches of the trigeminal nerve to be damaged during maxillofacial surgery and dental procedures. However, in most cases, the symptoms are temporary and patients typically regain sensation over time.\nIs it hard to prove nerve damage?\nDiagnosing nerve conditions can be challenging, and many patients suffer for years without understanding or finding effective relief from their muscle weakness or pain. Our specialists recognize that the underlying cause of a nerve condition is not always apparent and may require thorough investigation to uncover.\nCan a doctor prove nerve damage?\nA skin biopsy is a medical test that can assist doctors in determining if there is nerve damage that is causing a loss of sensation.\nWhat happens if dentist hits a nerve?\nIndications of Nerve Injury If you have experienced nerve damage after a dental treatment, you may encounter the following symptoms: loss of sensation or numbness in the gums, cheeks, jaw, face, or tongue; a tingling or pulling sensation in these regions.', ""Painful 'sports hernias' aren't true hernias at all, doctor says\nUpdated 8:02 am, Saturday, October 6, 2012\nThat chronic groin pain sometimes felt by athletes may be called a sports hernia, but it's not really a hernia at all, according to Dr. Katherine G. Lamond, assistant professor of surgery at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and a surgeon at the University of Maryland Medical Center.\nQ: What is the difference between a sports hernia and other hernias?\nA: The classic definition of the word hernia is a protrusion of tissue through an opening. Hernias can occur in a number of places, but most commonly in the umbilicus and inguinal canal or after previous abdominal surgery.\nA sports hernia is not in fact a hernia, but rather a term that refers to chronic groin pain typically found in athletes. A region of the inguinal canal, which is a tunnel in the lower abdominal muscle wall, becomes weakened and causes pressure on nerves and therefore debilitating pain. An inguinal hernia also causes groin pain, however it is also associated with a bulge or swelling along the groin or in the testicle.\nQ: Are sports hernias common, and who is most prone to have one?\nA: Sports hernias are much less common than a classic inguinal hernia. Male athletes are more likely to be diagnosed with a sports hernia than females.\nSports hernias are extensively described in professional soccer players in Europe. Lacrosse, football and ice hockey are other common sports that may make athletes more susceptible.\nQ: What are the symptoms?\nA: It can be difficult to diagnose a sports hernia; however, a thorough history and physical exam by a physician familiar with sports hernia is usually sufficient. Sometimes imaging studies, such as an MRI, X-ray or ultrasound can be helpful, especially to rule out other injuries, such as muscle strains or hip abnormalities. It is crucial to undergo a thorough evaluation, because symptoms of sports hernia can be similar to other medical problems. Often patients will complain of a sharp pain while kicking, running or pivoting, which may subside with rest. Discomfort with sit-ups and when getting in and out of a car is also frequently described.\nQ: Will it go away on its own or does it require treatment?\nA: Because a sports hernia is not a true hernia, it is possible for some athletes to recover with a combination of rest, physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medication. However, a sports hernia can also be a debilitating problem. In these cases, surgical treatment may be required.\nQ: If an athlete has surgery for sports hernia, how long might recovery take?\nA: Surgical therapy is typically an outpatient procedure. It is performed either through an open procedure or laparoscopically. In either case, one of the major goals besides pain relief is to return athletes to training and practice. With an appropriate rehabilitation program, athletes can often be competing within two weeks.\nQ: How can athletes prevent a recurrent injury?\nA: A stretching routine performed before and after exercise is a good habit to instill. Hip flexibility and strength are critical in prevention of sports hernias. When weight training, it is imperative to use a sensible routine for both flexion and extension muscle groups. Finally, core stability and strength will assist with balance and can help prevent sports-related injuries.""]"	['<urn:uuid:08a96bbd-e8b6-455e-a839-62f87a0a0c88>', '<urn:uuid:9997016c-cdfa-4a0d-a5fc-067fde12a4c6>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	13	49	2393

75	climate change fire management new solutions	With climate change causing more intense and frequent wildfires, new solutions include the National Incident Management System (NIMS) for coordinating local, state and federal agencies, along with advanced GIS technology and LiDAR data collection for proactive risk analysis. These tools enable real-time monitoring of fire incidents, simulation of fire spread, and evaluation of potential impacts within minutes of fire notification, helping emergency managers make more effective decisions in crisis situations.	"['Following the 2001 9/11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush in 2003 directed all federal agencies to use the National Incident Management System (NIMS). For many disasters this change has profoundly improved and changed the ability for local, state and federal agencies to work together with a common set of objectives. Yet it only works if it is fully used and, more important, it only works if there are decisive effective leaders commanding the disaster.\nEIS Council - 17 June 2021 - Robert Lewin joined a panel of Fire Service and Emergency Management professionals to share real-world stories and hard lessons learned by walking through key moments during the Thomas fire and the ensuing debris flow.\nHomeland Security Today - April 9, 2020 , Robert Lewin\nSeasoned disaster managers recognize that it is not just the best decision that needs to be made, it is the execution of those decisions.

With climate change and trending drought conditions, the occurrence and intensity of wildfires is increasing annually. Fire seasons are getting longer, fires are becoming more intense, and the subsequent impacts are more devastating.\nWhile this change in wildfire frequency and intensity is putting people living in the Wildland Urban Interface at more risk, it is also affecting industries that service society through communication, power and other related facilities. In particular, electric and communication companies have substantial risk and liability from wildfires. This includes the risk of potential damage to critical infrastructure assets, such as utility poles, structures and transmission/distribution conductors.\nIn addition, power lines are often a cause of fire ignitions, especially when lines are blown down due to high winds and extreme weather conditions. This issue is not restricted to certain areas of the U.S., although the Santa Ana winds that occur in Southern California are frequently reported in the press. Some of the wildfires that occurred in the 2007 Firestorm in San Diego County were caused by downed power lines. This can result in significant liability for electric utility companies.\nWith recent advancements in GIS technology, LiDAR data collection, and fire science, solutions are now readily available to proactively analyze wildfire risk and potential exposure. This information can be used to support mitigation of vegetation and fuels to reduce the potential for ignition and extensive fire spread when fires do occur. Electric companies are actively engaging in risk analysis to support vegetation management activities to reduce potential damage and liability. LiDAR data provides a detailed source of vegetation data for power line rightof-ways as well as surrounding areas.\nIn addition to incorporating wildfire risk analysis as a standard element of asset management practices, companies are also interested in real-time monitoring of fire incidents, including simulating fire spread, and evaluating potential impacts for individual fires in real time. This information can be obtained in minutes of a fire notification, providing capabilities to alert key managers on potential consequences. This information is key for decision making in support of response, suppression, and infrastructure logistics and activities. By providing real time analysis, more accurate information is available to support response for company field crews, as well as coordination with fire management agency partners and the public.\nMethods for Mapping Vegetation, Fuels, Landscape Characteristics and Infrastructure\nVegetation encroachment is an on-going issue for electric utility companies. Practices and programs are in place to support on-going inspection and trimming of vegetation to minimize potential damages to lines. LiDAR data is a critical data source for providing detailed, accurate data to support ROW vegetation management. LiDAR data is collected along a corridor and processed to identify ""points-of-interest"" (POI). These POIs are then used to develop projects that are designed to raise structures and their associated conductors or to trim the surrounding vegetation, decreasing the likelihood of ""grow-in"" or ""fall-in"" occurrences.\nFigure 1 presents an example of using LiDAR data to identify areas where vegetation is encroaching on power line ROWs and could potentially damage lines during certain weather conditions.\nTraditionally vegetation and fuels data has been derived using remote sensing processing methods to determine vegetation species, type and fuels load. Satellite or aerial imagery is a common source providing data at resolutions varying from 1m to 30m on the ground. Medium resolution data, such as 10m to 30m, is ideal for wildfire risk analysis across large landscapes, such as counties or states. This data can be used for fire behavior analysis providing adequate scale outputs when combined with asset data.\nFor local areas and specific sites or ROWs, more detailed data is often required. LiDAR provides the most robust and cost-effective approach for acquiring high resolution data, for vegetation, canopy mapping, and infrastructure mapping (poles, towers and conductors). Recent methods have been developed to analyze LiDAR data to provide very detailed representations of vegetation canopy. This is important for localized canopy fire potential mapping. While not commonly applied in fire management agencies or private industry today, LiDAR holds promise for providing the most accurate mapping of site-specific fire hazards in the future. It is anticipated that LiDAR will become the norm for data acquisition for certain industries, especially when conditions of man-made features combined with natural vegetated landscapes are important.\nWhile LiDAR mapping specifically addresses vegetation encroachment concerns, it does not immediately address risk from wildfire due to infrastructure-caused ignitions. The potential damage from wildfires is an issue for power companies in two ways: 1) potential damage to infrastructure assets from wildfires that start elsewhere and burn into infrastructure, and 2) potential damage to homes, people and commercial buildings from wildfires caused by power lines. The second issue can have substantial financial liability associated with it as seen in recent legal decisions across the Nation.\nAnalyzing Wildfire Risk for Infrastructure Assets\nWildfire risk assessment and fire behavior analysis methods are well defined in the fire management arena. The fire science, while being sophisticated, is available through custom programs and vendors, to define potential fire conditions and quantify areas of greatest risk. In particular, the development of GIS datasets that define surface fuels, canopy fire potential, rate of spread and flame length (fire intensity) provide excellent information to aid companies in determining the risk surrounding infrastructure assets.\nSurface fuels are a definition of the expected fire behavior based on fuel loads for specific vegetation types, given density, and topographic conditions (elevation, slope, aspect). Of special concern is the potential for a canopy fire to occur, as compared to a surface fire. Canopy fires occur in specific situations when weather conditions and vegetation characteristics conspire to produce extreme fire situations where spread and intensity can cause extreme conditions and significant damage. Other fire behavior outputs, such as rate of spread define how quickly a fire will move across the landscape given active weather, fuels and topography; flame length is a measure of fire intensity, describing the conditions of a fire front. Higher flames generally mean worse conditions and greater potential for damage when a fire reaches an asset, infrastructure or building.\nDetermining Risk to Prioritize Mitigation Projects\nCompanies must be concerned about risk conditions not only at the location of assets, but also adjacent to assets, and surrounding proximity. Consideration of surrounding fire behavior conditions is a critical element in determining those areas of most concern, and prioritizing mitigation activities to reduce fuel loads and vegetation density. Identifying these areas helps companies proactively work with private landowners and local government agencies in planning activities to reduce and mitigate risk. This typically involves fuel treatments to minimize fire intensity and spread should a fire occur.\nFigure 2 presents examples of wildfire risk analysis outputs that are used to assess conditions around infrastructure assets, and lead to identification of priority areas for mitigation and partner collaboration. The map on the left portrays fire behavior Rate of Spread (measured in chains per hour) for an area in San Diego. Orange and red areas represent extreme spread conditions where a wildfire will move quickly across the landscape. Note the conditions not only within the Right of Ways (ROW) but also in areas adjacent to those areas. The map on the right presents a zoomed in example of the same data showing only the ROS within the ROW. These orange and red areas should be considered as priorities for vegetation management and fuels mitigation.\nEnhancing Asset Management Risk Evaluation\nThe mapping of wildfire risk can also be combined directly with infrastructure data to aid in the calculation of risk scores for assets. Traditionally risk scores are derived using asset management software by considering inspection data and asset characteristics, such as age of the asset, voltage/capacity, recovery complexity, number of identified defects (based on inspection), and other Failure Modes. However, recently some companies are expanding this risk evaluation to include wildfire risk, at or near, the particular asset. Wildfire risk data provides additional information that can useful in determining priorities for conducting asset inspections, or establishing priorities for work orders to correct asset deficiencies identified by field inspections. Figure 3 presents an example of where wildfire intensity data has been assigned to poles and integrated into the VUEWorks asset management software for consideration during failure mode analysis and subsequent work order prioritization.\nMonitoring Active Wildfires and Quantifying Potential Impacts\nElectric utility infrastructure can also be a source of wildfire ignitions, resulting in substantial liability to companies. Typical situations occur when high winds and extreme weather can cause power lines to fall and spark underlying vegetation. Many companies actually have their own firefighter crews for initial attack and suppression of wildfires to respond to these situations. In addition, companies actively collaborate with local fire management agencies to provide supplemental resources during any fire scenario.\nWhile risk analysis methods help to proactively mitigate risk, they do not address real-time incident requirements. Having current information about when ignitions occur, where they are, and their potential for damage is important information used to direct company resources for suppression efforts. Timely, accurate information about an incident is critical for reducing damages and potential liability.\nWith recent advancements in fire modeling and GIS technologies, tools are now available to provide services to monitor active fire incidents, simulate the spread of fires, and calculate potential impacts and damage in real time. DTSwildfire (Orlando, FL) offers a suite of advanced capabilities to meet these needs using a web and mobile subscription service. By integrating with local, state and federal dispatch systems, DTSwildfire is able to track verified active incidents, and then simulate fire spread on-the-fly, providing the basis for quantifying potential impacts to infrastructure, people and homes. Analysis is done automatically in less than 2 minutes providing incident impact reports via email quickly to key company decision makers. This approach monitors fire status and informs when thresholds for potential damage are met. An interactive web mapping application provides more advanced tools for qualified users to conduct more detailed analysis should the incident warrant, particularly for large fires that extend beyond a day.\nThe impact analysis uses a range of data sources to produce the summary report. Often this may include census data, local parcel and assessor data used to identify home locations and values, detailed building locations, and proprietary company data on ratepayers, customers and infrastructure assets.\nFigure 4 presents examples of the real-time incident monitoring outputs generated by the DTSwildfire subscription service. The map on the left shows the expected spread of a wildfire for 12 hours during typical Santa Ana event conditions in San Diego County. The simulation mimics an ignition caused by a downed power line. The map on the right presents a more detailed view of the ignition location and local spread conditions near adjacent homes and infrastructure.\nFigure 5 presents an example of the DTSwildfire interactive web mapping application with typical impact analysis reports that are generated in seconds for any fire simulation.\nConclusion & Next Steps\nField activities for vegetation management, asset inspections, and hardening of power lines can be costly. Knowing the most at-risk areas is critical information to help prioritize where field activities should be focused, and where investments should be made. Understanding wildfire risk and the potential impacts is also key to reducing corporate liability and justifying insurance coverage determination. This approach will provide an immediate Return-on-Investment to any utility looking to quantify their potential fire risk as well as implementing a program to mitigate these risks in their highest consequence areas.\nThe integration of wildfire risk analysis, asset management and advanced modes of data acquisition, such as LiDAR, offer many benefits to electric utilities and service providers. These include:\nProactively mitigate risk through the ability to target and prioritize vegetation management activities and homeowner prevention programs\nMore accurately estimate costs for mitigation activities by identifying risk near company assets.\n$ Where should you focus vegetation management, mitigation and prevention efforts?\n$ Where should you prioritize more frequent inspections of network infrastructure and assets?\n$ Prioritize expenditures for line maintenance by including surrounding wildfire risk conditions.\n$ Where are jurisdictional collaboration, agreements and partnerships required?\nKnow where to locate new assets to minimize potential risk and damage in the future.\nIdentify those home and business owners who are located in high risk areas around your assets to support outreach and prevention programs.\n$ Identify and potentially justify additional costs to rate payers in high risk areas to support company mitigation efforts.\nReal-time forecasting of where a wildfire is going and what is actually happening.\n$ Immediately determine potential impacts to support operations and response efforts.\n$ Prioritize service restoration and mobilization of resources.\n$ Minimize employee risk for field teams.\nThrough technology and scientific advancements, opportunities now exist to enhance the ability of electric utility and communication companies to better address and respond to infrastructure maintenance requirements by integrating consideration of wildfire risk and impacts. In the future, the integration of wildfire modeling will become the norm and ultimately help to reduce the damage and liability caused by wildfires for this industry. The need for more detailed data, from technologies like LiDAR, will be critical to providing the most accurate, and up-to-date information possible.\nJason Amadori is the CMO of DTS and VueWorks.

76	what conservation methods exist for canadian forest wildlife and what are organizations doing to protect habitat	The Endangered Species Act previously required industries to prove their activities would provide an overall benefit to species, though this has been weakened to only requiring harm reduction. Meanwhile, organizations like Ducks Unlimited are working to protect habitat by partnering with forward-thinking companies, investing in research to understand industrial impacts, and developing sustainable industrial practices that conserve wildlife habitat. They are also working to convince key audiences about the importance of habitat conservation and demonstrate how it can help companies achieve business objectives.	"['Last week, Ontario’s Divisional Court upheld a ruling, challenged by Ontario Nature and Wildlands League, which removes two core provisions from the Endangered Species Act. Lara Tessaro, lawyer with Ecojustice, stated of the decision, “It takes out the heart of what the Act is.”\nThe regulations target sections 9 and 10 of the Endangered Species Act which in summary prohibits the killing of endangered species in Ontario and prohibits damage to the habitat of endangered species. The regulation exempts major industry such as forestry, mining or energy development from complying with those sections.\nHowever, the regulations may exempt myriad industry and developments. “People engaging in all kinds of harmful activities have been exempted – not just giant mines, but even early mining exploration which people consider a less major development. But from a species survival situation that isn’t always the case. An urban housing development, for example, can be just as devastating to their survival as a mine,” remarked Tessaro.\nThe ruling provides that industry is required to meet some standard of conditions but Tessaro argues that the criteria works to a lower standard of protection.\n“Mining activities are accepted if steps are taken to lessen the amount of killing and habitat destruction caused by the industry,” she explained. “Prior to the regulation, industries would have to prove that even though they might be causing some harm to the species that the activity would have an overall benefit to the species. Now all the company has to do is show that they are lessening the harm to that endangered species. We argued that it undermined what the purpose of the Act is about, which is not to do with lessening the harm to endangered species, but protecting them. The Court did not agree.”\nWhen it was established in 2007, the Endangered Species Act was lauded as the ‘Gold’ standard for its’ protection of endangered species as well as for the flexibility it afforded for development.\nCaroline Schultz is the executive director with Ontario Nature.\n“In our view the regulation actually undermined the intent of the Act to protect and recover species at risk,” she remarked. “Having legal protection for endangered species is paramount. The Act was all about balancing and being able to proceed with certain activities but also making sure that there was compensatory action taken so that the species was better off. This Act, prior to the regulation, provided a lot of opportunity to work out solutions.”\nOver the past five years Schultz, as well as various conservation entities, observed a gradual slide away from the government’s commitment to the Act. Schultz offered her thoughts about why this may have occurred.\n“There wasn’t enough dialogue with partners and stakeholders about innovative ways to implement the Act. I think the government made a big problem for itself with the way it was implementing and then decided that everything was way too expensive and cumbersome. That’s why they attempted to pull back and they tried to do that by gutting much of what the Act provided for.”\nSchultz expressed concern regarding the fate of all endangered species but specifically spoke about the threat to Ontario’s six herds of caribou.\n“Unless forestry industries are required to reduce their ecological footprint we know that the woodland caribou will decline. Unfortunately now with the regulations we have in place, the Endangered Species Act is of no help in reducing that footprint,” remarked Schultz.\nAccording to Schultz, the habitat of two woodland caribou herds overlap with industrial forest operations. Government research shows that these two herds will not survive. As for the remaining four herds- their survival rate is 50/50.\n“Without the intervention of the Endangered Species Act that actually requires Forestry to operate in a way that won’t affect caribou- those odds are pretty poor. Over a century, caribou habitat has shrunk northwards with forest activity. We do believe that forestry and caribou can exist but it means large protected areas and not going in to critical caribou habitat. What’s working now for forestry isn’t working for the caribou.”\nSo why the ongoing match between environment and industry?\n“It’s not wanting to change practices and fearing that changes are going to affect the bottom line,” mused Schultz. “But the entire jobs versus environment thing is really just a red herring. It’s very clear that the two can co-exist provided we have something like the Endangered Species Act where there is a provision of mechanisms that provide flexibility for both.”\nSchultz challenges that different industry models need to be considered regarding economic and employment gains that can be drawn from the natural environment.\n“The jobs versus environment thing really gets amped up in the North. The North is traditionally a resource extraction based economy. We need to look at a range of economic activities that are still resource based but done in a different way. There are many more opportunities in terms of livelihood that can be derived from the forest other than the traditional approach to forest management. One of the projects Ontario Nature is working on is a Forest and Fresh Water Food program. We’re engaging communities and First Nations in the North to look at the economic potential of harvesting forest products that aren’t timber.”\nTessaro put forward that provisions provided in the Endangered Species Act creates an even stronger economy.\n“Sustainable economic development is economic development that protects the environment. To view economic development and environmental protection as at odds with each other ignores that a lot of our economic strengths comes from having a healthy, clean environment that is rich in biodiversity. The most obvious example is Tourism,” expounded Tessaro. “People come to Ontario and other parts of Canada because -unlike so many other parts of the word, there are still healthy natural areas here. I think Ontarians accept that we need to promote a healthy environment and a healthy economy that go hand in hand.”\nOntario Nature and Wildlands League are considering next steps. The two groups have until June 12th to put forward a request to appeal before the Ontario Court of Appeal.\nPress Release issued by Ontario Nature\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nStatement on Divisional Court ruling on Ontario’s Endangered Species Act\nTORONTO — Ontario’s Divisional Court has upheld a provincial regulation that exempts major industries from the Endangered Species Act and allows them to kill species at risk and destroy their habitat.\n“This is a disappointing decision for Ontario’s endangered and threatened wildlife,” said Ecojustice lawyer Lara Tessaro. “The Endangered Species Act is intended to put species first — not to let their survival be balanced against competing industrial interests. That would tip the scale towards extinction.”\nWhen it was introduced in 2007, the Endangered Species Act was considered the gold standard law for species protection in North America. Unfortunately, recent years have seen Ontario shirk its duties to protect at-risk wildlife.\nIn 2013, the province introduced a regulation that exempts major industries from strict protection standards under the Endangered Species Act — in many cases giving them a free pass to kill endangered or threatened species and destroy their habitat, as long as this harm is “minimized.” To challenge this regulation, Ontario Nature and Wildlands League, represented by Ecojustice lawyers, brought a lawsuit that culminated in a hearing earlier this year.\n“There are too many plants and animals that are teetering on the edge in this province,” said Anna Baggio of Wildlands League. “We will continue to speak up for them until their habitat is protected and until they are no longer at risk of extinction.”\nSome of Ontario’s 155 at-risk species threatened by the regulation include the American Eel, Blanding’s Turtle, Lakeside Daisy, Jefferson Salamander, Eastern Meadowlark, and the iconic Woodland Caribou.\n“In the past 40 years, the earth has lost over half of its wildlife,” said Caroline Schultz. “Today’s ruling certainly won’t help the situation. The prospects for Ontario’s most vulnerable plants and animals just got a whole lot bleaker.”\nThe groups are reviewing the decision and considering their options.\nFor more information, please contact:\nLara Tessaro, Staff Lawyer | Ecojustice: 416-368-7533 ext. 531, 647-462-1834 (mobile)\nAnna Baggio, Director of Conservation Planning | Wildlands League: 416-453-3285 (mobile)\nCaroline Schultz, Executive Director | Ontario Nature: 416-444-8419 ext. 237, 416-768-9795 (mobile)', 'Waterfowl in a Changing Land\nIn the early days of waterfowl management, the boreal forest remained largely a pristine wilderness with little need for active conservation\n. This is no longer true in many areas. The boreal forest has rich natural resources—oil, natural gas, timber, minerals, rivers that can generate hydropower, and in the south arable land—and these resources are now being exploited at a rapid rate. In Canada, portions of the western boreal forest are being developed or fragmented at a pace that far exceeds land-conversion rates in some Third World countries. Trees are being harvested for timber and pulp, and land is being cleared for the extraction of a variety of natural resources. Roads are being built across wetlands, which can also impact downstream habitats. And water is being diverted and pumped from lakes, rivers, and aquifers for industrial use. Between 1966 and 1994, agriculture in parts of the southern boreal forest expanded three times faster than the global rate. Development has now impacted more than 87 million acres—an area equal in size to the state of New Mexico—in the Canadian western boreal forest alone.\n""Twenty-five years ago, the boreal forest was barely on maps of important waterfowl areas in North America—just a few scattered sites. That\'s changed,"" says Jeff Nelson, CEO of Ducks Unlimited Canada\n. ""It\'s not that the number of ducks here has grown dramatically over that time; we\'ve just come to better recognize the continental significance of this area and the growing threats there to duck habitat\nPopulation trends among waterfowl species vary substantially across the boreal region. In Canada\'s western boreal forest, populations of scaup, mallards, American wigeon, and scoters have recently declined below North American Waterfowl Management Plan (NAWMP)\ngoals. In Alaska, however, populations of these same birds are near or above NAWMP objectives. The reasons for this variation are largely unknown, but landscape changes may be contributing factors.\nWhile forests can regenerate over time with sound management, the current scale and rate of cumulative landscape change in the boreal forest may reduce the region\'s ability to sustain historical waterfowl populations. Climate change also threatens the boreal forest\'s fragile ecology. Recent studies suggest that in parts of Alaska melting permafrost has resulted in wetland losses of 30 percent. The combined effects of climate change and industrial activity are not fully known, but some evidence suggests that the removal of forest cover accelerates the melting of permafrost, which could result in increased wetland losses. The implications of ongoing habitat loss and degradation are that fewer waterfowl may settle in impacted areas, and those that do settle in these areas will experience lower survival or productivity.\nSustainable Land Use in the Boreal Forest With industrial development occurring on millions of acres in Canada\'s boreal forest, Ducks Unlimited and its partners are actively working to foster public land-use policies and industrial practices that conserve waterfowl habitat. Specifically, DU and its partners are working to accomplish the following goals:\n- Convince key audiences that conserving waterfowl habitat in the boreal forest is important.\n- Invest in science to better understand the potential impact of industrial activities on wetlands and waterfowl.\n- Partner with forward-thinking companies that wish to include habitat conservation in their sustainable development initiatives.\n- Demonstrate how habitat conservation can help companies achieve their business objectives.\n- Guide development of industrial practices that conserve waterfowl habitat.']"	['<urn:uuid:7d0c3ec9-9791-4f5d-96e1-72af976cdd14>', '<urn:uuid:1c2ca47e-ef0e-4ec0-a4e6-429aec8443e1>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	16	83	1938
77	effects anechoic chamber human body balance hearing	When people enter an anechoic chamber, they experience unique sensations. The absence of sound can feel deafening, causing a sense of fullness in the ears or ringing. People can hear their own heartbeat, breathing, and even the sound of their bones grinding when moving. The absolute lack of reverberation affects spatial awareness, leading to loss of balance. Very faint sounds become clearly audible due to the exceptionally low ambient noise.	"['Inside the world\'s quietest room\nIf you stand in it for long enough, you start to hear your heartbeat. A ringing in your ears becomes deafening. When you move, your bones make a grinding noise. Eventually you lose your balance, because the absolute lack of reverberation sabotages your spatial awareness.\nIn this room at Microsoft\'s headquarters in Redmond, Washington, all sound from the outside world is locked out and any sound produced inside is stopped cold. It\'s called an ""anechoic"" chamber, because it creates no echo at all -- which makes the sound of clapping hands downright eerie.\nThe background noise in the room is so low that it approaches the lowest threshold theorized by mathematicians, the absolute zero of sound -- the next step down is a vacuum, or the absence of sound.\nThis is the world\'s quietest place.\nThe room offers a very rare sensorial experience.\n""As soon as one enters the room, one immediately feels a strange and unique sensation which is hard to describe,"" wrote Hundraj Gopal, a speech and hearing scientist and the principal designer of the anechoic chamber at Microsoft, in an email.\n""Most people find the absence of sound deafening, feel a sense of fullness in the ears, or some ringing. Very faint sounds become clearly audible because the ambient noise is exceptionally low. When you turn your head, you can hear that motion. You can hear yourself breathing and it sounds somewhat loud,"" he said.\nIn the real world, Gopal explained, our ears are constantly subject to some level of sound, so there is always some air pressure on the ear drums. But upon entering the anechoic room this constant air pressure is gone, since there are no sound reflections from the surrounding walls.\n""This is a novel experience,"" he wrote.\nA concrete onion\nTo achieve extreme silence, the room is designed with an onion-like structure that isolates it from the rest of the building and the outside world.\nIt\'s made of six layers of concrete and steel and it is somewhat disconnected from the surrounding building, because it sits atop an array of vibration damping springs. Inside, fiberglass wedges are mounted on the floor, ceiling and walls to break up sound waves before they have a chance to bounce back into the room. The floor itself is simply a grid of sound-absorbing suspended cables.\n""The design, planning and construction took a little over one and a half years,"" confirmed Gopal.\n""I needed a good location on campus where the measured noise levels inside the building were adequately low. (...) I needed to plan the inside of the building so that I could nest the chamber six levels deep. We had to build a special 12"" concrete wall encasing the chamber to block out further ambient sound. Careful attention was paid to every detail that could conduct sound from outside to inside the chamber, such as isolating the sprinkler supply pipes and the fire-alarm sensor, or lining the air-supply and return ducts with additional sound absorbing material.""\nThe final result? ""The noise level measured inside is -20.3dBA. This means that the ambient noise in the chamber is 20.3dB below the threshold of human hearing.""\nBy comparison, one of the quietest sounds that can be heard in a quiet room, calm breathing, clocks in at 10dB.\nMicrosoft\'s chamber is currently registered in the Guinness World Record as the world\'s quietest place, a title it claimed in 2015 at the expense of a similar chamber at Orfield Labs in Minneapolis. But unlike Microsoft\'s, that chamber is open to the public, which has turned it into a small tourist attraction.\n""We get thousands of requests. Members of the public visit from around the world almost every week, and they are just about always excited by the experience. There is no skeptical reaction, as this is simply a bodily experience, and there\'s nothing to learn or believe,"" wrote Steve Orfield, who constructed his own lab and anechoic chamber in a building that was once home to Studio 80 -- a renowned recording studio where Bob Dylan, Prince and Cat Stevens have recorded songs.\nAccording to Orfield, the experience is somewhat influenced by the place where one was immediately before entering the chamber, because coming from a loud environment will make it harder to fully perceive the quietness. The quality of one\'s hearing also counts: the older you are, the harder it is to adapt and fully appreciate the quietness.\nHe also recommends turning off the lights. ""Most of the experiences of sensory deprivation include turning off all lighting, so that you are in aural and visual quiet, with no sensory noise. Under this circumstance, walking around the interior will make most people lose their balance after a short while.""\nOrfield, who has done research on the impact of noise in people with degenerative diseases such as dementia, also noted that visitors who suffer from autism, ADHD and other disabilities of anxiety and hyper-sensitivity tend to find the chamber calming and peaceful.\nWhat are they used for?\nAnechoic chambers are generally used to test noises and sounds coming from a variety of products with a high degree of scientific reliability.\nMicrosoft uses it for audio equipment such as microphones, receivers, headphones and speakers, or to analyze clicks and hums from computing devices like keyboards, mice, fans and backlight modules on touch panels and displays. Among the products that have benefited from the chamber are the Surface line of tablets, the Xbox gaming console and the HoloLens VR goggles, but also software where the audio component is dominant, like Skype and the Cortana virtual assistant.\nSince the chamber at Orfield Labs is the only accredited one in an independent lab in the United States, it attracts an even wider range of businesses and products: medical defibrillators, sleep-apnea machines, hearing aids, heart valves, appliances, automotive parts, computers and hard drives.\nDespite rumors to the contrary, there is no ""world record"" for time spent in the chamber consecutively by a person, and such challenges are not encouraged, although according to Orfield he receives many requests from people who want to ""beat the record.""\n""I\'ve spent about 45 minutes in the chamber, and since I have a mechanical heart valve, I can always hear it clearly,"" wrote Orfield.\n""The longest continuous time anyone has spent inside the chamber is about 55 minutes,"" confirmed Gopal at Microsoft.\n""I have noticed that there are several folks who can stay inside for 30 minutes or so. But others have asked to go out within the first few seconds.""']"	['<urn:uuid:b1b9d309-410a-4145-a5e6-713bb14ddfc6>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	7	70	1094
78	I'm curious about the speed comparison between hailstones and wind during severe storms - can you tell me how fast these weather elements can travel?	Both hailstones and storm winds can reach extremely high speeds. During severe storms, large hailstones can fall at speeds faster than 100 mph. As for wind speeds, straight-line winds in thunderstorms can exceed 100 mph. In the case of Australia's worst hailstorm in Sydney in 1999, hailstones hit the city at more than 200km/h.	['A freak* and furious hailstorm has turned an Australian beach into a winter wonderland*.\nHeavy hail came down in the coastal town of Cape Paterson in Gippsland, Victoria on Friday and transformed the sandy shoreline into a sea of white. It also turned horse paddocks into icy fields and tennis courts into surfaces more suitable for ice hockey.\nIt made for an unusual sight and got us wondering here at Kids News, what causes hail?\nHere are some answers:\nWHAT CAUSES HAIL?\nHail is created when small water droplets* are caught in the updraught* of a thunderstorm. These water droplets are lifted higher and higher into the sky until they move way above the freezing level and they form into ice. Once they become too heavy for the updraught to support, they will start to fall as hail.\nHailstones are actually clumps* of layered ice.\nHailstones start as small ice balls (called hail embryos*) if they come into contact with tiny particles in the air, such as a speck* of dust or dirt, or a salt crystal.\nGrowth into a full hailstone happens in the hail growth zone, where the updraught air temperature is -10 degrees Celcius* to -25 degrees Celcius. Here, hail embryos collide with super-cooled water droplets, causing them to freeze on impact. Once the hailstones have collided with enough of these droplets, building up in size, they become heavy enough for gravity* to take over, and begin to fall.\nHail can only form in thunderstorms or Cumulonimbus clouds*.\nHOW BIG CAN HAILSTONES GET?\nHailstones can be as big as the size of a cricket ball.\nTheir size depends on the strength and size of the updraught. Most of the time hailstones are smaller than 25mm which is about the size of a 10c piece. However, in very intense thunderstorms, the upward air motion inside the updraught is so strong that even larger hailstones are suspended or fall very slowly. In these storms, hailstones have more time to collect even more super-cooled water droplets and grow to larger sizes, such as golf-ball or cricket-ball size.\nAUSTRALIA’S WORST HAILSTORM\nOn April 14, 1999, Sydney experienced Australia’s worst hailstorm in history.\nHailstones the size of cricket balls hit the city at more than 200km/h. The storm hit 85 suburbs, causing damage to 20,000 houses, including windows, roofs and skylights.\nMore than 70,000 cars had windscreen and panel damage and 25 commercial planes were affected.\nWhen the storm was at its worst, emergency services received a call for help every 10 seconds.\nWhen it was over, the damage bill came to $1.7 billion, the most expensive natural disaster in Australian history.\nMOST COMMON TIMES FOR HAILSTORMS IN AUSTRALIA\nHail can occur at any time of year, but large hail is most common in Australia during spring and early summer when temperatures are warm enough to promote the development of strong thunderstorms and the upper atmosphere is still cool enough to support growth of stronger storms.\nSource: Bureau of Meteorology\n- freak: unusual, not normal\n- wonderland: a place full of wonderful things\n- droplets: a very small drop of liquid\n- updraught: upward movement of air\n- clumps: bunch\n- embryos: at an early stage, such as a seed\n- speck: a tiny spot\n- Celcius: measurement of heat\n- gravity: downward force\n- Cumulonimbus clouds: rain clouds\n- What is the air current called that lifts droplets to become hail?\n- What is a hail embryo?\n- How big can hailstones become?\n- Where was Australia’s worst hailstorm in history?\n- What was the damage bill for that disastrous storm?\nLISTEN TO THIS STORY\n1.

79	I work with food product development and I'd like to understand the difference between honey fraud detection methods and other common food fraud cases - how do the verification approaches compare?	For honey, specific verification methods include high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tests to assure purity, and laboratory testing for the presence of other sweeteners. The honey's hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) value is also used as an indicator of freshness and proper handling. In contrast, other food frauds are often harder to detect because natural products have infinite variations - criminals count on consumers not noticing subtle differences, such as wild salmon's pink color when cooked or taste differences between wines. The growing number of imported foods (85% of seafood, 39% of fruits/nuts, 18% of vegetables) makes verification more challenging, as products may be re-routed through different countries to evade US bans.	"['This article originally appeared on SmartMoney.com\nMost consumers know to ignore emails alerting them to foreign lottery winnings and to steer clear of ""designer"" bags sold on street corners. But experts say even scam-savvy shoppers may be falling prey to fraud at a surprising place: the grocery store.\nFood fraud -- the adulteration, dilution or mislabeling of goods stocked on the shelf -- is part of a growing trend of faux household goods . Although there is little data on the frequency of food fakery, experts say there\'s growing awareness of the problem. The lack of information on the subject recently prompted the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention -- a nonprofit that sets standards used by the FDA -- to establish a Food Fraud Database. And a new study in the Journal of Food Science analyzed the top offenders identified by the database, including olive oil, milk and honey. ""We\'re seeing similar trends in food to other items -- if it can be faked, it probably is,"" says Tara Steketee, the senior manager for brand protection at OpSec Security, an anti-counterfeiting consulting firm. ""There are actually counterfeit tomatoes, believe it or not."" (In that example, she says, garden-variety tomatoes get marketed as the more expensive heirloom ones.)\nMore on SmartMoney.com\nThe growing number of imported foods consumed by Americans makes it harder to identify the frauds, experts say. A recent FDA-commissioned Institute of Medicine study found the quantity of imported foods and drugs nearly tripled over the past 10 years. Currently, imports account for 85% of seafood, 39% of fruits and nuts and 18% of vegetables. That leads to great variety, but also increased risk from less rigorous food safety practices in other countries, says Clare Narrod, the risk analysis program manager for the University of Maryland\'s Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, who served on the committee preparing the Institute of Medicine study. Criminals may also re-route a problem product through other countries in an attempt to evade U.S. bans.\nFood is also one of the easier products to fake because the distinctions from the real deal are often subtle. ""The biggest challenge with food products is that they\'re natural, and there\'s an infinite number of variation in natural products,"" says John Spink, associate director of the Anti-Counterfeiting and Product Protection Program at Michigan State University, who authored the new Journal of Food Science study. Criminals are counting on shoppers not tasting differences between wines, and not noticing that their supposedly wild salmon isn\'t quite as pink as it should be when cooked. As more cooks experiment with high-end olive oils, artisanal meats and heirloom produce, passing off a cheap ingredient as its fancier counterpart grows more profitable, too.\nAvoiding fakes comes down largely to being an informed shopper and buying from trustworthy sources. Branded products tend to have more supply-chain safeguards, says Narrod. ""It\'s their reputation on the line, so they have things in place,"" she says. It can also help to buy products with shorter supply chains which tend to be local or minimally processed, Spink says. And if the taste of an item seems off, or you get sick, it\'s worth alerting both the store and the local public health department.\nBecause they\'re ingested, fraudulent foods carry more significant health concerns than other fakes. Consumers with allergies could have a reaction, says Amy Kircher, associate director of the National Center for Food Protection and Defense. Some substituted items aren\'t meant for human consumption, and others contain toxic ingredients like lead or melamine.\nHere are eight foods researchers say shoppers may unwittingly buy fraudulent versions of.\nStart your workday the right way with the news that matters most.

In fact, bees travel at about 15 miles per hour to gather nectar, and a hive must fly more than 50,000 miles to collect enough for a pound of honey. That’s a lot of ground to cover to satisfy consumers’ demand for natural sweetness.\n“Honey is the ideal sweetener because it not only imparts exceptional flavors in all bakery foods, but it also sweetens baked products naturally and gives bakers a ‘clean label’ alternative to other sweeteners,” said Emily Manelius, communication specialist, National Honey Board.\nJames Mitchell, innovations and development manager, Ciranda, Inc., Hudson, WI, added that honey is natural and comes in an organic form, both of which are desirable attributes for many products. Because of honey’s high sweetness level, he said, products made with honey rather than sugar can include less sugars, thus achieving slight calorie reductions.\nHoney has many functional benefits in bakery foods, Ms. Manelius said. It helps extend the shelf life of products with a natural ingredient. Honey’s fructose content holds in a bakery food’s moisture, and it has high acidity (average pH 3.91), which inhibits mold growth.\nAccording to research published in 2004 by M.A. Mundo, O.I. Padilla-Zakour and R.W. Worobo in the International Journal of Food Microbiology\n, honey has the capacity to serve as a natural food preservative because of the generation of hydrogen peroxide, which acts as an antibacterial agent. Other researchers identified compounds such as flavonoids, particularly caffeic and ferulic acids, as the most likely contributors to the antimicrobial activity.\nIn addition, honey can be used to add flavor and aroma to different products. According to the National Honey Board, there are more than 300 kinds of honey in the US, originating from such diverse floral sources as clover, eucalyptus and orange blossom. This simple, yet complex, variety of flavors allows food manufacturers to launch complete product lines of honey-sweetened foods, all with different flavor profiles.\nFor example, a product with buckwheat honey offers a robust flavor, while a clover or alfalfa honey provides a simpler, lighter honey taste. This is mainly because darker honeys generally contain higher amounts of minerals than lighter honeys, said Joe Hickenbottom, vice-president, sales and marketing, Malt Products, Corp., Saddle Brook, NJ. In general, lighter-colored honeys are mild in flavor, while darker honeys have a stronger profile (see “Functional Characteristics of Honey” below).\nReplacing existent sweeteners completely with honey usually changes the nature of the existing product, most prominently flavor and consistency. Honey’s acidic nature requires the addition of a small amount of baking soda, according to the National Honey Board — about 0.2 oz of baking soda per 12 oz of honey.\nOn a dry weight basis, honey is about 25% sweeter than sucrose. Mr. Mitchell recommended balancing moisture levels when using honey to replace sugar and lowering oven temperatures since honey browns more than most sweeteners. If a processor replaces a syrup-type sweetener such as high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), he said, the focus is generally on moisture differences, sweetness levels and flavor.\nBlending honey with HFCS can reduce overall cost yet provide properties similar to those of pure honey, Mr. Hickenbottom said, stressing that processors must label their products accordingly to avoid misleading consumers.\nWhen replacing sugar with honey, the humectancy of the product also changes. In baked goods, this usually is a good thing because the honey will help retain moisture and delay staling. Honey can replace up to half of the granulated sugar in a formulation and all of the sugar in some baked foods, but formulators need to take moisture into account. In general, they must reduce the amount of liquid called for a formula by 2 oz for each 12 oz of honey used. They must also reduce the oven temperature 25 F° to prevent over-browning.\nDepending on the application, honey color and flavor are the parameters that vary the most when considering different applications. This is primarily a factor of the floral source of the honey, although over-heating or processing can cause some darkening of otherwise lighter-colored honey.\nFormulators working with honey must pay special attention to the honey’s hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) value, said Alton Berquist, quality assurance, Ciranda, Inc. HMF is a compound created by fructose degradation. Because there is a great deal of fructose in honey, this value can be used as an indicator of freshness and handling of honey. Over-handling or heating can cause the HMF value to rise more quickly.\nSome importers and honey packers have been illegally importing honey by misrepresenting the true country of origin to circumvent dumping duties of $1.20 per pound. This results in honey of questionable origin being sold to companies and consumers, raising safety concerns and threatening the honey industry by undercutting fair market prices. “Cheap, illegal imports hurt all legitimate US packers and beekeepers,” said David Mendes, president of the American Beekeeping Federation, Atlanta, GA.\nHoney in the US market must meet Grade A filtered honey standards and comply with Food and Drug Administration provisions, Mr. Hickenbottom said. No additives of any kind are permitted, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tests can quickly assure the user of its purity. Some foreign imports have been banned since they are found to be adulterated, and Mr. Hickenbottom warned processors that Chinese honey is still under US government quarantine.\nIf a processor suspects an adulterated ingredient, the National Honey Board recommended sending a sample of the honey in question to a laboratory that tests honey for the presence of other sweeteners. If needed, a list of laboratories is available on its website, www.honey.com\n. Processors should know their supplier and ask what steps have been taken to ensure the purity and origin of the products. A price point substantially lower than market value is one cause for suspicion.\nWhen its source is verified, however, honey can add instant appeal to baked products. Consumers recognize products containing honey as being sweet, flavorful and nutritious, Mr. Hickenbottom said.\nOr as Ms. Manelius summed it up, “Honey is honey.” It is made in a beehive, not a manufacturing plant. Because it contains no other additives or ingredients, honey can allow bakers to cash in on the natural appeal it holds for consumers.']"	['<urn:uuid:43de2067-adce-4698-95e0-b980f724d5d8>', '<urn:uuid:b4df1dab-04d6-4064-9c6c-68a363338b99>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	31	108	1653

Medical diagnosis is a process that includes a physician’s analysis of the symptoms, taking into consideration the individual’s history and performing a health examination. It additionally involves a review of research laboratory results and analysis imaging examinations, and is concluded with a medical professional’s decision of what is triggering the symptoms. The word medical diagnosis originates from the Greek origin gnosis, indicating knowledge. Medical professionals invest a large part of their training learning how to make medical diagnoses.\nThe initial step in figuring out a medical diagnosis is called differential diagnosis. The doctor considers the many illness or problems that could be causing the patient’s symptoms and makes a checklist, typically in order of possibility. The doctor then contrasts this list to the signs and symptoms presented and starts a process of elimination that will certainly cause a final diagnosis.\nOnce a physician has established the reason for the person’s symptoms, they can start to create a treatment plan. Frequently, this will certainly entail drugs and other therapies that can boost the individual’s lifestyle. It is likewise essential for individuals to comprehend the medical diagnosis and the factor it was picked to make sure that they can be educated consumers of their health care.\nIt is important for physicians to plainly explain the diagnosis and its importance to their patients at every stage of the see. Medical professionals must prevent using ‘non-diagnoses’ such as ‘urosepis’, ‘breast infection’ or ‘Trop-T adverse breast pain’ that perplex and irritate the person and represent careless medicine.\nThe therapy of a client entails providing drug and/or surgical treatment to reduce signs, remedy illness, or improve health and wellness. Medical professionals play a significant duty in the field of medicine, making significant contributions to clinical improvements and person treatment. Their work extends past the boundaries of the health center or facility. They participate in medical trials and research studies to discover new approaches of dealing with individuals, in addition to share their knowledge via clinical write-ups and presentations.\nDoctors are likewise associated with informing the general public on various health-related subjects, dispelling misconceptions and supplying sound guidance. They coach and overview trainees that desire end up being doctors, helping them plan for the needs of the career.\nSome physicians also take part in community outreach by donating their time to charitable companies such as the Red Cross or Doctors Without Borders. They work to assist people in need, especially those with serious conditions such as cancer or diabetes. Additionally, they function to have pandemics by gathering info about brand-new viruses and sharing it with the public. These initiatives help the world stay healthy and balanced.

81	I'm interested in maintaining my engineering license across different states - how does the licensing transfer process typically work between states?	Most states allow an engineer licensed in one state to become licensed without further examination, as long as the requirements of the state that originally granted licensure at least equal their minimum standards. However, the actual process, documentation, requirements, etc. can vary from state to state.	"[""Having a Professional Engineer’s License (or PE) tells others that you are a competent engineer of high integrity and have high ethical standards. It is important for many chemical engineers right now and could be even more critical in the future as regulations and laws governing the practice of engineering change and as the culture of chemical engineering changes.\nGet perspectives on the PE Exam\nProfessional Engineering FAQ\nWhat is a PE?\nA Professional Engineer (PE) is an engineer that has been licensed by a state. The license symbolizes that the engineer has completed certain training and has demonstrated minimum competency in a field of engineering. The specific training required depends on the specific state where one seeks a licensure. In most cases this currently requires a BS from an ABET accredited engineering program, successful passing of the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam (FE), 4 years of practical experience, and passing the Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) Exam.\nWhy should I get a PE?\nThere are many reasons to obtain a PE. These include:\n- Your engineering career can extend over 40-50 years and it is almost impossible to predict what you will need many decades in the future. Having a PE gives you maximum flexibility.\n- It is generally much easier to obtain your PE early in your career while technical content is fresh in one’s mind, so why not do it? Plan for your future.\n- In some cases only a PE may attest to certain work products.\n- You may want to be a Private Practitioner (whether now or 20 years in the future). If so, a PE will be required to advertise or offer services to the public.\n- All things considered, having a PE may well make you stand out from those who do not. Obtaining your PE will give you a feeling of real accomplishment.\nWhat is the process to become a PE?\nThe four general requirements for becoming a PE are:\n- Graduation from an accredited engineering curriculum\n- Successful completion of the Fundamentals of Engineering exam (FE)\n- Four years of engineering experience\n- Successful completion of the Principles and Practice of Engineering exam (PE)\nWhat is the exam format?\nThe PE Chemical exam became a computer-based format (CBT) exam in January 2018. The new computer-based PE Chemical exam allows year-round testing at approved Pearson VUE test centers. The only reference material allowed in the new CBT format is the online PE Chemical Reference Handbook. Please see more details at https://ncees.org/engineering/pe/chemical/.\nChemical Reference Handbook and NCEES Access\nThe PE Chemical Reference Handbook is available for download.

82	In what ways do Hindu Namkaran and Catholic baptism ceremonies both incorporate community participation and family involvement in welcoming the child?	Both ceremonies emphasize community and family involvement. In Namkaran, family members gather together, relatives place honey and curd on the child's lips, women sing songs, and guests shower the baby with blessings and gifts. In Catholic baptism, the Christian community welcomes the child 'with great joy,' family members can participate in readings, godparents are actively involved, and the whole parish community is present to welcome the new member into the faith family.	"['Namkaran Puja is of utmost importance amongst Hindus. It is one of the first religious Puja that everyone participates as a child. The word Naam means Name, and Karan means to make or to effect; hence, the word Namkaran means to decide and effect the name of a new born child. The ceremony is presided by a priest in which all the family members get together for a joyous celebration to welcome a new member in the house.\nImportance and Significance of Namkaran Puja\nNamkaran is the naming ceremony performed for every Hind child. It is a religious practice of initiating a child into a religion and at the same time reminding the parents of the newborn child their duties and responsibilities. Namkaran Puja is a ritual of providing Samskaaras to the child, which is considered to be of utmost importance in shaping the character and upbringing of a child. Vedas and Sutras provide certain guidelines which are to be followed while naming a child. For e.g, Grihya Sutra states that a child be named as per following\n- A name should be easy to pronounce and sound pleasant\n- Should indicate the sex of the child\n- Should signify the stature and social standing of the family.\n- Should contain specific number of vowels and letters as per the sex of the child.\nBenefits of Namkaran Puja\nNamkaran signifies bestowing Sanskaar on a child that is performed with a joyous celebration to welcome the baby. The Namkaran Puja includes naming the child as well. Its benefits are\n- Increases the auspiciousness of the name selected for the child.\n- Brings good luck, fortune and success in life.\n- Nullifies negative effects of the name.\n- To wipe off any sin generated from ovum and passed on to the fetus.\n- Increases the lifespan of the child.\nOccasions to Perform Namkaran Puja\nNamkaran Puja is performed upon the birth of a child in the family to bestow both Sanskaars and blessings of everyone upon him. The sanskaars are said to bestow both happiness and longevity to life.\nNamkaran Puja Vidhi (Procedure)\nNamkaran Puja can be carried out either at Temple or even at home in a small private ceremony that includes the presence of family members. The ceremony is carried out by a Pandit\n- Baby is given a bath and dressed in fresh new clothes and placed in either the father’s or a maternal uncle’s lap.\n- Other Namkaran Puja samagri like betel leaves, supari, turmeric, lentils and moongdaal are kept on a piece of red cloth over a wooden low-lying table.\n- The Puja begins with a Pandit chanting the mantras. He also draws out a child’s horoscope while praying to Lord Ganesh for his well-being and long and happy life.\n- The father or the maternal uncle then whispers the select name into the baby’s ears, while holding either a real or silver betel leaf, or Kusa grass to guide the whispers in the child’s ear.\n- There are certain guidelines followed while naming a child. For e.g. Rig Veda advocates naming a child which imbibes three components - the letters which are favourable as per nakshatra, the name of the deities of the month in which the child was born; and the name of the Ishtdevta of the family.\n- Once the name is announced to guests, the relatives place a few drops of honey and curd on childs lips while reciting the name. It is considered a good omen when the child licks his lips hearing his name. Women of the family also sing songs while gently swinging the cradle after naming the baby.\n- Sweets are distributed amongst the guest and they shower the baby with their blessing and gifts before the ceremony concludes.\nNamkaran Puja Shubh Muhurat\nThe naming ceremony is held on the 12th day after the birth of the baby as per the Muhurat suggested by a priest. In case the naming ceremony cannot be performed on the 12th day; it can be done on the 101st day, i.e. after three months or baby’s first birthday.', ""Baptism is the sacrament that all Christians share in common and the first of the seven sacraments that we share in as Catholics. “Baptism is the entrance to life in the Spirit, and the basis of the whole Christian way of life” (CCC,1213).\nInterested in finding out more about Baptism?\nWould your parish like to support those preparing for Baptism?\n- Infant Baptism - Parish Baptism preparation teams\n- Teens or adult Baptism - Forming an RCIA group in your parish\nEvery child is a blessing and to be celebrated. Each person who joins our faith community is a great blessing for the whole community, and we celebrate the parents decision to be a Christian family. At the start of your child’s Baptism ceremony, you will hear the priest say “The Christian Community welcomes you with great joy.” This welcome is at the heart of Baptism.\nWe hope that the following information on Baptism will help you to feel involved, supported and welcome as you take this step as a family.\n- What is the Sacrament of Baptism\nThe Celebration of Baptism - the order of service\nFinding my local parish - a link to map and parish search.\nIn the Sacraments we meet Jesus. Sacraments use familiar, everyday things, (like water, oil, bread, movement) to help us to recognise better the presence of Jesus. Each day we use words and signs to communicate with one another. God also communicates with us in the sacraments through words and signs. Baptism is a Sacrament. The signs used in Baptism are water, oil, white garment and light.\nWhen someone is baptised, that person is joyfully made a child of God the Father, a brother or sister of Christ, and a member of the people of God, the Church.\nThe Baptism ceremony is the start of our faith journey, and it emphasises this by having some physical movement in it. We normally start at the church door, walk to the top of the church together, later move to the Baptismal Font and then to the Altar. (Because the design of some churches does not make this movement easy, the ceremony may be conducted in one designated area, usually near the baptismal font.).\nHere is a short outline of the full Baptismal ceremony:\nThe priest, and any other parishioners like members of the parish Baptism team, greet the parents, godparents and friends who are waiting with the child, inside the door of the Church. The parents declare that they want Baptism for their child, they give the baby’s name and promise that they will bring the child up in the Catholic faith and be good and practising Catholics themselves. As a sign that we now place this child under Gods protection, the priest then signs the baby’s forehead with the sign of the cross and invites the parents and godparents to do the same.\nThose taking part in the ceremony now move to the front of the Church, sit down and prepare to hear Gods word in Scripture. Parents and God parents generally sit together at the front of the group, so they can easily step out of their seats later on when required.\nGod always has something to say to us in all circumstances. We are now invited to listen to the chosen readings from Scripture and the special prayers offered here, in order to hear and be nourished by Gods Word. The saints are also asked to help and guide us. (Ministers of the Word and/or family members may read the scriptures and prayers). While you may prefer your priest to choose the scripture – this link offers some choices of readings for your child’s Baptism.\nThe priest anoints the child on the chest with the Oil of Baptism, as a sign that he/she is being set aside for a special friendship with Jesus. (Please have the top buttons undone to make it easier to anoint the child).When an adult prepares for Baptism, they receive the Oil of Catechumens at the start of their preparation. Infants receive this blessed oil during the ceremony as a reminder that they are entering into a learning, loving friendship with Jesus.\nAfter the water is blessed, parents, godparents and all Christians present are asked to renew their Baptismal vows. These vows are a public statement of what we believe and commit to passing on. We don't say 'I do' just because someone asks us to - we say 'I do' when we mean it.\nThen the parents and godparents are invited to come around the Baptismal Font. This is the central point - the actual Baptism of your child. The priest pours blessed water on the child’s head, saying: “I baptise you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.”\nThe newly baptised child is now anointed on the forehead with the Oil of Chrism.\nGodparents assist in wrapping the child in a white Baptismal shawl, as a sign of the new life the child has received. The child’s baptismal candle is lit from the large Easter Candle. This is handed to the parents and godparents with the words: “Receive the light of Christ.” This candle may be lit on the anniversary of Baptism, for first Holy Communion, Confirmation celebrations etc.\nThe priest touches the child’s ears and mouth and prays that the child may soon hear God’s Word and praise God in prayer.\nIn the final part of the ceremony, the family is invited to bring the baby, who has joined the Christian family to the altar. The community gathered prays the great prayer of the Christian community, the Our Father, recognising that this child is now a member of our faith family.\nIn this action there is a pointing forward to Confirmation, the Mass and First Holy Communion. To share in the Mass is the privilege of the baptised. These Sacraments will complete the child’s entry into the Christian believing community.\nFinally, special blessings for the baby, the parents and for all present are said. Parents are reminded that they will be the first teachers of their child in the ways of faith.\nAfter the ceremony, the parish priest records the baptism in the Baptismal Register of the parish. This record includes the full names of the child, parents and godparents, the child’s date of birth, the date of the baptism and the name of the officiating priest or deacon. A Certificate of Baptism can then be issued by the parish as and when required, (for example, before your childs wedding)\nIf you would like your child to be baptised, you will need to make contact with your local parish and your priest. You can find details of your Limerick parish here.\nMany Irish parishes have a team of parishioners who offer information and support to parents who bring their child for Baptism. Preparation usually takes one of two forms:\n- Parents are invited to a once-off gathering in the parish where they are introduced to the meaning, ritual and symbols of Baptism, and where they are welcomed in a new way into the parish and its life.\n- Two team members visit a family in their home where they discuss the meaning, ritual and symbols of Baptism, and where the parents and child are welcomed in a new way into the parish and its life.\nIn the context of today’s parish, Parish Baptism teams are a powerful way of reaching out and making connections with parents/ families who request Baptism for their children.\nThe following are some basic details about what is involved in creating a parish Baptism team:\n- A Baptismal team normally has 6-10 members.\n- Training for new teams takes place over 3 nights or 1 day and is ideally suited to clusters of parishes.\n- Renewal and support for established baptism teams is available on request.\n- A parish baptism team is part of the overall ministry of the parish and therefore deserves the on-going support of the parish pastoral council and clergy.\nThe training course is built around the following themes: Present Experience of Baptism, History of Baptism, Challenges for today’s Parish, Symbols, How Baptismal Teams work – possibilities, Christian life as journey. Please see the 'upcoming events’ calendar for details of training courses this year.\nThe Pastoral Development team also sometimes visit Baptism teams in a parish to plan together an evening or a Saturday gathering. These gatherings serve as a refresher for the group, and help them to re-organise and re-new their energy for the year ahead.\nThe’ Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults’ (RCIA) is the process by which the Catholic Church welcomes new teen and adult members into the Christian Community. As an infant, parents choose and childhood catechesis follows. As a teenager or an adult, an inquirer is first welcomed and given the opportunity to learn and experiences our Catholic faith. In this time of welcome, they can then discern if this where God is calling them. The following information may answer some of your questions. However its worth remembering that each parish is unique and adapts to the needs of its community. So the best way to find out about becoming a Catholic is to come along and meet us this Sunday - you'll be very welcome!\nWhat is RCIA? The RCIA is a return to the way that the early Church initiated new members into the Christian Community. RCIA takes place in the participant’s local community, so they really experience what it is to become part of the faith community. RCIA happens in small groups (usually 4-10 people), who meet for between six months and a year. In these relaxed and welcoming groups participants discuss and pray together, study sacred scripture and doctrine, take time for spiritual reflection and engage in community service and involvement.\nSimply put, the RCIA is a process of conversion and spiritual growth for adults.\nIt is divided into four parts (listed below) and each period has a prayerful celebration to mark its end and the start of the next stage of the faith journey. There is not set duration for this journey as each person comes with different experiences and needs, but it usually concludes on Holy Saturday night at the Easter Vigil ceremony. There, at the parish Easter Vigil celebrations, adults receive all the Sacraments of Initiation together (Baptism, First Holy Communion and Confirmation), in the presence of the whole faith community.\nWho participates in the RCIA?\n- Non-Christians who are interested in becoming members of the Christian Community.\n- Those baptized in another Christian tradition who are interested in becoming full members of the Catholic Church.\n- Catholics who are baptised but who have not yet received the Sacrament of the Eucharist or Confirmation.\n- Parishioners committed to supporting inquirers on their faith journey.\nOutline of the RCIA Stages\nBecause RCIA is international; its terms/words can sound a little strange to our ears sometimes. The words hold thousands of years of history and meaning, so please don’t be put off by them. What is important is the process – one of welcome, learning, prayer and belonging.\nPart one: Period of Evangelization and Pre-catechumenate\nAn informal time for those who are curious about Catholicism but aren’t yet sure if they want to become Catholic. It’s a chance to meet some parishioners and ask questions/discuss faith.\nRite of Acceptance into the Order of Catechumens\nInquirers who wish to continue, now move onto the next stage, which is known as the Catechumenate (Study) Period. This short but lovely rite marks the transition between the Period of Inquiry into the Period of the Catechumenate. It takes place when the members of the local Church (parish) are gathered together to celebrate Mass.\nPart Two: Period of the Catechumenate\nThe Inquirers have now become known as Catechumens [preparing for baptism] or Candidates [already baptised]. Parishioners, Candidates and Catechumens will now spend time studying the Bible and the fundamental teachings of the Church. Meetings are held in the same small groups on a regular basis. The aim is for the Candidates and Catechumens to get a good sense of the Catholic faith through study, prayer and community involvement\nThe Rite of Election or Enrolment of Names\nWhen a Catechumen or Candidate is ready to proceed, it is a time for the whole Church to celebrate! Where possible, all Catechumens, Candidates and their Sponsors in the diocese come to meet their Bishop and be formally ratified as ‘ready to receive the Sacraments of initiation’. This short ceremony normally happens on the First Sunday of Lent at the local Cathedral, led by the local Bishop. The Catechumens - from now on known as the Elect - publicly acknowledge their desire to receive the Sacraments of Initiation and to be received into the Catholic Church.\nPart Three: Period of Purification and Enlightenment\nThis time is the time that the Christian community came to call Lent. Early Christians came to see that the preparation that the Catechumens were undertaking would be beneficial to us all. Those preparing for the sacraments enter into a time of increased reflection and prayer. The aim is to support and bless the Candidate as they prepare, and at the same time to identify and heal anything that might block them from the graces of Baptism and the love of God.\nThroughout the time of Lent, a number of Rites (short public prayers at Sunday Mass) and Presentations are offered to the Candidates and Catechumens. These also help the whole community to feel connected with their soon-to-be brothers and sisters.\nCelebration of the Sacraments of Initiation\nAt the Easter Vigil (Holy Saturday night), Candidates and Catechumens receive the Sacraments of Initiation and are now full members of the Catholic Church.\nPeriod of Post-Baptismal Catechesis or Mystagogy\nEarly Christians found that the time after Baptism was as important as before. There were so many questions to ask, they needed time to settle into this new life they had chosen. So the church put aside time for faith formation (catechesis) after Baptism, usually the length of the Easter Season. In this time the local parish community offers opportunities for development and growth of the person's faith - as well as that of the entire community, though study and prayer. The Pentecost celebration is a final ‘Alleluia’ to mark the end of the beginning of the new Christians life!\n‘I was never baptized as a child’\n‘My child is in First Communion class, can we be baptized together?’\n‘I am already Christian and want to become Catholic’\nSound familiar? …. Not sure of what to do next??\nEvery parish has a number of people who have expressed a wish to ‘become a Catholic’. While some are nervous as to how we might support such enquirers; we all want to joyfully encourage those God is calling to join us. The R.C.I.A. process is a simple, joyful way that is adaptable to your parishes realities. It draws on the Word of God, it links the new Christian into the Sunday liturgy and invites the whole community to pray and give thanks for those who prepare.\nA leaflet for parishioners who might want to know more about form a welcoming RCIA group is here\nInterested in learning more? Read on!\nWhat is the RCIA? The letters ‘RCIA’ stand for the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults. The RCIA process was introduced after the Second Vatican Council, Church leader advocated a return to community style initiation, with an emphasis on liturgy, as a more fitting form for the modern world.\nRCIA is a process which involves the faith community in journeying with a person who has asked to become a Catholic.\nIt takes place over a number of stages, and actively links our community prayer and the persons faith journey. At the Easter Vigil, the sacraments of initiation are received and the person becomes a full member of the Roman Catholic Church. The entire process takes several months, but participants are invited to proceed at a pace which suits them individually.\nWho is involved in the RCIA process?\n- The person who is inquiring about becoming a Catholic, or to receive some of the sacraments of initiation (Baptism, First Eucharist, Confirmation)\n- The parish R.C.I.A. team (3-4 people)\n- The whole parish community\nWhat material is covered in R.C.I.A.? (or ‘but do we need a theology degree to do this?’ !)\n- Suitable Catechesis: The Catechumentate is essentially training in Christian life. It contains instruction, but it is about learning for life not learning for a test! (I.e. formation not information!) There’s lots of training and material available for RCIA groups to use.\n- Liturgical life: All we do is supported and grounded in scripture and the lived liturgy of the faith community.\n- The Sharing of life experience: All of us are journeying – conversion is a life long process. Priests, parishioners, new comers and old times - we all have more to learn, and can best do that together.\nSo what do we do now? The following steps are necessary to establish an RCIA group in your parish:\n- A parish decision is made to establish an RCIA group. (Usually by the parish’s priests & pastoral council)\n- The Parish R.C.I.A. group is established to learn about R.C.I.A. and trained to welcome enquirers (the Pastoral Centre will help with this)\n- Parish agrees upon a procedure for enquirers (so when a person calls, they get in direct contact with the RCIA team!)\nSupport for parish RCIA groups: The parish RCIA team works on behalf of the whole parish, and thus is supported by the parishes priests and its pastoral council. A member of the parish group is a contact person for the diocesan RCIA committee, so that resources and support are always available. Parish groups from across diocese meet annually around Pentecost to review and celebrate their work.""]"	['<urn:uuid:86205aaf-1d23-4667-8eb3-94b3ea348b22>', '<urn:uuid:f9171bdc-a356-4216-a873-230c4913544d>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	21	72	3674
83	What causes swelling in gallbladder and how do doctors check for it?	Gallbladder swelling can be caused by gallstones blocking the cystic duct, or in rare cases without stones (acalculous cholecystitis) due to complications from severe illnesses like HIV or diabetes. Doctors typically diagnose this through ultrasound, which can show gallstones, thickened gallbladder walls, extra fluid, and other signs. They may also use CT scans or a nuclear scanning test called HIDA scan, though ultrasound is generally the most common and best diagnostic test.	"['Acalculous cholecystitis is an inflammatory health condition of the gallbladder in which there is no evidence of gallstones on the routine testing.\nIt commonly occurs in critically ill patients and who are on artificial ventilation or suffering from sepsis. Other risk factors include diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus infection, total parenteral nutrition, prolonged fasting, or being an ICU patient. It is usually a complication of other health conditions.\nIt has a higher risk of perforation and gangrene when compared to calculus cholecystitis. The overall incidence of acalculous cholecystitis is 5% in all cases of cholecystitis.\nThe acalculous cholecystitis can present with similar symptoms and signs as that of calculus cholecystitis. Common symptoms manifesting in this condition are:\n- Nausea and/or vomiting\n- Pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen that usually appears after meals.\n- Food intolerance\n- Abnormal bowel movements and abdominal distension.\nThe differential diagnoses that need to be considered while diagnosing acalculous cholecystitis are:\n- Calculus cholecystitis\n- Ascending cholangitis\n- Acute pancreatitis\n- Gastric issues like a stomach ulcers\n- Liver conditions like hepatic abscesses and hepatitis\n- Kidney diseases like pyelonephritis.\nHow to diagnose?\nIn acalculous cholecystitis, biochemical lab tests don’t provide comprehensive and conclusive clues towards establishing a diagnosis. Generally, radiological tests like ultrasound and CT scan are used to diagnose acalculous cholecystitis, and sometimes nuclear imaging tests like HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid, also called cholescintigraphy) scan can also be used.\nIt is the most common and best diagnostic test for acalculous cholecystitis. On ultrasound, an enlarged and edematous gallbladder is seen. There is also thickening of the wall of the gallbladder, presence of fluid in the bile duct, and mucosal sloughing.\nComputer tomography is usually indicated when there is a need to narrow down diagnosis from a broad list of differential diagnoses or no clear findings on ultrasound. Usually, similar findings are observed on a CT scan. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the CT scan are similar to the ultrasound.\nThis test has no significant advantage over other diagnostic modalities. The specificity and sensitivity of this test are generally lower than ultrasonography and CT scan.\nCommon surgical and nonsurgical treatment options for acalculous cholecystitis are as follow:\n- Percutaneous Cholecystostomy: It is the treatment of choice. It is a minimally invasive procedure. During this procedure, a catheter is placed in the gallbladder lumen and it is used for drainage. This treatment option is usually used in patients who are unstable and unfit for general anesthesia that is required for cholecystectomy. It can also be used as an adjunct therapy with cholecystectomy.\n- Cholecystectomy: This is a surgical treatment option. In this surgery, the whole gallbladder is removed by doing open or laparoscopic surgery. It is the definitive treatment and its need is increased if there is an indication of gangrene or perforation of the gallbladder.\n- Antibiotics: Antibiotics are indicated in patients who have a superimposed infection. Commonly, broad-spectrum antibiotics are used.\nInternet book of critical care, Acalculous cholecystitis, Accessed April 30, 2021, https://emcrit.org/ibcc/acalculous-cholecystitis/\nSciencedirect, Acalculous cholecystitis, Accessed April 30, 2021, https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acalculous-cholecystitis\nUptodate, Acalculous cholecystitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management, Accessed April 30, 2021, https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management', ""What is cholecystitis?\nCholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, a small organ near the liver that plays a part in digesting food. Normally, fluid called bile passes out of the gallbladder on its way to the small intestine. If the flow of bile is blocked, it builds up inside the gallbladder, causing swelling, pain, and possible infection.\nWhat causes cholecystitis?\nA gallstone stuck in the cystic duct, a tube that carries bile from the gallbladder, is most often the cause of sudden (acute) cholecystitis. The gallstone blocks fluid from passing out of the gallbladder. This results in an irritated and swollen gallbladder. Infection or trauma, such as an injury from a car accident, can also cause cholecystitis.\nAcute acalculous cholecystitis, though rare, is most often seen in critically ill people in hospital intensive care units. In these cases, there are no gallstones. Complications from another severe illness, such as HIV or diabetes, cause the swelling.\nLong-term (chronic) cholecystitis is another form of cholecystitis. It occurs when the gallbladder remains swollen over time, causing the walls of the gallbladder to become thick and hard.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nThe most common symptom of cholecystitis is pain in your upper right abdomen that can sometimes move around to your back or right shoulder blade. Other symptoms include:\n- Nausea or vomiting.\n- Tenderness in the right abdomen.\n- Pain that gets worse during a deep breath.\n- Pain for more than 6 hours, particularly after meals.\nOlder people may not have fever or pain. Their only symptom may be a tender area in the abdomen.\nHow is cholecystitis diagnosed?\nDiagnosing cholecystitis starts when you describe your symptoms to your doctor. Next is a physical exam. Your doctor will carefully feel your right upper abdomen to look for tenderness. You may have blood drawn and an ultrasound, a test that uses sound waves to create a picture of your gallbladder. Ultrasound may show gallstones, thickening of the gallbladder wall, extra fluid, and other signs of cholecystitis. This test also allows doctors to check the size and shape of your gallbladder.\nYou could also have a gallbladder scan, a nuclear scanning test that checks how well your gallbladder is working. It can also help find blockage in the tubes (bile ducts) that lead from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine (duodenum).\nHow is it treated?\nTreatment for cholecystitis will depend on your symptoms and your general health. People who have gallstones but don't have any symptoms may need no treatment. For mild cases, treatment includes bowel rest, fluids and antibiotics given through a vein, and pain medicine.\nThe main treatment for acute cholecystitis is surgery to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy). Often this surgery can be done through small incisions in the abdomen (laparoscopic cholecystectomy), but sometimes it requires a more extensive operation. Your doctor may try to reduce swelling and irritation in the gallbladder before removing it. Sometimes acute cholecystitis is caused by one or more gallstones getting stuck in the main tube leading to the intestine, called the common bile duct. Treatment may involve an endoscopic procedure (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or ERCP) to remove the stones in the common bile duct before the gallbladder is removed.\nIn rare cases of chronic cholecystitis, you may also receive medicine that dissolves gallstones over a period of time.\nOther Places To Get Help\n|American Gastroenterological Association|\n|4930 Del Ray Avenue|\n|Bethesda, MD 20814|\nThe American Gastroenterological Association is a society of doctors who specialize in the digestive system (gastroenterologists).

84	How do Middle Eastern dining customs relate to emotions?	In the Middle East, dining customs are closely tied to emotional expression and social bonds. While emotions like disgust are universally expressed through facial behaviors (such as a wrinkled nose and protruded lower lip), specific cultural display rules govern appropriate behavior during meals. For instance, in Middle Eastern cultures, it's mandatory to eat only with the right hand, as the left hand is considered unclean. This rule is particularly important during communal dining, where multiple people share food, and it extends to other social interactions like handshakes and gift-giving. These customs reflect how cultures develop specific rules for expressing respect and maintaining social harmony through behavior.	"['The Many Facets of Emotion\nWe experience emotions such as happiness, fear, sadness, pride, and anger when we consider our situation (either real or imagined) to be relevant to our active personal goals (Scherer, Schorr, & Johnstone, 2001). Some goals that make a situation meaning-ful are of long-term concern, such as wanting to be liked. Other goals may be more fleeting, such as hoping to get the last slice of cake, or rooting for the underdog in a football match.\nWhatever the goal may be, once we’ve evaluated a situation as being personally rele-vant, three types of changes are evident that, taken together, characterize emotion. These changes affect our behavior (how we act), our subjective experience (how we feel), and our physiology (how various systems in the body are functioning) (Mauss, Levenson, McCarter, Wilhelm, & Gross, 2005). We can identify similar changes in the states we call moods, but psychologists distinguish emotions from moods in several ways. For one, emotions typically have a clear object or target (e.g., we are happy about something, or mad at someone); moods do not. Emotions are also usually briefer than moods, lasting seconds or minutes rather than hours or days.\nSome of our bodily responses to emotion are quite general, such as a broad pattern of approaching with interest in response to emotionally positive stimuli, or a general withdrawal in response to emotionally negative stimuli. Perhaps the most prominent behaviors associated with emotion, however, are our facial behaviors—our smiles, frowns, laughs, gapes, grimaces, and snarls.\nCharles Darwin hypothesized that our facial expressions of emotion are actually vestiges of our ancestors’ basic adaptive patterns (1872b). He argued, for example, that our “anger” face, often expressed by lowered brows, widened eyes, and open mouth with exposed teeth, reflects the facial movements our ancestors would have made when biting an opponent. Similarly, our “disgust” face, often manifested as a wrinkled nose and protruded lower lip and tongue, reflects the way our ancestors responded to foul odors or spit out foods. (For elaborations, see Ekman, 1980, 1984; Izard, 1977; Tomkins, 1963.)\nIn support of this position, Darwin noted that our facial expressions resemble many of the displays made by monkeys and apes. Darwin also believed that the expressions would be identical among humans worldwide, even “those who have associated but little with Europeans”. This point, too, can be confirmed—for example, in observations of children born blind, who nonetheless express emotions using the typical, recog-nizable set of facial expressions despite the fact that they could not have learned these expressions through imitation (see, for example, Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1970; Galati, Scherer, & Ricci-Bitti, 1997; Goodenough, 1932).\nA different test of this universality claim involves comparisons between cultures (Russell, 1994; Tracy & Robins, 2008), but only a tiny number of studies have used the participants most crucial for this test: members of relatively isolated non-Western cul-tures (Ekman, 1973; Ekman & Oster, 1979; Fridlund, Ekman, & Oster, 1983; Izard, 1971). Why is this group crucial? If research participants, no matter where they live, have been exposed to Western movies or television, their responses might indicate only the impact of these media and thus provide no proof of the universality claim. Therefore, we need participants who have not seen reruns of Western soap operas, or Hollywood movies, or a slew of Western advertising.\nIn one of the few studies of this critical group, American actors were photographed showing expressions that conveyed emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. These photographs were then shown to members of various modern literate cultures (Swedes, Japanese, Kenyans) and to members of an isolated nonliterate New Guinea tribe. All participants who saw the photos were asked to\npick the emotion label that\nmatched each photograph. In other cases, the procedure was reversed. For example, the New Guinea tribesmen were photographed portraying the facial expressions that they considered appropriate to various situations, such as happiness at the return of a friend, grief at the death of a child, and anger at the start of a fight (Figure 12.29). American college students then looked at the photographs and judged which situation the tribesmen in each photo had been asked to convey (Ekman & Friesen, 1975).\nIn these studies, all the participants, including those in relatively isolated cultures, did reasonably well. They were able to supply the appropriate emotion label for the pho-tographs, or to describe a situation that might have elicited the expression shown in the photograph. But they were more successful at recognizing some expressions than at recognizing others. We highlighted the biological roots of smiling, and, in fact, these were, in this study, generally matched with “happy” terms and situations, with remarkable levels of consistency (Ekman, 1994; Izard, 1994; see also Russell, 1994). Other emotions, such as disgust, were less well recognized, but still identified at levels well above chance, suggesting that the meaning of emotional expressions tran-scends cultural and geographic boundaries.\nLet us note, though, that even though the perception of emotions may be similar in all cultures, the display of emotions is surely not. A widely cited example comes from research in which American and Japanese participants were presented with harrowing surgical films (Figure 12.30). Participants first watched the films privately (i.e., with no one in the room with them), but their facial expressions were recorded by a hidden camera. The facial reactions of Americans and Japanese were virtually identical. But when the participants then watched one of the films again while being interviewed by an experimenter, the results were quite different. In this context, the Japanese showed more positive emotion than the Americans showed (Ekman, 1972; Friesen, 1972). Thus, when in public, participants’ facial expressions were governed by the display rules set by their culture—deeply ingrained conventions, often obeyed without awareness, that govern the facial expressions considered appropriate in particular contexts (Ekman &Friesen, 1969; Ekman, Friesen, & O’Sullivan, 1988).\nOf course, display rules are not limited to a person’s reactions to a gruesome film. Other studies have extended the analysis of display rules in contexts as diverse as par- ticipating in sports (H. S. Friedman & Miller-Herringer, 1991) and receiving presents one does not like (P. M. Cole, 1985). Research has also explored the way in which indi- viduals differ in their knowledge of display rules (Matsumoto, Yoo, & Nakagawa, 2008). These differences include variation not only from one person to the next, but also between the genders. For example, women in Western cultures are more likely to express their emotions than men are, particularly emotions such as sadness (Brody & Hall, 2000; Kring & Gordon, 1998).\nAlong with changes in our behavior, emotion also involves changes in how we feel. Indeed, emotional experience has long been the essence of poetry, literature, and other forms of artistic expression that are all replete with expressions of undying love, mortal hatred, and unquenchable sadness. How can we study these fleeting and complex feelings hidden inside the mind (Barrett, Mesquita, Ochsner, & Gross, 2007)? Here, as elsewhere, scientists begin by seeking a proper classification scheme, and one proposal has focused on defining specific categories of emotions (see, for example, R. S. Lazarus, 1991). One problem with this approach, though, lies in defining exactly what the categories are. Common language gives few clues. There are over 550 emotion words in English (Averill, 1975), and many more in other languages that cannot be translated readily into English. However, as Phillip Shaver and his colleagues have shown, people typically use emotion words in ways that reveal a relatively small num- ber of “clusters,” which are defined by words with similar meanings (Shaver, Schwartz, Kirson, & O’Connor, 1987). As in Figure 12.31, one cluster involves words associated with love, another involves words associated with joy, and other clusters describe anger, sadness, and fear. An alternative approach describes emotions in terms of dimensions rather than categories: “more this” or “less that” rather than “this type” versus “that type.”There are various ways in which we might define these dimensions, but one relies simply on how pleasant or unpleasant the emotion feels, and then how activated the person feels when in the midst of the emotion (Barrett, 1998; Larsen & Diener, 1992; Russell, 1980, 1983); these two axes can be used to create a circle within which all the various inter- mixtures of the dimensions can be described, as in Figure 12.32.\nEither of these categorization schemes can help us figure out how emotions relate to one another—which are similar, which are sharply distinct. But neither scheme really tells us what the emotions really feel like, and so neither scheme answers questions about individual or cul- tural differences in emotional experience. Does your happiness feel the same as mine? When someone in Paris feels triste, is that person’s feeling the same as the feeling of someone in London who feels sad, or someone in Germany who feels traurig?\nFor that matter, how should we think about cultures that have markedly different terms for describing their emotions? The people who live on the Pacific Island of Ifalik lack a word for “surprise,” and the Tahitians lack a word for “sadness.” Likewise, other cultures have words that describe common emotions for which we have no special\nterms. The Ifaluk sometimes feel an emotion they call fago, which involves a complex mixture of compassion, love, and sadness experi-enced in relationships in which one person is dependent on the other (Lutz, 1986, 1988). And the Japanese report a common emotion called amae, which is a desire to be dependent and cared for (Doi, 1973; Morsbach & Tyler, 1986). The German language reserves the word Schadenfreude for the special pleasure derived from another’s misfortune. Do people in these cultures experience emotions that we do not (Figure 12.33)? Or are emotional experiences common across cultures, despite the variations in cultures’ labels for emotional expe-riences? On these difficult questions, the jury is still out.\nWhen we respond emotionally, it is often a whole body affair, and the bodily reactions associated with different emotions certainly feel different from one another (Levenson, 1994). That is, not only do the emotions differ in how they feel inside our “head,” but they also seem to differ in how they feel in the rest of the body. The sick stomach and wrinkled nose of disgust, for example, feel decidedly different from the squared shoul-ders and puffed chest of pride. And anger’s hot head and coiled muscles seem opposite fear’s cold feet and faint heart.\nFrom a common-sense perspective, it seems that emotions arise when we encounter a significant stimulus, and this encounter leads to bodily changes that dif-fer by emotion (Figure 12.34A). Interestingly, this sequence of events was turned on its head by one of the first emotion theories in the field, namely, William James’s the-ory that different emotions provoke different patterns of physiological response (James, 1884). According to the James-Lange theory of emotion (Carl Lange was a European contemporary of James’s who offered a similar account), the reason emo-tions feel different from one another subjectively is that we sense the different phys-iological patterns produced by each emotion. Specifically, this view holds that emotion begins when we perceive a situation of an appropriate sort—we see the bear or hear the insult. But our perception of these events is, as James put it, “purely cog-nitive in form, pale, colorless, destitute of emotional warmth”. What turns this perception into genuine emotion is our awareness of the bodily changes produced by the arousing stimuli. These changes might consist of skeletal movements (running) or visceral reactions (pounding heartbeat), but only when we detect the biological changes do we move from cold appraisal to emotional feeling, from mere assessment to genuine affect (Figure 12.34B). Moreover, the claim is that the specific character of the biological changes is crucial—so that we feel fear because we are experiencing the pattern of bodily changes associated with fear; we feel hap-piness because of its pattern of changes in the body, and so on.\nSubsequent theories, however, made quite different predictions about the degree of physiological patterning we should expect in emotion. For example, Walter Cannon, whom we met earlier as a pioneer in the study of the “fight or flight” response, believed that our physiological responses are quite general (W. B. Cannon, 1927). According to the Cannon-Bard theory of emotion (Philip Bard was a contem-porary of Cannon’s who espoused a similar view), it’s not easy to distinguish the bodily changes associated with different emotions, so that the bodily changes associated with anger are actually rather similar to the changes associated with happy excitement (Figure 12.34C).\nCannon’s view gained support from early studies in which participants received injections of epinephrine, which triggered broad sympathetic activation with all its consequences—nervousness, palpitations, flushing, tremors, and sweaty palms. These biological effects are similar to those that accompany fear and rage, and so, according to the James-Lange theory, people detecting these effects in their bodies should experience these emotions. But that was not the case. Some of the participants who received the injections simply reported the physical symptoms. Others said they felt “as if ” they were angry or afraid, a kind of “cold emotion,” not the real thing (Landis & Hunt, 1932; Marañon, 1924). Apparently, the visceral reactions induced by the stimulant were by themselves not sufficient to produce emotional experience.\nEven so, there is an obvious challenge to the Cannon-Bard theory. If different emo-tions produce comparable physiological responses, then why do we have the subjective impression that our bodies are doing quite different things in different emotional states? This question was addressed by the Schachter-Singer theory of emotion (Figure 12.34D). According to this theory, behavior and physiology are (as James proposed) cru-cial for emotional experience. James was wrong, though, in claiming that the mere per-ception of these bodily changes is sufficient to produce emotional experience. That is because, in addition, emotion depends on a person’s judgments about why her body and physiology have changed (Schachter & Singer, 1962).\nIn a classic study supporting this theory, participants were injected with a drug that they believed was a vitamin supplement but really was the stimulant epinephrine. After the drug was administered, participants sat in the waiting room for what they thought was to be a test of their vision. In the waiting room with them was a confederate of the experimenter (someone who appeared to be another research participant but was actu-ally part of the research team). In one condition the confederate acted irritable, made angry remarks, and eventually stormed out of the room. In another condition he acted exuberant, throwing paper planes out the window and playing basketball with balled-up paper. Of course, his behavior was all part of the experiment; the vision test that the participants were expecting never took place (Schachter & Singer, 1962). Participants exposed to the euphoric confederate reported feeling happy, and, to a lesser degree, par-ticipants exposed to the angry confederate reported that they felt angry. Although this study has come under criticism (G. D. Marshall & Zimbardo, 1979; Mezzacappa, Katkin, & Palmer, 1999; Reisenzein, 1983), it remains influential because it is a reminder that bodily arousal only partially determines the emotion that is experienced.\nOver the past 50 years, researchers have tried to clarify how the body responds dur-ing emotional experiences. One of the most interesting conclusions from this research is that our perceptions of bodily differences among the emotions may in some cases be illusions, compelling experiences that are not well grounded in reality (Cacioppo, Berntson, & Klein, 1992). It seems, therefore, that the various emotions are surprisingly similar if we examine the body’s response “from the neck down.”\nEven so, the emotions are distinguishable biologically—in the pattern of brainactivation associated with each emotion. Evidence on this point comes from studiesin the field of affective neuroscience (R . J. Davidson & Sutton, 1995; Panksepp, 1991, 1998), whose proponents argue that emotions arise not in one, but in multiple neu-ral circuits. Some brain regions are activated in virtually all emotions (Murphy, Nimmo-Smith, & Lawrence, 2003; Phan, Wager, Taylor, & Liberzon, 2002)—for example, the medial prefrontal cortex. One likely possibility is that this section of the brain plays a general role in attention and meaning analysis related to emotion. Other brain regions, however, seem to be related to specific emotions. For example, fear is often associated with activation of the amygdala, and sadness is often associ-ated with activation of the cingulate cortex just below the corpus callosum (although activation in these brain regions is not specific to these emotions; see Barrett & Wager, 2006). Many researchers are convinced that brain data like these will eventu-ally allow us to determine the extent to which different emotions have different phys-iological profiles.', ""Body language of the world: Body signs to avoid in travel...\nBody language of the world: A traveller's guide to avoiding faux pas\nSarah Bennett & Lee Slater\nAugust 10, 201110:21AM\nIn the Middle East always eat with your right hand. Eating with your left is considered unclean. Picture: Flickr user hiyori13\nIn Japan bowing is a sign of respect. Picture: Flickr user alf melin\nEVERY country has its cultural quirks. To avoid being the subject of tut tuts and disapproving looks while you're travelling, we take you through the top taboos from Japan to the Middle East.\nThe most common greeting in Japan is the bow; the timing, posture and movement of which should reflect sincerity, respect and graciousness. A beautiful bow is often compared to a ripe rice stalk swaying in the wind: the more mature the person, the deeper the head is lowered. An improper bow hints at a lack of education and maturity. As a foreign visitor you are not expected to emulate this ritual faithfully - a gentle nod will do. -Lonely Planet Japanese Phrasebook\nPersonal space boundaries vary from country to country, but in Latin America they are set closer than in Anglo-Saxon countries. People stand closer when talking to one another, and casual touching of the arm or shoulder during conversation is not unusual. Good friends will typically greet each other with an abrazo (hug) or beso (kiss), and it’s quite normal to see people of the same sex walking down the street arm in arm.\n-Lonely Planet Latin American Spanish Phrasebook\nIn Mexico, when paying for something, place your cash or credit card directly into the hand of the person you’re dealing with. This applies in cafes and restaurants, as well as hotels and shops. Leaving payment on the counter can be interpreted as a sign that you don’t respect the person enough to have contact with them. -Lonely Planet Mexican Spanish Phrasebook\nThe traditional greeting of New Zealand Maori is the simultaneous pressing of noses and forehead, known as the hongi. The word directly translates as smell or sniff, but is more evocatively described as an exchange of ha, the breath of life. Such greetings are commonplace on marae, the open space in front of a Maori meetinghouse where visitors are welcomed, nowadays with a handshake at the same time as the hongi. -Hirini Moko Mead, Tikanga Maori (Huia, 2003) & Lonely Planet South Pacific Phrasebook\nThe hongi is a traditional New Zealand Maori greeting. Picture: Lonely Planet\nWhen ‘no’ gets mistaken for ‘yes’ there can be all sorts of trouble, but you can always rely on a shake of the head or a nod, can’t you? Not in Bulgaria, where the nod means no and the shake means yes. To complicate matters further, polite Bulgarians will often try to compensate by reversing their normal habit. For absolute verification, familiarise yourself with the words da (yes) and ne (no). -Lonely Planet Bulgarian Phrasebook\nBefore you whip the big thumbs up out of your pocket to convey that ‘all is well’ or ‘I’d like to hitch a ride’, be warned that you may be about to make a boo-boo. In some parts of the Middle East you may as well be flipping the bird, and the gesture has a similarly negative meaning in Nigeria and parts of South America. In Germany, you will be indicating the numeral one, which will be fine unless you really want to order two.\nMeanwhile, eating with your hand is acceptable in the Middle East, as long as it’s the right one! The left hand is considered unclean. Practicing this custom is particularly important at communal dinners, where many hands may come into contact with shared food, but it’s also important when shaking hands or giving and receiving gifts. -Roger Axtel, Gestures: The do’s and taboos of body language around the world\nJust don't raise your thumb in the Middle East. Picture: Lonely Planet\nAs you would expect in a country that came up with the word etiquette, it is easy for foreigners to commit faux pas in France. At the dining table the odds increase dramatically. To avoid offence, keep your hands on the table, not in your lap. Break up your bread roll into nibbles, rather than shoving the whole thing in your gob, but beyond that try to avoid eating anything with your fingers. Peel fruit with a knife and eat it with a fork; avoid man-handling sandwiches if you can. -Lonely Planet French Phrasebook\nIn India - as in much of Asia - it is the feet that are considered unclean. Do your utmost to avoid touching any part of someone else’s body with your foot or shoes, and if you do so, apologise straight away. Pointing the soles of your feet at someone is also offensive, so don’t prop your feet on chairs or tables while sitting, and take care how you arrange yourself when sitting on the floor. -Lonely Planet Hindi, Urdu & Bengali Phrasebook\nThe ultimate beau geste (gracious gesture) is one that is used in every country on earth. Although in some cultures in certain circumstances it can have negative connotations, it is seldom misunderstood and can be used in many situations. It conveys an array of positive emotions, and as such is the great bridge builder between peoples of the world. It involves only the eyes and the mouth, and so requires minimal effort. It is particularly useful in sticky situations. It is so powerful it is thought to release endorphins into the body that generate a feeling of euphoria. It is, of course, the smile.""]"	['<urn:uuid:fe48ec8b-45a6-4a23-b664-2ef512a462e1>', '<urn:uuid:43448c08-edca-41cd-af2f-7d6b11e809df>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	9	106	3712

People still remember them — so they’re back this year.\n<iframe width=”470” height=”264” src=”//www.youtube.com/embed/747EOF7Va0Q” frameborder=”0” allowfullscreen></iframe>\nThe high-altitude Australians are just one of the many attractions — with a range that encompasses music, visual art, food, film, literary arts, kids’ activities, workshops and more — that will fill Salt Lake City’s Library Square and Washington Square, Thursday through next Sunday.\nIn terms of sheer numbers and real estate, visual artists are the centerpiece of the Utah Arts Festival.\nOut of 500 applicants, the festival’s visual-arts jury has selected 163 artists to display and sell their works in the Artists Marketplace, said marketplace coordinator Matt Jacobsen.\n<iframe src=”//player.vimeo.com/video/88944871” width=”470” height=”264” frameborder=”0” webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href=”http://vimeo.com/88944871”>Utah Arts Festival - NEA Reel</a> from <a href=”http://vimeo.com/utahartsfest”>Utah Arts Festival</a> on <a href=”https://vimeo.com”>Vimeo</a>.</p>\n“It’s a huge honor to be part of such a long-running, prestigious event,” said Nikki Root, a glass artist from Providence, in Utah’s Cache Valley, who is showing her work for the first time at the Utah Arts Festival.\nRoot, a stained-glass artist for 20 years, found her passion three years ago when she was cleaning a Depression glass bowl she got from her mother.\nAs Root tells it, she held the glass up to the light, “and I said, ‘It’s a shame I can’t enjoy it.’ The light came on, and I started cutting. … I told my husband, ‘I’m a freaking genius.’ ”\nSince then, Root has been incorporating found glass objects into her windowlike frames.\n“My art usually focuses on something that’s ignored, and that’s the bottom,” Root said.\nFor Serg Wiaderny, a Polish-born abstract photographer who makes his home in Draper, inspiration came after a ski trip to Snowbird with his daughter.\n“I was looking for a long time at a rock,” Wiaderny said, noting that he had long been fascinated with nature. On the drive back down the canyon, he said, “I tell my daughter, ‘I’m going to be a photographer.’ ”\nMuch research at the Draper library followed, along with experimentation on what became his signature style: macro-photography, extreme close-ups, of paint floating on water.\n“I drop the paint or ink, any colorful substance, into the water,” he said. “I let it spread. I drain it, too. Let it separate. Sometimes the paint will flow itself. Sometimes it needs a little bit of time.”\nThe results are other-worldly abstracts that some people mistake for paintings, not photographs, he said.\nThis year is Wiaderny’s first time at UAF. “It’s a great exposure — I know thousands of people are going up there, and hopefully they’ll enjoy my work,” he said.\nIt’s also the first time for California artist Sondra Wampler, who makes digital collages that combine the natural and the human-made in interesting ways.\nWampler said her current collages were inspired by the idea that “if we left the Earth alone, nature would reclaim it.”\nSo her works feature notable landmarks, like New York’s Flatiron Building or the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, looking overgrown with vegetation and populated by animals.\n“Some people look at it and say it’s post-apocalyptic. It is, but it’s peaceful,” Wampler said.\nSalt Lake City painter Karen Horne has been attending the Utah Arts Festival for years. She’s also been painting it — along with other cityscapes that capture Salt Lake City’s vibrant cultural scene.\n“I have painted landscapes, but I’m much more attracted to people in the landscape, or a more urban view,” said Horne, whose works are featured in the festival’s main gallery, on the fourth floor of the City Library.\n“I’m really attracted to color, and an urban landscape offers more chances for a crazy range of colors,” she added.\nHorne may be best known for her paintings of the Capitol Theatre — she’s done a couple dozen of them, from many angles and in all seasons. She’s recently added landmarks such as the Peery Hotel, the Tower Theatre and the Rose Wagner Performing Arts Center to her repertoire.\nHorne will be teaching a workshop, “Creating Color Worlds,” Saturday and Sunday at 1 p.m. in the library’s Special Collections room. (There’s a $35 fee, for materials, and online pre-registration is required at uaf.org/workshops.) It’s one of a series of visual-arts workshops UAF has scheduled.\nAn opening reception for Horne’s exhibit is set for Thursday from 6 to 7:30 p.m. For those who can’t wait for the festival to start, Horne will take part in an event today during the library’s regular hours, 1 to 5 p.m.\nBefore Robert Paterson starts rehearsing the chamber-music work he’s been commissioned for writing for this year’s Utah Arts Festival, he has to go to find a kitchen sink.\n“I may take some mallets with me to the hardware store,” he said, chuckling at the plight of a poor store employee who may see him testing housewares for their tonal quality.\nThe New York-based Paterson, who won the festival’s Chamber Ensemble Commission, has a habit for playful musical themes. He’s written an operatic soliloquy about a sexbot, a suite for Foghorn Leghorn, and a work setting music to quotes by New York Mets legend Mike Piazza.\nFor his UAF commission, Paterson hit upon the idea of writing a work inspired by Hell’s Kitchen, the famously rough-and-tumble neighborhood near his New York home.\nTaking the name a bit more literally, he said he thought, “What would it be like to have a kitchen in hell?”\nThus was born his work “Hell’s Kitchen,” which not only creates musical themes for cooking techniques — but also uses kitchen implements as instruments. (The work debuts Saturday at 4 p.m. in the City Library auditorium.)\n“I’ve got two blenders, a coffee grinder, pots and pans,” he said. “Many of them have really beautiful sounds.”\nAnd, in the finale, Paterson literally is putting in the kitchen sink.\n“My primary goal is to connect with people who are around me now,” he said of his light approach to classical music. “I hope my music survives after I’m gone. But if I don’t connect with people now, there’s no way it will last later.”\n<iframe width=”470” height=”264” src=”//www.youtube.com/embed/b_TfuhcKWII” frameborder=”0” allowfullscreen></iframe>\nThe Intermountain Acoustic Music Association is incorporating its annual folk-music festival within the Utah Arts Festival.\n“I asked them, ‘Why don’t you put your festival in our festival?’ ” Sewell said.\nOn Friday and Saturday, IAMA will run its songwriter academy, taught by musicians Kate MacLeod and John McCutcheon. Saturday at noon, on the Big Mouth Stage, 10 singer-songwriters will compete in the Susanne Millsaps Singer Songwriter Showcase, each performing two songs before a panel of judges.\nThe winner of the showcase will perform at 8:30 p.m. Saturday on the Festival Stage — opening for McCutcheon, who plays at 9 p.m., and bluegrass/jam band Mountain Heart at 9:50 p.m.\nThe music lineup for the Utah Arts Festival is loaded with national headliners, in styles that vary from cowboy duets to African beats.\nThursday is a blues double bill at the Amphitheater Stage, with old-school blues singer Cee Cee James at 8:30 p.m. and Serbian blues guitarist Ana Popovic at 9:55 p.m.\n<iframe width=”470” height=”264” src=”//www.youtube.com/embed/p89HhGr3-BI” frameborder=”0” allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe width=”470” height=”264” src=”//www.youtube.com/embed/cKEQUwkcNBk” frameborder=”0” allowfullscreen></iframe>\nFriday’s lineup includes Blair Crimmins & The Hookers, a Dixieland/ragtime jazz revival band (Amphitheater Stage, 8:30 p.m.); African singer Angelique Kidjo (Festival Stage, 9:45 p.m.); and Chris Robinson Brotherhood, a psychedelic/vintage rock band founded by the frontman of The Black Crowes (9:45 p.m., Amphitheater Stage).\n<iframe width=”470” height=”264” src=”//www.youtube.com/embed/LmskXNorzuo” frameborder=”0” allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe width=”470” height=”264” src=”//www.youtube.com/embed/CTgj_myK3qk” frameborder=”0” allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe width=”470” height=”264” src=”//www.youtube.com/embed/sTVCJwUS6b8” frameborder=”0” allowfullscreen></iframe>\nOn Saturday, classic Western/country vocal duo Vince & Mindi perform on the Garden Stage at 7:15 p.m. Later, at 9:45 p.m. at the Park Stage, Josiel Perez’s AC Jazz Project, a collaboration of Cuban musicians, will get people dancing.\n<iframe width=”470” height=”264” src=”//www.youtube.com/embed/lJRsWFB-GVI” frameborder=”0” allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe width=”470” height=”264” src=”//www.youtube.com/embed/7m7KuTtsUy0” frameborder=”0” allowfullscreen></iframe>\nSunday’s headliners are musical oddities.

They’ve created a play, involving the book’s superhero characters, that includes audience participation. “They’re using the play to get the audience to contribute to their next couple of issues,” Love said.\n<iframe width=”470” height=”264” src=”//www.youtube.com/embed/6Av3FVaW3x0” frameborder=”0” allowfullscreen></iframe>\nFood Row on 200 East is a staple of the Utah Arts Festival. This year, vendors will be serving up kebabs and tacos, pizza and cheesesteak, crêpes and gelato, hot dogs and tacos, and lots more.\nThe food service will also get combative, as festival organizers are planning a chef competition from 1 to 3 p.m. on Thursday and Friday — with the finals at the same time Saturday. Local chefs will be tasked with creating a dish using a basket of items from Utah food sources.\nEach day, from 4 to 11 p.m., Master Chef Robert “Sully” Sullivan will be creating edible works of art, just west of the Festival Stage. And each night from 5 to 10, students from the Art Institute of Salt Lake City will create culinary masterpieces for UAF patrons.\n“Film is always a solitary art form,” said Topher Horman, who coordinates the Fear No Film Festival, the cinematic component of the Utah Arts Festival.\nTo make film more inclusive, Horman has chosen 50 short films from 500 submissions — plus a dozen or so invited entries — and distributed them into seven programs that play in the City Library auditorium.\nOn a hot day, the short films can be a welcome relief. “You can step in, enjoy an hour’s worth and go back out,” Horman said.\nThe programs are themed, each concerning different types of boundaries — personal, societal, historical, global, artistic, relationships and “The Way You See Others.”\nSome of the films are homegrown — particularly the seven in the Utah Short Film of the Year competition (see one, “Realm of Possibility,” below), a Fear No Film staple. Others come from as far away as Germany, France, Australia, Serbia, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, Iran and Turkey.\nThere also are two kids programs — one for ages 3 and older, the other for ages 8 and older — playing on screens in tents, from noon to 8 p.m., in the Art Yard near the City County Building.\n<iframe src=”//player.vimeo.com/video/62300592?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0” width=”470” height=”264” frameborder=”0” webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href=”http://vimeo.com/62300592”>Realm of Possibility</a> from <a href=”http://vimeo.com/spyhop”>Spy Hop Productions</a> on <a href=”https://vimeo.com”>Vimeo</a>.</p>\n• Full programs of street theater are planned in the late afternoon and evening all four nights of the festival.

87	halloween scary house safety flame risk	Haunted houses, while entertaining, pose significant fire safety risks due to their combination of combustible materials, special scenery, and confusing egress paths. To address these risks, haunted houses are classified as special amusement buildings and must meet strict safety requirements including: mandatory automatic sprinklers, smoke detection systems that sound alarms at constantly attended locations, exit marking with floor proximity signs, and Class A interior wall/ceiling finish materials. Additionally, all materials used in haunted houses should be properly flame retarded, with specific products like Flamex being used according to the substrate type. Regular testing using the '12/2' procedure is crucial to verify flame retardancy, and written records of treatments should be maintained.	"['Creating beautiful scenery on a budget often requires Scenics to paint on lightweight soft goods like muslin, silk, lace, and burlap. Unfortunately, these fabrics are also very combustible and have a long record of contributing to some of the worst theatre fires in history. With so many products and tools available to us (and because it is a fire code issue!) there is no reason why we shouldn’t be adding the time and budget to properly flame retard our soft goods – painted or not. In this article, we’ll break down what products are available for treating your fabrics and help you identify which one to use on each substrate.\nOne of the most important tips:\n⊗ Don’t use the wrong product on the wrong substrate.\nFor many applications, the best choice is to treat your scenic element with one product either in its raw form (before you add any paint), or at the end after all the pretty stuff is done. What you use to FR wood is not the same as cotton muslin, china silk, or paper.\nKnowing which product to use on which substrate is pretty daunting, if you don’t have a lot of background knowledge of products and materials. To simplify this process, Rosco created a handy reference chart;\nThe fire retardant experts at Turning Star manufacture Rosco’s range of Roscoflamex products, and they are used all over the entertainment industry, from community theater to Broadway, theme parks to tv/film production, and more. I always get great info from their customer service number about which Flamex products to use on what, and I recently ran a bunch of small sample tests on common fabrics that I wanted to share. I will be talking about common application methods on various substrates and fabrics, how to test your work when you are done, and the results of my testing.\n2 Common Methods of Application: Spraying and Dipping\nBefore applying any flame retardant product, it is highly recommended that you work in a well-ventilated area and protect yourself from overspray with appropriate PPE gear, which includes clothing that covers bare skin.\nThis is often the most popular method due to the square footage of fabric and substrates we need to treat. Spraying involves loading the proper type of Flamex into a garden sprayer and then applying it liberally to the scenery or drop. The goal is total saturation. Because some fabrics are naturally hydrophobic, liquids tend to just bead up on the surface and don’t soak in right away, this is when using a broom or brush to help spread out and push fire retardant into the material helps avoids holidays. Two light passes of FR with the second happening before the 1st has completely dried is also highly recommended as it helps the second coat actually penetrate the substrate.\nIt is recommended that you treat your soft goods before you start painting and then size with starch after your application. But be cautious, as painting on FR treated fabric has been known to change the color of paints and appear splotchy until more coats of paint are added. Read more about that here!\nBecause of all these headaches, many Scenics will elect to flip a drop on to its face and apply a good layer of FR to the backside AFTER they have painted the drop. The reason for flipping is that there is a risk of the Flamex leaving a subtle shiny sheen and we don’t want to risk ruining our hard and beautiful work.\nIt’s worth noting here that the main component of many FR’s can be corrosive if left in a metal sprayer for too long. The high nitrogen content will also kill grass and other plant life if spraying is done outdoors.\nThis involves getting a large plastic bin or bucket and submersing your material in flame retardant before laying it out on plastic to fully dry. Although the amount of Flamex needed for this method can be more than just spraying, it can a great method for ropes and open weave products like erosion cloth so that you know you have gotten every nick, nook, and cranny that spraying can miss.\nFlame Test Procedure\nAfter the application of any FR product, it is crucial to test a sample to ensure that your goods have been effectively treated.\nFlamex, like other flame retardants, are only effective when applied properly and in sufficient quantities. You should always test your work before loading it into the performance space.\nPerforming a flame test on your actual piece of scenery or drop will, at best, leave burn marks and at worst fail, meaning that you’ll watch your work go up in flames. The best practice is to create a separate sample piece to test with that was treated exactly the same way as your real piece, to test with. Pro-Tip; keep your samples handy just in case the local fire marshal pays a visit. That way they can test your sample instead of your scenery too. Some shops sew a sample piece about 12” x 12” onto the drop or curtain for testing purposes, about head height or a little higher is good. That way it’s clear which sample goes with which drape or drop. It’s right there and doesn’t get lost. If it’s at the top of a 20’ or 30’ high drop, no one will see it and it will be forgotten.\nThe “12/2” Testing” Procedure\n1. Before performing your own test, make sure that the material and substrate have fully dried and cured. Many FR flame retardant products need up to 24 hours to cure depending upon the fiber characteristics of the substrate they were applied to.\n2. Work in a draft-free area, and keep clear of away from other combustibles.\n3. For fabric testing, it is recommended to use a piece that is, at minimum, 1/2 in x 4 in (12.7mm x 101.6mm). The fabric sample can be suspended lengthways by using tongs or spring clips.\n4. Using a wooden match, position the bottom edge of the fabric 1/2 in (12.7mm) above the bottom of the flame.\nThe test FAILS if after 12 seconds of exposure, the match is removed from the sample and there are no more than 2 seconds of after-flame.\n2.0 seconds or less = pass\n2.1 seconds or more = fail\nThe test ALSO FAILS if flaming materials that break off or drip from your sample continue to burn for more than 2 seconds after they reach the floor.\nNOTE: Fire regulations vary widely. Be sure that your treated materials meet the standard which applies to your venue. For an accurate look at the codes and standards that fire marshals use to test fabrics, you can visit the National Fire Protection Association’s website and obtain a copy of the NFPA 705.\nFor testing methods of other substates – we recommend you consult with your local fire marshal directly.\nIt’s good practice to keep written records of your methods, samples, and etc. It’s the law that your flame retardancy effectiveness needs to be ‘maintained’ and most FR manufacturers advise treatment every 3 to 5 years. It is also important to remember that Roscoflamex products, and many other brands as well, are water-soluble and are easily removed when exposed to water. It is also recommended that all treated fabrics be dry cleaned, and if you paint over FR treated goods, you should test and re-treat as needed.\nA note about compliance: The products mentioned and used in this article meet fire-retardant standards as established by NFPA, ASTM, ANSI, and UL and have been approved by the CA Fire Marshall and New York City Fire Dept. These are important things to research when choosing any brand of FR product.\nFlame Test Results\nWhen creating my testing samples, I used sample sizes larger than what is required, a stopwatch for timing, and if I ever felt a test got out of hand too fast I pulled my match away sooner and was quick to put out with water.\nPainted Muslin Samples\nI tested the NFR painting sample from another previous article Paint Off.\nAs you can see from the video below the un-treated material failed hardcore.\nI used a small garden sprayer to spray one section of the back and another section of the front with Flamex NF to see if there was a noticeable difference in effectiveness or distortion to my painting. The front treated section did have a subtle shine to it, so that is a thing to consider if deciding to flip a drop to paint. Both passed my test on the first try.\nPolyester Silks can lead to confusion as to what product is best to use. Should you use Flamex DF for delicate fabrics so that it keeps its flexibility, or do you go with Flamex SF because it’s synthetic? So I tested both! I noted that both products did make the fabric samples ever so slightly crunchy and kept their wrinkles more- but they still fluttered nicely in the air as desired. I applied the FR with a spray method and both products passed on the first try. I did find, however, that the flame on the DF sample extinguished a little bit faster and with less damage to the fabric.\nWow! Did you see how fast the untreated sample went up! This is why if you can’t purchase a pretreated FR burlap – you should definitely treat your own! Flamex WD (Wood) has been recommended to me in the past for products like burlap and erosion cloth, and I was curious as to why it was a better choice than the Flamex NF (Natural Fiber) that I’ve used in the past so I did a little research. After comparing the Turning Star SDS’s of both products I found that the WD version has more “proprietary blend” and ammonium sulfate in the mix than in the NF version. It’s this difference that will help me choose both the product and my methods easier: do I want to do one treatment with WD or two with a NF?\nI used the spray method, testing both the WD and NF. And although I thought I had gotten them incredibly saturated, apparently I did not, which is why I am glad I tested. The Flamex WD passed the first time, but the NF failed. After retreating my NF sample with a second coat, I found that it was a “stiffer and more crunchy” than the WD version however it did finally pass.\nBonus fun time video – I tried to make the WD treated Burlap fail on purpose and it just refused!\nI included rope because in my career, about every other year, I do a show where hemp style rope is a major component of the visual design and it should be treated. My samples for untreated rope failed several times because it would consistently continue to smolder after the 12/2 time, and the one time my camera was misbehaving it went up like a candle. I used the Dipping method and once again compared the two types of Rosco Flamex; Flamex WDand Flamex NF.\nBecause it makes a great curtain material, lace is often used as a set dressing. I had no idea what type of lace I had found, or if it was already treated with an FR product, so I tested a sample before I did anything. Watching it drip melty and firey bits was not only fun but also helpful, as it told me that I was working with a polyester blend. (See here for an explanation of how to tell if a fabric is natural or synthetic…) One brushed-on coat of Rosco Flamex SF, and it easily passed the next test. You can see the results in one of our previous photos.\nIn conclusion – we make pretty art for the enjoyment of others. Let’s keep everyone safe by taking the time – and making room in the budget – to protect us, our running crews, and audience members from accidental fires. I sampled just a small handful of common scenic fabrics in this article, but I would love to hear what other materials and substrates you have flame retarded, along with and the methods you’ve used to treat them, in the comments below.\nAnd to see the other side of this conversation, check out this article about 7 Ways to Screw Up Your Flame Retarding.\nAngelique Powers has been painting for over 15 years and has an MFA in Scenic Art from Cal Arts.

Greg, a Principal Engineer in the Building Fire Protection and Life Safety Department at NFPA, discusses how the scope and provisions of NFPA 101 apply to the recent tragedy in Las Vegas and how we, as safety professionals, can contribute to occupant safety in the future. I am truly saddened by the events that required such a post be written in the first place, but cannot deny that we, as professionals, need to keep pushing forward and making changes and doing our best to make this world a safer place. Thanks, Greg, for the timely and thoughtful information.\nOnto NFPA 1.\nDo you ever feel like you are preparing for the holidays months in advance these days? Just the other day I heard a holiday ad on the radio and saw Christmas decorations on display while shopping. Whether we are ready or not, the “holiday season” is here. A common fixture during during fall is the haunted house. Large or small, permanent or temporary, professional or amateur, haunted houses are popping up everywhere, especially in buildings not originally designed to accommodate such use. Unfortunately, haunted houses can cause nightmares for more than just those that attend. Without the proper knowledge and understanding of the codes that apply, haunted houses can be a safety nightmare as well.\nPer NFPA 1, Fire Code, a haunted house is considered a special amusement building. By definition, a special amusement building is ""a building that is temporary, permanent, or mobile and contains a device or system that conveys passengers or provides a walkway along, around, or over a course in any direction as a form of amusement arranged so that the egress path is not readily apparent due to visual or audio distractions or an intentionally confounded egress path, or is not readily available due to the mode of conveyance through the building or structure."" A special amusement building is an assembly occupancy regardless of occupant load.\nHaunted houses use special effects, scenery, props, and audio and visual distractions that may cause egress paths to become not obvious. In haunted houses in particular, the presence of combustible materials and special scenery can also contribute to the fuel load should a fire occur. Because of this, the Code requirements are purposely strict to in hopes of avoiding a potentially disastrous fire event.\nCode provisions for special amusement buildings are found in Section 20.1.4 of NFPA 1. The Code requirements for haunted houses are summarized below:\n- Haunted houses must apply the provisions for assembly occupancies in addition to the provisions of Section 20.1.4.\n- Automatic sprinklers are required for all haunted houses.

88	How do common beans contribute to global nutrition?	Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) are critically important to the global food supply, providing up to 15 percent of calories and 36 percent of daily protein for parts of Africa and the Americas. They serve as a daily staple for hundreds of millions of people.	"['Huntsville, Ala. String bean, snap bean, haricot bean, and pinto and navy bean. These are just a few members of the common bean family scientifically called Phaseolus vulgaris. These beans are critically important to the global food supply. They provide up to 15 percent of calories and 36 percent of daily protein for parts of Africa and the Americas and serve as a daily staple for hundreds of millions of people.\nNow, an international collaboration of researchers, led by Jeremy Schmutz of the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology and Phillip McClean, of North Dakota State University (NDSU) have sequenced and analyzed the genome of the common bean to begin to identify genes involved in critical traits such as size, flavor, disease resistance and drought tolerance. The study was funded by the US Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the US Department of Energy Office of Science.\nThe researchers learned that, unlike most other food crops, the common bean was domesticated twice by humans about 8,000 years ago once in Mexico and once in South America through the selection of largely non-overlapping, unique subsets of genes.\n""We found very little overlap, and very little mixing, among the two domesticated populations,"" said Jeremy Schmutz, who co-directs the HudsonAlpha Institute\'s Genome Sequencing Center and serves as the Plant Program Leader for the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute. ""Evolutionarily, this makes the common bean very unique and interesting.""\nSchmutz shares lead authorship of the current study, which was published on June 8 in Nature Genetics, with Phillip McClean, director of the genomics and bioinformatics program at NDSU. Scott Jackson, from the University of Georgia, is the senior author.\nThe HudsonAlpha Genome Sequencing Center specializes in the production of reference plant genomes and genomic resources with a focus on improving agriculture and developing plant-based energy sources. In 2010, Schmutz led a team of researchers that used the Center\'s unique facilities to be the first to sequence the genome of the soybean another vital global crop.\nIdentifying genes involved in the domestication of the common bean, and comparing locally adapted domesticated bean groups (called landraces) to their wild counterparts throughout Mexico and South America will help researchers understand how beans evolved, and how modern breeding programs might be improved to yield tastier, more-easily harvested, and, yes, even more-nutrient-packed beans. It may also help scientists to develop bean varieties resistant to pests, or better able to grow in challenging environments.\nThe common bean originated from a wild bean population in Mexico, and shares a common ancestor with the soybean. In addition to its role as a critical food crop, it serves as a partner in a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria to improve the soil in which it is planted.\n""We\'re trying to understand what the common bean looked like before human intervention, to identify what occurred during early domestication and to apply that to modern bean breeding,"" said Schmutz. ""Modern beans have been bred to fill specific expectations with regard to color, size and shape, and as a consequence have very little diversity. Studies such as this are necessary to identify genes that could be used to improve traits such as ease of harvest, flavor, yield and disease resistance.""\nOnce genes are identified, they could be reintroduced into the population by selective breeding with wild populations, or careful breeding of existing landraces or even commercial beans. The Common Bean Coordinated Agricultural Project, or BeanCAP, launched in 2009 under the direction of study co-author McClean, is dedicated to the identification of gene markers that can be used in such breeding programs.\n""The genome sequence has important implications for world-wide efforts to improve beans,"" said McClean. ""The sequence will help breeders release varieties that are competitive with other crops and more climate resilient."" The sequence revealed that disease resistance genes are highly clustered in the genome, knowledge that will lead to better breeding strategies to combat the many diseases that challenge the bean crop. Data from the study is being actively used by the many international bean breeders and geneticists to develop the next generation of molecular markers to aid bean breeding efforts.\nFrom a global perspective, this information could be beneficial to farmers in developing countries that practice the intercropping system known as ""milpa"", where beans, corn, and occasionally squash, are planted together. The historical practice ensures that their land can continue to produce high-yield crops without resorting to adding fertilizers or other chemical methods of providing nutrients to the soil. McClean noted that ""Breeders and genomic scientists in these countries are already working with the international bean community to utilize this important new genetic resource to address the production constraints unique to the ""milpa"" system.""\n|Contact: Beth Pugh|\nHudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology']"	['<urn:uuid:cc5bb605-ff97-41d2-9a4a-4c42852162ee>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	8	44	790
89	conservation biology seems really important for nature but i dont know what it studies exactly can someone explain what it covers and what fitness has to do with it	Conservation biology is a field that focuses on understanding and protecting Earth's biodiversity. It studies ecosystems, species diversity, and genetic diversity to preserve nature for current and future generations. Fitness plays a crucial role in conservation biology because it determines how well species can survive and reproduce in their environments. In biological terms, fitness measures an organism's ability to pass on its genetic material and maintain population survival. This understanding helps conservation biologists protect species by ensuring they remain fit enough to reproduce and adapt to their environments, ultimately contributing to biodiversity preservation.

Electronic J Biol, 19(2): 1-2\nConservation biology is a multidisciplinary field that aims to understand and protect Earth's biodiversity. It recognizes the intrinsic value of nature and emphasizes the need to conserve and restore ecosystems for the well-being of both current and future generations. In this article, we will explore the fundamental concepts, challenges, and strategies employed in conservation biology, as well as its significance in building a sustainable future.\nOne of the central principles in biology is evolution, the process by which species change over time. Proposed by Charles Darwin, the theory of evolution by natural selection provides a framework for understanding the diversity of life on Earth. According to this theory, individuals within a population exhibit variations, and those with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits to the next generation. Over millions of years, these small changes accumulate, leading to the formation of new species and the incredible diversity of life we observe today.\nBiodiversity, the variety of life forms found on our planet, is a testament to the evolutionary processes at work. It encompasses the rich tapestry of ecosystems, species, and genetic diversity. Ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands, and coral reefs, consist of living organisms interacting with their physical environment. These interactions are essential for maintaining the balance and functioning of ecosystems, providing vital ecosystem services like clean air, water, and food production.\nBiology delves into the intricacies of physiological processes that enable living organisms to survive and thrive. From the coordination of organ systems to the biochemistry occurring within cells, physiology investigates how living organisms function. Homeostasis, the ability of an organism to maintain a stable internal environment despite external fluctuations, is a fundamental concept in physiology. Through various mechanisms, such as temperature regulation, pH balance, and hormonal control, organisms can preserve optimal conditions for their cells and tissues. For example, in humans, the hypothalamus acts as a control center, maintaining body temperature within a narrow range despite changes in the external environment.\nEcology examines the interactions between organisms and their environment. It explores how organisms adapt to their surroundings, utilize resources, and interact with other species. Ecology encompasses various levels of biological organization, ranging from individual organisms to populations, communities, and entire ecosystems. Interconnectedness is a key theme in ecology. Each organism is intricately linked to others through ecological relationships, such as predation.\nBiology is the study of living organisms, their structure, function, growth, evolution, and interactions with each other and their environment. It is a vast and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including molecular biology, genetics, ecology, physiology, zoology, botany, and many others.\nAt its core, biology seeks to understand the fundamental principles that govern all living organisms, from the smallest bacteria to the largest animals and plants. One of the key concepts in biology is evolution, the process by which species change over time in response to environmental pressures and other factors. Evolution is driven by genetic variation, which arises through mutations and other mechanisms, and natural selection, which favors certain traits that confer a survival advantage.\nAnother important area of biology is genetics, the study of the inheritance and expression of genes. Genes are segments of DNA that contain the instructions for making proteins, the building blocks of cells and tissues. Genetics plays a crucial role in many areas of biology, from understanding the causes of genetic diseases to developing new biotechnologies like genetic engineering and gene therapy. Molecular biology is another major area of biology that focuses on the structure and function of the molecules that make up living organisms. This includes the study of DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as other biomolecules like carbohydrates and lipids. Molecular biology has revolutionized our understanding of the inner workings of cells and has led to many important discoveries in medicine and biotechnology.\nEcology is the study of the relationships between living organisms and their environment. This includes the study of ecosystems, the complex networks of plants, animals, and other organisms that interact with each other and with their physical surroundings. Ecologists study topics like food chains and webs, nutrient cycling, and the effects of human activities like pollution and habitat destruction on the natural world. Physiology is the study of the functions of living organisms, including the mechanisms that regulate growth, metabolism, and other processes. This includes the study of the nervous system, which controls sensory perception, movement, and other aspects of behavior, as well as the endocrine system, which regulates hormone levels and other physiological processes.\nZoology and botany are two major sub-disciplines of biology that focus on the study of animals and plants, respectively. Zoology encompasses a wide range of topics, including the study of animal behavior, anatomy, and physiology, as well as the conservation of endangered species. Botany, on the other hand, focuses on the study of plant structure, growth, and reproduction, as well as the role of plants in the ecosystem and their use in medicine and agriculture.\nOne of the most exciting areas of biology today is biotechnology, the application of biological knowledge and techniques to develop new products and technologies. This includes the development of new drugs, vaccines, and other medical treatments, as well as the development of new crops and agricultural practices that are more sustainable and efficient.\nAnother important area of biology is the study of ecosystems and biodiversity. Ecosystems are complex networks of living organisms and their physical environment, and they play a crucial role in maintaining the health of the planet. Biodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms on Earth, from the smallest microbes to the largest animals and plants. Biodiversity is important because it provides a range of ecosystem services, including pollination, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration.\nFinally, one of the most important aspects of biology is its role in addressing some of the biggest challenges facing humanity today, including climate change, food security, and disease. Biologists are working to develop new technologies and approaches that can help us mitigate the impacts of climate change, ensure a sustainable food supply for a growing global population, and prevent and treat a wide range of diseases."", 'Fitness simply implies reproductive success to an evolutionary biologist, and it shows how well an organism is suited to its environment.\nSimilarly, How does fitness relate to natural selection quizlet?\nWhat is the relationship between fitness and natural selection?

Offspring with more desirable features are more likely to survive and reproduce, increasing the frequency of specific traits.\nAlso, it is asked, What does fitness mean in evolution?\nsuccess in reproduction\nSecondly, What is fitness in ecology?\nThe term “fitness” is used by evolutionary biologists to define how good a genotype is at producing children in the following generation compared to other genotypes. So, if brown beetles continuously produce more progeny than green beetles due to their hue, you’d conclude that the brown beetles are more fit.\nAlso, What is the fitness of an organism?\nIn evolutionary biology, “fitness” refers to an organism’s capacity to pass on its genetic material to its children. The ability to survive long enough to reproduce and maintain a population or species alive is referred to as biological or “Darwinian” fitness.\nPeople also ask, How is natural selection related to a species fitness?\nFitness is only accounting; survival and differential reproduction are the outcome of natural selection, which is the driving force behind evolution. Organisms that are more adapted to their surroundings will reproduce more and hence increase the percentage of the population with their characteristics.\nRelated Questions and Answers\nDoes fitness and survival have the same meaning quizlet?\nDoes fitness (as used in biology) and survival (as used in biology) have the same meaning? Yes, if the population is the issue.\nWhat is relative fitness quizlet?\nRelative fitness refers to an individual’s contribution to the gene pool of the next generation in comparison to that of other people. Natural selection operates directly on the phenotype and indirectly on the gene that regulates it.\nWhat does greater fitness mean quizlet?\nIndividuals who exhibit a more extreme version of a characteristic are more fit than those who exhibit an average form or the opposite extreme form of the trait.\nWhat is the biological term for fitness?\nFitness is sometimes known as Darwinian fitness in biology since it refers to Charles Darwin’s evolutionary theory of natural selection.

Single-Gene Traits and Natural Selection\nWhat is fitness biology quizlet?\nAn organism’s capacity to survive and reproduce in its environment is referred to as fitness.\nWhere does the word fitness come from?\nThough we have come to think of fitness solely in terms of physical fitness it is actually defined as “the quality of being suitable,” and is derived from the Old English suffix -ness, which means “the state of being,” and the root word fit, which means “proper or suitable,” and is of unknown origin (with theories\nWhat does fittest mean in science?\nThe phrase “survival of the fittest” was coined by British biologist Charles Darwin in the fifth edition of On the Origin of Species (published in 1869), which argued that creatures that are best adapted to their environment had the highest chance of surviving and reproducing.\nWhat does survival of the fittest mean quizlet?\nIt’s a case of “survival of the fittest.” Natural selection is the process through which individuals that are more fitted to their environment survive and reproduce the most effectively.\nWhat does the saying survival of the fittest mean?\n: the natural process through which organisms that are well-adapted to their surroundings have the highest chance of surviving and reproducing: the process of natural selection Our home is in the heart of the woods, with deadly snakes in the grass and snapping turtles in the ponds, and each day is marked by the survival of the fittest.—\nWhat is the definition of natural selection quizlet?\nthe process of natural selection The process through which organisms that are most suited to their surroundings survive and reproduce in order to pass on beneficial features to their progeny. offspring.\nWhat is the difference between fitness and relative fitness?\nAbsolute fitness refers to an organism’s fitness as measured by the number of children it would generate in its lifespan and the age at which those offspring would reach reproductive age. Absolute fitness is standardized relative fitness.\nWhy does the fitness of phenotype depend on frequency dependent selection?\nThe fitness of a trait in frequency-dependent selection is determined by how prevalent it is in the population. Depending on which side of their head their mouth is on, scale-eating fish attack their meal from the left or right.\nWhat is the fitness of a mule?\nWhat is a sterile mule’s relative fitness? Because fitness also involves reproductive contributions to the next generation, and a mule is incapable of producing children, the answer is zero.\nWhy do organisms with greater fitness generally?\nWhy do creatures with higher fitness have more offspring than organisms with lower fitness?

Relative fertility success The founder effect is different from a population bottleneck in that it entails the isolation of a small colony of people from the rest of the population.\nWhich of the following is the best definition of evolutionary fitness quizlet?\nDue to heritable features, evolutionary fitness refers to the capacity to reproduce better than other members of your species. Because it may boost reproduction, an adaptation can improve a species’ evolutionary fitness.\nWhen we discuss fitness in a biological context what do we mean quizlet?\nThe capacity of a person to generate children that survive and reproduce in comparison to other individuals in the population is best characterized as biological fitness.\nHow is fitness measured biology quizlet?\nThe proportional number of alleles it provides to the gene pool of the following generation compared to the contribution of others is used to determine fitness. As a result, an individual’s fitness is determined by the number of fertile offspring produced.\nHow is fitness measured in biology?\nThe capacity of an organism to live and reproduce affects the quantity of its genetic contribution to the following generation, which is assessed by fitness. Fitness, on the other hand, is measured by the percentage of following generations that inherit an organism’s genes, not by the overall number of children.\nWhy is natural selection often referred to as the survival of the fittest?\nThe notion of survival of the fittest was popularized by Charles Darwin as a process underpinning natural selection, which drives the development of life.

Evolution, according to Charles Darwin (pictured), is based on the survival of the fittest principle. In a genetic sense, this implies that people in a group, or society, are more likely to survive if they are fit.\nWhat does survival of the fittest mean in reference to natural selection and evolution?\nThe expression “survival of the fittest” relates to natural selection, which is a mechanism that causes evolutionary development. Natural selection works by providing those who are more suited to a certain set of environmental circumstances an edge over those who aren’t.\nFitness is a term that refers to the ability of an organism to survive and reproduce. In natural selection, fitness is related to how well an individual can adapt to its environment.\nThis Video Should Help:\nWhen we are discussing natural selection the term fitness refers to how well an organism is able to survive and reproduce.

90	food security challenges russia georgia farming	Both Russia and Georgia face significant food security challenges in their farming sectors. In Russia, climate change threatens food security through increased water scarcity, pest proliferation, and the risk of extreme weather events, though northern regions may benefit from expanded growing seasons. In Georgia, farmers have experienced severe production losses due to extreme weather events, with small-scale farmers particularly vulnerable due to limited access to financial resources and modern agricultural technologies. To address these challenges, Georgia has implemented comprehensive solutions through climate-smart agriculture practices, while Russia needs to develop adaptive measures for its diverse agricultural regions.	"['Russia\'s food security and climate change: Looking into the future\nAbstractGlobal climate change presents long-term risks to agriculture. In general, global climate change is expected to positively affect Russian agriculture. In high and middle latitudes, global warming would expand the growing season. Acreages of agricultural crops may expand toward the north, although yields would likely be lower due to less fertile soil. However, in the south there is a possibility of drier climate, which has a negative impact on crop yields and livestock productivity. In addition, climate change is expected to increase the scarcity of water resources and encourage weed and pest proliferation, and it is expected to increase the short-term risks associated with an increase in extreme weather events and natural disasters. This paper uses data on current conditions to simulate future scenarios and examine possible impacts on crop production in the Russian Federation. It also considers adaptive measures for agriculture in response to climate change. --\nDownload InfoIf you experience problems downloading a file, check if you have the proper application to view it first.

The frequent wind storms brought other troubles, too, such as extreme temperature swings that further weakened the soil and made her apple trees and blackberry vines vulnerable to diseases and pests. Despite her best efforts, Irina found her yields decreasing from year to year.\nIrina wasn’t alone in her experience. In recent years, farmers across rural Georgia have had to contend with severe production losses and significant threats to their food security. The changing climate has led to a constant barrage of extreme weather events – floods, droughts, wind storms – that have degraded the land and left farmers struggling to cope. An especially hard-hitting spell of heavy rains, hail and winds in July 2012, for example, left many areas of the country in a profound state of emergency that they never fully recovered from.\nWith no end to these weather patterns in sight, the focus turned to helping Georgian farmers mitigate and adapt. The situation was especially urgent for the country’s small-scale farmers, many of whom lack access to the financial resources and technologies – including the latest agricultural techniques – needed to make these changes.\nA holistic approach to restoring the food system\nThe AMMAR project, launched in 2015, was designed to address these challenges. The project forms part of the Georgian Ministry of Agriculture’s ongoing programme to modernize the country’s agriculture sector, with the support of IFAD, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA).\nBecause the entire food system had been so heavily affected, AMMAR project staff knew they needed to adopt a holistic approach that would address all components of the system simultaneously. They therefore decided to promote climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices, a set of approaches that help farmers transform their agricultural systems in response to changing climate circumstances while sustainably increasing their yields and incomes.\nSince then, AMMAR has helped many Georgian farmers restore their local ecosystems and find new ways to produce and sell goods that sustain both the environment and their businesses. For example, they have encouraged the regular pruning of fruit trees, a practice that helps prevent damage from heat and moisture; helped farmers set up and maintain natural windbreaks; introduced beekeeping (an excellent way to support agricultural productivity and biodiversity while increasing and diversifying rural incomes); and trained farmers in composting and vermiculture (the raising of earthworms) to improve soil quality. They have also introduced new practices, such as the use of greenhouses, to protect crops from hazardous weather.\nAMMAR has also provided plenty of equipment, from anti-hail nets and organic fertilizer to drip irrigation systems and seedling nurseries, to help farmers make the most of the new CSA practices. They also offer regular training sessions, maintain demonstration plots to provide examples of best practices, and organize exchange visits between groups of farmers. The latter, in particular, give participants a chance to teach and learn from each other and provide a way for them to explore new opportunities in their local and regional economies.\nSpotlight on windbreaks: One solution for many challenges\nAlthough the land degradation rural Georgians have experienced has multiple causes, one single factor – wind erosion – has proven to be the primary driver. Establishing windbreaks has therefore been central to AMMAR’s activities. In collaboration with the Regional Environmental Center for the Caucasus, AMMAR has set up pilot windbreaks on over 2,800 hectares of land to date. The resulting reduction in wind speed has many benefits, including better control of soil erosion, more favourable snow distribution, improved food and wood production, an increase in livestock productivity, and improved crop quality and yield. In total, the windbreaks correspond to a reduction of 234 tons of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions. They also provide a habitat for up to 1,000 animal species.\nWhen Irina heard that AMMAR was setting up windbreaks, she applied right away. In November 2019, she received 920 seedlings of tall trees, such as poplar, cypress and maple, along with the materials needed to protect growing saplings and manage water flow. After attending training sessions on how to construct and maintain the windbreak, she was ready to begin.\nBy the following summer, her work was already paying off. In addition to buffering her eight hectares from the wind, the windbreak helps accumulate moisture in the soil and shades her apples and blackberries from the sun, increasing the quantity and quality of her yields – and therefore her income. The increase in biodiversity in the area around the windbreak also provides some natural pest control, helping Irina avoid the use of pesticides.\n“I am delighted with the project support,” she says.\nOver all, the promotion of CSA practices and the introduction of innovative technologies has made a significant contribution to building the climate resilience of Georgian agriculture. The success of the windbreak pilot, in particular, has raised hopes of extending the practice to other areas. To this end, AMMAR has contributed to a policy framework that would help establish windbreaks across the country. Of course, transforming food systems is an extremely complex undertaking, involving cross-cutting biophysical, socio-economic, political and institutional elements across all elements of the system. For all these reasons and more, it is vital to scale up CSA practices to promote their sustainability across the entire system. But with farmers’ continued interest and enthusiasm, this momentum is only expected to increase.\nLearn more about IFAD’s work in Georgia.Publication date: 07 June 2021']"	['<urn:uuid:88d94635-ead3-43a3-a787-072fe4b1013f>', '<urn:uuid:f82b268c-445f-4456-944b-a7dad2017c95>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	6	96	1603
91	How are scientists helping farmers deal with food production challenges like diseases and climate change, and what's the current state of global food waste and production?	Scientists are using advanced genetic tools to help farmers improve crops. For example, they're using genetic markers to breed wheat varieties that resist diseases like wheat scab while maintaining high productivity. This breeding process, which previously required extensive field testing, can now be done more efficiently in laboratory conditions. Meanwhile, global food production faces significant challenges - while we currently produce enough food to feed the world's 7 billion people (17% more food per person), up to half of the world's food is wasted. This waste occurs through production inefficiencies in developing countries and market and consumer waste in advanced societies. Americans alone waste about 141 trillion calories worth of food daily, equivalent to about $165 billion per year.	"['Researchers are using the latest tools in genetics to help give farmers an edge in the race to feed the planet.\nFood prices have been climbing in recent months because of bad weather in several major agricultural regions. Experts expect more extreme weather as the climate changes, threatening food supplies around the world. Farmers must also deal with the constant threats of insect pests, weeds, and diseases.\nUsing genetic markers, plant breeders like the University of Maryland\'s Jose Costa are improving crops with greater precision and accuracy than ever before.\nCosta is working to protect farmers from a fungal disease called wheat scab that infected half the crop last year.\nAs he pours healthy and infected seeds into metal pans at his laboratory at the university\'s College Park campus, the effect of the disease is plain to see. The scabby seeds are white-ish, even pink in some spots, and they\'re ragged-looking next to the healthy wheat grains.\nBut beyond deforming the seeds, the fungus causes a much more serious problem.\n""It causes vomiting in humans,"" Costa says. ""So, we don\'t really want that in our bread or cookies.""\nBut just like some people don\'t get sick as often as others, some varieties of wheat are less likely to get scab. Costa has one such variety from China growing in an incubator downstairs from his lab.\nOne in a thousand\nThe challenge, Costa says, is to mate a local wheat variety that produces a lot of grain but is susceptible to scab with the Chinese variety that is resistant to scab -- but doesn\'t produce as much.\n""One or two plants in a thousand [will] carry the right combination of genes,"" he says.\nRecent advances in genetics make the job of combining those genes easier.\nScientists are mapping the entire genetic code of wheat. They\'ve already figured out the location of some of the key genes, including those for scab resistance and productivity. And to locate them quickly, they\'ve found small stretches of DNA called markers.\n""Just like in real life you would use a landmark when you give directions, we use markers,"" says graduate student Lydia Cardwell.\nScientists mate the wheat plant from Maryland with the one from China by cross-pollinating them.\nUntil recently, finding that one-in-a-thousand offspring that is both resistant and productive meant growing lots of plants to maturity in big test plots.\nNow, they grow young plants in a room-sized incubator. They extract genetic material from a small piece of leaf to look for the markers that will identify the scab resistant, productive offspring.\nIt takes far less space and it\'s far more accurate, Costa says. Out in the field, some plants just get lucky and escape infection even though they\'re susceptible to the disease.\n""You don\'t know if they\'re resistant, or if they [just] escaped the disease,"" Costa says. ""With markers, now we can tell if they do have the genes or not.""\nTool for improving many crops\nPlant breeders are using markers to improve many different crops.\n""They\'re making combinations of genes possible that simply would have been impossible in the past,"" says Erik Legg, lead researcher with major global agriculture company Syngenta.\nSyngenta is developing maize that tolerates both drought and flood. At least 15 genes are involved. Legg says planting enough maize to find that extremely unlikely combination of genes would be a challenge, to say the least.\n""It\'s been estimated that stacking together 15 or more genes of interest through traditional breeding would take probably more arable land than is available on Earth,"" he says.\nThis advance in breeding comes at an important time. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that food production will need to increase by 70 percent by 2050 to meet the demands of a growing population. Meanwhile, climate change threatens food production in many parts of the world. Wheat scientist Jose Costa says breeders will need all the help they can get.\n""Well, we don\'t know if it\'s going to be enough,"" he says. ""It\'s the best we can do at this time.

92	wing mounted air compressors fuel savings	Actuators can be integrated into aircraft wings or fins to improve climb performance and help save fuel. However, this integration involves a trade-off: while it can improve efficiency in some ways, it also requires additional assembly work and creates more weight, which leads to higher fuel consumption. Economists are analyzing whether the fuel savings during launch can compensate for the increased fuel consumption during flight to determine if using actuators would be economically sensible.	['Flying: Efficiency thanks to Lightweight Air Nozzles\nThe Federal Cluster of Excellence MERGE at Chemnitz University of Technology and the Fraunhofer ENAS join forces in order to optimise actuator systems for active flow control in aeroplanes and cars\nActive flow control has nothing to do with flowing rivers and the dead wake is actually air, and not really dead at all. Basically speaking: “We investigate ways of influencing aerodynamic flows of aeroplanes, cars or wind turbines”, explains Dipl.-Ing. Martin Schüller, research fellow at the Fraunhofer Institute for Electronic Nano Systems in Chemnitz. “To this end, we use actuators. It helps to imagine small loudspeakers pumping air with a very high velocity.” These so-called actuators can actively control the aerodynamic flow through targeted air blasts. The Federal Cluster of Excellence MERGE at Chemnitz University is contributing significantly to this research project.\nOptimising their application and design for varying uses is the subject of Schüller’s PhD thesis and of his daily work along with his colleagues Mathias Lipowski, Perez Weigel and André Gratias in the “Flow Control Actuators and Systems“-team. So far the usual approach has been trial and error”, Schüller says and adds: “I wanted to develop an optimisation tool that allows for a simulation of as many application parameters as possible.” The result is a combination of a closed analytical model with a network model, which can calculate all elements analytically for the first time. With this tool the actuators’ performance can be improved for every application.\nSchüllers PhD thesis takes a closer look at an application in aviation. Actuators can be integrated into wings or fins e.g. improving the climb and thereby helping to save on fuel. Nevertheless, this integration requires additional assembly work and creates more weight leading to higher fuel consumption, as the scientist explains. Which is why, Schüller and his team have investigated the integration of actuators into several material compounds and components within the Federal Cluster of Excellence MERGE. They took some inspiration from automotive engineering in this respect. “We try to fight the so called dead wake at the car rear, where turbulences emerge, slowing down the car. Actuators at the rear can counteract this effect”, Schüller explains.\nThe most important parameters are taken from lightweight design: There are only a few production technologies and materials that are suitable for an especially low weight, the installation space is pre-defined, as are the aerodynamics of the vehicle. According to the chosen technology a variety of actuator designs is possible, because their layout is predetermined technologically. Milling, 3D printing, injection moulding and stereo lithography allow only for specific forms of the nozzle and cavity. Innovative fibre-reinforced plastic materials, which are the main focus of MERGE, possess other properties that have to be taken into account for the integration of the actuators.\nInterdisciplinarity Ensures Practical Strengths and Economic Efficiency\nMechanical and electrical engineers within the Cluster cooperate with the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration at Chemnitz University of Technology on an interdisciplinary level. Professor Uwe Götze, Professor of Management Accounting and Controlling, and his colleagues investigate the economic efficiency of each of the manufacturing technologies as well as the life cycle of the actuators. For example, for the aircraft wing. The economists analyse whether the saving in fuel during the launch can make up for the higher fuel consumption during the flight, i.e. whether the use of actuators would be sensible from an economic point of view.\nAll these parameters - from the manufacturing technology via aerodynamic values up to economic efficiency - are combined in MERGE. Schüller’s optimisation tool can help combine them analytically and create an almost optimal design of the actuators for each respective case. “We also aim at integrating an adapted actuator system into the rear spoiler of our Chemnitz Car Concept”, Schüller explains. “This is an absolute innovation. Until today there have been studies on actuators in side-view mirrors only, but no implementation has yet been tried for the rear.”\nAbout the Chemnitz Car Concept\nVarious research areas are merged in the system demonstrator called “Chemnitz Car Concept” (CCC). The “MERGE up!” provided by Volkswagen, serves as a platform for tests and demonstration of the latest research results in cooperation with the Department of Advanced Powertrains. The lightweight vehicle represents the MERGE technologies integrated into an electrically driven car. It will include exemplary parts in the interior and exterior - from lightweight components up to the power train - especially developed and built into the “MERGE up!”.\nFor more information please contact the project coordinator Martin Schüller, Phone 0371 45001-242, e-mail email@example.com\nFor more information on the Chemnitz Car concept please visit www.tu-chemnitz.de/MERGE/ccc.php']	['<urn:uuid:d65e1b93-2915-486c-a039-f96c9303d099>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	6	74	772
93	native american tribes environment water contamination issues	Native American tribes face significant environmental justice issues, particularly related to water contamination. According to government data, there are 565 recognized tribes who have historically faced unfair environmental burdens including industrial waste dumping and mining pollution affecting their rivers and lakes. For example, in Montana, 1,200 gallons of hazardous waste were illegally dumped on the Fort Peck Reservation, while on the Blackfeet Reservation, water supplies were found to be contaminated with fecal matter due to falsified monitoring reports.	"['Special Report: Pollution, Poverty, People of Color\nCommunities across the US face environmental injustices\nHead in any direction on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and you will reach gushing rivers, placid ponds and lakes – both Great and small.\nAn abundant resource, this water has nourished a small Native American community for hundreds of years. So 10 years ago, when an international mining company arrived near the shores of Lake Superior to burrow a mile under the Earth and pull metals out of ore, the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community of the Lake Superior Band of Chippewa had to stand for its rights and its water.\nAnd now, as bulldozers raze the land and the tunnel creeps deeper, the tribe still hasn’t backed down.\n“The indigenous view on water is that it is a sacred and spiritual entity,” said Jessica Koski, mining technical assistant for the Keweenaw Bay community. “Water gives us and everything on Earth life.”\nThe Keweenaw Bay Indians are fighting for their clean water, sacred sites and traditional way of life as Kennecott Eagle Minerals inches towards copper and nickel extraction, scheduled to begin in 2014.\nTribal leaders worry the mine will pollute ground water, the Salmon Trout River and Lake Superior, and strip the spiritual ambiance from their historical sites. Meandering through the Huron Mountains before spilling into Lake Superior, the river is home to endangered coaster trout as well as other fish that the tribe depends on for food.\nThe Keweenaw Bay community’s L’Anse Reservation, home to 1,030 people, is both the oldest and the largest reservation in Michigan and sits about 30 miles west of the river. The struggle of this small community in remote, sleepy northernmost Michigan mirrors that of its native ancestors.\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, there are 565 recognized Native American tribes. About 5.2 million people identified themselves as Native American or Alaska Native in the 2010 U.S. Census. But that sliver of the country’s population – 1.7 percent - historically has faced an unfair burden of environmental justice issues.\nSince early European immigration there have been palpable culture clashes with Native Americans – with the indigenous people often on the losing end. Infectious diseases, forced assimilation and land grabs marred early relations.\nBut as the nation grew larger, the environmental justice issues did, too. Native American reservations have been targeted as places to dump industrial waste, and to mine both uranium and coal, leading to polluted rivers, lakes and tribal lands across the country. Some tribes have turned to waste storage or mining as revenue generators.\nNative Americans continue to battle poverty, joblessness and low incomes. About 28.4 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives – nearly twice the national rate – lived in poverty in 2010. Their unemployment hovers around 49 percent, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ most recent labor force report in 2005.\nLow income and environmental threats often go hand-in-hand, said Kyle Whyte, an assistant professor of philosophy at Michigan State University who studies Native American environmental justice issues.\nNative Americans are even more vulnerable than other disadvantaged groups because of their reliance on natural resources for survival, he said. The top environmental justice issues still plaguing their communities are lack of healthy foods and water, and protection of sacred sites – all at play in northern Michigan.\nFor the 3,552 members of the Keweenaw Bay tribe, it’s more than just water at stake. “It is a living thing that provides for us – physically and spiritually,” Koski said.\nWhyte said this view of water and the surrounding area is unique to tribes and should guide governance. “Part of it is admitting that some groups have a different conception of sacredness than we do,” he said.\n""Almost more pure than rainfall""\nThe newest controversy is over the Eagle Project, an underground nickel and copper mine just west of Marquette, Mich., a few miles inland from the shores of Lake Superior. Mine development began in 2010. It is now 75 percent complete and is scheduled to operate in 2014, according to Kennecott Eagle Minerals, owner, developer and future operator of the mine. The tribe, however, hopes to derail it with pending lawsuits.\nThe concerns about water contamination stem from the method, sulfide mining, which extracts metals from sulfide ores. When the sulfide ores are crushed, the sulfides are exposed to air and water, which catalyzes a chemical reaction that produces highly toxic sulfuric acid. The acid can then drain into nearby rivers, lakes and ground water sources – a phenomenon called acid mine drainage.\n“Water is the top environmental concern,” Koski said. “In addition to ourselves, all of the plants and wildlife rely on that water, and we have treaty rights for hunting, fishing and gathering.”\nCompany officials say they have addressed environmental concerns.\nAny water, including rain and snow, that comes in contact with mining activities is sent to a $10-million water treatment plant that will use a cleansing technology called reverse osmosis, said Daniel Blondeau, communications and media relations advisor at Rio Tinto, the London-based mining company that owns Kennecott.\nThe water is then either recycled into the mining process or returned into the ground. Blondeau said mining effluent will be tested every day and results will be sent to the state monthly.\nThose tasked with keeping Michigan’s water clean say they are confident that this treatment method, already used in many places to purify drinking supplies, will work.\n“We actually really don’t expect a lot of water in the mine … I mean there will be some,” said Hal Fitch, director of the office of oil, gas and minerals for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. “Once that water goes through reverse osmosis treatment, it comes out almost more pure than rainfall … In fact, they have to have a roof over treatment plants so the treated water isn’t contaminated by rainwater.”\nExperts tout the reverse osmosis and reuse as an example of technology overcoming environmental obstacles.\n“The way Eagle will process the material, there will be no smelting onsite, so there’s very little likelihood for contamination,” said Klaus Schulz, a senior research geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. “As long as they aren’t putting tailings (leftover mining material) into the streams there should be no problems.”\nTailings will be stored in an offsite temporary holding area double-lined with leak detection and collection systems, according to Kennecott officials. The tailings will also be mixed with limestone to neutralize the acid potential.\nSchulz said historically mishandled tailings have been to blame for contamination.\n“The reverse osmosis is leaps and bounds over what used to happen, which was water being dumped in lakes and rivers,” Schulz said. “Plus they’ll be recycling and reutilizing the water in the process, which lessens the withdrawal.”\nWestern states have seen the most sulfide mine contamination, Schulz said. Two of the most well-known examples are the Summitville and Gilt Edge mines.\nIn the 1980s, the Summitville Mine in southwestern Colorado contaminated the Wrightman Fork tributary and the Alamosa River. The acid drainage stemmed from poor holding areas and tailing leakage. Ground water in that area is not used for drinking. But the Alamosa River below the site still cannot support aquatic life.\nThe Gilt Edge Mine in South Dakota was a gold mine that an insolvent company abandoned in the late 1990s, leaving behind 150 million gallons of acidic heavy-metal-laden water, as well as millions of cubic yards of acid-generating tailings. The Strawberry and Bear Butte creeks have been contaminated.\n“Sure, historically there have been issues, but there are techniques today to deal with all of that,” Schulz said.\nNow-shuttered Wisconsin mine\nUnder the Treaty of 1842, the Chippewa gave the U.S. government land bordering Lake Superior in what is now the western half of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and northeast Wisconsin. The tribes were paid and allowed to continue hunting, fishing and gathering on the ceded land.\nKennecott now owns about 1,600 acres, including the mine site, within that territory given to the government 170 years ago. Over its seven- to eight-year lifespan, the mine will produce 300 million pounds of nickel and 250 million pounds of copper, and directly employ about 300 people, according to Kennecott estimates.\nIn recent years, the land surrounding Lake Superior has been a hotspot for companies seeking to mine, process and sell metals. A similar copper and nickel sulfide mine proposal in St. Louis County, Minn., by Polymet Mining, has come under similar attacks by residents concerned about the water supply.\nThe Eagle mine will be the first to use sulfide extraction in Michigan. The state has had copper mines in the past but it was native copper, not copper tied up in sulfide, Schulz said.\n“There are no examples they can point to of sulfide mines that haven’t caused pollution,” Koski said.\nBut Kennecott points to its now closed Flambeau Mine that operated in Rusk County, Wis., from 1993 to 1997. Reclamation of the copper and gold mine was completed in 1999, when it was filled back in.\n“We have not found any violations of mining permits or state law, have not issued any violations at the Flambeau in compliance,” said Phil Fauble, mining coordinator with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.\nKennecott is responsible for the Flambeau site in perpetuity. During mine backfill and site cleanup, the company found a few areas where there was copper contamination. The company took care of the contamination right away, Fauble said. His department hasn’t yet completed studies to see if these areas could harm wildlife or people.\nEmily Whittaker, executive director of the Yellow Dog Watershed Preserve, an environmental group that is also fighting the Eagle mine, said Flambeau is a reason not to trust Kennecott. She pointed to an ongoing lawsuit brought by the Wisconsin Resource Protection Council that charges Kennecott under the Clean Water Act.\nWhittaker said the preparation for mining has already altered the environment in Michigan. Road widening for trucks is probably to blame for increased sedimentation of the Salmon Trout River, she said. Portions of the mine will be drilled directly below the river.\n“Our main concern is the condition of the environment. Our secondary concern is the communities that depend on this environment,” Whittaker said. “Water is the lifeblood of this area.”\nHunting, fishing and blueberry gathering have already been hampered because development has gobbled up prime land, Koski said.\n“Right now it’s an access issue, with the complete bulldozing,” Koski said. “If and when the mine opens, it will be pollution impacting wildlife and treaty-protected resources.""\n“It is still very sacred to us.”\nOne company compromise – providing access to Eagle Rock – hasn’t mollified tensions. Eagle Rock is a spiritual gathering place.\n“We went there early afternoon on a Saturday, had to show our ID’s … show our tribal cards,” Koski said. “We had to put on bright green and red vests, wear safety goggles … there were cranes everywhere … we were escorted by two company officials.”\nBlondeau said the state requires the company to protect the rock’s surface and prohibits any mining activities on the rock. But to the Keweenaw Bay community, these requirements haven’t protected the rock’s essence.\n“We used to drive up freely without permission or being escorted, now there is a high berm and a barbed wire fence,” Koski said. “We aren’t able to stay the night or do any traditional fasting. The whole integrity of the site is disturbed. But it is still very sacred to us.”\nFitch said that Kennecott has provided adequate access. He referred to the site as “the so-called Eagle Rock.”\n“It never had that name before the project, but I guess there’s an oral tradition,” Fitch said.\nIt’s these kinds of communication breakdowns that are at the heart of persistent Native American environmental justice issues across the country, Whyte said.\n“When a tribe expresses its own knowledge and conceptions of things like the environment to companies or officials, and it is respected, justice issues like being able to protect sacred sites and clean water are often handled in a fair way,” Whyte said.\nHe said the state and federal government has a mixed record on handling Native American issues, and he wasn’t so sure that this open communication was happening in the upper reaches of Michigan – especially over Eagle Rock.\n“I think it’s fair to question whether the company, federal and state governments are truly respecting the unique caretaking practices of the tribe for that space,” Whyte said.\nLittered with litigation\nThe only federal regulatory hurdle Kennecott faced was approval of the Environmental Protection Agency’s underground injection control program. After reviewing the treatment plans, the EPA determined a federal permit wasn’t necessary.\nThe Keweenaw community initially reached out to the EPA but did not get very far, Koski said. The EPA acknowledges that environmental justice issues persist in Native American communities, even accepting some blame.\n“The environmental justice issues facing Native American communities range from direct environmental, public health, cultural and sacred sites impacts, to lack of meaningful involvement and fair treatment in the governmental decision-making processes,” according to an emailed response by the EPA’s press office.\nThe EPA did not comment on relations with the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community.\nFitch said the state has included the tribe every step of the way.\n“They were there when we went over the rules and didn’t say much. We had meetings at the governor’s office with them and they didn’t say much,” Fitch said. “Now they come out and they’re critical, and that bothers me.”\nKoski said the tribe has opposed the mine since talks began. Failing to make much progress at the state or federal level, the Keweenaw Bay community has reached out to the United Nations, meeting with James Anaya, the UN\'s special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples.\nAs the project pushes on, it remains littered with litigation.\nCurrently, the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community and three organizations – the National Wildlife Federation, Huron Mountain Club and Yellow Dog Watershed Preserve – are waiting to hear whether Michigan’s Court of Appeals will hear their challenge of a 2006 state permit to build the mine.\nIn addition, the Huron Mountain Club, a private landowners club, filed a lawsuit in April contending Kennecott didn’t get permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The lawsuit claims that the permits are necessary since the project could harm the Salmon Trout River, wetlands, endangered species and sacred Native American sites.\nSo far lawsuits and knocking on government doors have proven fruitless and costly, Koski said. But the tribe will continue its steady drumbeat of opposition, pushing industry and government to respect their land, their water, their beliefs and their rights.\n“An elder recently gave me a bracelet symbolizing a rainbow,” Koski said. “She said she saw that things were going to be changing.\n“There is still a lot of hope.”\nThis article originally ran at Environmental Health News, a news source published by Environmental Health Sciences, a nonprofit media company.', 'Prosecutions in Indian Country: Environmental Crimes\nProtecting Indian Country from Environmental Harm\nby Michael Cotter, U.S. Attorney for the District of Montana\nIn Montana, 45 drums containing more than 1,200 gallons of waste marked “sulfuric acid,” “caustic potash” and “caustic soda beads” were hauled and disposed of 330 miles away from the perpetrator’s business – dumped on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. Out of sight, out of mind.\nFour hundred miles west, fecal contamination was found in a town’s water supply on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. An investigation revealed that after the primary water system operator tested and monitored the water supply for chlorine and turbidity, he consistently falsified his reports, endangering the community. The operator was prosecuted and last month pled guilty to federal charges.\nThese are just two examples of how the Department of Justice plays an important role in protecting the health and the environment of American Indian and Alaska Native communities.\nThe Attorney General’s Advisory Committee has designated July as the focus month for Indian Country. Evidence suggests that many communities in Indian Country bear a disproportionate share of risk from environmental harms. Attorney General Holder has made achieving environmental justice – where all Americans share an equal right to protection under our nation’s environmental laws – a top priority. Equally important is respect for tribal sovereignty and jurisdiction, making meaningful consultation with communities a critical step along the path to achieving environmental justice. With these principles in mind, we in the U.S. Attorney community must work towards the fulfillment of our nation’s enduring promise to Native Americans by building and sustaining healthy and safe native communities.\nSanta Ana Mountains, California\nBut criminal enforcement is not the only tool available to the Justice Department. In a civil action brought by the Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, a processing facility overloaded a city’s wastewater treatment system with millions of gallons of industrial wastewater. At times, this caused pollution along a 22-mile-long section of the Spring River in southeast Kansas and northeast Oklahoma, affecting indigenous territory of the Shawnee Tribe of Eastern Oklahoma and killing countless fish. The case was resolved by consent decree in which the company agreed to pay $390,000 in civil penalties, a portion of which are to be available specifically to re-stock fish in the Spring River.\nQuileute Reservation, Washington\nIn June, the United States, the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, and the state of Idaho reached an agreement with the Hecla Mining Company pursuant to which the company agreed to pay $263 million to resolve historic claims by the tribe and the federal government for cleanup costs and natural resource damages from mining waste from the Bunker Hill Mining and Metallurgical Complex Superfund Site in northern Idaho. This not only resolves a two decade old claim by the tribe, it also fosters future cooperation on the cleanup of the site and the restoration of natural resources in the Coeur d’Alene basin.\nThe stewardship of our environment and natural resources must be a shared responsibility of the U.S. Attorneys and the tribal communities we serve. The examples above are just some ways the Department of Justice acts on behalf of American Indians and Alaska Natives to resolve environmental matters, and defend Native Americans from harms to their health and environment. It is a priority of the Department to ensure that environmental justice is achieved in every tribal community throughout the 55 million acres of Indian Country.']"	['<urn:uuid:145a85d3-d026-47f4-857f-b1e9f548e403>', '<urn:uuid:342e437e-4155-4821-ad3b-0af411e38908>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	7	78	3074

These monuments are located in the Shera alps of Jordan, situated east of the Wadi Araba Valley.\nApproximately 2200 years ago, Nabateans (ancient Arab people who inhabited northern Arabia) had carved more than 900 monuments using sedimentary rocks as they were well-aware of the aesthetical features of sedimentary rock.\nIn 1986, the United Nations of Education, Science, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) emblazoned Petra on the directory of the world heritage site as a work of genius, bearing inimitable testimony to the advancement of civilization that has vanished. Rock-cut monuments of Petra are the epitome of exceptional architecture and represent an important phase of human history.\nIn 2007, the rock-cut monuments of Petra were selected as one of the seven wonders of the world. Petra region is also considered as a famous historical site in Jordan because it has impacted the tourism economy of the country. More than 700,000 tourists visit the rock-cut monuments of Petra in a year.\nThe sedimentary rocks of the Petra region are of lower paleozoic age. Mostly, the sandstone formations of the sedimentary rock are the pertinent stratigraphical units used for carving the monuments. These sandstone formations are the part of the Ordovician disi formation and the Cambrian umm ishrin formation.\nMost of the rock-cut monuments of Petra are undergoing weathering due to external agents such as water, humidity, and salt that have contributed to the damage. Also, anthropogenic activities, natural hazards like floods, and earthquakes have worsened the situation.\nThus, by looking at the development of damage, the world monuments fund added the rock-cut monuments of Petra to the list of top 100 endangered monuments of the world in 1998, 2000, and 2002. Therefore, the rock-cut monuments of Petra have become a global concern for preservation.\nIn this article, we will discuss the rock types, weathering agents, which are contributing to the degradation process, and preventive measures to reduce the degradation of the rock-cut monuments.\n1. Geology of the Petra Site\nThe ruined city of Petra includes many monuments, tombs, quarries, stairways, and theaters all constructed directly from sandstone rock, especially Cambrian and Ordovician sandstones. More details about the sandstone rock, which is mostly affected by the weathering, are described below:\n- Most of the sandstone rocks are underlain by igneous rocks, such as granite, gneisses, and schists.\n- Plinth level of igneous rock displays a well-defined characterized contact plane whereupon the sandstone strata is situated.\n- The shade of Petra sandstone is rosy, that is why the city is called “a rose-red city”.\n- Umm Ishrin Sandstone stratum is of middle to upper Cambrian age, and the thickness of the strata is around 300 m.\n- The upper-level blanketing formation is comprised of Disi sandstone, and the thickness of this formation is 100 m. This stratum displays a whitish-beige color and is seen throughout the valley.\n- Sandstones of the Disi formation are critically influenced by the weathering agents. Such strata erode into characteristic domed features that can be recognized from miles away.\n- Umm Ishrin sandstone formation shows extensive moment jointing and faulting. In contrast, Disi formation sandstone shows less frequent jointing.\n- Weathering induced sandstone surface recession ranges from 12-50 mm on a horizontal surface and 6-20 mm on vertical surfaces.\n2. Climatic Conditions at Petra Site\nThe climatic conditions at the Petra region are generally arid with moderate to mild blustery winters and sweltering, dry summers. Regional rainfall occurs due to change in barometric pressure conditions as the peripheral precipitation passes through northern Israel and Jordan. However, when low-pressure fronts get across northern Africa or up through the red sea, heavy rainfall occurs in the Petra region. Such conditions occasionally bring flooding in the region due to a combination of orographic lifting and cyclonic flow.\nMostly, the precipitation occurs between November and March, and the mean yearly precipitation at the Petra region is around 110-130 mm. Hints of snowfall are also reflected. However, a large portion of the precipitation is observed as rainfall.\nThe temperature in the Petra region may dip below 0 degrees during January. However, freezing temperature conditions are not common, and the temperature rises rapidly during the daytime. The maximum and minimum temperature is observed in the months of August and January and the range of temperature is around 18-390C and 6-120C, respectively.\n3. Weathering Factors and Degradation of the Monuments\nHigh-temperature loads are induced on many rock-monuments in Petra. Mostly, the monuments located in the south and west are exposed directly to the sun, for example, the Silk Tomb. Variation due to direct isolation and high-temperature loading affects the monuments and promotes the attack of weathering agents.\nResearchers have hypothesized temperature as a mild to moderate weathering agent for degrading the quality of Petra’s rock-cut monuments. As indicated by the outcomes gathered from various investigations, the correlation of high-temperature loading and weathering damage is not very severe. However, mild to moderate damages occur on the monuments exposed to temperature loading compared to the monuments insignificantly affected by temperature loading. Thus, high-temperature loading has turned out not to be the principal reason for the degradation of the monuments due to weathering.\nOn the other side, a strong correlation exists between water impact and weathering damage. During rainy reason, runoff water flows over the facades of the rock-cut monuments, and flooding conditions were also observed occasionally. Thus, the potential of damage to the monuments due to water impact is high. For example, the effect of water on the Unaishu Tomb during heavy rainfall is illustrated in Figure-2. The portion of monuments protected from the rainfall appears in a lighter color, whereas, the portion of monuments exposed to rain appears in a darker color in the photographs.\nResearchers have observed the changes in exposure characteristics of the monument during periods of rainfall. Such observations helped in mapping the exposed part of the monument, which is vulnerable to damage due to water impact. An example is presented in Figure-3. It was discovered that the south to west exposed monuments are more influenced by water impact due to precipitation compared to the north to east exposed monuments.\nThe architectural elements, such as moldings and pediments, provide protection from rain for some of the locally exposed monuments from south to west. Overflowing water affects sites, especially when water channels above the site are filled or eroded with debris. Water flowing from architectural elements is an attribute of many Petra monuments because precipitation often exceeds the water absorption capacity of the rock sediments. The lower sections of many monuments are also influenced by increased humidity.\nThe predominant weathering factors causing the degradation of the rock-cut monuments are water, salt, and humidity. Water runoff and floods affecting the monuments are characterized by high mechanical water impact potential. Several types and extents of humidity and the impact of salt relate to the weathering patterns formed on the monuments. Mostly, the monuments are categorized into damage index of two degrees. The low damage index represents the monuments sheltered from the rainfall. Thus salt penetration is negligible. The high damage index represents the monuments directly exposed to the rainfall, therefore higher salt penetration is possible.\nSalt weathering has been found to be the main and most detrimental water or moisture-induced weathering activity. The results of mineralization and geotechnical studies have exhibited that all major types of rock separation, such as contour deposits, flaking and granular decomposition, are associated with the presence of salts.\nMostly, halite (NaCl) was found to be the primary salt mineral deposited on the external walls of the monuments. Also, the presence of niter (KNO₃), Gypsum (CaSO₄.2H₂O), and sylvite (KCl) were observed. The type, amount, spatial distribution, and crystallization cycle of salt control the type and strength of stone exfoliation. Chemical analysis of rainwater shows that a significant proportion of the salt component comes from rain, especially with respect to the formation of halite. Nitrate load on the walls of the monument (especially at the bottom) is probably due to the effects of livestock over the decades.\nThe wind is observed to be another weathering agent influencing the degradation of the rock-cut monuments. However, the wind is not causing the collapse of stones. Still, it contributes considerably to the erosion of loose stones, and the evaporation of salt fluids and their movement through rocks.\n4. Preventive Measures\nThe following types of preventive measures should be taken into consideration to protect the rock-cut monuments of the Petra region:\n- Stone blocks should be prevented from breaking out. Preservatives should be used to reduce salt weathering.\n- Loose stone materials should be reinforced again to preserve the originality of the monuments.\n- For highly damaged monuments, structural stabilization or reinforcement should be provided to keep them structurally sound.\n- Repair should be done for the damaged stone parts and missing parts should be replaced.\n- Joints and fissures should be sealed properly to avoid the percolation of water and thus to prevent the disintegration of stone material.\n- A system should be provided to construct and maintain the control of runoff water. Thus, the capillary rise can be prevented and further the disintegration of stones can be reduced.\n- The rise in humidity should be controlled by planting more trees at the affected locations.\n- Desalination of runoff water must be provided because salt weathering is mostly affecting the rock-cut monuments.\n- The regular cleaning process must be carried out to reduce the deposition of harmful agents on the surface of stones.\n- External stone wall surfaces, which are exposed to weathering agents, should be protected. Protection can be provided by applying preservative solutions on external surfaces.\nPetra is a world heritage site and recognized by UNESCO as a work of genius, bearing inimitable testimony to the advancement of civilization that has vanished. Rock-cut monuments of Petra are the epitome of exceptional architecture and represent an important phase of human history.\nRock-cut monuments of Petra are located in the Shera alps of Jordan, situated in east of the Wadi Araba Valley.\nMost of the rock-cut monuments of Petra are suffering from weathering.

Mostly, the sandstone formations of the sedimentary rock are the pertinent stratigraphical units used for carving the monuments.

95	How did the organizers handle language differences during the international conference presentations to make them accessible to everyone?	The conference provided simultaneous interpretations in four languages—English, French, Spanish and Mandarin—for all the presentations, and these interpretations were noted to be excellent.	['I had the great honour and pleasure to represent TESOL and speak at the “International Conference on Language – Enhancing Language Ability and Education for the 21st Century”* held on 5–6 June 2014 in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. The Government of China invited 400 government officials, policy-makers, researchers, educators and development partners, and UN agencies from China and around the world to discuss and reflect on challenges and new approaches for effective language education and planning.\nThe conference focused on the enhancement of language ability and language education for human civilization and social progress. Three themes were addressed:\n- language ability and sustainable social development,\n- innovation in language education, and\n- international exchange and cooperation.\nThe conference was opened by welcome remarks from government leaders of China and UNESCO leaders, and with keynote addresses from national and international experts such as the Director-General of UNESCO, the Vice Premier of the Chinese Government, the Vice Minister of Ministry of Education, and the Director of the State Language Committee of China.\nEleven panels discussed language education issues within the three themes during the 2-day conference. Topics included multilingualism, multilingual education, learners with diverse language backgrounds, Lingua Franca and other languages, language education and educational objectives, improving teacher performance, and so on. The panels presented research, case studies, approaches, and practices, which were followed by discussions with the audience sharing views and experiences on the topics.\nMy Presentation: “Successful L-2 Learning: What We Know”\nI was on the panel presenting and discussing issues on the topic “Successful L-2 Learning: What We Know” with five other panelists from China, Cambodia, Nigeria, UK and Australia. My presentation on innovation in English language education, discussing the integration of experiential learning and e-portfolios into a collaborative professional English curriculum, was well received, and our panel aroused a number of discussion questions from the audience. For details, all the topics and panels can be viewed here.\nA Successful Conference\nThis important government-hosted international event with UNESCO was a big success. It was a very well organized and interactive conference that I had the privilege to participate in. I was impressed with the in-depth and global discussions at the panel sessions and rich conversations throughout the conference as well as the professionalism of the organizers and the enthusiastic support of the student volunteers. The simultaneous interpretations in four languages—English, French, Spanish and Mandarin—for all the presentations were excellent.\nA drafting group composed of rapporteurs from all the presentation panels prepared an outcome statement that summarizes the main discussions of the event.\nKey Discussion Questions for Exploration\nThese key discussion questions from the conference might be of interest for explorations:\n1) Language ability and sustainable social development\n- What are the current understandings of the complexity of language ability?\n- What are critical and analytical perspectives affecting language-in-education policies?\n- What are the new technologies that best foster enhanced and multiple language abilities?\n- What are the thresholds of mother tongue language that foster improved second and third language learning?\n- What is the current state of the art regarding language acquisition in relation to cognitive, mental, and also sociocultural dimensions?\n2) Innovation in language education\n- How can the latest innovations in language education be connected efficiently to curriculum planners, text book writers, and teachers?\n- What are key directions in research on language innovation?\n- What can individual schools and teachers gain from the innovation literature and experience?\n- What are the implications for the future role of teachers as managers of the learning experiences of students?\n- How can national governments and other systems of education foster large scale adoption of promising innovations in language education?\n- What are the most effective means for producing greater rates of success in language learning? What are the implications for teacher education, in-service and preservice, of the technological and other changes that are transforming the communication experiences of young people today?\n3) International exchange and cooperation\n- How can long-term collaborations be best fostered in school and postschool international exchange?\n- What are the best-practice models of language learning that encourage productive international collaboration?\n- Is there a case for a universal language body to foster and guard the languages of the world, and to encourage language study, such as a Global Language Council?\n- Could such a body document global language resources and encourage collective action to preserve the rich variety of the intangible heritage of humanity?\n- What can individual schools and teachers contribute to wider national schemes of exchange and collaboration?']	['<urn:uuid:b67da39a-6e28-40ec-bcda-7abbdd59bea1>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	18	23	755
96	What unique customs and rituals are involved in a traditional Kazakh feast, particularly regarding the serving of tea and the presentation of the sheep's head?	In a traditional Kazakh feast (dastarkhan), tea is served in handle-less cups called pialas and is constantly refilled throughout the meal. The amount of tea served has significance - a half-filled cup is an invitation to continue speaking, while a full cup signals it's time to leave. A special ritual involves presenting a boiled sheep's head (koy bas) to distinguished guests. The honored guest must cut pieces from the head and distribute them to others around the table following traditional symbolism - young people often receive pieces of ear so they may listen well to their elders. The distribution should proceed in age order, starting with the eldest person at the table.	"[""Vast, barren and enigmatic: deserts are among some of our planet's most spectacular landscapes.Read more...\nKazakhstan - Eating and sleeping\nKazakh cuisine is heavily based on the nomadic past of the Kazakh people. It is dominated by meat (especially mutton and horse) and various milk products, many of which have no direct English translation. The techniques of preparation emerged out of the importance of ensuring food preservation: thus, there are many dishes based around smoked meat and soured milk. Meat is an important part of the Kazakh diet, and there are numerous jokes about the legendary capacity of Kazakhs for consuming huge quantities of the stuff (the punch lines tend to be of a ‘right, where’s the main course?’ nature). An invitation to a Kazakh feast provides a great opportunity to try many of the classic dishes of Kazakh cuisine together with the rituals that accompany their apportionment, though most dishes are also available in Kazakh or generic central Asian restaurants.\nA Kazakh feast tends to be referred to as a dastarkhan, actually the name of the low table around which Kazakhs traditionally sat, on the floor or propped up against cushions, to eat their meals. In rural areas, this form of dining is still common; in larger towns, chairs and tables have taken over, at least among wealthier Kazakh families. On arrival, you will find the table already laden with things to eat, typically fruits, nuts and a range of salad dishes. Tea is served into handle-less cups called pialas, and will be constantly refilled throughout the meal, even as vodka toasts are called for, and other drinks, such as kumiss, a drink of fermented mare’s milk, are also passed round. Appetisers are brought out, focused heavily on sliced meats. Pride of place here goes to various sliced sausages made from horsemeat of varying degrees of fattiness: among the most important varieties are kazy, karta and shuzhuk. Th ere may also be a range of pastries on offer, such as a meat-filled variety, samsa, found throughout the region. Kurt, little balls of dried curd, is a salty snack which has the effect of draining all moisture from your mouth. At some point during the meal a dish of kuirdak will be served. This is made from the internal organs of a sheep or other freshly slaughtered animal: these are cut into small pieces, together with lumps of fat from the animal, cooked in oil, and served with onion and pepper.\nBeshbarmak is a traditional nomad dish of finely chopped boiled meat © Nykonchuk Oleksii, Shutterstock\nThe focus of the meal, and the signature dish of Kazakh cuisine, is beshbarmak. The name means, literally, ‘five fingers’, a reference to the traditional way of eating the stuff and not, fortunately, to its ingredients. It is generally served in a large dish, placed in the centre of the table. It involves large lumps of horsemeat or mutton, boiled on the bone, which are scattered across a bed of flat layers of pasta that have been boiled up in broth. Onion cut into rings, garlic and a scattering of parsley and fennel, completes the dish. The broth, sorpa, is served up separately, in pialas.\nBefore the beshbarmak is doled out, one tradition that is often incorporated into such a feast, particularly if there is a distinguished guest to be honoured, is the presentation to that guest of a boiled sheep’s head, or koy bas. Since a foreign visitor may well count as the ‘distinguished guest’, be aware that this could be coming your way. The ritual here is that the guest is given a knife, and cuts off pieces from the head, apportioning them to the others around the table. This is traditionally done by identifying pieces appropriate to individual recipients: thus young people often receive a piece of ear, so they may listen well to their elders. You needn’t worry too much about getting this symbolism right; if you can cut small pieces of meat from the head and apportion them, starting with the eldest person around the table and continuing in approximate age order, you will be considered to have discharged your distinguished guest function well. The lumps of meat on the beshbarmak itself are also distributed on the basis of various traditional customs. Thus, elderly or honoured guests tend to be given meat from around the hip, while it is never done to offer brains to children, for fear that they may become weak-willed, or a knee bone to an unmarried woman, lest she be left on the shelf (given the elbow?). Ak nan, a type of bread flavoured with onion, is often eaten with beshbarmak.\nSweet dishes served after the beshbarmak (though they may have been sitting on the table throughout the meal) include irimshik, which is not actually itself particularly sweet: it’s a dry yellowish/orange dish, made of soured cow’s or sheep’s milk that has been boiled and dried. It is, however, an ingredient of the classic Kazakh sweet, zhent, which also contains millet, sugar, raisins and butter and has a rather powdery consistency. Baursaki, small, spherical, fried doughnuts, have an important place in Kazakhstani culture, and feature in many forms of commemorative and celebratory meals. Fruit will also be served at this time. Do expect the unexpected in a Kazakh feast: the kuirdak is, for example, occasionally served right at the end of the meal, after the sweets.\nThe multi-ethnic character of Kazakhstan and the centuries of trading and interactions along the Silk Routes mean that the cuisine of modern Kazakhstan incorporates a large number of influences alongside those drawn from the nomadic Kazakhs. You will find here some of the dishes popular throughout the region, such as plov, a rice-based dish served with lumps of meat, and pieces of carrot and onion. In Kazakhstan, it is sometimes made in a sweet form, with the addition of dried raisins and apricots. Manty are also popular. These are dumplings, filled with spiced lamb or beef, sometimes with chopped carrot added, and cooked on a steamer. A range of noodle dishes, in particular lagman, are brought from Uyghur cuisine, while shashlik, skewered lumps of various barbecued meats, cooked over hot coals and served with raw onion, is a south Caucasus speciality popular across the region. Korean-style spicy vegetable salads are also found on many menus. Kazakhstan’s large ethnic Russian community has ensured the presence of numerous classic Russian dishes, including salads such as the chopped vegetable in mayonnaise confection described on menus here as olivye but known in western Europe as Russian salad, the ravioli-like pelmeni, sweet and savoury pancakes, or blini, and soups, such as okroshka, a Russian cold soup based on kvass, a fermented beverage made of rye bread, or the traditional Ukrainian and Russian-favourite borscht. In the regions bordering China, traditional Chinese dishes such as noodles and stir fries are also common.\nFuelled by the increasing wealth and aspirations of many Kazakhstanis, a whole range of newer arrivals from around the globe has supplemented these longer-established dishes. Thus, as the Where to eat and drink sections under individual towns make clear, it is possible in the larger cities to find Italian, Mexican, French or Japanese restaurants. Note that in Kazakhstani restaurants side dishes such as vegetables do not usually come automatically with your main dish, and have to be ordered separately. A 10% service charge is typically added. In some top-range restaurants and bars this may be set at 15%. Tipping beyond this is not expected. Many restaurants in Kazakhstan offer a business lunch: this will usually be a set meal or a buffet. These tend to be good value, and are usually served promptly, though they are often fairly unexciting. Restaurants are usually open every day, typically from noon until the last diner has finished up in the evening, though some close for an hour or two mid afternoon. Stolovayas, or canteens, often stay open 24 hours and offer a buffet with a good choice of local dishes for a budget traveller.\nThe drink most closely associated with the traditional Kazakh diet is kumiss, prepared from fermented mare’s milk, and believed by Kazakhs to have numerous health-giving properties, from the stabilisation of the nervous system to the treatment of tuberculosis. In parts of the south and west of the country, including Kyzylorda and Mangistau regions, it is supplanted by shubat, prepared from fermented camel’s milk, whose advocates ascribe it an equally impressive range of curative properties, recommending it for the treatment of tuberculosis, diabetes and stomach ulcers. Both kumiss and shubat have a slight fizzy quality and a sour flavour, and are definitely acquired tastes. A foreign delegation greeted on arrival into Kazakhstan by their Kazakh hosts may well be confronted with a girl in traditional dress holding out bowls of kumiss and shubat, accompanied by baursaki. Less frequently encountered, but rather more palatable for most western visitors, is kazhe, which is essentially shubat mixed with grains, which soften the flavour and texture of the drink.\nAnother important drink for Kazakhs is tea. Green tea is popular, especially in the south of the country, but ‘black’ tea, in other words the standard tea of the English-speaking world, is more prevalent. Ethnic Russians drink this black, sometimes with lemon, but, unusually for the region, Kazakhs traditionally drink their tea with milk. Do not be surprised if your host fills your tea cup only half full: it is an invitation for you to continue speaking. Once your cup is filled, you know it is time to leave. Coffee tends to be hit-and-miss, though there is an increasing range of coffee places offering the cappuccinos and lattes you get back home.\nAlthough some Kazakhstanis refrain from alcohol on religious grounds, the legacy of Tsarist and then Soviet rule has brought with it a tradition of vodka drinking. There are numerous local brands, from expensive varieties such as Snow Queen, which boasts that it has been distilled five times, to cheap and rather unpleasant products. You should avoid the cheapest offerings, particularly from outlets such as kiosks. Kazakhstan also produces a broad range of drinkable if rather sweet brandy, known locally as konyak. There are plenty of Kazakhstani beers: brands to look out for include Beliy Medved, Shymkent and Karaganda. However, in swankier bars and restaurants in Nur-Sultan and Almaty, local beers and spirits do not always feature on the menu, as they have been elbowed out by imported products. Viticulture has also been gaining momentum. Arba Wine have been producing quality wines since 2010 that have regularly won prizes at international fairs. Menus in swankier restaurants in Almaty and Nur-Sultan feature Arba Wine.\nRapid economic growth in Kazakhstan in the early 2000s and increasing interest from foreign investors have transformed the situation with accommodation across the country. In Almaty, Nur-Sultan and the oil-boom towns of the west, smart four- and five-star hotels run by international chains cater to the upper end of the business travel market. Elsewhere, once-shoddy Soviet hotels have been modestly refurbished, and new mid-range ones built, though often in rather bland buildings (frequently faced with silver-coloured metallic-look tiles, for some reason). Middle-class and wealthier Kazakhstanis have also shown interest in smarter accommodation in resort areas, from lakeside hotels around Borovoye to chaletstyle mountain retreats in the Zailysky Alatau. Less fashionable, but equally popular family resort areas, such as Lake Alakol, offer family-run and very reasonably priced bed and breakfasts, while greater numbers of young people and backpackers visiting Kazakhstan, mean that both Almaty and Nur-Sultan now have a good selection of hostels for budget travellers to choose from.\nWhat more authentic Kazakh experience could you have than staying in a yurt? © Maria Oleynik\nAnother budget option are the very basic dorms or private rooms with shared bathrooms, the so-called ‘retiring rooms’ at most of the major railway stations, though it would simply get too depressing to use these for more than the occasional night. Overnight train journeys themselves offer a good deal for the budget traveller, as you get a night’s ‘accommodation’ thrown in with your transport. And at the time of writing there was still to be found in most regional capitals at least one survivor from the hotel styles of the Soviet Union, with a dizhurnaya (a lady in charge of distributing keys and assisting guests) on every floor, clunking lifts and stucco-covered lobbies. The great merit of these places is that they invariably offer a wide range of prices, with at least some budget-end rooms with worn-out parquet floors and tiny wooden beds. Some have now been surprisingly well renovated and maintained without too much of an upward effect on the prices.\nCamping in the wild, including those national parks that do not have strict restrictions in place, is usually allowed, though as ever choose your site with care, taking local advice. There are also some well-organised camping sites, in particular in the Altai area. Otherwise, homestays are a good option, and locals often rent rooms out in rural areas. The range of NGOs providing such homestays has unfortunately declined, but asking around usually works. It is of course important to inspect the room on offer before agreeing to stay. Alternatively, Eco Centre in Almaty can help in finding a suitable homestay accommodation option.""]"	['<urn:uuid:ea8b99bc-bf2e-4c04-9ad1-ded19767b28f>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	25	112	2213
97	as neuroscientist studying brain development how does early social experience affect brain architecture permanently	Early social experiences have significant impacts on brain architecture, particularly in the prefrontal cortex. Research shows that the physical structure of the brain is malleable to social experience during specific critical periods. In mice, social isolation during a critical period leads to permanent changes in myelin-producing cells (oligodendrocytes) and myelin sheaths. These structural changes persist into adulthood and affect functions like working memory and social interaction, even if social conditions improve later. The prefrontal cortex, which regulates social interaction, impulse control, planning, and decision making, doesn't fully mature until the early twenties.	['Have you ever wondered how the social experiences you had early in life affected the way your brain developed? How was your cerebral architecture influenced by the games of ‘peek-a-boo’ your parents played with you as a toddler or the exciting games of hide-and-seek you played with the neighborhood kids? How would we be different if we were deprived of these experiences due to parental neglect or social isolation? Is it possible that early life experiences shaped the way we perceive the world in adulthood, as well as determined our capacity to learn and remember? And if so, what are the physical substrates for these processes?\nIn the quest to understand the interplay between social experience and brain development, scientists have successfully applied a reductionist approach to unravel important details. Makinodan et al. published a remarkable set of experiments in the September issue of Science showing how the pattern of myelination in the prefrontal cortex of mice is sensitive to the social environment of the mouse during a temporally restricted “critical period” (postnatal days 21 to 35, which is comparable to childhood and adolescence in humans). The experimenters compared the medial prefrontal cortices of mice that spent two-week intervals in the following three social contexts: an isolated environment (single mouse per standard cage), a regular environment (four mice per standard cage), and an enriched environment (a larger cage with eight mice and novel objects). This brain region has been shown to be important in regulating social interaction, impulse control, planning, executive function, and decision making in humans. It’s also one of the last regions of the brain to completely develop; it doesn’t fully mature until the early twenties.\nThe researchers found that the morphology of the myelin-producing cells (oligodendrocytes) in the prefrontal cortex varied drastically depending on the social environment of the mouse. More specifically, mice that spent the duration of the critical period in isolation had thinner myelin sheaths and simpler oligodendrocyte branching patterns than mice raised in either of the other two environments. Importantly, this effect was not observed if mice were housed in isolation after, but not during, the critical period (after postnatal day 35). This study went on to show that when mice are deprived of social interaction during this critical period, they display deficits in working memory and social interaction tasks in adulthood, regardless of the social environment they experience as adults.\nIt is amazing to see how the social environment of an adolescent organism can have such drastic effects on the structure and function of the adult brain. The fact that the physical architecture of the brain is malleable to social experience is intriguing, to say the least! It is cool to think that the vestiges of our childhood adventures are not limited to photographs and mental imagery, but that a footprint of the experiences we shared with our friends has been left in our brain’s physical make up.Makinodan M., Rosen K.M., Ito S. & Corfas G.

98	I'm researching religious calendar systems and noticed something interesting - could you explain the difference in how the dates are determined for Easter versus Yom Kippur in relation to their respective religious calendars?	Easter's date is determined based on the lunar calendar and spring equinox - specifically, it falls on the first Sunday following the first full moon after the spring equinox. This means the date changes each year, but maintains its relationship to other related events like Good Friday, which is always the Friday before Easter Sunday. In contrast, Yom Kippur has a fixed position in the Jewish calendar, occurring 10 days after Rosh Hashanah. For example, in one year it began at sunset on October 11 and lasted through October 12. While both holidays follow lunar-influenced calendars, they operate on different systems for determining their dates.	['What is the most significant occasion in Christian customs? Many individuals may state Christmas, on which Christians praise the introduction of Christ, however that is not it. The most significant Christian occasion is really Easter, commending the restoration of Christ, the supernatural occurrence whereupon the Christian confidence was established. In any case, Easter isn’t a segregated occasion. Most Christian places of worship celebrate different minutes paving the way to Easter also.\nPresently, Christians observe Easter on the principal Sunday following the main full moon after the spring equinox. That implies the date of Easter, and its previous occasions, change each year, however not according to one another. One of the more significant of the first occasions is Good Friday, the day on which Christ was killed, commended the Friday before Easter Sunday. For what reason do Christians call such a dull day ‘Great’? To get that, we will need to talk a little religious philosophy.\nGood Friday of History\nTo honor the torturous killing of Jesus Christ and his end at Calvary, Good Friday is commended as a Christian strict occasion. The occasion occurs during Holy Week and is considered as a piece of Paschal Triduum on the Friday that proceeds Easter Sunday. Great Friday is otherwise called Black Friday, Great Friday or Holy Friday. Great Friday is a national occasion in numerous nations around the globe, particularly in the Anglican and Catholic countries. This serious day is seen by fasting and afterward with grave parades.\nGood Friday of Celebration\nOn the off chance that you’ve at any point been around a Christian church on Easter, you may see the for the most part bubbly demeanor, the music, the splendid hues, and so forth. It’s intended to feel cheerful and confident. Is that how Christians observe Good Friday as well? In reality, no. Great Friday is generally celebrated with supreme seriousness, loaded with dull hues, solemn reflection, and a practically melancholy disposition. Why? Indeed, present day Christians know how the Crucifixion turned out at last, yet the demeanor is intended to grasp the dread, distress, and melancholy of the followers who watched Jesus kick the bucket and didn’t have the foggiest idea what was to come. On Good Friday, Christians grieve the demise of Christ; at that point commend the restoration on Easter.\nWhat do People on Friday Day\nNumerous individuals in various nations praise the commemoration of Jesus Christ’s torturous killing, and demise on the Friday before Easter Sunday. This is a recognition that includes individuals fasting and supplicating. Many community gatherings are held toward the evening, for the most part around early afternoon or noontime to 3pm, to recall the hours when Jesus held tight the cross. Numerous places of worship additionally watch the day by re-sanctioning the parade of the cross as in the custom of the Stations of the Cross, which delineates the last hours of Jesus’ life. Parades are held in numerous nations, for example, India, Italy, Malta, the Philippines, and Spain.\nKites that are regularly high quality are flown in Bermuda on Good Friday to symbolize the cross that Jesus kicked the bucket on, just as his climb into paradise. This custom goes back to the nineteenth century. Places of worship in nations, for example, Belgium and Mexico, are hung in dark on Good Friday in memory of Jesus’ enduring on the cross. The day is grave and a general quality of misery is felt in numerous towns and towns. Numerous Christians in Poland quick on dry bread and broiled potatoes. Egg enlivening is likewise part of the Easter arrangements in Poland and numerous different nations.\nFriday day of Symbols\nGreat Friday is commended in memory of Christ’s Passion, execution, and demise. The most significant Good Friday image is the cross, or cross, which speaks to the manner by which Jesus kicked the bucket. A few crosses bear a figure of Christ. Different images of Good Friday incorporate dark material used to cover the cross, works of art and statues in houses of worship and a few homes to mean grieving. What’s more, a few people purposely make an uncovered appearance in their homes and houses of worship by evacuating all blossoms and sparkling articles.', 'What’s Yom Kippur about exactly?\nYom Kippur is the Day of Atonement, when we ask forgiveness for the wrongs we have committed over the past year. Jewish tradition believes that on this day God places a seal upon the Divine decrees affecting each person for the coming year. Traditionally, Jews fast on this somber day and also refrain from other bodily pleasures.\nHow long does Yom Kippur last?\nYom Kippur, which falls 10 days after Rosh Hashanah, lasts one day. This year it begins at sunset on Tuesday, Oct. 11 and lasts through Wednesday, Oct. 12. The fast itself lasts 25 hours, from just before sunset on Oct. 11 until just after sundown on Oct. 12.\nWhy do people fast on Yom Kippur?\nYom Kippur is the day on which we are instructed to divorce ourselves as completely as humanly possible from the mundane world in which we live, in order to devote ourselves with all our hearts and minds to our relationship with the Divine. Fasting is the most widespread manifestation of this devotion. Other examples include: refraining from washing, sexual relations, and the wearing of leather (a sign of luxury in earlier times).\nDo children have to fast? Is anyone exempt from fasting? Can I at least drink water?\nTraditionally, Jews are not required to fast until they reach bar/bat mitzvah age (12 or 13), and children under the age of 9 are not allowed to fast. People for whom fasting is a health risk, along with pregnant and nursing women, are also exempt. The fast includes abstaining from water, but, again, only if doing so does not pose health risk. For tips on fasting without jeopardizing your health, click here.\nI heard it’s OK to wear sneakers to services. Is that really true?\nYes, many Jews wear sneakers, or white athletic shoes, on Yom Kippur. That’s because of a desire to avoid leather (a sign of luxury in early times) and the tradition of wearing white, as a symbol of purity.\nWhat prayers are unique to Yom Kippur?\nThe evening of Yom Kippur begins with Kol Nidre, a prayer that is repeated three times and asks that all vows and oaths that we have made throughout the year will be forgiven, so we can start the new year with a clean slate. Another major prayer is the Vidui, or confession, which includes Ashamnu and Al-Chet, prayers which list all the sins individuals in the community have committed.\nWhat parts of the Torah are read on Yom Kippur?\nOn Yom Kippur, congregations traditionally read a passage from Leviticus about the sacrificing of a goat (the origin of the term scapegoat). The Reform movement has replaced that reading with one from Deuteronomy on human freedom to make moral choices. In addition to these readings from the Torah (the five books of Moses) on the afternoon of Yom Kippur it is customary to read the Book of Jonah, from the Prophets section of the Bible.\nWhat’s this I keep hearing about the Yom Kippur breakfast? I thought people skipped breakfast on Yom Kippur.\nA break-fast is an informal meal in the evening, after the Yom Kippur fast has ended. In the United States break-fasts tend to resemble morning breakfast (or at least brunch) in that they tend to be dairy (rather than meat) and to include bagels, cream cheese, smoked fish, salads and sandwich fillings like cheese, tuna salad and egg salad. Here are some recommended recipes.\nHow do I greet people on and before Yom Kippur? Since it’s such a somber holiday, saying “Have a good holiday,” or “Happy Yom Kippur” seems awkward. And are there any other special words or phrases I need to know?\nYou can say, “Have an easy fast” or “gmar hatima tova” (may you be inscribed for a good year.) It’s also acceptable to say “shana tova” (happy new year). As for other words and phrases for the holiday, check out our glossary for Yom Kippur. (We also have ones for Rosh Hashanah and Sukkot.)\nPronounced: MITZ-vuh or meetz-VAH, Origin: Hebrew, commandment, also used to mean good deed.\nPronunced: TORE-uh, Origin: Hebrew, the Five Books of Moses.\nPronounced: yohm KIPP-er, also yohm kee-PORE, Origin: Hebrew, The Day of Atonement, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar and, with Rosh Hashanah, one of the High Holidays.']	['<urn:uuid:41732979-0e3a-40aa-a446-906947eeaa57>', '<urn:uuid:81f21fef-b222-4f67-a740-c556bffd2c0a>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	33	105	1422
99	What's harder to maintain: gutters or solar panel surfaces?	Solar panel surfaces are harder to maintain, requiring regular cleaning with soft cloths or wash rags using biodegradable soap, plus monitoring for fractures, scratches, corrosion, moisture penetration and browning. Gutters mainly need seasonal cleaning to remove leaves and debris, particularly in autumn, with additional attention during winter freeze-thaw cycles.	"['It can be quite disconcerting to a homeowner to find water in the basement. If you determine that this water is coming into your home from outside — rather than from a plumbing leak, for example — you’ll need to explore ways to prevent this seepage in the future and keep your basement dry. Once you know of a water problem in your basement you’ll have to disclose this trouble when you’re ready to sell in the future, so do yourself a favor and fix the problem, correctly, as soon as possible. Here are some steps to take to address water leaking into your basement.\nAdjust Your Downspouts\nEven on a small home, the roof collects a significant amount of water every time it rains. Some estimates say that an inch of rain is equivalent to approximately 550 gallons of rainwater on a 1000 square foot roof. This water has to go somewhere, and you don’t want that to be anywhere near your home’s foundation. The gutter system around the edges of your roof directs all the collected rainwater into your downspouts. It’s important that your downspouts are kept in good condition, and that they’re long enough to deposit water far from your home.\nGutters and downspouts can also become clogged with leaves and other debris, particularly in autumn, which will necessitate seasonal cleaning. Snow and ice can also pose problems in the wintertime, causing problems during freeze and thaw cycles. If you’re not sure how well your downspouts are designed, or if you suspect they’re causing you water problems, bring in an expert to perform some necessary downspout maintenance as soon as possible. Hiring a professional to clean out your gutters and downspouts is a great option, especially if your home has two or more stories. You may find that cleaning your downspouts and correcting their placement fixes the majority of your basement wetness issues.\nDetermine the Water Source\nOnce you’ve adjusted your downspouts as needed, keep an eye on your basement. If that wasn’t sufficient to completely solve your basement water problem, you’ll need to determine where else water is infiltrating your basement. Water may seep into your basement through cracks and seams in your concrete or cinderblock walls. It’s also possible that water is getting in around window wells and plumbing access points that are not completely sealed. Repairing any imperfect seals is a great next step in your basement waterproofing project. You might also use hydraulic cement to patch cracks in your basement walls.\nKeeping water away from your basement walls on the outside of your house is a good way to reduce in-leakage as well. Moving your downspouts was one part of that solution, but it’s also important to grade your landscaping away from your home. Whether you have a lawn, garden plants, or hardscape up against your foundation, everything should be sloped downward away from the house to help water run off into the soil in your yard rather than pooling near your foundation.\nIn extreme leakage cases, foundation contractors can install an exterior drain tile system around the perimeter of the basement walls. This is an expensive project, as it involves deep excavation all the way around your house to allow for the installation of a perforated drain pipe at the basement footing level, which is below the floor of the basement.\nConsider Interior Drainage Solutions\nCompanies that specialize in basement waterproofing systems can install drain tile systems inside the basement, which is considerably less expensive than excavating around the basement exterior. These systems are designed to capture water that comes into the basement at the joint between the walls and the floor. If you have cinderblock walls, they will also collect the water that gets caught in the hollow portions of the block and move it out of the house before it can leak through the walls into the basement.\nInstalling an indoor tiling system involves breaking away the concrete around the entire interior perimeter of the basement. Perforated pipe is placed in these newly create trenches, which are then backfilled with gravel. New concrete is poured to cover the entire system and make the floor complete again. Access pipes are located periodically throughout the system to allow easy cleaning in case the drain pipes get clogged. All of these new pipes direct water to a floor tank, which is then purged periodically by a sump pump.\nWith a system like this, be sure to use a marine grade backup battery on your sump pump in case of power failures. Rainstorms are a frequent cause of power outages, and you want to be sure that your drainage system continues to work when a heavy storm hits. A sump pump alarm is another good failsafe tool. If the water level in your floor tank becomes too high, indicating your pump did not empty the system when it should have, you’re alerted before the problem becomes too large. It could be a failed electrical connection or a problem with the pump’s float. Whatever it is, this alarm gives you the chance to fix the problem and get the system working again quickly.\nFinding water in your basement can make your heart sink, but knowing what to do to fix the problem will help you get things under control with as little pain as possible. Start with the easy, inexpensive fixes, and add solutions from there as needed to make your basement as dry as possible.', 'A properly installation solar system requires few Solar panel maintenance. However the following maintenance tips you should keep in mind to keep your solar system in good shape.\nSolar Panel Maintenance tips\nA solar energy system requires few maintenance once it has been installed properly.A quality solar system can easily last over 15 years. In fact, solar panels carry a performance warranty of 25 years. With the right care you will be guaranteed of a steady and maximized output over a long period of time.[caption id=""attachment_4951"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""515""] Solar panel maintenance - cleaning of solar panels[/caption]The following solar panel maintenance tips are recommended:\nSolar panel cleaning\nCleaning of the solar panels is easy but labor intensive. It ensures that the solar cells are unobstructed and receive the maximum amount of insolation.Clean solar panels are important to maximize the panel’s energy output.Cleaning the glass on the panels is a simple procedure that can be carried out as often as required depending on how much dirt is accumulating. To clean panels, you can use a soft cloth or wash rag and biodegradable soap.If you are only dealing with dust you can run a hose pipe with water over the panels.\nShading is one of the things you already avoid when you do a proper site analysis during pre-installation.Once the panels have been mounted, you need to ensure shades do not come up such as new towering trees, as this will decrease the amount of energy produced by the system.You do not necessarily have to cut down trees but you can trim them to ensure the panels are not shaded.[caption id=""attachment_4952"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""582""] Solar panel maintenance - ground installation cleaning[/caption]\nMonitor the solar system\nThe only way to detect a problem in the system is to monitor its performance through daily, monthly, quarterly and annual checks.\nDaily solar panel maintenance\nDaily checks should involve monitoring the inverter display to ensure that it is working correctly and that the green light is on, failure to which you should refer to the manual.Also, keep a daily record of the system’s output to be able to monitor performance over a long period of time. Most modern inverter and their monitoring software will do this automatically for you.\nMonthly and quarterly solar panel maintenance\nMonthly and quarterly maintenance checks involve checking the cleanliness of the panels, and accumulation of any dust and debris under and around the PV array.Annual maintenance checks are more detailed and should involve a thorough checkup of the entire system to ascertain that it is working correctly.\nAnnual solar panel maintenance\nSome of the annual maintenance services for solar systems include:\nPerforming a general performance check of the system by reviewing the daily performance data to detect any major changes in output\nChecking the solar panels to ensure that they are clean, free of fractures, scratches, corrosion, moisture penetration and browning.\nCabling should be checked to ensure it is secure and the voltage of strings is within the stipulated tolerance.\nChecking the mounting hardware to ensure it is in good condition and ensuring the earth connection is continuous.\nChecking of junction boxes to ensure there is no water accumulation and that the integrity of lid seals, connections and clamping devices is intact.\nChecking of breakers for any damage, and to verify that the isolation devices are working correctly\nChecking of fuse boxes for water damage and resistive joints on connections\nInspecting the inverters to assess any damage, checking for any resistive joints on connections and verifying the DC voltage coming into the inverter.']"	['<urn:uuid:05496c37-d76f-486a-9806-6fd4b0a30a5f>', '<urn:uuid:fdaeb2b5-dfb2-4b09-9d3b-614ef5f9cdcc>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	9	49	1501
100	industrial applications powerline vs wireless sensors	Both technologies serve different industrial applications. Powerline solutions are used for lighting control in parking lots, industrial signage, and automatic metering of up to 264 power meters. Wireless temperature sensors are particularly useful in applications with moving parts (like rotary ovens), hard-to-reach places (like chimneys), and environments lacking cable infrastructure (like warehouse halls) where traditional wiring would be impractical or could get damaged.

Read the article and find out how they work, where to use them and what issues to think about before buying.\nA wireless temperature sensor is used to measure and transmit temperature information via a digital signal – without the use of cables or wires. The sensor relies on a battery-powered microprocessor that captures temperature information from a nearby area. The device then uses radio waves to transmit this data to a central device.\nThe value measured by the wireless temperature sensor is first transmitted via radio signal to a receiver, such as JUMO Wtrans. From there, the signal can be transmitted in digital or analog form for further processing to various devices such as controllers, automation systems, indicators or recorders, e.g. PLC controller JUMO variTRON 300.\nThe JUMO variTRON 300 central unit can be used as a receiver for JUMO Wtrans wireless sensors. Using a router module, input and output modules can be connected and thus create a complete system with an integrated PLC.\nThe JUMO WTrans B wireless sensor transmits a signal to the receiver. It can then be processed by control devices.\nIn many industrial applications, temperature measurement by the traditional method, based on connecting the temperature sensor by wire to other devices for indication, control, regulation or data recording, is difficult or impossible. This is due to, among other things:\nthe presence of moving parts that would damage the cables\ndifficult accessibility of measurement sites\nlack of cable infrastructure\nhigh cost of long cable routes\ndifficult accessibility through extreme conditions such as high temperature, pH, pressure, etc.\nIn such cases, an alternative is a wireless temperature sensor, which has no wiring and works on the principle of digital signal transmission from the sensor to the receiver.\nTemperature plays a key role in composting plants, as it kills dangerous organisms. According to the bio-waste regulation, it is required to document temperature measurements for all composting batches. What's more, this data must be available at all times to the relevant government verification body.\nSometimes these measurements are carried out manually by composting plant operators, but this generates high personnel expenses. A better solution is wireless temperature sensors, which provide continuous, non-invasive and direct measurement of the temperature in the treated material and automatic recording of these values.\nWireless temperature monitoring system system in the composting plant with wireless temperature probe and PLC controller\nMeasuring system for a composting plant consisting of wireless wTRANS sensors, receiver and JUMO variTRON 500 PLC controller\nWireless temperature measurement also plays an important role in the food industry. Wireless temperature probes can be found, for example, in:\ntanks with mixtures, e.g. for heating chocolate\nmeat production processes\nIn warehouse halls, there is often no cable infrastructure to connect sensors, so wireless temperature sensors are a suitable solution.\nOther examples of wireless sensor applications include:\nRotary ovens - they have moving parts, so cables of traditional temperature sensors would be damaged\nHard-to-reach measurement locations such as chimneys\nWireless temperature sensors are used in the meat industry in smokehouses and production processes, among others.

If immediate measurement is required, this should be taken into account when choosing a wireless transmitter, as some models may not offer the desired response time.\nRange: The range of wireless sensors varies widely. Some are designed for short-range indoor applications, while other sensors can transmit data to a receiver many kilometers away.\nRegardless of the sensors' capabilities, the range of a wireless signal is always limited by obstacles. Transmission through machinery, walls and structures degrades signal strength and reduces range capabilities. As a result, the range of a transmitter located indoors is usually much shorter than that of the same transmitter transmitting outdoors in a wide field.\nFrequency: European wireless products typically operate at 868MHz or 2.4GHz.\nWhat do you want to measure?\nWhere do you want to install it?\nHow are you going to power it?\nAre there any space limitations where you will be installing it?\nWhat approximate range do you plan to cover with the measurement?\nAt what frequency do you want to operate it?\nInsert your Text here.""]"	['<urn:uuid:d893b4bf-cfc3-4c0e-89fe-77a927bc4c26>', '<urn:uuid:a0a165f9-d2d5-4bbf-94f0-0d642a4eab0b>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T19:20:27.984763	6	63	1380
