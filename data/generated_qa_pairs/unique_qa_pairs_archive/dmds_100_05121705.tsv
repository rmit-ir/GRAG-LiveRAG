1	When did Norvir first become available?	Norvir has been around since 1996, when it was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).	['Norvir, also known as ritonavir, is an HIV medication in the class called protease inhibitors (PIs) that works by preventing HIV from completing the final step in making new copies of itself after it infects the T cell. While it’s not the first PI approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Norvir—which has been around since 1996—is remarkable for both its longevity in the HIV treatment field and for its evolution over time.\nThe History of Norvir as an HIV Medication\nInitial studies showed that Norvir—when combined with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) like AZT, D4T, 3TC, or others—was an effective HIV treatment regimen. In fact, a study of Norvir plus two NRTIs first reported in 1996 was among the first to demonstrate a significant survival benefit associated with the use of a protease inhibitor in combination with older HIV drugs.\nIn those days, there were no single-tablet regimens, so it was the norm to have regimens consisting of multiple medications that had to be taken two or three times daily. In 1996, when Norvir was first FDA-approved, the dosing was six 100-mg soft-gel capsules twice a day—that’s a total of 12 soft-gel capsules daily, taken with food—with a refrigeration requirement to maintain its integrity. It also came in an oral solution for both children and anyone who had trouble swallowing capsules, as well as a powder form. Over time, the pill formulation and dosing fell out of favor due to pill burden, refrigeration requirements, and side effects.\nThe Evolution of Norvir Into a Booster Drug\nIn the 2000s, scientists discovered that Norvir could be used at a much lower dose—as low 100 mg once daily—and paired with another PI as part of a complete antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen. The reason behind this switch was the discovery that Norvir has the ability to block an enzyme in the liver that processes other protease inhibitors. By increasing and prolonging the levels of these other protease inhibitors in the body, it made them work better at suppressing HIV from making copies of itself.\nThis began the concept of “boosting” other protease inhibitors with Norvir, in which the drug was prescribed along with other PIs (like Prezista [darunavir] or Reyataz [atazanavir]) at a lower dose. Not only did this help the other medications work better, but it also reduced their dosing, which had additional benefits: Without Norvir “boosting,” Prezista and Reyataz needed to be taken twice a day. With boosting, they could be taken once a day, at least by people starting a protease inhibitor–based regimen for the first time. Using Norvir as a booster also required a much lower dose of Norvir, which reduced the frequency and severity of Norvir side effects experienced by people living with HIV.\nOne of the most famous and popular pairings of Norvir was with another PI named lopinavir, marketed together with Norvir under the brand name “Kaletra,” which was approved by the FDA in 2000. Kaletra was the first coformulation of two protease inhibitors into a single tablet.\nKaletra became one of the first truly durable “workhorses” in combination ART, demonstrating superiority to other PIs in suppressing viral loads to less than 50 copies/mL (i.e., making a person’s viral load undetectable), as well as showing a higher genetic barrier to resistance compared to other PIs and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). As a result, Kaletra became one of the most popular PI-based regimens for providers and patients alike during the 2000s, and the standard of care by which other ART regimens were often measured.\nNorvir has also been effectively paired with all the other PIs as a boosting medication, demonstrating both durability and effectiveness in sustained viral suppression among people living with HIV.\nNorvir’s Changing Role in Treatment Regimens\nIn 2010, the FDA approved Norvir in a 100-mg tablet form that didn’t require refrigeration and made it much easier for people with busy lives to fit dosing into their schedules.\nNowadays, Norvir’s higher twice-a-day dosing is rarely (if ever) used. As a component of Kaletra and other “boosted” PI regimens, it had enjoyed status as part of a recommended initial combination ARV regimen for patients who are ARV-naive by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Adults and Adolescents with HIV for many years. Over time, however, its utility as part of a boosted ART regimen has taken a back seat to the newer single-tablet regimens and other ART combinations that boast reduced pill burden, durable medications with higher genetic barriers to resistance, fewer side effects, and no need for an additional medication as a booster.\nAdditionally, with the emergence of cobicistat (Tybost) as an alternative HIV medication booster that offers a better side-effect profile, it is clear why Norvir has fallen out of favor as a preferred initial ART medication.\nHow to Take Norvir\nNorvir is FDA-approved in the United States to be taken as part of ART in several ways.\n- Twice a day with food when taken as a 600-mg soft-gel capsule.\n- Twice a day as an oral solution at 80 mg/mL up to 600 mg with food.\n- Boosted 100-mg tablet dosing with other PIs, either twice a day or once daily with or without food.\n- Boosted 100-mg oral powder sachets in suspension, 600 mg twice daily with food.\nThe older, higher dosing of Norvir (capsules, powder, and liquid) is recommended to be taken with food for both absorption and reducing potential side effects. The lower boosted dose of 100 mg, when paired with other PIs, can be taken either with or without food.\nHow Much Does Norvir Cost in the U.S.?\nThe cost of Norvir can range from $278/month for the 100-mg powder or tablet formulation to $1,513/month for the oral liquid solution.\nIf you have insurance, monthly copays for Norvir can typically run between $50 and $100 depending on the plan, though you may qualify for cost-sharing assistance provided by the manufacturer.\nIf you don’t have insurance or your insurance won’t cover the majority of Norvir’s cost (you are “underinsured”), the [patient assistance program](https://www.abbvie.com/patients/patient-assistance/program-qualification/ orvir-program-selection.html) can also help reduce or eliminate the cost, depending on your financial situation.\nThe first generic version of Norvir, sold as ritonavir, became commercially available in the U.S. in early 2018. Today, several generic versions are available, and their average cost is significantly lower than that for brand-name Norvir.\nSide Effects of Norvir\nAs with many ART regimens, there is the potential for mild side effects, particularly when first starting out on meds or switching to Norvir. Most often, the following mild symptoms may occur:\n- Mild rash\n- Upset stomach\nA general rule of thumb is what we call “the two-week rule”—when starting your HIV treatment regimen, give your body about two weeks for it to get adjusted to the medication.\nSometimes rashes, mild fever, joint pain, or other symptoms may happen. This could be related to the medication working and your immune system getting stronger, which can manifest as these symptoms. Keep in touch with your medical team and let them know as you move forward.\nIf, after a couple of weeks, you are still having bothersome symptoms or they are getting worse, let someone from your medical team know so that you can schedule a virtual or in-person meeting to discuss.\nIn this day and age, we have varying options for HIV treatment, and even if a medication worked well for one of your friends, that doesn’t necessarily mean that your body will respond to it in the same way. Speak up, let your provider know, and discuss whether they feel labs are needed and/or recommend switching up your regimen altogether.\nOther Potential Side Effects of Norvir Worth Noting\nThere are very rare concerns of buildup of lactic acid in the blood or liver problems, so pay attention to any new or worsening symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, or unusual muscle aches.\nNorvir has been found to increase cholesterol levels as well as contribute to fat buildup in the back of the neck and/or waistline (lipodystrophy), so watching for body or weight changes is important when on Norvir.\nSide Effects of High-Dose (Older) Norvir\nPerhaps the most striking side effects that have dogged Norvir from the early days of its use in the 1990s are the gastrointestinal ones. Symptoms like abdominal pain, cramping, nausea/vomiting, gas, and diarrhea are commonly noted among people who are on Norvir, particularly at the higher 600-mg, twice-a-day dosing schedule.\nThese side effects often discouraged adherence with Norvir if people were prescribed it by their clinicians and also fostered reluctance to even start it when recommended by providers.\nFortunately, there are more potent ART options today with fewer side effects, and patients often will comment on how much better they feel overall when switching off of an older Norvir-based regimen.\nInteractions Between Norvir and Other Drugs\nAs a boosting medication, Norvir helps other PIs stay in the bloodstream longer, thereby making them more effective at keeping HIV virally suppressed. However, this also means it has the potential to interact with many other medications, when you consider that it blocks one of the proteins in the liver that helps process many common medications. This could cause their drug levels to increase in the body, increasing the potential for side effects.\nCommon medications likely to interact with Norvir include:\n- Steroids like fluticasone (typically found in inhalers for asthma and COPD).\n- Cholesterol medications like simvastatin.\n- Blood-pressure medications like certain calcium-channel blockers and beta blockers.\n- Some antidepressants.\n- St. John’s wort.\nIf you are on Norvir and taking medications for other conditions, make sure your medical provider knows about all the medications you take, in order to help safeguard against potential interactions. The website HIV Drug Interactions has a helpful “interactions checker” where you can review potential interactions between medications you are on. You can also find useful drug-interaction information on the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) website on ART.\nWhat’s the Verdict on Norvir?\nNorvir is an old-school HIV medication from the 1990s that enjoyed an evolution and resurgence in utility in the 2000s due to its effectiveness as a booster medication that makes other HIV drugs work better.\nWhile still used in some settings and circumstances, the ship has sailed on Norvir being incorporated in current ART regimens, particularly for individuals who have recently received a new HIV diagnosis. The combination of gastrointestinal side effects and pill burden is a deal breaker for many, and with the advent of both single-tablet regimens with minimal side effects and other boosting medications like cobicistat that are created in coformulations and single-tablet regimens, it is likely that Norvir’s glory days as a go-to HIV medication are long gone.']	['<urn:uuid:8492981c-122d-4b1b-9f40-8905640738d8>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	6	19	1796

3	compare cost organic products wind energy	Both organic products and wind energy involve higher initial costs. Organic products often cost more due to longer production times, smaller-scale processing, and specific certifications. Similarly, wind energy requires substantial upfront costs ($3,000-$5,000 for home installation) plus permits and maintenance fees. However, both options offer long-term benefits - organic products provide environmental and welfare benefits, while wind energy can reduce monthly utility bills to less than $100 for average household consumption.	"[""As a consumer you may have heard dubious or conflicting statements about organic farming and wondered whether they were true. Read on to find out the answers to some frequently asked questions.\n- Are organic products of the same quality as other food and drink?\n- Do organic products taste different from other food and drink?\n- Do organic products cost more than other food and drink?\n- Is organic farming less productive than conventional farming and does it take up more land?\n- Does the large number of organic logos mean there are no common rules for organic production in the EU?\nAre organic products of the same quality as other food and drink?\nOrganic production methods differ from conventional ones – but the aim is nonetheless to produce top-quality food and drink. Organic produce has to meet the same safety standards as other foods and complies with EU General Food law . The difference is that instead of using chemical compounds to combat pests or weeds, organic farmers use multi-annual crop rotations and resistant varieties to prevent such problems from occurring in the first place. And rather than using artificial preservatives and flavour enhancers, organic processors keep products as fresh as possible by focusing on seasonality and local markets.\nDo organic products taste different from other food and drink?\nSome consumers claim that organic food tastes better, but studies in the EU have so far failed to find any conclusive evidence to back this up. However, organic ingredients are increasingly finding favour with leading chefs, and organic farming offers consumers different varieties of vegetables, fruit and meat. Organic producers do not claim that their products taste better, just that they have an authentic taste because they have been produced in a natural way.\nDo organic products cost more than other food and drink?\nOrganic products often take longer to produce, sometimes need more work, and have to be separated from conventional products. They are processed and distributed on a smaller scale, and are subject to specific controls and certifications. These extra production costs often have to be passed on to consumers for organic operations to be financially viable. However, the higher cost may be viewed as a premium for quality food produced with environmental protection, animal welfare and social and economic benefits in mind.\nIs organic farming less productive than conventional farming and does it take up more land?\nCase studies suggest that with respect to land use, conventional farms tend to have a higher production per surface unit. However, this difference is highly contextual and can partly be attributed to the fact that organic farms in Europe are often located in less favourable environments. Organic production requires more labour than conventional production as well as equal amounts of fossil fuels. Considering several other types of inputs, as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, organic farming aims at being a low input type of farming.\nDoes the large number of organic logos mean there are no common rules for organic production in the EU?\nIt's true that there are quite a few different organic farming logos on food and drink packaging across the EU, including the EU organic logo and the logos used by various EU countries. These highlight organic products and guarantee that they comply with strict EU rules. Although there is an EU-wide system for the regulation of organic farming, well-established national and private logos can continue to be used on product labels."", 'Wind energy is one of the most cost-effective renewable energy sources available. To encourage property owners to make “the switch,” many states offer tax deductions and financial incentives. Yet, you may wonder whether wind energy’s more expensive than it seems.\nPer the U.S. Department of Energy, wind energy costs anywhere from one to two cents per kilowatt-hour after you get a tax credit. The average home consumes about 10,000 kilowatt-hours of energy a month. If operating on wind energy, the utility bill would cost less than $100.\nThere are other things to consider when considering wind energy, including how much it costs to install a wind turbine and what incentives the state offers. Continue reading to learn more.\nHow Much Does It Cost To Install a Wind Turbine?\nThe cost of installing a wind turbine depends on many factors, such as the size of one’s property. It generally costs anywhere from $3,000 to $5,000 to install a small wind turbine for a large home. This could be more or less, depending on pulling permits, requesting permission from the county, and the state’s financial incentives.\nIf you own a large business enterprise, such as a farm, it could cost you anywhere from $15,000 to $75,000 to install wind turbines on your property. Whether this is cost-effective depends on your situation.\nThings To Know About Installing for Wind Turbines\nWhen considering the total cost of wind energy, it’s a good idea to consider the following:\nSome Energy Sources Could Work Better for You\nHowever, if you live in another region (such as Florida), wind energy isn’t as cost-effective. That’s because the state simply doesn’t have as much wind as other states, like the Midwest or the southwestern United States. In that instance, you might benefit more from solar energy.\nWind Energy Can Be Pricey To Get Started\nWhen changing your property’s energy source to wind, you might have to pay for:\n- Permits. You can’t build a wind turbine on your property without notifying the city or county. You might have to present your case to a zoning board, which could incur additional costs.\n- The wind turbine itself. As noted, it can cost thousands of dollars to even install a small wind turbine. Its lifetime cost could depend on whether you pay for the turbine upfront or pay for it on a month-by-month basis.\n- Additional property. You generally cannot have a wind turbine within 150 to 300 meters of your home. This is both for your comfort (wind turbines can get loud) and safety. If you don’t have a property that large, you might have to buy an adjoining lot or additional acres of land.\n- Your home’s “hookups.” Once installing a wind turbine, you’ll have to outfit your home to connect with that system. How much this costs could depend on your home’s age, where you live, and who you’ve purchased (or leased) the wind turbine from.\n- Maintenance fees. If your wind turbines break down (or don’t work as expected), you might have to pay for a specialist to come to assess the damage. This consultation, in addition to the cost of repairs, could add up.\n- Replacement costs. Sources note that your wind turbine’s blades will likely last for 25 to 35 years. At first glance, this might not seem like an issue (after all, 25 years is a pretty long time). Yet, when it comes time to replace those blades, it could be hard (and expensive) to get these replacements. After all, the manufacturer may not make those pieces anymore.\nTax Incentives Could Make Wind Energy Cheaper\nTurboTax notes that as of 2021, you could get a tax credit that covers 30 percent of the cost to install two wind turbines on your property. Your state could provide additional financial incentives.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy notes that when determining what incentives you should receive, the government will consider where you live, the types and number of turbines you’re installing and whether you’re powering a home or business.\nIs Wind Energy Right for Me?\nFrom a purely ecological perspective, switching to wind energy is one of the best things you can do for the environment. From a financial perspective, you’ll have to consider many different aspects.\nPer the U.S. Department of Energy, when contemplating wind energy, you should consider:\n- The size of the system you’ll need\n- Your property and family’s energy consumption habits\n- What you could do to reduce your energy use\n- Where you live\n- How long do you expect to stay at your property\nA Final Word\nOnce up and running, a wind energy system will save you thousands on monthly utility bills. Yet, there are many things to consider. The bottom line is, when wondering whether wind energy is expensive, you’ll have to consider your situation.']"	['<urn:uuid:f12babba-8aba-4519-8ce1-a28fd030ff6e>', '<urn:uuid:614d4a9a-4559-415b-a01f-78402cfca50a>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	6	71	1382
4	As someone managing IT assets, I need to understand both financial tracking and environmental impact - how does gross profit margin calculation work, and what are the main approaches to sustainable data center decommissioning?	Gross profit margin is calculated by dividing the estimated monthly gross profit by estimated monthly sales - for example, if monthly gross profit is $5,500 and sales are $10,000, the profit margin would be 55%. For sustainable data center decommissioning, there are three main approaches: commitment to sustainable end-of-life management to divert waste from landfills, pursuing opportunities for equipment reuse through IT asset recovery, and materials recovery for remanufacturing to reduce reliance on virgin materials.	"['A profit and loss, or P&L, forecast is a projection of how much money you will bring in by selling products or services and how much profit you will make from these sales. In good times, you use it to ensure that there will be enough money coming in to exceed the costs of providing the goods and services so you can make a solid profit. In tough times, your P&L can play an essential role in showing you what kind of a plan you need to return to breakeven, so that you\'ll be able to survive until better times come.\nIf you use accounting software, such as Intuit\'s QuickBooks, Sage\'s Peachtree Accounting, or Accounting Express by Microsoft, it will generate a P&L forecast for you once you enter monthly sales and expense estimates. You can also create your own forecast, using a basic spreadsheet. Just look at the sample P&L below and you\'ll see how to set it up.\nStart by estimating how much you\'ll take in each month during the next six to 12 months. No question, this will be a guesstimate. If you\'re already in business, you can extrapolate from current sales levels and allow for significant seasonal fluctuations and other known variables.\nEXAMPLE: Emme owns and operates a consignment shop that sells gently used clothes for women and children. She buys her inventory from moms who bring in their own and their children\'s clothing to sell. Emme is careful to buy mostly well-known brands (and when possible, high-end ones) that she can sell for a premium.\nEmme was selling $15,000 of clothing per month when the economy took a dive. Sales have been down almost 30% lately, so Emme wants to create a morerealistic profit and loss forecast for the upcoming year. She estimates that she\'ll bring in an average of $10,000 per month in sales over the next year—more at back-to-school time and the holidays, less during the slow summer months.\nNow estimate the monthly cost to you of the goods or services you\'ll sell as part of achieving your sales estimate. These are your variable costs. They\'re called variable, or sometimes incremental, because they go up or down depending on the volume of products or services you produce or sell. (And in retail, they\'re called ""cost of goods."") For example, if you\'re a mail-order business, then the more you sell, the more you\'ll pay for shipping costs.\nOther variable costs include inventory, supplies, materials, packaging, and sometimes labor used in providing your product or service. In the case of services, count labor costs as variable costs only if they will go up or down depending on how many sales you make. For instance, if you have to hire independent contractors or temps to cover busy periods, those labor costs are variable. But if you employ a manager, bookkeeper, or marketing employee, you\'ll have to pay their salaries no matter how much sales go up or down, meaning their wages should be listed under fixed costs (overhead) in Step 4, below.\nEXAMPLE: Emme used to spend more than $6,500 per month to buy used clothing to resell. But because sales have been down so much, she will need less inventory and estimates that she will probably spend only about $4,500 per month.\nNow simply subtract your average monthly variable costs from your estimated average monthly sales revenue to get your estimated monthly gross profit. This number will let you calculate how much of each dollar of sales you get to keep. From that amount, however, you\'ll have to pay for overhead costs; anything left over is your net profit.\nEXAMPLE: Subtracting her inventory costs of $4,500 per month from her sales estimate of $10,000 per month, Emme estimates her new average monthly gross profit will be $5,500. (This is before subtracting her overhead, which is discussed below.)\nYour net profit is the most important number you need to determine. This lets you see whether you\'ll have any money left after paying your overhead costs or, failing that, whether you can at least break even. To arrive at your net profit, make a list of your monthly fixed costs, which are items such as:\nDivide any annual expenses, such as insurance premiums, by 12 to get a monthly amount.\nTo arrive at your monthly net profit (or loss), subtract your average estimated monthly fixed costs from your monthly gross profit.\nEXAMPLE: Over the past year, Emme has been able to pay herself $50,000 from the business, but she knows that with sales dropping this won\'t be possible in the coming year. She guesses she\'ll need to cut her take-home wages to $30,000—and if she can\'t bring home at least that amount for living expenses, she won\'t keep the shop open. So she includes $30,000 in her fixed costs. Emme adds up her total fixed costs, including the following:\n- $1,000 for rent\n- $100 for utilities\n- $4,000 for labor (this includes $12,000 per year for a part-time assistant as well as employment taxes and costs plus $30,000 for her), and\n- $100 for insurance (her annual premium is $1,200), and so on.\n- The total of her fixed costs comes to $5,500 per month. When she puts one month\'s numbers together in a spreadsheet, here is what it looks like.\n|Cost of Goods||4,500|\n|Total Fixed Costs||5,500|\n|Net Profit (Loss)||0|\nWhen you are satisfied with your cost estimates for an average month, fill in estimates for six or 12 months. Then, for each month, subtract your total fixed expenses from your gross profit to get the net profit.\nEXAMPLE: Emme fills in an entire year of sales estimates, with the usual dip in sales she experiences in summer and then upswings in September when the kids go back to school and in December, traditionally her best month. Then, using her estimate of $4,500 in monthly variable costs and her estimate of $5,500 in monthly fixed costs, she comes up with a net profit for each month. Emme notices that in the summer she\'ll lose a little over $1,000 per month for a few months in a row, but will make it back up by December.\n|Emme\'s Profit and Loss Forecast (part 1)|\n|Total Fixed Costs||5,500||5,500||5,500||5,500||5,500||5,500||5,500|\n|Net Profit (Loss)||0||0||0||0||0||-1,100||-1,100|\n|Emme\'s Profit and Loss Forecast (part 2)|\n|Total Fixed Costs||5,500||5,500||5,500||5,500||5,500|\n|Net Profit (Loss)||-1,650||1,100||0||0||2,750|\nCreating this new profit-and-loss forecast lets Emme see that she can\'t count on taking any extra profits out of the business for the next year. And if her sales estimates are too high, she won\'t be able to take home $30,000 over the year for living expenses. She needs to think long and hard whether it makes sense to drain her savings account and continue toiling for a year in the hopes the the economy will rebound soon and allow her to make a good living again from the store.\nIt\'s also useful to know your gross profit margin. Gross profit margin measures the difference between the costs of producing a product or providing a service and what you\'re selling it for. In short, it lets you know how profitable your products and services are.\nTo get your profit margin, divide your estimated average monthly gross profit by your estimated monthly sales.\nEXAMPLE: Emme divides her monthly gross profit of $5,500 by her $10,000 of sales, to get a profit margin of 55%. Now she knows she will get to keep, on average, about 55 cents of every sales dollar she takes in (before paying for overhead).\nProfit margins can be used in many different ways. Some businesses regularly calculate their profit margin to monitor the profitability of their products or services. A decrease in profit margin over time usually means that variable costs have gone up—costs for raw materials, manufacturing, or labor—which should nudge the company to either look for new suppliers or raise prices.\nOther businesses use their anticipated profit margin to help them price products or services (and increase profitability). For example, a business that requires a profit margin of 60% and produces a product that costs $20 to make would set the retail price at around $50 ($20 ÷ (100% - 60%)). (However, some experts disagree with this use of profit margin, recommending instead that businesses start with the price they think customers will pay and then making sure the costs are low enough to make a profit.)\nAnother way to use profit margins is to screen new products and services to sell. For instance, a retail gift shop might decide to add only new products that can be bought and sold at a price that yields a profit margin of 50%.\nWhat\'s a good profit margin? The answer varies across industries. For example, most airlines have low profit margins, around 5%; the software industry has traditionally had high profit margins, around 80%-90%; wholesalers\' profit margins are somewhere in the middle, between 15% and 35%. But without looking at the costs of a company\'s overhead, such as marketing and administration, profit margins don\'t give the whole picture of a company\'s profitability.', 'Reduce your data center’s carbon footprint and support sustainability goals.\nWhite Paper Sustainable Decommissioning\nSustainable Data Center Decommissioning\nThis is a significant time for sustainable development. In a historic 2015 UN summit, the United Nations (UN) member states adopted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.\nOn January 1, 2016 the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) came into force. Later that same year the Paris Agreement on climate change, which addresses the need to limit the rise of global temperatures, was ratified by 175 countries.\nData centers are among the highest consumers of power today. But with the internet of things, growing big data and expanding connectivity, the need for more and more of these facilities is inevitable. Data center sustainability is becoming a priority.Data Center Frontier, April 4, 2019\nThe development of IT is generally seen as a force for good – an enabler toward an equitable and more sustainable world. But data needs are growing, as current estimates disclose:\nIt takes a huge amount of energy to manufacture, install and run global data centers to meet these growing data needs. With more than 7,117 colocation data centers, as well as hyperscale and wholesale data centers in existence, ensuring that data centers are as environmentally sustainable as possible is a concern of growing importance.\nShould a Company’s Data Management be Part of Their Sustainability Conversation?\nAccording to a study, data centers contribute approximately:\nIn fact, several institutions predict that data center energy usage could account for over 10% of the global electricity supply by 2030.\nMany data center users and providers recognize this and are pioneering environmentally responsible data management. According to Data Center Frontier, “the data center industry is focusing on sustainability as never before, with the executive suite and customers aligned on the importance of using renewable energy to power digital infrastructure.”\nSustainability in the Data Center: What does that look like?\nLEED-Certified Data Centers\nLeadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) – developed by the U.S. Green Building Council – is a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of green buildings. LEED has developed a certification for sustainable design and construction of data centers. Less than five percent of all U.S. data centers have LEED certification.\nFacebook, requires that their data centers achieve LEED gold level certification; “With each new data center we build, we add more renewable energy to the grid. And we make sure that all of our renewable energy projects are in the same electric grid as our data centers… our data centers are already 80 percent more efficient than the average data center.”\nCharacteristics of a ‘sustainable’ data center are considered by LEED to have/be;\n- Advanced cooling systems to reduce energy consumption\n- Improved cooling efficiency\n- Reduced energy consumption\n- A clean backup power system (reducing emissions, noise pollution and fuel consumption)\n- Using renewable energy\n- Green construction (recycled materials, reducing distance raw materials move, diverting waste)\n- Intelligent design\nMany data centers looking to improve their green credentials invest in ISO50001 accreditation for Energy Management. This ISO certification supports organizations in all sectors to use energy more efficiently, through the development of an energy management system.\nThe existing accreditations focus on build and in-life use of the data center, none consider end-of-life equipment age and lifespan possibilities or opportunities.\nSustainable Lifecycle Management\nThere are opportunities for data center users, owners and operators to boost their sustainability credentials and offset their carbon footprint by integrating lifecycle thinking into the design, operation and decommissioning of hardware. The opportunities can be broadly grouped as;\n- Commitment to sustainable end-of-life management\n- Opportunities for reuse\n- Material recovery for remanufacturing\nSustainable End-of-Life Management\nData centers can demonstrate their commitment to sustainability by promising to stop throwing away any aging, broken and end-of-life assets and equipment from their facilities. By doing this it diverts waste from landfill and promotes the case for reuse and recycling.\nData centers that make their own custom servers have the opportunity to partner with recycling technicians to consider reuse into their design. This might give their equipment the ability to operate longer, the possibility to be repaired and refurbished easily, and to incorporate only materials that can be recycled without residual materials going to landfill.\nOpportunities for Reuse\nWhen equipment reaches the end of its economical life companies can engage a credible third-party IT asset disposition (ITAD) operator for IT asset recovery. This might involve the recovery, repair, reuse and remarketing of complete units, parts and components, and base materials within the data center environment or outside of it.\nThe first value recovery option is to redeploy whole or part units into a company’s own environment. This can be supported by an ITAD company, such as Sims Lifecycle Services (SLS), that supports decommissioning, data wiping, audit testing, cleaning and redeployment. For data centers this is not just an exercise in sustainability, it is also a way to save money by leveraging reuse and recycling efforts to reduce costs.\nSecond-hand units can be sold into what is known as the ‘second-hand market’. This can be the case for either entire servers, or parts and components. By engaging with an experienced ITAD company like SLS to manage your reuse and resale program you gain control over these units. This gives you the ability to manage this in line with new product launches.\nMaking informed decisions about equipment placed on the second hand market can create an additional revenue stream for a business. At a time when the economical life of a server is ending, ITAD companies help to add market value to a device that has most likely been depreciated to zero on the books. This revenue could then become a budget to help fund more sustainability efforts.\nPulling equipment for redeployment\nReuse allows for cost avoidance opportunities. Redeployment options can feed into repair and manufacturing streams. If an organization manufactures its own custom servers reusable parts can be identified in legacy equipment for the manufacture of new products. Or for any data center operator, reclaimed parts can be deployed into repair centers to support maintenance contracts.\nReuse diverts waste from landfill, reduces the reliance on mining virgin materials and reduces the impact of manufacturing electronics.\nMaterials Recovery for Remanufacturing\nIn addition to reducing carbon emissions from data center energy use, materials recycling can contribute to offsetting the impact of mining virgin raw materials for new data center equipment.\nOne major technology company identified in their environmental responsibility report that “…the carbon footprint of our manufacturing processes represents the largest portion of our impact on climate change. Every year we investigate more deeply into our supply chain, constantly analyzing inefficiencies and developing ways to help our suppliers make less of an impact on the planet.” Many of the resources used to create data centers are finite.\nSpotlight: Recyclable Materials in Data Centers\nOrganizations must make strategic decisions when buying new material, and it starts with their sourcing supply chains. An original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that implements sustainable sourcing and practices is usually favored over one who does not.\nPlastics: Traditional plastics production involves the transformation of petroleum or natural gas into their constituent monomers. The process is highly energy intensive and has been estimated to account for 1 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions. The carbon footprint of recycled plastics is a mere fraction of that of virgin plastics.n of that of virgin plastics.\nAluminum: Traditional aluminum production uses a large amount of electricity to break the bond between oxygen and aluminum in aluminum-oxide. Recycling aluminum saves 90-95 percent of the energy needed to make aluminum from bauxite ore. There is no limit to how many times aluminum can be recycled.\nSteel: Recycling one tonne of steel saves 1,100 kgs. of iron ore, 630 kgs. of coal, and 55 kgs. of limestone. Steel recycling uses 74 percent less energy, 90 percent and 40 percent less water than virgin steel production. It also produces 76 percent fewer water pollutants, 86 percent fewer air pollutants, and 97percent less mining waste.\nThese materials make up the majority of material, by weight, in a typical data center. Additional valuable materials reside within the printed circuit boards (PCBs), processing chips and power supplies within the server units, such as valuable precious metals (i.e. gold, copper and silver).\nGold: One tonne of modern PCBs might contain five ounces (around $6,000 worth) of gold.\nTantalum: This is commonly found in processors and capacitors. Tantalum is a critical raw material with a current end-of-life recycling rate of less than-one percent.\nLead: This is found in batteries in data center universal power supplies (UPS). Lead is highly toxic when disposed of irresponsibly. Professional recycling diverts this dangerous waste from landfill and avoids environmental and human health impacts.\nCopper: This is a key component in wiring and printed circuit boards. Although newer wiring contains less copper than older units, like all metals, copper can be infinitely recycled to avoid raw material mining and reduce energy emissions.\nSome of the minerals used in server production have been identified as conflict materials. These usually involve materials mined in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo and its neighboring countries. Resulting revenues from the purchase of these raw materials are known to be financing, directly or indirectly, armed groups engaged in civil war resulting in serious social and environmental abuses.\nMaterials included in the conflict materials group, known as 3TG, include Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten and Gold. These are all commonly found in data center equipment. Using recycled materials helps divert revenues away from mining enterprises for these conflict materials.\nDiverting Materials From Irresponsible Recycling\nIf not recycled properly, electronic waste can be a serious health and environmental issue. To make a quick profit, unethical recyclers sometimes dump e-waste or use dangerous techniques that can leach toxins and harm the environment. Using a responsible recycler ensures material is diverted from these sites.\nSLS’s Top Advice for Sustainable Data Center Lifecycle Management\n1. Avoid Stockpiling Redundant Assets\nNot only does this monopolize valuable floor space that could be used for revenue generating equipment, but data breach risk aggregates when it is left unmanaged.\nAs equipment is stockpiled, value reduces as assets idle in a dusty corner. While equipment is stored SLS estimates that value reduces 3-5 percent per month. Potential clients may identify this as evidence of weakness in a process and the temptation exists to adopt less secure methods of data destruction. This ultimately increases the risk of a security lapse and decreases the chance to recoup value.\nSupport for a sustainable and environmental reuse and recycling program will likely rely on it also being secure and value-driven. An ITAD and e-Recycling partner should offer a solution that delivers data security and value recovery with equal importance to sustainability.\n2. Follow the Waste Hierarchy: Reduce > Reuse > Recycle\nMost ITAD and e-Recycling partners can support the refurbishment and repair of assets to be redeployed into a company’s own environment.\nReuse of materials or equipment, avoids the greatest amount of energy emissions, and delivers the highest value in many cases. Even if whole units cannot be reused look for opportunities to reuse parts and components.\nEnd-of-life equipment should be recycled. Some ITAD vendors may outsource this service. It is important for Data Center Managers to understand who the recycler is and how equipment will be responsibly recycled to protect their company’s brand reputation.\n3. Think Global but Keep it Local\nIt is always better to have businesses working with vendors that can recycle material in the region where it was collected. Where possible it is better to avoid shipping overseas for disposal. Businesses will need to always seek evidence and assurance that recycled materials are not being dumped in developing countries once handed over to a disposition vendor. This applies to their downstream vendors also, so look for evidence of a robust downstream vendor management system.\nAn operator’s geographical footprint should meet the needs of the company and matches their locations. Recyclers should also be able to offer a full range of lifecycle management services – IT asset disposition and e-Recycling.\n4. Enforce Accountability\nSetting targets for a company’s end-of-life data center equipment sustainability goals is a great way to set forth some accountability. It is helpful for many to share their goals with the organization, and measure progress against them. Examples of goals might include:\n- What percentage of equipment do you want to redeploy, reuse and recycle?\n- What is the ambition for energy and emissions avoidance? (This goal might be considered as a percentage of the footprint from data usage – offsetting the impact)\n5. Choose the Right Partner\nSustainability credentials should not be the only determinant in a partner choice. It is recommended to look for a financially-stable company, with experience and the ability to produce references from reputable organizations. Once it has been established that a chosen vendor has the ability to deliver, check that their ethics and values match as well to create the best possible partnership.\n6. Talk About it!\nCelebrate what you do. Managers should talk about their sustainable and secure ITAD and e-Recycling programs and use it as a sales tool. Look for a company that provides sustainability certificates and the ability to demonstrate an organization’s contribution to environmental protection goals.\nThe Time for Change is Now\nCompanies are starting to take responsibility for their brand by facilitating a closed-loop program that contributes to the circular economy. This supports the drive to address global resource scarcity by facilitating this urban mining of valuable and scarce materials.\nAs the data center industry continues to grow, it is necessary for more data centers to integrate reuse and recycling programs into their process to help minimize e-waste volumes by diverting waste from landfills. Green data centers can reduce the environmental impact of their data consumption and increase the productivity of their data center assets. In addition, they can reduce the social impact of their data usage by lowering their organization’s reliance on conflict materials, and minimizing their risk of irresponsible recycling of equipment in the informal recycling sector.']"	['<urn:uuid:1da15299-d1d1-42f3-906a-216e065915a4>', '<urn:uuid:ddb6540e-7370-40bf-be20-dd45f0ec530f>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	34	75	3866
5	How much food could be produced on Oxfordshire's available land, and what environmental benefits could this land provide through natural infrastructure schemes?	In Oxfordshire, just one Oxford college owns enough land to produce over 50% of Oxford's vegetable consumption, while the Church Commissioners own enough land to produce more than twice the county's annual vegetable needs. Beyond food production, this land could be used in Natural Infrastructure Schemes to provide environmental services like natural filtration and flood risk management, which are often cheaper than hard engineering solutions and could help reduce the £2.4 billion annual cost of river flooding and water contamination.	"['Sandy Lane Farm in Oxfordshire. Credit: Nina Osswald\nThis research focuses on how land might be made more accessible to promote a diverse, resilient, local food system in Oxfordshire. It focuses on the County Farm Estate, other land in the County and District Councils’ portfolios and privately own land and it considers alternative ways that land can be made accessible to provide opportunities to grow food for local communities. Land alone is not sufficient for building a resilient local food system. Attracting new entrants will require sufficient training and support, access to capital, appropriate infrastructure and reliable routes to market.\nSome of the key findings include:\n- Oxfordshire’s County Farm Estate is comparatively small but has huge potential to be diversified by reallocating arable land to grow fruit and vegetables: repurposing only 8 per cent of the estate to polytunnel or glasshouse horticulture would provide 10 per cent of fruit and vegetables for the county – a significant contribution to the resilience of local supply.\n- There are many ways of managing a County Farm Estate to provide a range of benefits, from a return on investment of 5 per cent, to attracting innovative, entrepreneurial farmers to contributing to multiple Council objectives from climate change to education and public health.\n- County Farms provide opportunities to new entrants that are not available on the private market.\n- There are holdings within the County and District Councils’ land portfolios with the potential to be repurposed for food production.\n- There are alternative models to County Farms that could improve access to land for local food production, such as Community Land Trusts and FarmStarts.\n- Just one Oxford college owns enough land in Oxfordshire to produce over 50 per cent of Oxford’s vegetable consumption, or over 10 per cent of the entire County’s.\n- The Church Commissioners own enough land in Oxfordshire to produce more than twice Oxfordshire’s annual vegetable consumption.\n- Just half a 5-a-side-football pitch per school in Oxfordshire could grow a portion of vegetables for every pupil each week.\nAs next steps, Good Food Oxford propose a collaboration with the County Council to:\n- Identify local authority policies and plans into which food production and access can be integrated.\n- Review the County Farm Estate management plan to consider synergies with other Council policies and strategies, the viability of restructuring the County Farm Estate to include more fruit and vegetable production and to provide appropriately-sized starter and progression farms.\n- Consider potential of reallocating portions of landholdings for food production using alternative models of ownership and tenancy such as selling the land to a community land trust, granting a farm business tenancy to a CIC FarmStart or granting a temporary lease for a community growing project.\n- Engage with Good Food Oxford and other strategic partners to identify potential buyers/tenants, existing frameworks such as the Oxford Community Land Trust’s legal frameworks, potential opportunities such as Oxford Mutual Aid as a reliable route market and established projects who may be interested in expanding, for instance Cultivate and Oxford City Farm.\n- Engage with other key landowners to explore further opportunities for local food production.\nGood Food Oxford and Oxford Community Land Trust co-hosted an online event to present the report and discuss its findings with key stakeholders and the local community.\nThe full report is available on the Good Food Oxford website.\nSustain are encouraging more areas to launch Veg Cities campaigns and get local businesses and organisations making veg pledges. Veg Cities is a campaign of Sustainable Food Places and is run in partnership with Peas Please.', 'Farmers could benefit from a new scheme to direct millions of pounds towards farming methods that reduce flooding, provide clean water and restore wildlife, according to a new report from Green Alliance and the National Trust published today.\nGreen Alliance and the National Trust have proposed a new model for green farming, which it is hoped will create new markets for sustainable land management. Under the scheme groups of farmers working together would sell flood protection and clean water to water companies and public authorities downstream.\nCalled Natural Infrastructure Schemes, the new model could see savings for organisations currently facing high costs from poor water quality and flooding.\nGreen Alliance calculates the cost of river flooding and water contamination to water companies, local authorities, public agencies and infrastructure operators at just under £2.4 billion a year. Contracting to avoid just a quarter of these costs could release as much as £120 million for each of England’s 100 catchments over a 20-year catchment scale scheme.\nSue Armstrong-Brown, policy director at Green Alliance, said: “The old CAP subsidy-and-grant approach is inadequate to deal with the pressures on land and the realities of farm economics. The potential market for environmentally-beneficial farming could be worth millions – far more than the £400million available to farmers through government agri-environment schemes. We need to make farming part of the way the environment is returned to health, and that means making good environmental management pay.”\nGreen Alliance and the National Trust will be working alongside leading landowners and businesses over the next 12 months, preparing to introduce pilot Natural Infrastructure Schemes in the UK.\nToday’s report follows the National Trust’s call in August that restoring the natural environment should be at the centre of any replacement to the Common Agricultural Policy. The conservation charity believes a focus on protecting and enhancing the ‘natural assets’ on which food production depends will open farming to new environmental markets that make it profitable and rewarding to manage land sustainably.\nPatrick Begg, rural enterprises director at National Trust, said:\n“Farmers should be paid fairly for producing great food in a way that supports the long term health of our farmland. The Natural Infrastructure scheme is about creating a market for services from farming that today go unrewarded - reducing flood risks, improving water quality and creating homes for wildlife, while at the same time opening up new revenue opportunities for farmers.”\nWelcoming the report, Christopher Price, director of policy at CLA, said:\n“Every day, alongside agricultural production farmers and landowners deliver valuable environmental services such as reducing flood risk and helping tackle climate change. If we can connect, via markets and incentives, those who benefit with the land managers who do the work then there is a real opportunity to grow this type of work and to amplify the benefits it delivers. We welcome this useful contribution to the important natural capital discussion and we look forward to working with Green Alliance, the National Trust and other groups to explore opportunities for further investment in environmental services.”\nAngela Francis, senior economist at Green Alliance, said:\n“In many places natural filtration and flood risk management are already cheaper than hard engineering. Once you have a good that can be supplied for a price that a buyer wants to pay, you have a market. Natural Infrastructure Schemes put these factors together and provide an opportunity for us to start restoring nature now.”\nThe Natural Infrastructure Scheme could benefit upland farmers who are struggling to make ends meet.\nChris Clark, who farms at Nethergill Farm in the Yorkshire Dales, said:\n“As we prepare to leave the CAP, diversifying how we make money from our land makes good business sense. Setting up marketing groups for our green services would offer a great deal for farmers and for our customers. The appetite exists for doing things differently, if we can make it pay.”\nThe report will be launched this morning at the Royal Society in central London. Representatives from business, local government and the third sector will debate how natural markets can benefit businesses and the environment.\nSpeaking at the event will be David Elliott, group strategy and new markets director at Wessex Water.\nAhead of the event, David Elliott said: “Water companies understand the value of resilient catchments for our business and our customers. We are already exploring long-term partnerships with our upstream farmers. Building markets for natural infrastructure would be a significant step towards bringing these approaches into the mainstream.”\nAngela Francis, senior economist, Green Alliance (available for interview)\nemail@example.com 020 7630 4526\nTo attend the 28 September event at the Royal Society, please contact Elena Perez, events manager, Green Alliance\nfirstname.lastname@example.org 020 7630 4520\n The report, New markets for land and nature: How Natural Infrastructure Schemes could pay for a better environment, is published today by Green Alliance.\n The Natural Infrastructure Scheme (NIS) is an area-based market in avoided costs, delivering environmental improvements by bringing together groups of land managers to sell ecosystem services to groups of beneficiaries. It has the following features:\n- It is farmer-led: Farmers and land managers are put at the forefront of developing and designing the scheme, which opens up a wider potential for delivering ecosystem services alongside other income streams.\n- Payments incentivise change: Long term and signiﬁcant scale contracts move ecosystem services from a peripheral activity to something that could fundamentally change land managers’ approach to farming.\n- It is designed for catchment scale delivery: Co-ordinated land manager intervention enables the NIS to deliver a solution that reduces costs downstream for organisations facing increasing flood and water pollution problems.\n- It sells a service based on results: Contracts are speciﬁed around solution delivery, within deﬁned limits, that land managers, who own the assets, are responsible for delivering.\nResearch also demonstrates that natural pest management, pollination, nitrogen capture, and precision technologies, make it possible to reduce chemical inputs, lower costs and maintain yields.\n Contracting to avoiding just a quarter of these costs would release up to £575 million a year. The market in avoided costs would release around £6 million a year for each of the 100 catchments in England, enough to support a 20 year £120 million investment in upstream catchment management. Source: New markets for land and nature: How Natural Infrastructure Schemes could pay for a better environment.\n In a speech in August at Countryfile Live, National Trust Director-General, Dame Helen Ghosh, called for a farming subsidy system that rewards farmers for managing land in a way that delivers a range of public benefits, securing the long term health and productivity of the land on which our farming depends.

6	essential elements writing good book introduction beginning story	When writing a book introduction, avoid starting in the middle of the story. Instead, step back to what you knew before your current knowledge, and then go back even further. Don't assume readers have specialist knowledge. Begin by presenting your overarching question, then give readers a preview of what's coming. Finally, guide readers through the introductory information they need to understand why the question matters and what's at stake. Only after this proper preparation should you proceed with the main content.	['What Are Book Editors Looking for?\nChronicle of Higher Education, July 21, 2006\nBy Dedi Felman\nAs an editor for a major publishing company, I am occasionally asked to give talks on what editors are “looking for” in books. It’s always struck me as a curious question. It presumes that we know what we are looking for; that blessed with foresight, we anticipate the Next Big Thing and then instigate a full-bore search for the perfect prepackaged book and author.\nNot unheard of, I suppose. But much more often we wander, slightly dazed, through campus visits or a steady stream of summer submissions, hoping that good ideas and even better writers will find us — and that we will find them. Then, once we’ve located the creative kernel or thinker that sets us popping, an even-longer negotiation usually ensues over how exactly to get from idea to book.\nDespite the latest headlines about Google Print or the e-book, our mission remains remarkably stable. We’re looking for the same thing we’ve always looked for — solid, readable, provocative, and important works of scholarship with clear ideas at their core. And if you know some of the basics of good writing, you have already improved your starting score.\nWhat do you need to know when approaching a publisher? The first thing to remember is that all editors are different: We work in various divisions of different-sized companies with different mandates. We come from different backgrounds (some with advanced degrees, some without); we’ve set up different series and carved out different niches in the field. Our tastes vary widely. Some of us go wild over a rich and textured narrative. Some of us prostrate ourselves before the altar of “the big idea.” Some of us live to hoist yet another plaque onto the house’s prize-lined walls, some of us simply want a paycheck, and some of us want it all. So find the editor most likely to get enthusiastic about your work. Then listen to that editor’s advice.\nTo get you started, here are some basic first steps.\nIdentify the question driving your book. What is it about? Before you got lost trying to track every bit of information that exists on your topic, you had a question. Reclaim it.\nAre you wondering what social conditions led hundreds to die in a heat wave? (See Eric Klinenberg’s Heat Wave.) Are you wondering whether the media stereotypes about black men — their morality, their civility, or lack thereof — truly hold up? (See Mitchell Duneier’s Slim’s Table.)\nThe central question that you started with could become the beginning of a narrative that documents change, one that contradicts conventional wisdom, or one that merely explains. But rediscover your starting point and write it down, using no more than a few sentences to explain what motivated you, and now your book.\nIdentify why that question matters. The next key to your success lies in that well-oiled mantra from elementary school: Who cares? If you can’t tell your reader why they should care, you probably don’t have a question that motivates an entire book.\nThat’s easier to do in some cases than in others. We know why we should care about global warming or suicide bombing. Even if we’re not historians, we can see why gaining a clear understanding of the aftermath of the Civil War matters. It’s a lot harder to show why people should care about what Spinoza said (although Matthew Stewart in his recent work The Courtier and the Heretic did just that).\nStill, you know why you cared. And if you can sniff out what interests people when you explain your project to them and build on that to tell us why it all matters, you’ve got a question that can sustain a reader’s interest for 300 pages.\nCreate a narrative structure. Or, how to think like an architect. First and foremost, your book needs a logical architecture or frame. And that frame must actually support the house.\nIs your story an academic mystery in which the answer, through a steady accumulation of evidence, will gradually be revealed? Or perhaps it’s a dramatic conflict with two plausible storylines (yours and the conventional wisdom?) battling it out until a deus ex machina comes on stage to resolve all? Or a chronological narrative where we come to grasp a shift that has played out over time?\nPrepare an annotated outline of the entire book, including the introduction (how will you grab the reader’s interest?) and the conclusion (where do we go from here?). Then be prepared to justify your building plan. Does Chapter 4 naturally follow from Chapter 3? Perhaps Chapters 5 and 6 should be combined? Are we hearing the same point over and over? If it’s a complicated story, break the book down into three or four basic parts (often, “the what,” “the so-what,” and the “now-what”) and try organizing the chapters from there.\nDon’t cling to your first outline. Put it away for a week, and then re-ask yourself the same questions. Outline it to friends over a few drinks and see if they get it. If not, it could be their inebriation, but more likely, you need to try again.\nMake the story your own. The best books are the ones where writers seized control and told the story they wanted to tell. It’s hard to do that in your first book. Finding your own point of view is a lifelong process, and spelling it out with a distinctive voice and verve often takes a second or third book. But hold the despair. There are steps you can take to hurry the process along:\n- Throw out all traces of the literature review. Yes, you painstakingly put together a comprehensive overview for your committee, but now is the time to find your own voice. Like it or not, a book is an act of ego. Do not quote or explain others’ philosophies at length, or you will put your reader to sleep. Don’t let others grab your center stage.\n- Eliminate those endless block quotes. Never use someone else’s words to make a crucial point for your argument. Quote others when their rhetoric is powerful and you absolutely, positively couldn’t say it better yourself. But in most cases paraphrase.\n- Avoid jargon at all costs. You have probably heard that one before. But doesn’t jargon make me sound smarter? The answer is no. Jargon just makes your prose mushy and obscures your points. Ask yourself if your reader will understand how you are using a word. Then ask yourself if you truly understand how you are using that word. Then get rid of it.\n- Use examples. It’s not just the novelists who know that it’s more effective to show people what you would otherwise tell them. Follow flamboyant or intriguing characters through your narrative. Choose striking metaphors to express your central ideas. Once you’ve alighted on an indelible image or character, remember that your carefully chosen example isn’t superfluous to your argument, it is your argument. Show your reader something they won’t forget. Startle them.\nAvoid Abstraction. I know, I know, you can’t avoid abstraction. But make an effort to unearth the reality that underlies your theory, and return to it as often as you can. Share with your reader the real-life problem that makes your abstract argument concrete. For just two great examples of that, see Michael Walzer’s Just and Unjust Wars or Robert Frank and Philip Cook’s The Winner-Take-All Society.\nUnderstand the true beginning of your story. When it comes to the opening of the book, you must fight the temptation to begin in the middle. Think back to what you knew before you knew any of what you now know, and then back up even further. Don’t start the story where you would if you were talking to the six other people in your workshop who already know the disciplinary questions by heart.\nBegin by asking your overarching question. Then allow the reader a sneak peek of what’s to come. Finally, lead the reader quickly through the introductory information that they need in order to understand why the question matters and what’s at stake. Then and only then, after they’ve been properly prepped, are you ready to let loose.\nUnderstand the end of your story. After all the hard work of plowing through a book, there’s no greater disappointment than to have it drift off, either repeating the themes stated in the introduction or veering into irrelevant tangents.\nSeize the opportunity to point the way forward for the rest of us. If it’s a chronological tale, find the natural ending for the era that you have been describing and an anecdote that expresses the spirit of that point in time. If it’s a policy-oriented work, avoid ending with pie-in-the-sky proposals; tie your suggestions to the actual discussions in the book. If you’ve introduced characters in the book, return to them and wrap up their stories. The best works of both fiction and nonfiction open up worlds and ideas even as they tell a story that has a definite end.\nBe fair. We live in a time when bestsellers engage in shouting matches and have titles like Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them. But I’m a respectable scholar, you protest. I’m nothing like those pop polemicists. You may not think you are, but are you examining the unquestioned and thickly encrusted crevices of your thought? Just because all your friends accept that unions are a force for good doesn’t mean that perspective is unquestioningly right. And if you reflect that point of view rather than truly argue it in your book, you aren’t being fair.\nYou don’t need to submerge your argument in mights, perhaps, and coulds, until the book flounders in equivocation. But you do need to be fair to all sides. Give your book to someone who you know disagrees with you, and ask him or her if you have presented that person’s views fairly. And take their critique seriously. The best arguments engage with and demonstrate the pitfalls in the other side’s logic. Be fair, and the reviewers will be fair to you.\nGive your book a pithy title. You might think that is industry folly, but it’s a premium exercise for conveying (and selling) your argument. The Republic. Bowling Alone. The Lonely Crowd. The Time Bind. Streetwise. Gideon’s Trumpet. The View from Nowhere. What do all those titles have in common? They illustrate an idea with an image. They don’t use jargon. And they express the author’s thesis in five words or less.\nFinally, remember: You’re not Tom Friedman (or David McCullough). And no one expects you to be. Yours is a narrative with a thought-provoking thesis, not a journalistic account. And though the more journalistic techniques that you can incorporate, the better your writing will read, don’t overworry this. Especially for a first book.\nInternalize Strunk and White and maybe even William Zinsser. But don’t twist yourself into a New York pretzel trying to write for Punch Sulzberger. You are bringing the rigor of logic, the surprises of great empirical inquiry, and the revelations of hard-won research to others. That’s a large-enough task.']	['<urn:uuid:9b5c6443-82c8-41de-b814-25cc131da2b3>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	8	81	1872
7	digital entertainment production practices young students stress effects	Kids Make Movies offers various digital entertainment production programs where students create movies and animations, providing creative outlets through activities like scriptwriting, filming, and editing. However, according to medical research, excessive screen time and media use among teens (averaging 9 hours daily) can contribute to stress, with issues like cyberbullying affecting 23% of teens and 'Facebook depression' impacting mental health.	"[""KIDS MAKE MOVIES\nANIMATION AND MOVIE-MAKING FOR KIDS\nAction! Let’s make a movie!\nStudents create a complete short movie from beginning to end with the help of a teacher and one assistant. We have worked with several schools throughout New York City and Brooklyn. We provide all necessary equipment to make a movie: 2 cameras, tripods, professional lights, microphones, green screen, props, costumes, and make up. Please contact us if you would like to add movie-making to your school program as an in-school elective, after-school or summer program.\nHere is a break-down of our approach:\nThe group comes up with a story together: First they work on a script and storyboards, choose backgrounds, cast the roles, and rehearse.\n“Roll camera!” Filming in front a green screen is next: The kids learn how to set up lights and sound equipment and take turns as director, camera operator, sound tech, and clapper loader while others perform.\nThey learn editing basics using iMovie and how to compress, export, save and upload it as a digital file.\nAt the end of the class, everybody gets a copy of the movie on a DVD and a digital file for sharing online.\n2D Animation classes\nThis animation class explores the process of crafting a digital story from beginning to end: It builds communication, creativity, digital,\nvisual, and sound literacy, as well as project management skills.\nDuring a trimester (about 9 classes,) students tell their story through the means of 2D Computer animation using the simple Frames Animation software. They work during the first two sessions on their storyboards and scripts. They can either use characters they draw themselves or ready-made images from the software library.\nAfter recording voiceovers, they choose backgrounds, create or cut-out characters, then animate them. They can then add sound effects and/or music files in addition to the voiceovers.\nStudents master the skills to tell their stories with text, pictures, and personal narration: We teach them how to engage their audience with transitions like pan and zoom, how to match frame duration to sound recording, how to integrate motion graphics and more.\nAfter the class, students get a DVD with their masterpieces and a digital movie file they can share online with friends and family.\nStop-motion animation is a great tool to tell your story. In a series of (1-10) sessions, students create a stop-motion animated movie using figures made out of clay, paper cut-outs, their toys (like Lego), random objects, or even their own bodies (pixellation). We come to you, or students can work at our office in Washington Heights.\nFirst, we work on a story outline, write a script, and draw a storyboard. Then we record voiceovers. Next, kids create their characters and backgrounds: The backgrounds can be drawn, built from Lego bricks and plates, printed photos, or added later with a green screen.\nIt’s time to film!\nWe take many, many photographs using a professional photo camera with lights and a tripod. We use the Dragon interface software to compile the pictures. After shooting, students learn how to edit the scenes in Final Cut adding music, voiceover, and sound effects.\nStudents can choose to work one-on-one with the teacher or invite one or more friends to participate. Teamwork is very suitable for producing stop-motion, particularly for taking turns on camera duty and animating the characters frame by frame. It also helps to have a variety of voice actors, and they can have a lot of fun together, along with a memory they can watch together again and again. At the end of the class student(s) receive a DVD and a digital file of the movie to share online.\nStudents tell their story through the means of 2D Computer animation: They can choose to use the simple Frames Animation software or use images made in Photoshop and assembled in Final Cut. A laptop with the software will be provided. We come to you, or students can work at our office in Washington Heights.\nFirst, students write a script and record voiceovers. Then they choose backgrounds, create or cut-out characters, then animate them: They can draw the characters themselves or use ready-made images from the software library or the internet. They can then add sound effects and/or music files in addition to the voiceovers.\nStudents master the skills to tell their stories with text, pictures, and personal narration: We teach them how to engage their audience with transitions like pan and zoom, how to match frame duration to sound recording, how to integrate motion graphics, and more.\nAfter the class, students can take a DVD with their masterpieces home and will also receive a digital movie file they can share online with friends and family.\nClick on the images below to watch a few of our fabulous featured projects! Some of these movies were made in the after-school programs, some were made in private lessons, and some in summer camps: All of these projects are the products of the young movie-makers’ creative ambition, their hard work, their desire to make a movie they can stand by, and their willingness to share their fantastic stories with the world.\nIf you would like to see more of our students’ fantastic movies, or for ideas and inspiration, please check out our YouTube channel:\nOur movie-making parties are very special. It is perfect for a birthday or special event, and best with kids ranging from 6-12. Up to ten kids are ideal, but we can scale up for larger events. We come to your location for the event or we can rent a green screen studio for an extra fee. Meeting in a park/outdoors is also an option, weather-dependent.\nYour child can choose a theme and we work with the kids to make their ideas come to life: time-travel, news shows, Greek myths, and monster madness, unicorns, and magic show: you name it! We can also facilitate improv games for older kids.\nBefore the Party: We work together with the kids to come up with a script beforehand and the participants prepare for the day of the filming gathering costumes, makeup and props as needed.\nDuring the party, kids take turns taking on on all the movie-making roles as director, camera operator, prop-master, costumes and make-up person, sound tech, and clapper loader while the others perform.\nAfter the party, we edit the movie and the finished product is typically delivered within one to two weeks. The birthday child is invited to participate and can come to our office in Washington Heights to help with the editing and learn the software.\nEach party guest receives a DVD and a digital movie file that can be shared with family and friends online.\nWhat we offer is an experience and end product that can, and will be—watched hundreds of times, and a memory that lasts a lifetime.\nCo-founder, Director, Teacher\nAndrei is a creative and passionate movie and animation teacher with 14 years of experience.

Whether they are complaining of it or having somatic symptoms such as headaches and stomach aches, it seems that stress and anxiety are on the rise. We know that over scheduling, homework, and the pressures of getting into college can contribute to this. But can media also affect it? Is screen time and media a stressor or a remedy for stress?\nIn a recent WebMD survey published in their Teens and Stress report, 54% of teens were stressed according to parents. Interestingly, 40% of parents turned to the screen for family stress relief while 58% of teens did. Social media and texting was used as stress relief by almost half the teens. This is on the heels of the Common Sense Media survey reporting that US teens were using media for 9 hours a day. Other recent reports have shown that 94% of teens with mobile devices are online daily with many online constantly.\nSo it seems that stress is on the rise and media use is on the rise. Although there may not be a direct relationship, some real issues impact stress and anxiety. Consider this: 23 % of teens report cyberbullying, especially girls. There have been reports of “Facebook depression” and loneliness, as kids who aren’t in social media conversations may feel left out. Other negative consequences can also have an impact: many teens are in front of a screen late at night or ‘sleep text’, both of which can contribute to lack of sleep, which in turn can decrease focus and potentially cause irritability and depression. And last but certainly not least, what about the time media consumes?\nTime spent on media is time often not spent communicating with family. Lately, when I’ve gone into a restaurant, I’ve observed that as soon as a family sits down, everyone pulls out a mobile device. No one is really talking. So even the short amount of time not doing homework, playing soccer, or at school is being compromised. Psychologists, community leaders and experts have long reported that family time can contribute to less depression, less anxiety, better academic performance and generally happier kids. But what if that family time is on media??\nAs the AAP reviews our screen time recommendations, I feel that we, as pediatricians should continue to advise parents about basic principles.\nParents need to lay down some parameters about when and how media is used. Media is a centerpiece of teens’ lives and is not going away, but just as we don’t give our kids a set of keys to our car and say “just drive”, we need to enforce appropriate media use. And good modeling is also critical: parents need to put down their mobile devices and simply communicate with their kids. Old fashioned parenting and just talking to your kids can build the foundation to a less stressful childhood and hopefully a happier life.""]"	['<urn:uuid:d94f1588-0cb2-4054-95c9-7ef1c2df8d57>', '<urn:uuid:9ee5a44c-ac0e-4471-bc2a-f3b31e423c46>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	8	60	1763
8	professional development music therapy students experience	Music therapy professional development involves both academic training and practical experience. Students must complete specialized coursework and clinical training requirements, working under board-certified music therapists. In practical settings, music therapists engage in workshops and performances, as demonstrated by Chamber Music New Zealand's program where therapists work alongside community musicians, providing valuable learning experiences. For example, at Mahinawa Specialist School, these workshops created positive interactions and enhanced the school community, while offering therapeutic benefits. Additionally, professional organizations like Music Therapy New Zealand support ongoing development by providing scholarships, funding research, and maintaining professional standards.	"['New Zealand’s first Music Therapy Week\n16 May 2016\nThe healing qualities of music have been recognised in popular culture for centuries and now, the life-changing impact of music therapy is set to be celebrated in New Zealand’s first Music Therapy Week from 21 to 29 May.\nEvery week, New Zealand’s 52 registered music therapists work with thousands of clients around the country, from dementia patients to young children with learning difficulties. Music is used as part of a therapeutic toolkit to assist with the healing and personal growth of people of all ages and abilities with identified emotional, intellectual, physical or social needs.\nChamber Music New Zealand, which presents chamber music concerts throughout New Zealand, organises workshops and relaxed performances with young people and adults with learning disability. Led by community musician Julian Raphael, the workshops and concerts are also a professional development opportunity for the musicians.\nCoinciding with Music Therapy Week, Arts Access Aotearoa\'s new video about a recent workshop and relaxed performance project between Chamber Music New Zealand, Julian Raphael, Trio Amistad and Mahinawa Specialist School will be available for viewing. The workshop culminated in a performance at Pataka Art + Museum.\nMegan Berentson-Glass, a music therapist at Mahinawa Specialist School, was involved in the project and is interviewed on the video.\n""From our music therapist perspective, the workshopping was where the great benefit was,"" Megan says. ""As a therapist, process is what it’s about. So it was wonderful to have such a long process with people who were so welcoming of all the things our students were able to bring and to see all the different musical interactions that happened.\n""It was such a positive and exciting situation. Everyone was involved and active, and it really enhanced the sense of a school community.\n""After the concert, the buzz didn\'t go for weeks.""\nMusic therapists often work as members of a clinical team, including at early intervention centres, hospitals, schools, prisons and rest homes, in addition to private practice and working in homes.\nMusic Therapy New Zealand President Heather Fletcher says the first Music Therapy Week is focused on celebrating music therapy.\n“We’re looking forward to telling stories about the measurable difference music therapy is making in the lives of thousands of New Zealanders every month,” she says.\n“We are encouraging people to learn about the value of music therapy and how it can support members of their family or community and, in doing so, we aim to raise the profile of music therapy as a profession in New Zealand.”\nMusic Therapy Week highlights include:\n- Music Therapy Symposium, University of Auckland Tamaki Campus\n- Massey University information booth, Wellington\n- Music Moves Me Trust Movie Night, Cambridge\n- This is Music Therapy presentation, Christchurch\n- SoundsWell Singers First Birthday Celebration, Wellington\n- Drumming Workshop, Wellington\n- Auckland Regional Group Market stand, Auckland\nAbout Music Therapy New Zealand\nMusic Therapy New Zealand works to advance the provision of music therapy to all who will benefit from these services by:\n- developing public awareness and understanding of music therapy\n- overseeing professional standards and registration of music therapists\n- encouraging and funding research\n- providing scholarships for music therapy students and other music therapists\n- developing relationships with government agencies, community groups, professional and other relevant organisations\n- supporting activities to advance the ethical provision of music therapy services.\nRegistered Music Therapists in New Zealand are employed in a variety of health and education settings in areas such as Early Intervention, Children with Special Educational Needs, Adult Learning Disability, Child & Adolescent Mental Health, Adult Mental Health, Rehabilitation via ACC and Aged Care.', 'Music Therapy Equivalency Overview\nMany people possess excellent music skills and training, and a passion for wanting to help others through music.

9	What similarities exist between the organ donation challenges faced by Indigenous groups in Canada and Muslim communities in Singapore regarding their interaction with healthcare systems?	Both communities face challenges related to systemic healthcare interactions, but for different reasons. Indigenous groups show mistrust in the local health system due to historical trauma from forced Pasteurian care, affecting their willingness to participate in organ donation. Similarly, Singapore's Muslim community faces systemic challenges through their separate organ donation system (MTERA), which results in disadvantages in accessing transplants and being placed on priority lists compared to other communities, though this stems from regulatory rather than trust issues.	['Fatwa on Organ Transplant\nبسم الله الرحمن الرحيم\nالحمد لله رب العالمين ، والصلاة والسلام على سيد المرسلين وإمام المتقين نبينا محمد وعلى آله وأصحابه أجمعين. اللهم أرنا الحق حقا وارزقنا اتباعه، وأرنا الباطل باطلا وارزقنا اجتنابه . وبعد ،\n1. After considering carefully the latest updates on the issue of Muslims and organ donation in Singapore, as presented by the Office of the Mufti, which included:\ni. Latest developments provided by the Muslim Kidney Action Committee (MKAC), included in the presentation by the Office of the Mufti, on the problems and sufferings of Muslim kidney patients in Singapore, and the outcomes of public awareness campaigns on the importance of rendering help to kidney patients by becoming organ pledgers, and the current number of Muslim pledgers, and whether this number can help alleviate the problems of the kidney patients in the future, and\nii. Latest developments provided by the Ministry of Health, included in the presentation by the Office of the Mufti, on the process of transplantation and the statistics and status of Muslim kidney patients, as compared to other patients in Singapore, and the benefits for the Muslim community from their inclusion in the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA),\n2. The Fatwa Committee takes the position that it is permissible for Muslims to be included in the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA) for the following reasons:\ni. The general consensus of Muslim jurists is that organ transplant and donation by the deceased is permissible in Islam. Among the reasons quoted by jurists are:\na. Islam calls for the seeking of cure and treatment for illnesses, and the most effective treatment for those who suffer from organ failure, currently, is by receiving a new organ in place of the failed one.\nb. The objectives (maqasid) of the Syariah clearly state the importance of protecting and saving human lives. This is mentioned in the Holy Quran:\nوَمَنْ أَحْيَاهَا فَكَأَنَّمَا أَحْيَا النَّاسَ جَمِيعا\nWhich means “…and whomever saves one life, then it is as though he has saved the whole of humanity.” (Al-Maidah : 32)\nc. The Syariah is built upon values such as care and compassion. The Syariah thus calls for mankind to help one another, and to contribute in alleviating human sufferings and pain, such as the sufferings of kidney patients.\nd. Donating one’s organs is an act of amal jariyah (continuous charitable deed) in which the rewards accrue even after one’s death.\nii. The current pledging system for Muslims (through the opt-in in MTERA) is not helping kidney patients overcome their medical condition. Although a fatwa was issued in 2004 to simplify the process of making a pledge [by lifting the condition that a pledge must be witnessed by two family members (waris)], the number of pledgers is still very low. Whilst waiting for organ donors, patients and their family members suffer in many ways, including having to go through financial and emotional distresses. Thus, the mafsadah (harm) and mudarrah (difficulties) that these patients encounter must be alleviated in an appropriate manner. This is in accordance with numerous legal maxims in Islamic jurisprudence, such as:\nإذا ضاق الأمر اتسع\nWhich means: “If a problem grows acute, then it shall be relieved”\nالمشقة تجلب التيسير\nWhich means: “Difficulty calls for facilitation”\niii. To safeguard public interest and welfare (maslahah), leaders of the community (waliyyul-amr) should decide for the community what is best in their interest. This is in line with the legal maxim:\nتصرف الإمام منوط بالمصلحة\nWhich means: “The actions of an Imam (leader) is driven by the interest of the community.”\niv. The presumed consent or opt-out system in HOTA is a method of obtaining early consent from the donor. The donor is given the option to object and not give consent during his/her lifetime. S/he can do so by opting-out from HOTA. As such, there is no conflict with the requirement in Islamic law of consent to be made during the person’s lifetime for organ donation, as agreed upon by majority of Muslim jurists.\nv. Muslims stand to gain from inclusion in HOTA. Upon inclusion, the Muslim community will have the same opportunity as other communities in receiving transplants. Due to the waiting list system, Muslims who are not pledgers are disadvantaged, as they are not placed in the priority list for available transplants.\nWithout inclusion in HOTA, the plight of kidney patients and those suffering from organ failure will remain. They will also need to bear the high cost of dialysis treatment.\n3. The Fatwa Committee puts forth the following recommendations, alongside the position that Muslims can be included in HOTA:\ni. The relevant authorities should ensure a transparent and fair system of choosing recipients for available organs.\nii. The relevant authorities should ensure an extensive public education on organ donation and HOTA. Each individual Muslim should receive information on how HOTA will affect them, together with a clear explanation on the opting-out scheme.\niii. The relevant authorities should seek the opinion of the Fatwa Committee on prospective amendments to the HOTA which will affect Muslims.\niv. The Muslim community must be given a clear explanation on the hukum (ruling) and need for organ donation. This can be done through public education before and after the fatwa has been issued.\nوالله أعلم ، وبالله التوفيق ، وصلى الله على سيدنا محمد وعلى أله وصحبه وسلم.', 'By Ashwin Sritharan and Simi Juriasingani\nCanada faces an ever increasing need for organ donations considering the persisting demand for transplants. According to the Government of Canada, over 4300 people were waiting for organ transplants in 2018, with 223 people succumbing to organ failure during the wait for a transplant. Given the rarity of registered donors, it is important to look deeper into the barriers that stop individuals from registering as organ donors and discuss the cultural and/or personal stigmas that may be factoring into their indecision.\n1) Religious discouragement due to the sanctity of the human body\nReligion can be strongly tied to one’s identity, influencing one’s beliefs and morality. Views on organ transplantation are no exception. While no religion formally condones or condemns organ donation, certain groups may discourage organ donations within their community. A scientific review published in 2008 reported that Roma Gypsies, Confucians, and some Orthodox rabbis were found to discourage transplantation from deceased donors. Furthermore, some South Asian Muslim Ulemars (scholars) and Muftis (jurists) have expressed their disapproval of donations from both living and deceased donors on the grounds that the human body is a blessing from God and accepting such donations would desecrate it. Additionally in addressing participants at the XVIII International Congress of the Transplantation Society in 2000, Pope John Paul II suggested that organ donation and transplant procedures “must be considered morally unacceptable, because to use the body as an object is to violate the dignity of the human person.” While we live in a society where everyone is free to make decisions based on their own thoughts and beliefs, working with reluctant religious groups could help change such mindsets. Addressing their concerns and educating them about the societal and medical benefits of transplantation could open dialogue and broaden our nation’s pool of organ donors.\n2) Indigenous groups and their contentious history with the state\nCertain indigenous groups have expressed their discouragement of transplantation from deceased donors in a recent cross-sectional survey that evaluated the presence of cultural influences on the willingness to donate. A recent study revealed a common trend of mistrust in the local health system for a variety of reasons. This mistrust is certainly warranted given the past history of Pasteurian care forced upon Indigenous communities by external bodies. Further efforts focused on developing trust and bridging the gap between health systems and Indigenous communities would increase patient satisfaction and better health outcomes for these communities. The need for organ transplants is steadily increasing in most communities across the nation. Thus, it is more important than ever to include Indigenous communities in these conversations and address their concerns to achieve a representative national pool of organ donors.\n3) The underrepresentation of Chinese Canadians\nThe underrepresentation of Chinese Canadians in the organ donor pool appears to be mainly due to lack of education and outreach. When studying the opinions and beliefs of Chinese Canadians towards organ donation, there was a noticeable trend of not having enough information, and being unaware of what the organ donation process consists of. Furthermore, another study found that most Chinese Canadian participants had little to no knowledge about organ donation and transplantation, but were eager to learn more about the topic. This common trend shows a rare opportunity to increase the inclusion of a group of individuals that show promise as eager organ donors. Public health measures to educate Chinese Canadians about the process and impact of organ donation could facilitate more donor registration from this group. This would greatly aid other Chinese Canadians and Canadians from other backgrounds who are waiting for transplants.\n4) LGBT+ underrepresentation and barriers faced by gay men\nThere has been a noticeable underrepresentation of LGBT+ individuals, particularly men, from organ donation for reasons outside of their control. While it is not discouraged, gay men have to go through additional barriers to become registered organ donors than other groups. In the case of living donors, doctors may question them about their sexual history to see if they have engaged in any sexual activity within a certain period of time. One such strategy to determine sexual activity is an invasive perianal condyloma to look for evidence of anal intercourse. Leading up to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 2015 election, the Liberal Party ran an “End the Ban” campaign, claiming that they would repeal regulations surrounding gay men. However, these promises only extended to donating blood. So far, the only legalized measure has been to reduce the deferral period. These organ donation policies have been criticized as being discriminatory and promoting dangerous stereotypes around gay men. They serve as barriers, based on sexual orientation, for individuals who may want to donate organs. Reforming discriminatory policies would go a long way in facilitating organ donor registration and promoting inclusivity, which is crucial for achieving a diverse donor pool.\nCall to Action\nWhile Canada’s population is diverse, its donor pool, unfortunately, is not. In Ontario, diverse areas like the Greater Toronto Area have a 14% organ donor registration rate, with Caucasian donors making up a larger proportion of the donor pool. A more representative, inclusive and diverse donor pool is needed to help as many patients as possible who are currently on waiting lists. Registering as a donor can help those who need it the most, regardless of ethnicity. One donor can save up to eight lives, so it’s up to each of us to make a conscious decision. Those living in Ontario can register online at https://www.ontario.ca/page/organ-and-tissue-donor-registration. Remember, registering as a donor is the primary way to ensure that your decision is known, but it’s also important to make your wishes known to your loved ones so that they can advocate for you if/when the time comes.']	['<urn:uuid:a11f0710-a56f-4c06-b1ff-d2694a73afe4>', '<urn:uuid:25571849-4467-4569-986a-a8f09df31b9a>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	25	78	1842
10	What sort of serious health indicators should make someone seek immediate emergency medical attention for their digestive issues?	There are several emergency signs that require immediate medical attention: bloody stools, continuous vomiting, severe abdominal cramps, and sudden, unintentional weight loss.	['What are digestion problems?\nThe digestive system is an intricate and extensive part of the body. It ranges all the way from the mouth to the rectum. The digestive system helps your body absorb essential nutrients and is responsible for getting rid of waste.\nDigestion problems can mean more than unwanted symptoms. Minor problems that are left untreated can lead to more serious, chronic illnesses.\nBecause there are so many different types of digestion problems, you might mistakenly dismiss them. It’s important to understand common digestion problems — as well as emergency symptoms — so you know when to talk to a doctor.\nChronic constipation indicates a problem with getting rid of waste. This most often occurs when the colon can’t pass or move stools through the rest of the digestive tract. You may experience abdominal pain and bloating as well as fewer bowel movements (which are more painful than usual).\nChronic constipation is one of the most common digestive problems in the United States.Getting enough fiber, water, and exercise will likely help curb constipation. Medications can also provide relief in more serious cases.\nFood intolerance occurs when your digestive system can’t tolerate certain foods. Unlike food allergies, which can cause hives and respiratory problems, an intolerance only affects digestion.\nSymptoms of food intolerance include:\nFood intolerance is usually diagnosed by keeping and reviewing a food diary. Recording what you eat and when can help you identify which foods are triggering your symptoms.\nCeliac disease, an autoimmune disorder, is one type of food intolerance. It causes digestive problems when you eat gluten (a protein in wheat, barley, and rye). People with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet to minimize symptoms and damage to the small intestine.\nHeartburn is an occasional occurrence for many adults. This happens when stomach acids go back up into the esophagus, causing chest pain and the trademark burning sensation.\nIf you have more frequent heartburn, you might have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Such frequent episodes can interfere with your daily life and damage your esophagus.\nSymptoms of GERD include:\n- chest discomfort\n- dry cough\n- sour taste in the mouth\n- sore throat\n- swallowing difficulties\nYou may need medications to control heartburn. A damaged esophagus can make swallowing difficult and disrupt the rest of the digestive system.\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a type of chronic swelling. It affects one of more parts of the digestive tract.\nThere are two types of IBD:\n- Crohn’s disease: affects the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract but most commonly affects the small intestine and the colon\n- ulcerative colitis: affects only the colon\nIBD can cause more general digestive ailments, such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. Other symptoms can include:\n- incomplete bowel movements\n- loss of appetite and subsequent weight loss\n- night sweats\n- rectal bleeding\nIt’s important to diagnosis and treat IBD as soon as possible. Not only will you be more comfortable, but early treatment also reduces damage to the GI tract.\nA gastroenterologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating diseases involving the digestive system. If you continue to experience digestion problems, it’s time to make an appointment.\nSome signs are more serious and could mean there’s an emergency medical problem. These signs include:\n- bloody stools\n- continuous vomiting\n- severe abdominal cramps\n- sudden, unintentional weight loss\nYou may be able to overcome digestion problems with treatment and lifestyle changes. Certain diseases of the digestive system might be long-term, but medications can help alleviate symptoms.\nIdentifying specific digestion problems and talking with a gastroenterologist can go a long way in terms of helping your doctor give you a proper diagnosis. Remember, you don’t have to put up with constant digestive issues.']	['<urn:uuid:63d74562-05c7-4f43-ba1a-10090daa58ae>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	18	22	623
11	what are main benefits of subscription based cloud licenses compared to traditional software licenses	Cloud-hosted subscription-based licenses offer two main benefits compared to traditional software licenses. First, they allow more flexibility in adjusting the number of licenses up or down on a monthly or quarterly basis, unlike traditional licenses which can only be adjusted upward during the agreement term. Second, they enable organizations to be up and running with new tools within hours, providing more agility to switch tools when needed.	"['Getting Benefit From Empty SeatsBuying software licenses the traditional way typically means that a set number of licenses are available for an agreement term, and these may only be adjusted upward during that time. There is no benefit for quieter times when the demand is lower. With many cloud-hosted services, the subscription is monthly or quarterly, making it much easier to adjust downward, as well as up. This removes the pressure to get the planning just right from the beginning.\nCloud-Hosted Products Allow More AgilityIf an organization has standardized a particular tool and set this up to help ensure a particular level of quality, it\'s typical to find projects that are exceptions. For example, a new staff member might find working with an on-site tool too restrictive, particularly when they’ve had experience with something else. One tool does not necessarily fit all needs. Change is constant in the market for development tools, and with the widespread adoption of agile methodologies in the last five years, being able to switch to a tool that provides a more effective way of working can provide significant dvantages over having to adopt a standardized way of working that does not fit the style of development being used. Using cloud subscription-based products, it is possible to be up and running with a new tool within hours. (Get more tips in Don\'t Mess This Up: How to Implement Cloud Computing.)\nIntegration Is Supported in the CloudYou might think that in moving to a remotely hosted service in the cloud, you’d have to give up the level of integration you’d come to expect from in-house hosted tools. Well, think again. Many cloud-based tools support integration. You may not be able to achieve as much integration as with purchasing a ""traditional"" dedicated software suite from a single supplier, but as with any set of tools, be clear on what integration you require. Determine what efficiency savings integration will bring versus the cost of operating the tools.\nHow to Decide: Cloud or On-Site Hosted?The purchase of any development life cycle tool should be one based on benefits achieved from the tool weighed against the total cost, while considering whether you can accept the associated risks. When comparing cloud versus an on-site hosted tool, points to consider should include:\n- The level of integration between the tools: Greater integration may give greater efficiency savings, but also require the purchase and support of more tools.\n- Potential operational risks: By hosting in the cloud, your organization creates an operational dependency on a third party. Consider what scenarios would impact your day-to-day work and how you might mitigate these.\n- Sensitivity of data: Does the information you wish to manage contain sensitive business or personal information? Review this against your own organization’s security policies and the procedures of the cloud-based service to decide if this data can be hosted outside the organization.\n- How long is the data needed: With a subscription-based license, terminating the subscription means you will no longer have access to the service or your information stored there. Understand how terminating the service would impact you both during and after the project and determine how you could continue to operate.\n- Economies of scale: Weigh the purchase and hidden costs of hosting your own tool, versus using a cloud-based one. There may well be break-even points where the hosting your own results is cheaper than a cloud-based service. These could be used to influence your choice or as negotiation points in discussions with vendors. (Read more in How Cloud Computing Costs Can Creep Up On Unsuspecting Companies.)\nWhen to Consider Cloud-Based ToolsCloud-based development life cycle tools have greater benefit when a project team or organization requires a quick start and flexibility over time to adjust cost to match demand. It remains to be seen whether longer term, larger company-wide deployments will move away from in-house hosted options.\nFor you and your project team, the choice of tool depends on cost, operational considerations, past experience and how long it takes to be up and running. Working through the considerations above should help you understand what you need and what shapes your decision.']"	['<urn:uuid:a5fc6bcb-651d-408f-9063-6f863a23bed2>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	14	67	692
12	damping off control selenicereus grandiflorus propagation	Both damping off and Selenicereus grandiflorus propagation are affected by soil and moisture conditions. Damping off can be prevented by avoiding poorly drained soils and carefully monitoring irrigation, as wet conditions favor pathogens. For Selenicereus grandiflorus propagation, stem cuttings should be taken in spring, allowed to heal for a week, and planted in well-draining cactus soil. Seeds can also be used, planted in spring or summer in containers with drainage holes. Both propagation methods require semi-shade conditions and proper moisture management to prevent disease issues.	['Selenicereus grandiflorus (synonyms are Cereus jalapaensis Vaupel, Cereus paradisiacus Vaupel, Selenicereus pteranthus, Selenicereus callianthus, Cereus roseanus Vaupel and Cereus hallensis Weing. ex Borg) is a type of cactus that grows in the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America. People often call this species queen of the night, night-blooming cereus, large-flowered cactus, sweet-smelling cactus, or vanilla cactus. These names are also used for other species.\nMost of the plants with this name are actually hybrids or other species. People often mix it up with plants in the genus Epiphyllum.\nGrandiflorus comes from the Latin word for “big flowers.” In 1753, when Carl von Linné wrote about this cactus, it was the only known species of cactus with the largest flowers. In a strange way, its flowers are not as big as those of some other Selenicereus species. The species was grown at the Royal Gardens at Hampton Court before 1700, according to Hortus Kewensis. There was some question about which plant Linné could see when he wrote his description.\nD. R. Hunt (1989) talked about problems with the typification of Selenicereus grandiflorus and suggested that the dozen or more species in the section Selenicereus probably represent no more than three or four species, such as S. grandiflorus, S. pteranthus (Link & Otto) Britton & Rose, and S. hamatus (Scheidweiler) Britton & Rose.\nMyron Kimnach (personal communication) said that S. coniflorus should be treated as a synonym or a variety of S. grandiflorus. As Hunt said, there is a lot of work to be done on this group of taxa. Until these questions are answered, it seems best not to call different kinds of S. grandiflorus by their names.\n|Water requirements:||Average water needs, water regularly, do not overwater, Requires consistently moist soil; do not let dry out between waterings|\n|Sun exposure:||Sun to partial shade|\n|Height:||30-40 ft.

At 700 meters above sea level, they were climbing up trees and rocks. Extremely variable, especially in Jamaica, where the same plant can have stems with edges that range from slightly wavy to very knobby. A lot of confusion in farming. Many Selenicereus species should be thought of as synonyms for subspecies of this species, since they only differ in degree, not in kind.\nAn easy-to-grow epiphyte or lithophyte that grows quickly. Needs a compost with a lot of humus and enough water in the summer. In the winter, it shouldn’t be kept below 5 °C (41 °F). Do best when they are grown in full sun. Extra light in early spring will make plants grow leaves. Flowers in late spring or early summer. Blooms only one night a year for a few years.\nStems are thin, clinging or sprawling, branching and sometimes tangled, stiff, up to 10 m long or more, and 15–25 mm thick, ribs are 4–10 mm wide, low, less so on older branches, spaced by wide, round intervals, slightly wavy to strongly knobby, areoles are small and woolly white or grayish white. Internodes are 6–12–20 mm long.\nIn cultivation in Europe, the woolly buds appear between April and May, and the flowers open June to August, preferably on a warm thundery or at least rainy night. The fragrant flowers are up to 30 centimeters long and reach the same diameter.\nThere are 5–18 spines that are 4.5–12 mm long and 0.25 mm in diameter at the base. The spines are acicular, elliptic, or circular in cross section and spread out from the base. As the plant gets older, the spines become shorter and less numerous. The epidermis is glaucous green or bluish green. People say that the flowers are 17–22.5 cm long and as wide as 15 inches (38 cm). Smells like vanilla.\nThe outer petals are yellow to brownish and narrow, the inner ones are white and broader. While the flowers of S. donkelaari open with small, visible jerks, the flowers of S. grandiflorus do so in a continuous, slow movement. This takes about one to two hours.\nThe Queen of the Night tree has small, unique fruits. The fruit is round and 5–9 cm long and 4.5–7 cm thick. The outside of the fruit is burgundy, but it turns red. The fruit is also covered with hair-like spines, which can be brushed off when the fruit is ready to be picked. The fruit’s white flesh is firm and has small seeds that are crunchy. When picked early, the fruit has a pleasant taste with a tangy aftertaste.\nThis cactus does not support the temperatures below 5 °C. This epiphyte plant needs a compost containing sufficient humus whose humidity is maintained in summer. It prefers the sun.\nIn the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the species is listed as Least Concern (LC), i.e., not endangered.\nThe Flowering Time\nThe Selenicereus Grandiflorus is most popular for its sweet-smelling flowers. Most of the time, the succulent plant doesn’t start to flower until it has been around for four or five years. The plant may only have one or two flowers when it first blooms, but as it grows older, it may produce more flowers.\nPitaya has flowers that are white with a yellowish-green center. The flower has many petals and can grow up to 17 inches across. It smells sweet, strong, and enticing. Most of the time, flowers bloom from late spring to early summer.\nThe most interesting thing about the Selenicereus Grandiflorus is that its flowers only open at night and stay open all night. As soon as the sun starts to rise in the morning, the flowers on the plant start to die.\nWhat do you need to know\nIf you want a dragon fruit plant, it’s important to keep in mind a number of things that we’ll talk about below. This is a cactus that, because of where it comes from, can’t handle frost unless it’s very specific and weak.\nBut this doesn’t have to be a big deal because it does well in pots. In fact, it can be very interesting to plant it in a construction site, on a terrace or patio, or in a pot with holes in the bottom so water can drain. Let’s look at what they need so that your plant grows well every year.\nThe Selenicereus Grandiflorus is a succulent plant that likes to be warm and has gotten used to living in places with high temperatures. The plant can grow in temperatures as low as 45 F and as high as 105 F. However, the best temperature for this plant is between 50 and 75 F.\nThe plant can die if the temperature drops below 41 F. When grown in colder places, the potted plant should be brought inside when the weather starts to get cooler.\nThe succulent plant does well in warm climates with long periods of sunlight. It can handle some shade, but it won’t grow as well as it could.\nWhen a plant gets more sunlight in the spring, it helps the flowers grow. The Queen of the Night grows best in the sun outside, where it gets the most light. When grown in colder areas, the Selenicereus Grandiflorus should be kept in a pot and brought inside during the winter.\nThis cactus needs light, but unlike some others, it can have its light filtered. In its natural environment, it grows by climbing up trees and/or rocks, so it doesn’t need direct sunlight.\nOnly if you plan to keep it inside should you get a plant lamp to make sure it grows well. This will keep it from getting etiolate, which means that its stems won’t get longer and weaker.\nPitahaya can grow both on the ground and on other plants. When grown in light, sandy soil, the plant does very well because any extra water can quickly drain away from the roots.\nWhen grown in pots, the Queen of the Night does best in soil that drains well, like cactus soil mix. For gardeners who like to mix their own soil, equal parts of garden soil, light garden sand, and pumice are enough to make a mix that drains well and gives the roots plenty of air.\nGardeners usually repot the Queen of the Night every three to four years.\nFlower pot: coarse sand (pumice, akadama, kiryuzuna, or something similar) mixed with a little peat is a great base for flower pots.\nThe soil in the garden must be light and sandy for it to grow. It’s important that the water drains well, because puddles are not good. It doesn’t mind being on stony ground.\nIt is best to feed Selenicereus grandiflorus with a cactus fertilizer in the spring and summer, when it is growing.\nDuring its growing season, the Selenicereus Grandiflorus loves to be fed with cactus fertilizers. At this stage, the succulent plant needs a lot of food in order to grow and make flowers and fruit. Mature plants will require more nutrients than juvenile ones.\nSelenicereus Grandiflorus does well in its natural environments, where winters are not a problem. When grown in colder places, the plant may go through a short period of dormancy. During this stage, you should water your plants less and stop fertilizing them altogether.\nHow often you water will depend on many things, like where you live and the weather. But it is always important to let the soil dry out between waterings or the plant could rot. Once the extra water starts to drain, you should stop watering. You should only water again after a few days, when the soil is dry.\nAlso, every time you go to water, you have to wet the whole land. You’ll know this is true if the water is soaked up as soon as you add it and the extra water comes out of the holes in the pot. If it is planted in the ground, it needs to be added until the soil is well-soaked.\nThis plant should be watered less in the winter when it is grown indoors in colder climates.\nIf you want to make more plants, stem cuttings are a great way to do that. This is done in the spring by cutting off a piece, letting the cut heal for about a week, and then planting it in a pot. It will grow its first roots in about 10 days, but you must keep it in the same pot for at least a year, until the roots are strong.\nIt can also be grown from seeds, which can be done in the spring or summer. You have to plant these in pots or planters with holes in them and good cactus soil. Spray the seeds with water after putting them on the surface, but not too close together.\nBoth the cutting and the seedbed need to be in semi-shade, away from direct sunlight.\nPests and sickness\nIt doesn’t have many because it is tough. But it’s important to keep snails away and not water too much to avoid getting fungal infections.\nDragonfruit tree isn’t too hard to care for, since its main problems are usually caused by too little or too much water, both of which can hurt the plant. Other problems are easy to fix, such as mealybugs, spider mites, and fungal infections.\nProperties and uses in medicine\nThe plant is used in homeopathy and is considered to be an aphrodisiac.\nSeveral medicinally active ingredients are found in the plant. The flowers of Selenicereus grandiflorus contain betacyans and about 1.5% flavonol glycosides. Eight glycosidated flavonoids have been identified: Narcissin (0.05%), cacticin (0.02%), rutoside, hyperoside, kaempferitrin, grandiflorin, isorhamnetin-3-O-β-(xylosyl)-rutinoside, and isorhamnetin-3-O-β-(galactosyl)-rutinoside. The shoots appear to have the same spectrum of flavonoids. In addition, they contain the biogenic amines tyramine (0.3% of dry weight), N-methyltyramine, and hordenine (N,N-dimethyltyramine). Other constituents include mucilage, fat, wax, and resinous glycosides.\nActive ingredients: contains cactin (hordenine), cacticin, narcisin, grandiflorin, hyperoside, rutoside, rutosides.\nIndications: cactin has a pseudo-digital action without risk of accumulation, so it was used as a cardiotonic. Formerly used in the treatment of angina pectoris, coronaritis, congestive heart failure.\nContraindicated with other cardiotonic medications, quinidine, anthraquinone laxatives, thiazide diuretics (due to possible potentiation of the cardiotonic effect). It is recommended to avoid their use and resort to standardized digitalis.\nSelenicereus grandiflorus is a type of cactus that grows on other plants. It is called “queen of the night” by people in general. It grows at about 700 meters above sea level in Mexico, Central America, and South America. Grows green stems that branch out a lot. The areoles are white or white-grey, and the spines are brown or yellow and 4 to 12 millimeters long.\nThe white flowers are between 17 and 22 centimeters long and up to 38 centimeters in diameter. They smell sweet, like vanilla, and are between 17 and 22 centimeters long. These grow at night. The fruit is 5 to 10 centimeters long and 4 to 7 centimeters thick. It is white-pink, yellow, or orange and has an ovoid shape. When fully grown, the plant can grow up to 9 to 12 meters tall.\nEpiphytic cacti are a good choice if you want to have a unique plant on the balcony, for example. Even more interesting is if it has big, beautiful flowers like the Selenicereus grandiflorus. In fact, collectors love this species a lot because of how beautiful its flowers are.\nAlso, it’s important to know that it’s not hard to take care of. And it is because, even though it is a cactus from the tropics, it does well in warm temperate areas of the world.', 'Common diseases in organic hoophouse greens\nIn much of northern Michigan, growers are seeing a cold and wet spring. While hoophouses help mitigate some of these problems, foliar and root diseases in high-value, organic hoophouse crops can prove to be challenging to growers across the state.\nLettuce, spinach and leafy brassica greens are some of the leading spring crops for Michigan hoophouse growers. While these crops can be profitable, they can be excellent hosts for fungal and bacterial pathogens, especially in the high humidity environment of the hoophouse. Organic growers have limited tools in their toolbox to address outbreaks, but understanding proper management and cultural practices can reduce the likelihood of infection. Below are some common diseases that Michigan growers may face.\nThis pathogen can be very problematic for greens growers in low light, low temperature and high moisture environments. Even more challenging, downy mildew (DM) has a different identified “races,” each of which behaves differently and can infect different varieties. For example, there are currently 16 identified DM races that infect spinach and new races are emerging that allow the pathogen to infect genetically resistant varieties.\nOn spinach, DM appears as a fuzzy, purple-gray growth on the underside of leaves and light yellow spotting on the opposing side. Advanced infections will cause infected foliage to turn tan and dry out, causing crop death and making it unmarketable.\nOn lettuce, the top side of leaves will have yellow or light green sections bound by plant veins. The underside of leaves will have white, somewhat fluffy growth that appears somewhat similar to powdery mildew.\nDM resistant varieties are available, but resistance is restricted to specific races. Selecting varieties that have broad resistance is a first line of defense. Other methods of control include limiting leaf wetness, utilizing proper crop rotations, removing plant residues after harvest, and removing infected plants as soon as the pathogen is identified. Regularly removing row covers to reduce relative humidity and timing irrigation to allow for leaf drying help prevent the spread of this pathogen.\nCladosporium leaf spot\nA concern for spinach, this pathogen is characterized by small (less than 1cm), round spots with tan-green fungal growth. Like many fungal pathogens, Cladosporium favors cool, wet conditions, so growers may see improvements with proper water management, circulation, and ventilation. Cladosporium also can be seed-borne, so growers may want to consider hot water or steam treatment of seeds prior to planting.\nDamping off/Root Rot\nSeveral pathogens can cause damping off in seedlings, including Fusarium, Pythium, and Rhizoctonia. Symptoms include poor germination, lack of vigor at germination, tissue death/stunting at the soil line, and seedling death. Damping off is often an issue in poorly drained soils, as excessively wet conditions are favorable for these pathogens. Managing soils properly and closely monitoring irrigation are important steps in reducing disease emergence. Some possibility exists for pathogen transfer on the seed, so growers may benefit from pre-planting seed treatments.\nPowdery mildew is one of the more easily recognizable foliar diseases due to its characteristic powdery white growth on both top and bottom leaf surfaces. Oftentimes spotted in the fall on cucurbits, this pathogen can infect brassicas and lettuce in the hoophouse.\nMany growers confuse powdery mildew and downy mildew. It is critical to understand the differences between these pathogens, as control methods and treatments are different. Powdery mildew develops best under dry conditions, so reducing leaf wetness will not have the same effect as it does for DM control. Instead, organic fungicides can be used, which often consist of biologicals that are designed to outcompete the pathogen. Growers must ensure that any fungicide is listed for the specific pathogen being controlled and instructions are followed appropriately.\nCollin Thompson is the Farm Manager of The North Farm at the Michigan State University Upper Peninsula Research and Extension Center in Chatham, Michigan and a Small Farm Educator with Michigan State University.

13	What makes business plans successful and what can make them fail?	Business plans succeed when they use structured approaches like OGSM, which provides clear direction through defined objectives, measurable goals, focused strategies, and specific measures for tracking progress. The framework's simplicity and coherence helps ensure all actions align with organizational goals. However, plans can fail due to resistance from employees, particularly when there's inadequate communication, insufficient involvement of affected staff, or failure to provide proper support and training. Success requires both good strategic planning and careful management of human factors - involving people in planning, addressing their concerns, and demonstrating the benefits of changes.	['What is OGSM?\nFast and effective planning with OGSM\nOGSM is a simple and effective framework for strategic planning and strategy execution. It is used by companies, governments, NGOs and individuals alike. As long as you have the courage to make the big choices, OGSM will help you create a well-structured plan that empowers you to achieve your organisation’s goals.\nOGSM is one of the premiere strategic frameworks for managing organisations. The name is an acronym for Objective, Goals, Strategies & Measures, which are the main components of this model.\nMore than simply creating a plan, OGSM also guides you through the steps to make your goals actionable: because realizing your dreams is even more fun than dreaming them. OGSM has four main advantages:\n- Simplicity. OGSM is a clear and easy-to-understand model that summarises your essential strategic choices on a single page. This also makes it a good tool for communication, because it is much easier to understand and interpret than a long written strategic document.\n- Coherence. OGSM makes explicit, logical connections between five different aspects of a strategic plan. These aspects are your objective or mission; your quantitative goals; the strategies you choose to achieve those goals; the way you measure progress towards the goals; and the actions or projects planned to realize the strategies.\n- Clear choices. Because OGSM is a strict logical framework limited to a single page, it forces you to make clear choices. Using this framework, every action and project your organisation or team works on, must be connected to your organisational goals. In that way, OGSM helps you identify any outdated or less-relevant projects and work more efficiently. This aligns perfectly with the Lean philosophy, and a clear and differentiated strategic focus is the result.\n- Flexibility. OGSM is a flexible framework that can be adapted to multiple levels of an organisation. For example, you have made a plan on one page for the strategic change of a whole organization. That may not be immediately executable for individual departments or teams. But by linking higher-level to lower-level OGSMs (a process called cascading), you can make your strategic plan concrete and executable at each level.\nWhy use OGSM?\nOGSM is commonly referred to as a business planning method, but you can use the framework to design and execute any type of plan: department plans, annual plans, project plans, personal plans and any other plans. Essentially, OGSM takes a clear goal and subsequently translates this goal into concrete steps and a way to execute them. It’s a uniquely simple, well-structured and effective method that you can use to achieve any goal without unnecessary complexity.\nWhat does OGSM stand for?\nOGSM is short for Objective, Goals, Strategies & Measures. Together these components form the basis of a good and effective business plan on 1 page.\nThe Objective describes the conditions that you want to achieve during the agreed-upon time period. It sets the direction for the whole plan. This objective should be:\nThe Goals section of your OGSM translates your Objective into a set of clear and measurable targets that must be achieved to realize it. Goals tend to include key financial targets like market share, profit, numbers of clients, or revenue. They can also include other numbers relevant to your organization’s performance, such as client satisfaction, employee churn or ESG goals. Goals must be SMART, meaning: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound.\nStrategies are the roadmap to the realization of your Objective. If your Objective defines the ‘what‘ you hope to achieve with the strategic plan, your Strategies should describe how you will do that. Selecting good Strategies is crucial to good performance for any organization. These will define the areas of focus for your strategic plan. When writing your Strategies, it can be helpful to keep a list of strategic areas in mind that tend to be relevant for most organizations. These are Customer, Product, Processes, Partners, and Innovation. Sometimes, you may also want to add ESG as an area.\nThe component of OGSM called ‘Measures’ really consists of two separate elements: a ‘Dashboard’ and an ‘Action Plan’. This split within Measures is not native to OGSM, but was introduced to improve the clarity of the model by Marc van Eck (one of our co-founders) & Ellen van Zanten.\n- The Dashboard Measures include the key performance indicators that tell you whether or not a strategy is on track;\n- The Action Plan includes the projects or actions that you execute as part of your Strategies, as well as data on who & when will execute them.\nOGSM, the 1 page business strategy\nDo you want to know more about the OGSM methodology, find out how to make a good OGSM yourself, or have your own go-to guide for any questions related to OGSM?\nAll you need to know about the OGSM methodology is summarized in the handbook: The 1-page business strategy, written by one of our founders, Marc van Eck. The Dutch version of the book has been a bestseller on managementboek.nl and bol.com for over 5 years. The book is available in Dutch, English and Mandarin.\nGet yours here:\nWhen did OGSM originate?\nIn the mid-twentieth century, a man named Peter Drucker introduced a management style called Management by Objectives, which eventually evolved into OGSM. The general idea of Management by Objectives is that management and employees should set goals together, because by agreeing together on goals that are challenging but achievable, you motivate and empower everyone involved. For that reason, Drucker wanted to link the goals of the employees of an organisation to the goals of the organisation itself.\nThe management method was first applied by NASA. The goal of getting the first man on the moon was split into sub-goals and divided over various teams. These teams in their turn translated these sub-goals into sub-sub-goals and those were assigned to sub-teams, and so on. In this way, everyone was involved with setting the goals that helped motivate the entire team. Every employee knew what his or her team’s objective was, and knew that if they had achieved their objective, they had contributed to the achievement of putting the first man on the moon.\nAfter getting the first man on the moon, various major car manufacturers in Japan noticed NASA’s success and developed Drucker’s ideas into the model we now recognize as the OGSM methodology. OGSM is now being used as the main tool for strategic planning by companies such as Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, Mars and many other Fortune 500 organisations wordwide.\nFive secrets to a good OGSM\nWe’ve mentioned a couple of times that it is necessary to make clear choices in order to get a quality OGSM, and that practice has shown that less is more. But how exactly do you create a good OGSM? Here’s our five essential tips:\n1. What-by-How approach\nClear and sharp choices are made using the What-by-How approach. This is a component of OGSM that has been added by Marc van Eck & Ellen van Zanten. What-by-How means that your Objective, Strategies and Actions should consist of two elements: a ‘What’ part and a ‘How’ part. For example: “Deliver a new website by collaborating with a web development partner.” What is it that we want to achieve? And how are we going to achieve this? Always take a moment to reflect on the decisions you made in your OGSM and ask yourself: do I have both a ‘What’ and a ‘How’? In case you didn’t, you now know exactly what to change!\n2. Sharp and Smart Goals\nIn other management methods, achieving even 75% of the goals may lead to great enthusiasm, but that’s not the case with OGSM. With OGSM, everything should be planned to be realistic and achievable. For that reason, it’s very important that your Goals are clear and that you make them SMART. Specific and measurable goals have a percentage, a measure, or a number in them, ensuring you can ‘tick the box’ once you have achieved them. The goals should be ambitious, but achievable: they need to really make a difference. The desired result should be well-defined, and you should specify the exact timing for you to reach that Goal. You should aim to reach all the goals at the end of the set time period.\n3. No more than five strategies\nWhen it comes to Strategies, we tend to say less is more. But how many is too many? A maximum of 5 strategies is recommended, because you tend to get better results out out of handling a few Strategies really well. This forces you to make clear strategic choices and not spread your efforts too thin.\n4. Choose existing measurements\nIt is wise to choose Dashboard Measures for your OGSM that are already being used in the organisation. Experience shows that it’s often more efficient to use an existing measurement that is 80% associated with being on track, than to set up a new measurement that is 100% aligned. If you do decide to use a new Dashboard Measure, take some time to think carefully about how you can do this as practically as possible.\n5. Monitor your plan\nSetting up your OGSM is only the beginning. Following up on your plan and habitually working within the framework of the OGSM is key. In the follow-up process, you should constantly reflect on the strategies and measures and make adjustments as you go. This ensures that the OGSM stays representative for your organization and that people still feel enthusiastic about it. Continue to apply the mechanics of OGSM as well as possible. If your OGSM starts to show technical inaccuracies, this can have serious consquences for the effectiveness of the framework.\nOGSM Example: Jeep\nOne example from “The 1-page business strategy” is an OGSM made for Jeep. We have imported this example into OGSM Software for you to learn from. The Jeep example can show you exactly how the software works and how your Action Measures should be linked to your goals. That way, you’ll ensure that everyone is doing the right things to reach the Objective.\nWhat does cascading your OGSM mean?\nIn essence, cascading means little more than splitting up your main Objective into a number of smaller sub-goals that, if realized, together add up to the Objective. These sub-goals then operate as the Objectives of one or more underlying OGSMs.\nThe Strategies of the higher-level OGSM are then ‘translated’ to the relevant level of the sub-OGSM. For example, a Customer strategy on the organisational level can be concretised into a marketing strategy for the marketing department. In short: by cascading, you can make your Goals and Strategies more concrete and manageable at different levels of your organisation. Individual departments, teams and employees can work on lower-level objectives and strategies that are relevant for them, without losing sight of the higher-level strategic objective.\nNeed help cascading your OGSM?\nWhy OGSM Software?\nWhether you are an experienced user of OGSM or still new to it all, managing and executing your strategy becomes a pleasure with this easy-to-use tool.

In order to shed excess costs and to respond more nimbly to customers and competitors, they are being urged to adopt new organizational forms, tightened inter organizational linkages and improved management practices (cf. Miles and Snow 1980, Johnston and Lawrence, 1988). Any change in organization is followed by a kind of resistance from its employees. In this assignment a few methods that can be used to overcome change in the organization are described.\nTechnology developments, social and demographic shifts, competition of changing market and economic issues, tend an organization to implement change in it as well. The rapid and dynamic change in market has increased consumerism. Whether it is an automobile industry or cosmetic industry or IT industry, consumer today has lots of choices these days that they need not have to wait for longer for any product. This changing market scenario imparts a message to managing bodies that the way of work should also change with the changing market. From managerial point of view a change is referred to as change in work pattern, work routine and work culture inside the working atmosphere. Change is normally a reaction to changing commercial, technological, economical, structural and strategic environment in which the company operates (Barbara Senior, Organizational Change). For example; departmentalization, job redesign, implementation of an international division are the examples of structural changes whereas work processes, methods and equipments are technological changes.\nChange should be welcomed as it can produce positive benefits for the individuals, bring opportunities for personal change and development, reduces boredom of work, provides new challenges and an opportunity to participate and shape the outcome. But unfortunately as change is accompanied by resistance, it is very important that the Change Manager anticipate and plan strategies for dealing with resistance not only at the introduction of change but also for monitoring the change over long term (Ronald, G and Smith, J 1995). It is helpful to understand why people resist change, because understanding this allows us to plan strategies to reduce resistance from the beginning. Kotter and Schlesinger identified the basic reasons of resistance to change are communication gap and inadequate information that creates misunderstanding, sense of insecurity, different assessment of situation and disagreement over advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, individuals are more concerned with the implications for themselves (Management by Robbins and Coulter).\nOrganizations do not change, individuals do. No matter how large is the project you are taking on, the success of project ultimately lies with each employee doing their work differently multiplied across all of employees impacted by the change (Web 1). Individual barriers to change include- tradition and set ways; loyalty to existing relationships; failure to accept the need for change; insecurity; preference for the existing arrangements; break up of work groups; different person ambitions; fear of power; skills and income; inability to perform as well in the new situation as for example, when quality control methods based on statistical models were introduced into manufacturing units, the quality control department have to learn the new methods. Some may fear that they will be unable to do so and may develop negative attitude towards the change or perform poorly if required to use the new methods. Sometimes change is resisted because of failures in the way it is introduced to the employees and the management fails to explain the need for change and its future benefits. Poor employer relations, lack of involvement in process and failure to offer support and training for the introduced change are the other reasons for change resistance (Web 2).\nResisting change takes many forms (Web 3) and the more obvious form is of active resistance, objection and refusal to cooperate with the change occurs. Sometimes, resistance appears to be individual and sometimes it is clearly situational. It may be passive in which colleagues agree to a change but are unwilling or unable to implement something new. This subtle form of resistance is dealt with more difficulty. For example, at a staff meeting everyone agrees to follow a new procedure, but after several weeks it is being discovered that the procedure has not been implemented yet. Another example of this kind is the introduction of new computers at the new place but virtually no one is using them for the purpose for which they are intended, since the staff had their own machines. The employee consents to change by agreeing to it but later he only changes to appear cooperative, but in fact he is doing most things the way he was before the change.\nAt the moment the change program is announced, many employees will employ tactics to protect themselves, their turf, and ultimately their place in the organization.Ã‚Â Some will aggressively challenge the necessity for change. This is a time waster and thus prevents critical objectives from being met. Every person who facilitates the change process must work diligently to build consensus. The employee must be assured that every idea is worth considering. If anyone argues, he or she can be asked to explain why he or she feels the way they do and ask for three or four suggestions for making the process work.Ã‚Â Some managers and members of the leadership team will avoid change by passively refusing the commitment to the process. Often these leaders will resist the change effort by being unavailable for meetings, denying resources, or withholding feedback. “The leadership” is a particularly difficult foe, because change efforts often require the use of resources managed by the leadership, such as time and money. Without these resources change efforts are likely to fail. Accountability with consequences is the primary means for assuring leadership participation. Many employees and organizational leaders search for personal or professional diversions during the change process that will ultimately hinder the effort. A distracted individual can undermine the change effort by not being present physically or mentally when his or her critical input is needed. Not being mindful of change creates an unnecessarily difficult experience for every member of the team. Such carelessness calls to mind the wasted energy expended when one runs against the wind. Change efforts provide an opportunity for every one affected to secure a new place in the organization or make a decision to seek a better fit elsewhere.\nKen Hultman argues that while no-one is a perfect change agent, managers have to be impeccable role models for bringing up a successful change. The essential attributes of such a person include the ability to be a clear thinker who is able to get a view about organizational situation and reach at logical conclusions. Hultman suggests few things in creating the right environment for change to occur. Firstly we must do things to establish a positive climate (p172) and secondly we must attempt to create environmental conditions that encourage an interest in improvement. Managers must demonstrate that how changes will improve employees circumstances and that there are opportunities in the change such as enabling colleagues to increase their knowledge and skills leading to genuine achievements and progress They must cultivate a value for collaborative working among staff and colleagues need each other to complete their tasks, it is easier to develop values of co-operation and mutuality. Whatever are the circumstances management must stay calm. At the heart of HultmanÃ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s analysis is a set of humanistic values along with an assumption that one cannot even hope to influence another colleague without firstly demonstrating that they will have their needs met in some way. It is likely to be counterproductive by getting impatient, exasperated and angry.\nBeing a change manager it is his/her duty to reduce the resistance towards change and towards change and to increase the enthusiasm and level of commitment for the change. While likely to encounter the people who resist change, people who welcome change will also be encountered and by knowing the reasons for their acceptance to change, the communication plan will be better formulated. People will accept change when they see possibility that they will gain something from the change. The gain may be either personal like, money; increased job security; status; self satisfaction; less effort and time and gain in better personal contact or other like it provides new challenges, likeness of the source, reduction in boredom etc.\nIn order to reduce resistance to change, the manager should involve people affected by change, actively seeking their thoughts and reactions to proposed changes. They must develop a proper attitude towards resistance to change and realize that it is neither good nor bad. The best way to minimize resistance to change is to involve those responsible for implementing it and those affected by it. People are more motivated towards successful completion when they feel that they are the valued participants in planning and implementing the change. Also ensure that people from all the levels of organization are involved in planning the change process and they should be listened carefully. In the early stages, manager should not launch into lengthy diatribes justifying the change as people are not interested in that. They want to be heard and have their concerns attended to. They must recognize that it takes time to work through reactions to change. Then people should be engaged in dialogue about the change. They should do this only after understanding the specific concerns of others completely. Change must be realistic, achievable and measurable.\nCommunication and education is helpful method to sort out the things when resistance is due to lack of information or inappropriate information and analysis. Though time consuming, this method provides great employee support if persuaded. When cause of resistance is difficulty in adjustment to changes, management support and facilitation do work at times. This is expensive and still unreliable way to overcome the change. Manipulation of some information is necessary some times in order to avoid negative reactions by the employee. The people that easily accept changes and get adapted to changing atmosphere can set an example for others and hence they follow the suit. Therefore, they should be the first target of change program.\nThree basic steps- planning, implementation, and evaluation of outcomes of both the plan and implementation are involved in the change process. Resistance to change should be dealt ideally with planning and early stages of implementation. For proper planning for change, a manager must consider about how and when the change is needed and the way it should be communicated to the employees for their better support. Managers should pay attention to the focus of change, the amount of change, and the rate of change in order to implement change. Evaluation of outcomes of change is also very important as all the change efforts are result oriented. If change is not monitored, its effectiveness cannot be measured. This can be done by collecting data and comparing the results against original goals.\nTo wind up at the end of an interesting discussion we can conclude that a degree of resistance is normal since change is disruptive and stressful but in general, most people have mixed reactions towards purposed change, so the change agents can be helpful in highlighting the positive aspects in realistic manner. Although most people feel comfortable with minor changes, no one can live and work by yesterdayÃ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reality. Managers must reduce change in very effective, meaningful and healthy way without hurting the sentiments of the employees. By providing resources to support the changes, allowing enough time and flexibility and with the widespread commitment of people throughout the organization, change efforts will succeed.\n(2) Hultman, K.

14	I've been reading conflicting information about protein sources in animal products. Could you explain which animal-based foods provide the most efficient sources of essential amino acids and why?	All meat products contain the nine essential amino acids, but lean meats are considered the optimal source as they lack the saturated fats found in red meat that can hinder nutrient absorption and cause diseases. Fish is also rich in essential amino acids and provides omega-3, though caution is needed due to potential mercury contamination. Dairy products, particularly low-fat options like cottage cheese and yogurt, contain all nine essential amino acids. Eggs are also a complete protein source, with a single egg containing all essential amino acids required by the human body.	['Amino acids are the building blocks of the human body as they are, essentially, what protein is composed of. Our bodies use amino acids to repair tissue, regenerate cells, and carry out various other essential functions.\nWithout amino acids, the body would be unable to carry out its most basic function — the preservation and continuation of the individual.\nTypes of Amino Acids\nThere are 20 amino acids that fall into two categories: non-essential and essential.\nThe human body produces non-essential amino acids for various uses. These nutrients are called non-essential as the body synthesizes them, and we do not need to obtain them from food sources.\nThese are the 11 Non-Essential Amino Acids:\n- Aspartic acid\n- Glutamic acid\nEssential amino acids are vital nutrients that the human body cannot synthesize. The only way to ensure that your body gets a steady supply of essential amino acids is by obtaining these nutrients through your diet.\nHere’s a list of the 9 Essential Amino Acids:\nFoods Containing Essential Amino Acids\nYou can ensure a steady supply of essential amino acids by consuming a complete diet. Any protein-rich food source will contain most (if not all) nine essential amino acids.\nThat being said, the quantity of each amino acid will differ based on the food source.\nPopular Non-Vegan Sources of Amino Acids\nAll meat is rich in protein and contains the nine essential amino acids required for proper functioning.\nHowever, lean meats are the optimal source of essential amino acids as they are free from the saturated fats found in red meat. Lean meat causes fewer diseases and does not hinder the absorption of nutrients as much as red meat, making it a more efficient source of amino acids.\nMost fish are rich in essential amino acids and also give the body a healthy supply of omega-3.\nHowever, you want to be more cautious with fish and its source, as most seafood today is laden with mercury poisoning.\nCottage cheese, yogurt, and other low-fat, high-protein dairy products often contain all nine essential amino acids.\nEggs are also a complete source of protein, and a single egg contains all the essential amino acids required by the human body.\nMost resources on the web will claim that complete protein sources can only be found in non-vegan foods. However, as long as you eat the right food, you can ensure you’re getting all nine essential amino acids from a vegan diet.\nHow to get Essential Amino Acids on a Vegan Diet\nAs we are already aware, a vegan diet abstains from any animal products, seeking to obtain all nutrition from plant sources.\nNot only do plants have all the proteins we need, but they are also devoid of the saturated fats and cholesterol that accompany animal protein sources.\nEven incomplete plant proteins (food sources without all nine essential amino acids) can be paired with other plant protein sources to ensure you’re consuming a holistic nutrient profile.\nFor example, some grains like brown rice are low in lysine, an essential amino acid. As such, it cannot be considered a complete source of protein. But eating rice with lentils or beans, both of which are high in lysine, will ensure that you’re getting all the essential amino acids.\nMost plant sources of protein contain many if not all the essential amino acids. And consumed with other plant protein sources, you can ensure you’re getting the nutrients your body needs.\nHere are a few vegan sources of essential amino acids.\nQuinoa is a super grain that has been in vogue in the health industry for years now. But it isn’t just a fancy new health fad being taken up by fitness fanatics.\nQuinoa is a complete source of protein, containing all nine essential amino acids required by the body. A single cup (185 gms) of quinoa provides roughly 8 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber. The presence of fiber helps your body digest and synthesize the amino acids effectively.\nQuinoa also provides other essential nutrients that can’t be found in other grains, including magnesium, zinc, and iron. The best part is that quinoa can replace the grains you’re used to cooking with, and it makes for a protein-rich substitute to regular breakfast cereals.\nJapanese soba noodles are made using buckwheat, and they’re packed with protein. While buckwheat isn’t as popular as quinoa or even as protein-rich (one cup contains 6 grams), it’s a complete source of protein containing all nine essential amino acids.\nBuckwheat can be consumed like quinoa, as part of the main course accompanied by gravy, or as a breakfast cereal when appropriately cooked.\n3. Sprouted Bread\nBread made from sprouted grains and legumes is much richer in amino acids than regular bread. One such example is Ezekiel bread, a type of bread made using sprouted grains, including barley, soybeans, wheat, lentils, and millets.\nAs mentioned earlier, some grains may lack a specific essential amino acid that needs to be included through another food source.\nIn Ezekiel bread, whole grains and legumes ensure that all nine essential acids are made available to the human body. This means most sprouted bread can be considered a complete source of protein.\nStudies suggest that when grains and legumes are sprouted, the process exponentially increases the amino acids in the food made with these ingredients.\nPerhaps the most comprehensive protein available to man, spirulina is a vegan source of amino acids like no other on the planet.\nA single spoon (7 grams) of spirulina contains a whopping 4 grams of protein and is an excellent supplement for vegans. Spirulina is a complete source of protein and includes the nine essential acids in significant quantities.\nIn addition to amino acids, spirulina is rich in antioxidants, B vitamins, copper, iron, and other essential nutrients needed by the body.\nAs such, spirulina is an effective supplement for both vegan and non-vegans, and can help balance out nutritional deficits in the body.\n5. Hemp Hearts\nObtained from the cannabis plant, hemp hearts are the edible white pieces procured by cracking open the hemp seed. It’s important to remember that the hemp seed itself can be toxic and cause digestive issues, so it’s best to purchase hemp hearts from a company distributing them directly.\nHemp hearts are incredibly nutritious and a complete source of protein. Aside from the nine essential amino acids, hemp hearts are also a rich source of omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids, which are vital to the body.\nThe best part is that hemp hearts can be added to almost any dish. They have a mild nutty flavor and can enhance the taste of salads, smoothies, cereal bowls, and desserts.\n6. Chia Seeds\nChia seeds are a complete source of protein, giving the body all the essential amino acids along with a serving of omega-3 fatty acids.\nWith the correct technique, chia seeds can be made to mimic eggs and used in baking vegan goodies. However, they can also be sprinkled on cereals, salads, and any dish you want to fortify with essential amino acids.\nIt’s important to remember that while chia seeds contain all the essential amino acids, the quantities vary. In fact, chia seeds are low in histidine, which needs to be supplemented with other sources of amino acids.\n7. Soy Protein\nMost soy products are sources of complete protein, giving the human body all the essential amino acids.\nTofu – The most popular soy product out there, tofu is made using soy milk pressed into blocks that can be chopped up and cooked in various ways. Tofu is highly bland with a mild trace of soy and can absorb any flavors you add to it.\nTempeh – Made using fermented soybeans, tempeh tends to be much denser than tofu, with a thick, nutty flavor. Like tofu, tempeh takes on the taste and flavor of the spices you add to it. Additionally, tempeh has a texture similar to meat, making it the ideal vegan substitute for meat dishes.\nSoy Milk – Soy milk, extracted from soybeans, is a complete protein source and an excellent supplement to a diet deficient in protein. You can add soymilk to cereals and smoothies and even use it for baking certain goodies.\nThe nine essential amino acids are vital to the functioning of a healthy body. A lack of any of these nutrients for a prolonged period can lead to muscle loss, especially in older adults.\nBut as you can see, all the amino acids can be obtained even on a vegan diet. Aside from the food sources here, do your research and pair foods that give you different amino acids so you’re able to obtain all the necessary nutrients.']	['<urn:uuid:4d791972-9954-4376-bd74-03e4a08066c0>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	28	92	1449
15	How has cheerleading impacted a team member with Down syndrome?	Keslie Miller, a 20-year-old with Down syndrome, has fulfilled her longtime dream of being a cheerleader. She participates in home basketball games, performs cartwheels, and does thigh stands. More importantly, cheerleading has helped her feel included and equal to other girls, showing her that anything is possible with hard work.	"['A Cheer For Keslie: Achieving A Longtime DreamPosted: Updated:\nIt\'s a Tuesday night and the Massena Red Raiders are taking on the Malone Huskies on home court.\nA crowd of students and parents are there to watch the game and off to the sideline is the high school\'s cheer squad.\nStanding proud in the second row is 20 year old Keslie Miller, the squad\'s newest member.\n""I love being a cheerleader,"" Keslie said.\nKeslie was born with Down syndrome, but it didn\'t stop her from wanting to live her dream. Her mother, Lisa Russell, says being a cheerleader is something she\'s wanted since she was a little girl.\n""She saw the competitions I\'d watch on TV and so she\'d jump around the room and cheer and stuff.""\nOne day during class, Keslie told her teacher, Roxanne Howard, that her dream was to be a cheerleader. When Howard heard that, she took matters into her own hands.\n""I communicated with her mom and dad and with the coach and the athletic director to make sure that it was a possibility and they were all very happy and excited to have her.""\nKeslie joined the squad in December. Sandra Brault is the cheer squad\'s coach. She says even though she was excited to have Keslie join, she had to do a few things differently.\nShe never coached someone with a disability before.\n""We did a lot of one on one,"" she said. ""Everybody on the squad pretty much took turns -- I either put one on one or two on one with her so we put her slightly away so she could concentrate with a smaller crowd so she didn\'t feel overwhelmed.""\nIn the few months that Keslie has been on the squad, she\'s learned a lot.\nShe does most of the cheers at the school\'s home basketball games, does cartwheels in between quarters, and even gets lifted by the other cheerleaders in a thigh stand.\n""I feel lifted like an airplane,"" she said.\nEven though Keslie gets to do some cheers and wave some pom-poms, there\'s so much more that cheerleading has given her.\n""When she\'s on the court,"" her dad, Danny Miller, said, ""she\'s like any one of the other girls and she\'s not being picked on or separated.""\n""This has really made her feel like anything is possible, that if she works hard at it she can do this, she can be a cheerleader,"" her teacher said.\n""Just do it to it and just follow my dreams -- I hope come true,"" Keslie said.\nKeslie isn\'t the only one who won. Her fellow cheerleaders say they\'re better for having her there.\n""I love it,"" cheerleader Austin Plante said. If we aren\'t getting things right at practice she\'s right there to clap us on, cheer us on, get right back up there and try it again.""\n""I felt like it would bring us all together and make everybody happy,"" cheerleader Amber Meyer said, ""and we all love her to pieces.""\nKeslie has one year of high school left.

16	what are benefits and risks of feeding alfalfa hay to horses and how does mineral balance affect health	Alfalfa hay is beneficial as a protein and calcium-rich forage source, particularly good for young growing horses and lactating mares. However, it comes with risks - it can be too rich for most horses leading to obesity, causes excess nitrogen excretion, and may contain toxic blister beetles. Regarding mineral balance, it's crucial that minerals are properly balanced in the horse's diet since minerals interact with each other. For example, too much of one mineral can lead to deficiencies in others that compete with it. This is illustrated by the copper-zinc relationship - excess copper without matching zinc can lead to zinc deficiency symptoms like poor hoof quality, decreased coat condition, and wood chewing behavior.	['The topic of supplements has become quite complex. Knowing the basic nutritional elements your horse requires can improve his health and well-being.\nNutrition isn’t an exact science. When it comes to designing a nutritional program that includes the right supplements for optimum health and performance, there are many conflicting opinions. With the advent of processed and engineered foods, nutrition has become an even more complicated issue. In order to achieve perfect health, we’re left to research and study these complexities for ourselves and our equine companions.\nOne of the most critical mysteries lies in the area of supplements, such as vitamins and minerals. How much should you and your horse take? What does the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) really mean? Are you and your equine partner getting enough, or too much, of what your bodies need? Is the balance appropriate? How are you to know?\nAs we begin to explore basic nutritional requirements, let’s first discuss the importance of whether the nutrients provided in supplements are being used by our bodies or eliminated as waste products.\nHow we process nutrients\nMost of the nutrients in the foods we consume are absorbed in the gut. This applies to all animals – including humans and horses. The nutrients enter the system through the walls of the small intestine. So it’s critical that we accomplish the following in order to achieve good health and optimum performance:\n•Ensure that the gut is healthy and functioning properly.\n•Consume foods that contribute to optimal digestion and maintain proper gut function.\n•Ensure that any added supplements (vitamins and minerals) are bio-available.\n•Ensure that the intake of supplements is properly balanced.\nAn “essential mineral” is one that is required for survival, or at least for health. Essential minerals include calcium, chlorine, chromium, cobalt, copper, iodine, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, silicon, sodium, sulfur, and zinc.\nMinerals play fundamental roles in all living organisms. Many are active parts of enzymes that perform chemical conversions in our bodies. Others are structural components of certain tissues – such as silicon, which strengthens connective tissue, nails and hooves. Still others serve as regulators and signalers; potassium, for example, is involved in controlling the activity of nerve cells.\nWhat is bio-availability?\nIn order for minerals to be of maximum use, their chemical makeup must be usable by the body, so the body can absorb and utilize them to meet its needs. This is what is meant by bio-availability. “Minerals enter the body mostly as components of food,” writes Russell Mills in Mineral Transport. “To become bio-available, mineral atoms must be combined with other elements to form chemical compounds. For example, the body gets most of its manganese not from nodules of manganese metal, but from manganese-containing substances in food — that is, from plant and animal tissues in which the manganese is already incorporated into enzymes similar to those that our own bodies will make from it.\n“There is thus a great deal of mineral recycling going on in the biosphere: mineral compounds travel from one organism to another when the latter eats the former,” Mills continues. “But not all of the minerals found in biological organisms are the result of such recycling of mineral compounds. Some minerals enter the biological world when elemental minerals are converted to chemical compounds in the soil or elsewhere. As elemental minerals get converted to mineral compounds, these simple inorganic compounds become bio-available to plants. The plants then perform the conversion to more complex organo-mineral compounds which makes them bio-available to other organisms – to animals, for example.”\nWhen mineral compounds are consumed in food, the body must somehow absorb the minerals from the digestive tract and make them available to the tissues and cells where they’re needed. This process is not a simple one.\nSo how do these essential minerals become bio-available? By attaching an amino acid to the mineral component, forming an amino acid chelate. Amino acids act as chelators when they react with positively charged metal atoms (the minerals, in this case), forming a strong chemical bond.\nThe argument in favor of using amino acid-chelated minerals goes like this: the body is very efficient at absorbing amino acids. Dipeptides (two amino acids linked together via the amino group of one and the acid group of the other) are especially well absorbed thanks to a dedicated transport system found in cells of the intestinal wall. When mineral atoms are strongly bonded (i.e., chelated) to dipeptides, they get dragged by the dipeptides across the intestinal lining and into the body.\nMinerals that enter the body in an inorganic (non-chelated) form do not efficiently pass through the lining of the intestines, and we eliminate them as waste through our kidneys and digestive system.\nWhat to look for\nNow you know why chelated minerals are so important. They are bio-available to your body, and your horse’s, and can be utilized to improve health and performance.\n1. Always look for amino acid chelates on your nutritional labels.\n2. Avoid comparing the amounts of chelated and non-chelated minerals listed on ingredient labels. You won’t be comparing apples to apples. For instance, if you think that 500 mg of non-chelated calcium looks better and more powerful than 250 mg of chelated calcium, you will be mistaken.\n3. Search for products with a proper balance of chelated minerals. Minerals interact with one another in the body. Too much of one will lead to a deficiency of others that compete with it, creating an out-of-balance situation in the body. The balance of minerals is a complicated topic best left for another article; the important thing is that you look through the ingredients and make sure you find at least one chelated form of each mineral (or most of them).\nBe a smart consumer\nAs you can imagine, the chelation process makes the production of mineral supplements more costly. Non-chelated, non-bio-available mineral supplements may be less expensive – but they’re not useful to the body. In order to draw consumers, or offer a product that boosts only one or two minerals to achieve a specific result, manufacturers often use only a few chelated minerals. They then refer to their product as containing amino acid chelates. But since only a few of the minerals are bio-available and absorbed by the body, you are creating an imbalance by using these products. Imbalances result in mineral deficiencies, so this is something to be very cautious of when researching supplements for yourself and your horse.\nProducers of animal feeds are notorious for offering chelated forms of copper in their foods. This gives the animals a briefly healthy “bloom” in the coat color. Many old-timers in sale barns used a similar technique by putting pennies in the water buckets for a few weeks before a sale. This would give the horses a brighter coat color for a short time and make them more appealing to potential buyers. However, as the body continued to absorb copper without an appropriate matching amount of zinc, the “sister” mineral to copper, the new owners began to see signs of a zinc deficiency, such as poor hoof quality, decreased coat condition, and wood chewing behavior. Horses low in zinc also often lick or rub their teeth on galvanized steel gates as they seek more zinc.\nTo keep your horse and yourself healthy and happy, you need to fully understand what you’re putting into your bodies. Always read nutrition labels – what looks good on the outside may not be so great on the inside!', 'Equine Nutrition from A to Z\nFeeding your horse may seem like a complex task, but it can be simple with our glossary of equine nutrition terms.\nHolly Werner |\nAbundant in protein and calcium, alfalfa is a good source of forage for young, growing horses and lactating mares. For most other horses, it can be too rich and lead to obesity. The high protein concentration can lead to excess nitrogen intake, which is excreted in the urine, causing a pungent ammonia smell in the stable. Western states in particular grow a lot of alfalfa and tend to feed it in the form of hay cubes because baled hay is harder to come by in these areas.\nAnother drawback to keep in mind if feeding alfalfa hay is blister beetles, which produce a poisonous substance called cantharidin that is toxic when fed to horses. Be sure to break open a few flakes and inspect them for traces of blister beetles before purchasing alfalfa hay.\nBeet pulp is a high-fiber roughage source that is easily digested by horses. Since it is purchased in dry form and expands when wet, you should soak it for a length of time before feeding it to your horse. It does not contain sufficient potassium for the horse’s diet, however, so if fed in large amounts as a fiber source, potassium must be supplemented. Molasses will add potassium, but it is made mainly of sugar. Although flavorful, too much sugar can upset the horse’s digestive system. Many pre-formulated mixed feeds contain beet pulp to increase fiber content and will have the correct nutrient balance.\nConcentrates are grain mixtures formulated specifically for horses as a concentrated source of energy (calories). They provide much more energy per pound than hay or pasture, so be careful not to overfeed these. The horse’s digestive tract is not equipped to handle large meals of starchy carbohydrates, so it is best to feed only small amounts of grain at a time, preferably dividing them into at least three meals a day. This will still keep your horse at a good weight. Most lightly worked horses will maintain condition from high-quality hay or pasture grazing alone. Only horses in moderate or heavy work will need the added calories supplied by grain. If you opt to feed concentrates, do not exceed the amount specified by the manufacturer, and store feed in air-tight containers where loose horses and barn pests cannot get into it.\nThe digestive system of a horse works very differently from that of a human. Food passes quickly through a relatively small stomach designed to take in frequent meals throughout the course of the day. In the small intestine, enzymes digest starch, protein and fat.\nThe “hindgut” of the horse is made up of the cecum (a pouch between the small and large intestine), the small intestine, the large intestine and the rectum. The hindgut contains a beneficial bacteria population that breaks down fibrous plant material into energy that the horse can use as fuel.\nHorses cannot vomit and are therefore more prone to digestive disruptions, such as choke and colic, than other animals.\nIn general, horses that are properly fed are more likely to be too fat than too thin. If you have a healthy but overweight “couch potato” horse that is just fed hay and/or a reasonable amount of pasture (i.e., no grain), it’s time to increase the exercise regimen to get him to a healthy body condition. As with humans, a good diet should always be combined with reasonable exercise to promote the best possible health.\nUnlike humans, horses are able to extract energy from the fiber in their diet. The fiber is converted to volatile fatty acids (VFAs) by a bacterial fermentation process in the hindgut; the VFAs are then used to synthesize glucose (sugar) for immediate energy or are converted to fat for storage.\nHorses need to eat a large amount of fiber each day to keep their gut active and free of problems, such as colic. A strong urge to chew on fibrous material also means horses may develop vices such as wood-chewing and stall-walking if they become bored without hay or pasture to consume. Since horses can handle only small amounts of concentrated energy in the form of grain, the bulk of the diet should be free-choice forage (hay or pasture), preferably with a lot of natural long-stem matter as opposed to pelleted hay or small cubes.\nGood-quality pasture is a wonderful source of energy, protein, fiber and vitamins. Horses enjoy grazing and are designed to move around, eating grass in a herd situation. In most areas, however, pasture space is limited and careful maintenance is required to keep turnout time healthy and productive. Regularly removing manure helps break the fly and parasite life cycles, while resting fields by rotating horses to other paddocks will allow grass to recover and keep undesirable weeds to a minimum.\nWhen purchasing hay for your horse, assess its freshness; it should not be dusty or smell moldy or musty. Moldy hay contributes to respiratory ailments in horses. The more mature the hay is when it’s harvested, the more stemmy and high in fiber/low in protein it will be. While this may be nutritionally adequate for lightly ridden horses and easy keepers, it is also less palatable and may not get eaten at all.\nHay cut earlier has more leafy material, calories and protein. Horses are usually quite eager to eat it, but it may also lead to weight gain if fed free-choice. A good idea is to feed the “younger,” tastier hay at meal time and leave the more mature hay available free-choice for snacking on whenever the horse wants something to keep him busy.\nThe two types of hay are grass and legume. Examples of grass hay are orchard grass, Bermuda grass and timothy. Legume hays include alfalfa and clover. Many hay producers grow mixed fields for “combination” hay—for example, orchardgrass and clover.\nWhen starches and sugars are consumed, the body releases insulin, a hormone that cues absorption and storage of sugar from the bloodstream. Overfeeding starch and sugars can make horses “insulin resistant,” meaning the body cannot absorb glucose properly to fuel the body.\nAlthough obese horses are more at risk for insulin resistance, it also occurs in horses of normal weight. The condition is known to be associated with repeated bouts of laminitis. Although there is no cure, insulin resistance can be controlled by managing or eliminating concentrates, grains and lush pasture from the diet.\nArthritis and degenerative joint disease are common problems in performance horses. They can often be managed with joint supplements that allow a horse to continue a useful athletic career. These can be administered topically, orally, intramuscularly, intravenously or intra-articularly (directly into the joint).\nCommon oral supplements include glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) and avocado soybean unsaponifiable extracts (ASU). Limited studies have been done on orally administered joint supplements, but the data suggest they may be helpful in controlling and even protecting against certain joint problems.\nKentucky bluegrass is a cool-season grass (Poa pratensis) that grows best in spring and fall, and resists trampling and close grazing quite well. It is found in lawns and horse pastures across the nation due to its ability to grow in most soils and to withstand cold.\nAlso called founder, this disease is a painful inflammation of the tissue within the foot that connects the hoof wall to the coffin bone. It can cause extreme lameness and may require euthanasia. It most commonly occurs in the front hooves. In severe cases, the coffin bone inside the hoof tears away from the hoof wall and rotates downward, causing a permanent need for corrective trimming and shoeing.\nThe exact physical mechanism that causes laminitis is still somewhat of a mystery, but many of the triggers are well-known. For instance, ponies and easy-keeping or overweight horses tend to be most prone to laminitis when allowed to eat large quantities of lush grass. Particularly in the springtime, grass stores a sugar called fructan, which has been linked to triggering laminitis. Fructan levels vary widely in different types of grass, from region to region, throughout the year, and even throughout the day.\nIf your horse has a history of severe laminitis (which your veterinarian can determine by looking at and X-raying his hooves), he is much more likely to be predisposed to another bout, so you should be particularly vigilant about limiting his turnout on grass or use a grazing muzzle. Turning him out in a dirt paddock (“dry lot”) with plenty of mature hay to munch on is usually the best solution for keeping him healthy.\nThe microbes in a horse’s hindgut include beneficial bacteria, protozoa and fungi. These unseen friends ferment fiber coming through the digestive tract, releasing carbon dioxide, VFAs and a small amount of methane. As mentioned previously, the VFAs are readily absorbed and converted to energy. In fact, it has been shown that 30 percent or more of the horse’s total energy is derived from VFAs.\nThe important thing to remember about this energy production is that you’re not only feeding your horse, you’re feeding the good bacteria, as well. They require a steady stream of fiber to do their job and keep your horse healthy. Digestive disturbances can occur if the horse’s feed changes suddenly, leading to the death of certain bacteria, which then release endotoxins into the horse’s system. Endotoxins can trigger colic or laminitis, potentially fatal conditions that—at the very minimum—will result in a costly vet bill.\nThe general categories of nutrients required by horses are energy, carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, minerals and water. Keep this big picture in mind when thinking about how to divide up your horse’s daily feeding regimen. Energy in the form of carbohydrates (mainly from fiber) should make up the great majority of a horse’s feed intake. Protein and fat are not required in large amounts in lightly worked mature horses, and vitamin and mineral needs are met with hay or pasture and a trace-mineral salt block.\nVegetable oil and other high-fat supplements are often used to increase the calorie content of feed for horses that have high energy requirements (such as hard keepers or those in heavy athletic work) without feeding large amounts of high-starch grain. Other benefits of adding oil or fat to the diet include a shiny coat and decreased excitability.\nCorn oil is a palatable, high-fat product easily available to most horse owners. If you’re switching to a high-fat diet for your horse, begin slowly with small amounts and work up to the amount needed to keep your horse in good weight (while still providing adequate fiber) over at least two weeks’ time, so as not to suddenly disturb the microbe balance in the hindgut. For most horses, fat can be fed quite sparingly to meet energy needs, as too much can lead to obesity. Talk to your vet to see how much oil to feed your horse.\nAdult horses in light work have relatively low protein requirements; if they are eating enough forage and concentrates to maintain good weight, they are probably not protein-deficient. Dietary forage in the form of legumes (including clover or alfalfa hay) is very high in protein. This particularly benefits young, growing horses and nursing mares, which have much higher protein requirements in order to supplement their developing foal.\nIt is important not to cut corners when it comes to feeding your horse. Cheap hay may seem to save money, but if it is moldy or filled with weeds and other contaminants (such as trash or dead animals), it can upset the digestive system and cause colic. Always inspect hay, grains and supplements, including oil, to be sure they are not moldy or rancid. If you are unsure, do not feed it.\nHay should look uniform from one bale to the next. Grain should smell fresh, and supplements should not be fed after they expire, or if they’ve been sitting in a hot feed room for too long. Always keep hay shaded and protected from rain (by a shed or tarps) to prevent nutrient loss from moisture and sunlight. Take good care of your horse’s feed, and it will take good care of your horse.\nStabilized rice bran provides supplementary fat to the equine diet—but only about 30 percent by weight, versus nearly 100 percent fat in oil. However, it lasts longer on the shelf than vegetable oil.\nA word of caution to keep in mind is that rice bran may have an inverted calcium-phosphorus ratio (more phosphorus than calcium, resulting in a calcium shortage). Therefore, additional calcium must come from other parts of the diet if you feed large amounts of rice bran.\nOlder equines often have special dietary needs. Weight loss is a common problem, mainly due to poor dentition or metabolic problems. If a horse has lost some or all of his teeth, he may require a diet of soaked hay pellets to maintain a healthy weight.\nAlso available and convenient is equine “senior feed,” which is meant to be a complete source of nutrition, taking into account the special protein, vitamin and mineral requirements of the equine senior.\nThe first stop along the digestive pathway for a horse’s feed is his mouth. The incisors clip grass and the molars grind hay, grass and grains before they are sent to the stomach. Since horses consume a lot of tough, stemmy material and incidental dirt and sand from the ground, teeth can be quickly and unevenly worn down. Since they grow continuously from the root throughout the horse’s life, it is important to have them rasped (or “floated”) to eliminate sharp edges that may cause the horse pain or lead to the inability to eat. A veterinarian should float your horse’s teeth at least once a year so he is comfortable chewing his food and can receive proper nutrition.\nWhile we often think of ulcers as being a human condition, horses also suffer from this ailment. Some studies have found that as many as 80 to 90 percent of show and race horses are affected. Symptoms include poor body condition and a decline in athletic performance.\nManagement is critical to prevent ulcers from occurring in the first place. Feeding many small, high-roughage meals keeps the stomach busy and prevents acids from perforating its lining. Keeping horses on pasture as much as possible during the day, especially in a herd, is good for them mentally, and seems to be correlated with a decrease in ulcer occurrence.\nThe two most important supplementary vitamins for horses are A and E. When a horse is fed a diet entirely of hay, these nutrients may be insufficient because of how quickly they decline after forage is harvested and stored. Concentrates or low-calorie ration-balancers designed specifically for horses are usually formulated to complement a diet of hay and will provide adequate supplementation of these vitamins.\nIt is critical for horses to always have access to clean, fresh water, which is more appealing when it’s not extremely hot or cold. Water is not only required for body fluid balance, but also for digestion and gastrointestinal health. Stagnant ponds are not an acceptable source of water.\nBuckets and troughs that don’t refill automatically should be scrubbed daily, as water sitting in them can quickly become dirty. Automatic waterers should also be tended to regularly—both cleaned and inspected for leaks.\nX = Weight\nTo accurately determine your horse’s weight without using a scale, use the following formula:\n= (heart girth) x (heart girth) x (length) 330\nThis will give you a more accurate weight in pounds (for horses over one year of age) compared to using the commonly available “weight tapes.” For best results, use a 75-inch (or greater) plastic measuring tape, as fabric tends to stretch and metal tape measures do not bend enough. The heart girth circumference measurement should be taken straight down from the highest point of the withers, and length should be taken from the point of the shoulder to the point of the buttock (halfway around the buttock). Regularly measure your horse’s weight to see if his feeding program is keeping weight on him, or causing him to gain or lose too much weight.\nFoals, weanlings and yearlings have different nutritional needs than mature horses. They generally require higher amounts of protein and calories than adult horses to ensure proper growth and development, but care must be taken not to overdo it.\nThere is some evidence linking rapid weight gain and obesity in young horses with bone and joint development problems that can affect the horse for the rest of his life. If you have a young horse, ask your vet to help design a healthy feeding program for his needs.\nZinc is a micromineral found in many enzymes produced in the horse’s system and is rarely deficient in adult horses. Zinc is probably most important for its interaction with copper, as too much dietary zinc can create a copper deficiency. Copper deficiency is of greatest concern in foals, as there is evidence linking this to limb deformities and other developmental problems. Companies that manufacture equine feeds take the zinc/copper ratio into account and formulate the ratio of these minerals accordingly.\nYour horse’s digestive system and the nutrients he needs work in a delicate balance to keep him healthy. Talk to your vet or go online to find your nearest county equine extension specialist (www.csrees.usda.gov/ Extension/index.html) to help you customize a diet appropriate for your horse.\nSenior Associate Editor Holly Werner has an M.S. in Animal Science specializing in equine nutrition.\nThis article originally appeared in the 2010 issue of Horses USA.

17	What is the default recommended housing condition for laboratory mice?	Group housing or pair housing are the recommended default housing conditions since mice are social animals.	['Better together or happier apart? The effects of housing on stress in mice\nBetter Together or Happier Apart? Investigating the Effects of Housing on Stress in Mice\nDoes housing mice on their own affect animal welfare and reduce experimental validity? Researchers at the University of Brussels (Buckinx et al) investigated this question using EthoVision XT video tracking software to automate their experiments .\nHousing Strategies for Mice\nResearch has shown that animal welfare is a key factor in animal experimentation, not only for minimizing stress in animal subjects, but also to ensure the validity of scientific results gained in this way [2, 3].\nSince mice are the most commonly used animals for biomedical research, the question of how best to house laboratory mice in order to minimize the amount of stress they experience is an important consideration in biomedical research .\nSince mice are social animals, group housing or pair housing are the recommended default housing conditions. However, aggression between male mice frequently means that single housing is more practical. Also, single housing might be a more favorable experimental condition in certain studies, for example when group environments might compromise specific individualistic behavioral variables that are under investigation. In such cases, single housing can help scientists draw conclusions aimed at changes to a mouse’s specific individual behavior based on stimuli from the experiment itself and not influenced by other mice present.\nIn the interests of maintaining the potential social benefits of group housing while precluding inter-male aggression, the use of cage dividers – which permit sensory contact between mice without physical contact – have been suggested for experiments where group housing is not possible.5\nAnalyzing Behavior, Movement and Activity Using EthoVision XT\nBuckinx et al decided to investigate the impact of different housing methods on the stress levels of mice in a series of tests .\nTheir research team first housed mice in a variety of conditions – single housed, pair housed, or pair housed with a cage divider – for several weeks. After this period, the researchers used EthoVision XT video tracking software to automatically monitor and analyze the movement and behavior of the mice during three different tests.\nOpen Field Test\nThe Open Field Test (OFT) is a test used to assess general activity levels, gross locomotor activity and exploration habits . In this test, the researchers used EthoVision XT to automatically calculate several parameters: total distance traveled, time spent in the center zone, and measurements to evaluate exploratory/locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior. The researchers found that while total distance traveled was statistically different between housing conditions in these experiments, the time spent in the center zone – a measure of anxiety-like behavior – did not differ significantly.\nElevated Plus Maze Test\nThe Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) test is used to investigate anxiety-like behavior . In this test, mice are placed in a cross-shaped maze elevated from the ground. Two of the arms of the plus-shaped maze are open, while the two other arms are enclosed, providing a more sheltered area that tends to get more (and longer) visits by mice that are more anxious.\nIn this test, EthoVision XT enabled the researchers to completely automate measurements of time spent in the open arms, total distance traveled, and exploratory/locomotor activity. The team observed that time spent in the open arms of this maze and the total distance traveled remained unaffected between housing conditions.\nFear Conditioning/Freezing Behavior\nFinally, the researchers used the auditory fear conditioning paradigm to study fear memory formation in the mice . In this test, EthoVision XT was used to examine freezing behavior in mice during habituation periods and as they were presented with various auditory stimuli. By defining “freezing” in terms of a difference between pixels (max 0.3%) in consecutive frames over a period of 1s, the researchers were able to use EthoVision XT to automate the process of data collection for this test. While there was a general trend recorded, no significant difference in freezing behavior was found between single and group housed mice in these fear retrieval tests.\nLearn more about fear conditioning in our free white paper\nSo what do these outcomes mean?\nThe results from the open field, elevated plus maze and fear conditioning test did not show any particular differences between mice that were singly or pair-wise housed, nor with a cage divider. This was unexpected considering the hypothesis of the study, stating that single housing would probably increase stress and anxiety (and would be decreased again by the cage divider). The authors suggest that this method is highly context-dependent, and should be further investigated before being considered a viable housing strategy in mice. Such investigations are extremely valuable for the ongoing improvements in animal welfare and ethics in general, which are made possible with powerful and versatile tool such as EthoVision XT.\nThe value of EthoVision XT\nEthoVision XT has evolved over the years from video tracking software into a fully-fledged software platform, offering full integration of data and automation of animal behavior experiments. From simple tests like open field to complex or high-throughput protocols, EthoVision XT provides accurate measurement of a huge range of parameters along with unparalleled versatility in data processing and visualization.

18	karma vs divine retribution differences explain	While both are divine laws, karma and divine retribution operate differently. Divine retribution, found in monotheistic faiths, involves God bringing evil-doers to justice through conventional worldly means, ranging from minor personal consequences to major events like the biblical Great Flood. In contrast, karma, shared by Buddhism and Hinduism, operates without the connotation of punishment - it's a natural universal law where our acts, whether good or bad, intentional or unintentional, naturally reflect back on us as part of the universe's operation.	"['In religious terms, divinity or godhead is the state of things that come from a supernatural power or deity, such as a god, supreme being, Creator-God or spirits, and are therefore regarded as sacred and holy. Such things are regarded as ""divine"" due to their transcendental origins, and/or because their attributes or qualities are superior or supreme relative to things of the Earth. Divine things are regarded as eternal and based in truth, while material things are regarded as ephemeral and based in illusion. Such things that may qualify as ""divine"" are apparitions, visions, prophecies, miracles, and in some views also the soul, or more general things like resurrection, immortality, grace, and salvation. Otherwise what is or is not divine may be loosely defined, as it is used by different belief systems.\nThe root of the word ""divine"" is literally ""godly"" (from the Latin deus, cf. Dyaus, closely related to Greek zeus, div in Persian and deva in Sanskrit), but the use varies significantly depending on which deity is being discussed. This article outlines the major distinctions in the conventional use of the terms.\nDivinity as a quality has two distinct usages:\n- Divine force or power - powers or forces that are universal, or transcend human capacities\n- Divinity applied to mortals - qualities of individuals who are considered to have some special access or relationship to the divine.\nOverlap occurs between these usages because deities or godly entities are often identical with and/or identified by the powers and forces that are credited to them — in many cases a deity is merely a power or force personified — and these powers and forces may then be extended or granted to mortal individuals. For instance, Jehovah is closely associated with storms and thunder throughout much of the Old Testament. He is said to speak in thunder, and thunder is seen as a token of his anger. This power was then extended to prophets like Moses and Samuel, who caused thunderous storms to rain down on their enemies. (See Exodus 9:23 and 1 Samuel 12:18.)\nDivinity always carries connotations of goodness, beauty, beneficence, justice, and other positive, pro-social attributes. In monotheistic faiths there is an equivalent cohort of malefic supranormal beings and powers, such as demons, devils, afreet, etc., which are not conventionally referred to as divine; demonic is often used instead. Pantheistic and polytheistic faiths make no such distinction; gods and other beings of transcendent power often have complex, ignoble, or even irrational motivations for their acts. Note that while the terms demon and demonic are used in monotheistic faiths as antonyms to divine, they are in fact derived from the Greek word daimón (δαίμων), which itself translates as divinity.\nIn monotheistic faiths, the word divinity is often used to refer to the singular God central to that faith. Often the word takes the definite article and is capitalized — ""the Divinity"" — as though it were a proper name or definitive honorific. Divine — capitalized — may be used as an adjective to refer to the manifestations of such a Divinity or its powers: e.g. ""basking in the Divine presence...""\nThe terms divinity and divine — uncapitalized, and lacking the definite article — are sometimes used as to denote \'god(s) or certain other beings and entities which fall short of absolute Godhood but lie outside the human realm. These include (by no means an exhaustive list):\nDivine force or power\nAs previously noted, divinities are closely related to the transcendent force(s) or power(s) credited to them, so much so that in some cases the powers or forces may themselves be invoked independently. This leads to the second usage of the word divine (and a less common usage of divinity): to refer to the operation of transcendent power in the world.\nIn its most direct form, the operation of transcendent power implies some form of divine intervention. For pan- and polytheistic faiths this usually implies the direct action of one god or another on the course of human events. In Greek legend, for instance, it was Poseidon (god of the sea) who raised the storms which blew Odysseus\' craft off course on his return journey, and Japanese tradition holds that a god-sent wind saved them from Mongol invasion. Prayers or propitiations are often offered to specific gods of pantheisms to garner favorable interventions in particular enterprises: e.g. safe journeys, success in war, or a season of bountiful crops. Many faiths around the world — from Japanese Shinto and Chinese traditional religion, to certain African practices and the faiths derived from those in the Caribbean, to Native American beliefs — hold that ancestral or household spirits offer daily protection and blessings. In monotheistic religions, divine intervention may take very direct forms: miracles, visions, or intercessions by blessed figures.\nTranscendent force or power may also operate through more subtle and indirect paths. Monotheistic faiths generally support some version of divine providence, which acknowledges that the divinity of the faith has a profound but unknowable plan always unfolding in the world. Unforeseeable, overwhelming, or seemingly unjust events are often thrown on \'the will of the Divine\', in deferences like the Muslim inshallah (\'as God wills it\') and Christian \'God works in mysterious ways\'. Often such faiths hold out the possibility of divine retribution as well, where the divinity will unexpectedly bring evil-doers to justice through the conventional workings of the world; from the subtle redressing of minor personal wrongs, to such large-scale havoc as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah or the biblical Great Flood. Other faiths are even more subtle: the doctrine of karma shared by Buddhism and Hinduism is a divine law similar to divine retribution but without the connotation of punishment: our acts, good or bad, intentional or unintentional, reflect back on us as part of the natural working of the universe. Philosophical Taoism also proposes a transcendent operant principle — transliterated in English as tao or dao, meaning \'the way\' — which is neither an entity or a being per se, but reflects the natural ongoing process of the world. Modern western mysticism and new age philosophy often use the term \'the Divine\' as a noun in this latter sense: a non-specific principle and/or being that gives rise to the world, and acts as the source or wellspring of life. In these latter cases the faiths do not promote deference, as happens in monotheisms; rather each suggests a path of action that will bring the practitioner into conformance with the divine law: ahimsa — \'no harm\' — for Buddhist and Hindu faiths; de or te — \'virtuous action\' — in Taoism; and any of numerous practices of peace and love in new age thinking.\nIn the third usage, extensions of divinity and divine power are credited to living, mortal individuals. Political leaders are known to have claimed actual divinity in certain early societies — the ancient Egyptian Pharaohs being the premier case — taking a role as objects of worship and being credited with superhuman status and powers. More commonly, and more pertinent to recent history, leaders merely claim some form of divine mandate, suggesting that their rule is in accordance with the will of God. The doctrine of the divine right of kings was introduced as late as the 17th century, proposing that kings rule by divine decree; Japanese Emperors ruled by divine mandate until the inception of the Japanese constitution after World War II\nLess politically, most faiths have any number of people that are believed to have been touched by divine forces: saints, prophets, heroes, oracles, martyrs, and enlightened beings, among others. Saint Francis of Assisi, in Catholicism, is said to have received instruction directly from God and it is believed that he grants plenary indulgence to all who confess their sins and visit his chapel on the appropriate day. In Greek mythology, Achilles\' mother bathed him in the river Styx to give him immortality, and Hercules — as the son of Zeus — inherited near-godly powers. In religious Taoism, Lao Tsu is venerated as a saint with his own powers. Various individuals in the Buddhist faith, beginning with Siddhartha, are considered to be enlightened, and in religious forms of Buddhism they are credited with divine powers. Muhammad and Christ, in their respective traditions, are each said to have performed divine miracles.\nIn general, mortals with divine qualities are carefully distinguished from the deity or deities in their religion\'s main pantheon. Even the Christian faith, which generally holds Christ to be identical to God, distinguishes between God the Father and Christ the begotten Son. There are, however, certain esoteric and mystical schools of thought, present in many faiths — Sufis in Islam, Gnostics in Christianity, Advaitan Hindus, Zen Buddhists, as well as several non-specific perspectives developed in new age philosophy — which hold that all humans are in essence divine, or unified with the Divine in a non-trivial way. Such divinity, in these faiths, would express itself naturally if it were not obscured by the social and physical worlds we live in; it needs to be brought to the fore through appropriate spiritual practices.\nIn traditional Christian theology, the concept and nature of divinity always has its source ultimately from God himself. It\'s the state or quality of being divine, and the term can denote Godly nature or character. In Hebrew, the terms would usually be ""el"", ""elohim"", and in Greek usually ""theos"", or ""theias"". The divinity in the Bible is considered the Godhead itself, or God in general. Or it may have reference to a deity. Even angels in the Psalms are considered divine or elohim, as spirit beings, in God\'s form. Redeemed Christians, when taken to heaven as immortalized born-again believers, according to Biblical verses, are said to partake of the ""divine nature"". (Psalm 8:5; Hebrews 2:9; 2 Peter 1:4)\n- Acts 17:29\n- ""Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to be like unto gold, or silver, or stone, the graving of art, and device of man.""\n- Romans 1:20\n- ""For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; his eternal power also, and divinity: so that they are inexcusable.""\n- Revelation 5:12\n- ""Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and benediction.""\nThe word translated as either ""deity"", ""Godhead"", or ""divinity"" in the Greek New Testament is also the Greek word θεότητος (theotētos), and the one Verse that contains it is this: Colossians 2:9\n- ""Quia in ipso inhabitat omnis plenitudo divinitatis [divinity] corporaliter."" (Vulgate)\n- ""For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily."" (KJV)\n- ""Because it is in him that all the fullness of the divine quality dwells bodily."" (NWT)\n- ""For in him all the fullness of deity lives in bodily form."" (NET)\n- ""For the full content of divine nature lives in Christ."" (TEV)\nThe word ""divine"" in the New Testament is the Greek word θείας (theias), and is the adjective form of ""divinity"". Biblical examples from the King James Bible are below:\n- 2 Peter 1:3\n- ""According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.""\n- 2 Peter 1:4\n- ""Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.""\nThe most prominent conception of divine entities in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is the Godhead, a divine council of three distinct beings: Elohim (the Father), Jehovah (the Son, or Jesus), and the Holy Spirit. Joseph Smith described a nontrinitarian Godhead, with God the Father and Jesus Christ each having individual physical bodies, and the Holy Spirit as a distinct personage with a spirit body. Smith also introduced the existence of a Heavenly Mother in the King Follett Discourse, but very little is acknowledged or known beyond her existence.\nMormons hold a belief in the divine potential of humanity; Smith taught a form of divinization where mortal men and women can become like god through salvation and exaltation. Lorenzo Snow succinctly summarized this using a couplet, which is often repeated within the LDS Church: ""As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man may be.""\n- Catholic Concept of the Divine\n- Ho\'oponopono (Morrnah section)\n- List of deities\nNotes and references\n- Wiktionary: ""divine (comparative more divine, superlative most divine) 1) of or pertaining to a god 2) eternal, holy, or otherwise supernatural 3) of superhuman or surpassing excellence 4) beautiful, heavenly\n- divine - Dictionary.com.\n- divine - Merriam Webster.\n- See, for example ""The Great Stag: A Sumerian Divinity"" by Bobula Ida (Yearbook of Ancient and Medieval History 1953)\n- note Augustine\'s argument that divinity is not a quality of God, but that ""God is [...] Divinity itself"" (Nature and Grace, part I, question 3, article 3) ""Whether God is the Same as His Essence or Nature""\n- This is sometimes a controversial issue, however; see , for example, for a discussion of the status of the Japanese emperor.\n- See, for example, ""The Divinity of Alpha\'s Jesus"" by Peterson & McDonald (Media Spotlight 25:4, 2002)\n- See, for example, ""Twelve Signs of Your Awakening Divinity"" by Geoffrey Hoppe and Tobias\n- divinity - The Free Dictionary.\n- D&C 130:22 ""The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man\'s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit.

19	how micro scale liquid liquid flow behaves in small channels and what are challenges scale up to production	In microscale channels (few hundred μm), liquid-liquid flows benefit from thinner fluid layers and large surface-to-volume ratios, leading to significantly better heat and mass transfer rates. The narrow residence time distributions result in higher efficiency processes. However, scaling up these processes presents challenges, particularly when moving to production scale. The main challenge is that many commercially available single-use bioreactors differ from classical stirred-tank designs in terms of vessel design, stirrer design, and gassing strategy. This lack of consistency and geometrical similarity across scales can complicate the scale-up process and add risk to process transfer. Scale-up requires generating solid process understanding at different scales to ensure consistent quality throughout scale-up from early clinical trials to final production scale.	['Research focusing on the flow and transport phenomena in complex two-phase systems.\nWe study the flow and intensified processing of complex multiphase mixtures. We are interested, in particular, in immiscible liquid-liquid mixtures, as well as particle or bubble suspensions in non-Newtonian fluids for energy and manufacturing applications. The aim of the research is to gain fundamental insights of the underpinning small scale flow and interfacial phenomena and their interactions with mass transfer, that we use to understand the global behaviour of the multiphase processes and to develop predictive models.\nOur work is supported by state of the art experimental facilities that include pilot scale flow rigs for studies of oil-water flows and processing of complex fluids, and bench scale setups for intensified and microscale flow and mass transfer studies.\nWe have available advanced instrumentation for studying velocity and concentration profiles (Particle Image Velocimetry, PIV and micro-PIV, hot film anemometry, Laser Induced Fluorescence), phase distribution (Electrical Resistance Tomography, ERT), rheology and interfacial properties, as well as a variety of local conductivity probes, made in-house, for investigating drop size, interface positioning and phase continuity.\nThe studies address areas such two-phase liquid flows in pipelines relevant to flow assurance in oil production and transportation, intensified liquid-liquid extractions and reactions for spent nuclear fuel reprocessing, metal separations and biofuel production, and processing of suspensions in complex fluids for healthcare applications.\n- Large scale liquid-liquid flows\nThe flow of oil and water inside a pipe is an important phenomenon which is often found in chemical and oil & gas industries, for example during transportation of crude oil and water mixture over long distances from offshore to onshore platforms. It is known when the two fluids flow together, they can flow in different flow patterns and each pattern can give arise to different pressure drop and energy consumption. With limited availability of the resources, it has now become essential to be able to predict accurately the flow patterns for increased production efficiency and for safety purposes as well as for future design of the system.\nOur team aims to characterize and understand different oil-water flow phenomena, focusing on different regions of the flow pattern map through both experimental and numerical investigations. Different inlet geometries, channel sizes and fluid properties are currently being studied. High speed camera is extensively used for flow pattern identification and to extract data such as drop sizes and wave characteristics. PIV and High Speed PIV are used to gain better understanding of the flows and a wide range of conductance probes are used to capture interfacial phenomena. Simulation results are compared against experimental data and used to design future experiments.\nYouTube Widget Placeholderhttps://youtu.be/UJWlhC1TW4s\nMicrofluidic devices in the range of a few hundred μm have received increased attention over the last decade driven by process intensification demands, notably in two-phase operations. With advantages such as thinner fluid layers and large surface-to-volume ratio, heat and mass transfer rates are significantly better and when coupled with narrow residence time distributions, a higher efficiency process can be achieved.\nOur group aims to gain fundamental understanding of micro-flow phenomena in two-phase systems. Studies involving interfacial mass transfer and recirculation patterns can be achieved with the state-of-the-art equipment within our research laboratory, such as, Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and micro Particle Image Velocimetry (µPIV). Currently, there are multiple ongoing research involving droplets formations and the displacement process within the microfluidic system.\nYouTube Widget Placeholderhttps://youtu.be/irluQIXLV_c YouTube Widget Placeholderhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOspRHePC6c\n- Intensified Processes\nIn ThAMeS, we develop innovative intensified technologies that have a direct impact on the energy industry and particularly the nuclear, biofuel, and hydrometallurgy sectors.\nThe main use of these technologies is in the recycling and reprocessing of metallic components from the (nuclear) waste, and thus reducing the amount of metals needed to be mined and reducing the volume (and toxicity) of the rest of the waste. In the production of biofuels new approaches based on waste oils and fats are substituting earlier ones that are controversially competing with crops for food.\nProcesses are performed in intensified, small-scale units (micro to milli scale), which reduce the amount of solvent volume required, and make possible the use of expensive solvents such as ionic liquids. The reduction in volume is compensated by the high efficiencies achieved. Rapid and efficient mixing is an important trait in these processes and is significantly enhanced in small channels by the short diffusion lengths, recirculation, and convection induced by surface tension gradients. The industrial application of intensified units requires a good understanding of the whole system and in ThAMeS we perform full hydrodynamic & mass transfer characterisation of the key features on multiphase flows.\nIn ThAMeS there is ongoing research to increase throughput using small-scale devices. Scale-out (or number-up), which is the use of parallel channels to increase the throughput in the two-phase contacting equipment, is mainly used instead of conventional scale-up (increase in size). The objective is to design multichannel reactors and increase the total processing capacity of the process. This is achieved by using novel methodologies based on resistance network models for multiphase mixtures.\nYouTube Widget Placeholderhttps://youtu.be/RY1wcrZvIjo\n- Coalescence Phenomena\nIn long-distance oil transportation, the coalescence of water or oil droplets affects the pressure drop and energy consuming. Previous studies reveal that drop coalescence is influenced by the fluid properties (density, viscosity and interfacial tension) and the operation conditions such as the relative velocity between two coalescence bodies. This research aims to find how the fluid properties and operation conditions affect the coalescence process and build models to predict the coalescence rate.\nYouTube Widget Placeholderhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmbH3UKdBE YouTube Widget Placeholderhttps://youtu.be/QKyHmb9-1kg YouTube Widget Placeholderhttps://youtu.be/of85NUCruEM\n- Processing of Complex Fluids\nNon-Newtonian fluids, such as paint, toothpaste, blood are ubiquitous in nature, and they are widely used in chemical engineering, bio-chemical engineering, food processing, oil exploration, and medical engineering.\nIn our group we use both experimental optical techniques and computational fluid dynamics to obtain critical information of different physical systems and tackle new manufacturing challenges. Specifically, our main interest focuses on the mixing of complex non-Newtonian liquid-liquid and solid-liquid mixtures in both batch and continuous processes with an insight into the rheological properties of the materials used.\nYouTube Widget Placeholderhttps://youtu.be/Vgvg5kMshms', 'During the past several years, single-use bioreactors have been gradually established in modern biopharmaceutical processes (1, 2). This adoption is directly linked to their unique ability to enhance flexibility and reduce investment and operational costs. Furthermore, production output can be increased, and time to market is shortened (3). Today a wide variety of single-use bioreactors exists for the cultivation of mammalian and insect cells (4), whereas only limited solutions are available for microbial cultures (5).\nTypically, processes are established and optimized in stirred-tank benchtop bioreactor systems. One challenge during the development of a robust cell culture process is the straightforward scale-up to final production scale. This is especially critical when using less-characterized bioreactor designs that deviate from the well-known and understood classical stirred-tank principle.\nScale-up is an important and potentially time-consuming step in the development of industrial processes. It involves much more than just doing the same at a larger volume. It requires the generation of solid process understanding at different scales to ensure consistent quality and titer throughout scale-up from early clinical trials to final production scale (6). Today, many companies use chemometric tools such as design of experiments and multivariate data analysis to establish critical process parameter ranges that define the design space of a robust production process. Especially during late-phase development of a commercial process, the availability of a properly representative scale-down model of full production scale is essential to allow efficient process development (7).\nDetailed understanding of bioreactor characteristics at different scales significantly facilitates the development and scale-up of robust production processes (6). Typical parameters of concern are oxygen transfer, mixing, and heat-transfer characteristics as well as the generated shear forces.\nDuring the past 30 years, stainless-steel stirred-tank bioreactors have evolved as the gold standard, especially as a result of their straightforward scale-up. Multiple times, their well-understood design principles have proven successful in development and scale-up to safe and robust commercial processes. Furthermore, they enable users to implement their existing knowledge — especially with platform processes — into production processes of new drugs and to set-up experiments in a way that can shorten development timelines.\nHowever, many commercially available single-use bioreactors differ from this gold standard. Vessel design, stirrer design, and gassing strategy especially may differ from the classical stirred-tank design principles and do not necessarily offer consistency and geometrical similarity across scales (8). So the scale-up exercise might be complicated, and additional risk might be added to the process transfer.\nTo offer a solution for that, Sartorius Stedim Biotech has developed a range of single-use bioreactors from 250 mL to 2,000 L working volume. Its designs are entirely based on proven stirred-tank bioreactor principles. This ensures straightforward scale-up to 2,000 L scale and beyond to facilitate process transfers to existing legacy production facilities.\nHere we detail the different design aspects of those bioreactors and their impact on critical process engineering parameters such as power input per volume, mixing time, and volumetric mass transfer (9). We compare the characteristics of the large scale single-use bioreactor family BIOSTAT STR to small-scale single-use bioreactor vessels such as the ambr250 (250 mL) and the single-use UniVessel SU 2L, which are typically used during process development, optimization, and characterization.\nDesign Principles and Suitable Scale-Up Criteria of Stirred-Tank Bioreactors\nGeometrical similarity of vessel design (amongst others defined by the height-to-diameter ratio and the impeller-to-vessel-diameter ratio) is commonly considered important for simple and straightforward scale-up of a process (10). This is especially critical as design changes across scales might influence mixing behavior, oxygen transfer, bubble dispersion, and various other key parameters. On the other hand, a homogenous culture environment across scales — where important cultivation parameters such as pH, oxygen partial pressure, temperature, and nutrient supply are well controlled — is a key prerequisite to establish a robust and safe production process. To characterize bioreactor performance across scales and govern scale-up, an appropriate criterion should be defined and kept constant during scale-up. In general, the power input per volume is used as scale-up criterion (10). Also, the tip speed or other shear-related parameters are often used, especially when using shear-sensitive cells (11) or when growing cells on microcarriers.\nBased on the very well-characterized, reusable, stirred-tank bioreactors, it is possible to assign relevant design criteria to single-use bioreactors for animal and microbial cells. One such criterion is the height-to-vessel-diameter ratio (H/D or aspect ratio), which should be kept within a range of 1:1 to 3:1 for stirred-tank reactors (10). A low value for an H/D ratio results in an increased ratio of headspace surface to filling volume, which enables an\nimproved gas exchange at the gas– liquid interface. On the other hand, a larger aspect ratio offers advantages in case of direct sparging due to the longer residence time of gas bubbles in the liquid and hence a higher oxygen-transfer rate (12). For animal cell cultivations, often a ratio of 2:1 is recommended (13).\nAnother parameter to consider is the ratio of impeller diameter to vessel diameter. This parameter should typically be between 0.33 and 0.5 for animal cells (14) and influences mixing efficiency and the generated shear forces. Three-blade-segment impellers or marine-type impellers are commonly used for animal cell cultures (15). They efficiently transform the transferred energy into hydrodynamic power and generate large circulation loops because of their axial flow patterns (16). Therefore, they are often preferred over Rushton-type disk impellers to achieve effective homogenization. Also, because of the lower dissipative energy transferred, this impeller type is more adequate for shear-sensitive cell lines. In comparison, disk impellers generate a radial flow, leading to higher power input per volume at a given stirrer speed and enhanced gas-bubble dispersion (11). It is common to install multiple impellers in bioreactors with an H/D ratio above 1:1.4 to ensure efficient mixing throughout the entire cultivation chamber.\nTo achieve suitable power input, the distance between the impellers is important. It is recommended to use a distance that is 1.2–1.5 times greater than the impeller diameter to guarantee that the impellers act independently of each other. Historically cell culture processes often used two three-blade segment impellers, but today many companies are using a combination of a Rushton-type impeller and a three-blade segment impeller. The disk impeller (installed right above the sparger) ensures good dispersion of the gas bubbles. A three-blade segment impeller serves as a superior axial mixer and ensures homogeneity in the entire vessel, thus supporting high–cell-density processes (17, 18). That approach has been facilitated by modern, more robust recombinant cell lines to grow at higher shear rates, which have been selected for commercial manufacturing at large scale (19).\nAnother determining factor for a successful cell culture process is the amount of gas transfer. In conventional bioreactor designs, a sparger is installed directly below the lower impeller, which ensures proper gas-bubble dispersion (14). Spargers with small holes generate small bubbles and improve oxygen transfer because of their high gas–liquid interface areas. Reusable bioreactors use sintered stainless steel microspargers. But this design has the disadvantage of nondefined pores, leading to coalescence of bubbles. Therefore, Sartorius Stedim Biotech\nhas developed a special microsparger design with 150 μm holes that provides a uniform bubble swarm of small bubbles for effective gas transfer. Spargers with large holes have a relatively low oxygen transfer but offer improved performance for CO2 stripping because bigger bubbles typically rise to the gas–liquid interface and carry excessive CO2 from the cell suspension to the headspace.\nAt small-scale, CO2 stripping is less of a challenge. It is more critical at larger volumes because of the higher hydrostatic pressure and thus improved solubility of CO2. Together with excessive foaming, that limits the efficiency of conventional 10 to 20 μm microspargers for large bioreactor volumes.\nSartorius Stedim Biotech Single-Use Bioreactors Emulate Classical Stirred-Tank Design\nMost large-scale, single-use bioreactors do not rely on established design criteria of reusable bioreactors, which can add risk to scaling-up processes. To overcome this, Sartorius Stedim Biotech offers a range of stirred single-use bioreactors (Figure 1) based on classical, well-proven design principles. Different scales exist, allowing to work from 250 mL to 2,000 L culture volumes.\nFor efficient, cost-conscious process development, highly automated, single-use multiparallel bioreactors are available at 250 mL scale (ambr250) (20). This high-throughput process development bioreactor system allows fast and effective establishment of optimal process conditions early in process development. With the classical stirred-tank design, straightforward scale-up is possible either directly for production of material for toxicological studies or through step-wise scale-up through 2 L scale using the UniVessel SU technology and 50 L scale using the BIOSTAT STR. With the UniVessel SU 2 L model, conventional glass vessels can be replaced easily even with already existing bioreactor controllers in development laboratories. The UniVessel SU design is similar to its glass counterpart and the large-scale single-use BIOSTAT STR design, thereby enabling straightforward scale-up all the way from development to commercial production and offering a single-use scale-down model for process characterization.\nThe BIOSTAT STR has a cylindrical shape with an H/D ratio of 2:1 and a semi-torispherical bottom and top. The impeller-to-bag-diameter-ratio is 0.38 with a distance between both impellers of 1.3× the impeller diameter. So the vessel design fits perfectly to the gold standard derived from reusable bioreactors for mammalian cell culture. Table 1 provides a detailed description of the geometrical dimensions of those closely linked single-use bioreactor families.\nThe impellers are installed on a rigid, central shaft. For agitation, 2 × 3-blade-segment impellers are available. For the BIOSTAT STR, a combination of a six-blade-disk (bottom) and three-blade-segment (top) impeller can be installed as an alternative.\nThe study presented here focuses on process engineering characterization of a configuration based on 2 × 3-blade-segment impellers for different single-use bioreactor volumes. Gas transfer has been characterized for a microsparger (hole diameter = 150 μm) or a ringsparger (hole diameter = 0.5 mm for the Univessel SU or 0.8 mm for the BIOSTAT STR) positioned below the lower impeller. The BIOSTAT STR is available with a combisparger (Figure 2) — consisting of both a microsparger (0.15 mm holes) and a ringsparger (0.8 mm holes). The microsparger supports high oxygen transfer, and the ringsparger enhances CO2 stripping. All single-use bioreactors from 250 mL scale to 2,000 L are equipped with precalibrated, single-use optochemical probes for pH and pO2 measurement. Alternatively, conventional probes can be introduced if desired for scales ≥2 L. All single-use bioreactors are available with standard digital control units.\nProcess Engineering Characterization\nWe performed in-house process engineering characterization of the UniVessel SU and BIOSTAT STR bioreactors. For the ambr250 system, we used data published by Bareither et al. (20). The process engineering characterization of the UniVessel SU and BIOSTAT STR family was performed at parameters typical for mammalian cell culture (tip speeds between 0.6–1.8 m/s). For the characterization of the ambr250 Bareither et al. used tip speeds ranging from 0.27 m/s to 1.02 m/s, which resulted in corresponding stirrer speeds from 200 to 800 rpm (20).\nFigure 3 graphs stirrer speed as a function of tip speed for the UniVessel SU and BIOSTAT STR systems. The increasing impeller diameters requires lower stirrer speeds at increasing scale to maintain the same tip speed.\nDuring in-house trials for the BIOSTAT STR and UniVessel SU bioreactors, the Newton number (Ne) was determined to characterize the different impeller types and configurations and to quantify the power input per volume. The Newton number was determined by torque measurements (8). For 2 × 3-blade segment impellers, we calculated a Ne of ~1.3. The fact that the Reynolds number (Re) is above 10,000 at the chosen tip-speed range implies that turbulent flow conditions are present, thus the Ne value is constant.\nThe power input per volume (P/VL) is an important process engineering parameter and can be calculated based on the experimentally determined Newton number. Figure 4 shows the power input per volume for the BIOSTAT STR and the UniVessel SU bioreactors. For the ambr system, Bareither et al. (20) reports a power input of 10–445 W/m³ for the tip speed. To maintain a constant P/VL value during scale-up, the tip speed will need to increase with increasing scale. That clearly demonstrates that users have to choose their scale-up criterion because it is not possible to keep both the tip speed and the power input per volume constant when increasing the bioreactor scale.\nWe determined mixing times for the BIOSTAT STR and UniVessel SU bioreactors using the decolorization method (14) to characterize the mixing capabilities of the single-use bioreactor systems. It is obvious that the mixing time decreases with increasing tip speed because of the higher power input per volume. In addition, we obtained higher mixing times with increasing scales.\nFigure 5 shows the mixing efficiency for the different single-use bioreactor scales. At 2 L scale, a mixing time of 7 s at a tip speed of 0.6 m/s and 2 s at a tip speed of 1.8 m/s can be achieved. At 50 L scale, mixing times increase to 19 s at tip speed of 0.6 m/s and 8 s at a tip speed of 1.8 m/s. For 2,000 L scale, mixing times of 20 s can be obtained. Overall, it is possible to ensure mixing times <30 s for all scales, from 2 L to 2,000 L, thus demonstrating the superior performance of the UniVessel SU and BIOSTAT STR family for mammalian cell culture (9).\nFor the quantification of the oxygen-transfer rate, we determined the volumetric mass transfer coefficient (kLa) using the gassing out method (21). For most common cell cultures, kLa values of 5–10 h–1 are required. Figure 6 shows the kLa characteristics for different tip speeds and scales of the BIOSTAT STR and UniVessel SU bioreactors. Both ring and microsparger elements were used for the BIOSTAT STR system and a ringsparger for the UniVessel SU and ambr studies.\nThe kLa-values increase with increasing tip speed at any given scale and configuration. As expected, the kLa values increase also with the scale. That can be explained by the increased liquid height and the longer residence time of the gas bubbles in the liquid — resulting in a more efficient oxygen\ntransfer (22). The ambr system had kLa values of 8.5 h–1 at a tip speed of 1.02 m/s (20). For the other bioreactor families kLa values >10 h–1 can be easily achieved at all scales for both microsparger and ringsparger. Hence, the ambr, UniVessel SU, and BIOSTAT STR bioreactors meet the oxygen-transfer requirements of mammalian cell cultures. With a microsparger, kLa values up to 40 h-1 can be reached at 2,000 L scale, thereby demonstrating the superior performance of this bioreactor type and making this bioreactor type the ideal choice for high cell-density processes.\nSuperior Single-Use Bioreactor Scalability Due to Classical Stirred Tank Principles\nTheir excellent performance characteristics make the single-use ambr250, UniVessel SU, and BIOSTAT STR bioreactors ideal for mammalian cell culture — even for very demanding, high cell-density or microcarrier-based processes. Low-shear agitation with three-blade segment impellers provides homogeneous mixing. With a nonparticle-shedding microsparger, operators can reach oxygen transfer rates of up to 40 h–1 at 2,000 L scale. Like other single-use bioreactors, such systems make cell culture operations more flexible, cost-effective, and less time-consuming. Their classical stirred-tank design allows relying on well-known and established scale-up criteria such as power input per volume or tip speed. In addition, their geometrical similarities across all scales facilitate successful scale up and scale down as well as process transfer, thus derisking scale-up and process transfers significantly. These single-use stirred tank bioreactor solutions enable seamless scale-up from 250 mL to 2,000 L. This makes them ideal solutions for any modern biopharmaceutical development and production facility for monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, and vaccines.\n3 Eibl D, Peuker T, Eibl R.

20	How do community-building initiatives help address racial separation in society, and what physiological effects of discrimination have been documented in middle-aged adults?	Community-building initiatives like Race Unity in Action and the Friendly Supper Club helped address racial separation by creating spaces where people of different backgrounds could share meals and experiences, fostering understanding across racial and social boundaries. Regarding physiological effects, research on middle-aged adults shows that discrimination is associated with concrete health impacts, particularly on sleep, with non-white subjects having nearly four times the odds of poor sleep efficiency, potentially contributing to increased cardiovascular risks and mortality rates.	"['The Third Thirty: A Community Oral History Project\n""My faith provides a guide. I want to make sure that I never do anything to harm another person and I see every person as connected to me. And I\'m wanting to help however I can. When I\'m able to see every person as a part of my human family, then I respond to people in that way. It goes beyond just seeing a stranger. I’m seeing someone who is a part of me as well and so I have to reach out.""\nI have known Lonnie Locke for about 20 years. I really got to know her when she co-facilitated a 10-week Study Circle on Race for my theatre company, the Heartsparkle Players. That was an experience that helped our group to first, talk about race and then to be able to portray stories about race and racism with a more complex understanding. Lonnie was born in Linden, Alabama. She came to Pasco, Washington 54 years ago. She has lived with her family in Lacey, Washington for the last 22 years.\n-Debe Edden, Oral Historian\nBeing born African American, in 1946, in a very racially segregated environment really contributed to my longing to get to know people who didn\'t look like me and learn about customs and traditions different from my own.\nWhat I saw or heard in that environment was that anyone who looked like me was inferior. I fought against that idea. Yet I internalized it. So I felt that I had to get to know people who did not look like me to prove that my being different did not mean that I was inferior. I would not have been able to do that if I hadn\'t really pursued getting to know other people and comparing our humanness.\nIn 1964 I came to Washington State and started college. I was definitely a minority in that environment but I didn\'t have to sit in separate places or go to places that said colored or white. It was a chance for me to get to talk to someone who didn\'t look like me. To get a chance to talk one person to another in a more equal setting\nI met my second husband after I left my job as Court Commissioner in Franklin county. We dedicated our interracial marriage to promoting the oneness of humankind and working on matters that bring people together.\nIn the early 90’s we, along with others, organized a group called Race Unity in Action. We met monthly with interested persons to share meals and talk. That soon morphed into a group called the Friendly Supper Club. We met on the second Saturday of every month. Often there would be 25-50 people in our house sharing food and talking. We never knew who was going to be coming. Some of the participants helped to shape activities which became a tradition in the Friendly Supper Club. One dear friend, who is now deceased, was Tlingit from Alaska and noticed that not everyone greeted others. So he offered to teach what he called the friendship dance. Two lines were formed with people facing each other; then each person stated their name and shook hands with the person they were facing and then moved on to the next person until everyone had a chance to say hello. I was amazed and so delighted to see friends and strangers who came to our house. Many wonderful things happened in this gathering. An incident that stood out to me was a time when five women were sitting together at the dining table talking about their life experiences. One woman was native, another was someone who had lived in the Southeast and had an interracial marriage; another person was a biologist; one was a white woman who was trying to adopt an African American child; and another was homeless. They were talking about women\'s issues. It was so heartwarming to hear them talk about things that affected their lives, and to see the commonality they had regardless of their particular life situations. It was those types of things that caused my husband and me to feel honored to be able to offer our home to the community for about 15 years.\nFaith has always been a part of my life. When I was growing up in the Southeast it was what kept me going.\nWhen I first began to become conscious of being a spiritual person it was my faith that helped me. When I was about 15 I went to the police station because I wanted to do a report on accidents in our area. I asked if I could speak to a police officer when this officer came out the first thing he said was, “What do you want, girl?” and pushes me against the wall. I think it was part of my faith that helped me stay calm and able to talk to him without losing that calmness. And where I could reach for what was to me at a higher level of thinking. That\'s what faith does. It allows us to reach for that thing that\'s higher and not go to the lower nature there in all of us. I could see that when I chose not to reach what I thought was lowness then he was able to calm down and to actually provide me with what I\'d come there for in the first place.\nI try to make a habit of calling myself to account each day and thinking whenever I decide to do something,” Is this the right thing to do?” My faith provides a guide. I want to make sure that I never do anything to harm another person and I see every person as connected to me. And I\'m wanting to help however I can. When I\'m able to see every person as a part of my human family, then I respond to people in that way. It goes beyond just seeing a stranger. I’m seeing someone who is a part of me as well and so I have to reach out.\nI\'ve made it my goal every day to try and look in the face of people that I see and smile. The majority of time people smile back and I feel that connection between us. For someone who has come from being separate and not being able to look into the eyes of other people and smile at them and get to know them. It feels like I\'ve reached this wonderful milestone. I\'m happy that at this time of my life that I can do that and that as I reach the other side of my life to really begin to develop that part of me.', 'Losing sleep over discrimination? ‘Everyday discrimination’ may contribute to sleep problemss\nDecember 22, 2016 – People who perceive more discrimination in daily life have higher rates of sleep problems, based on both subjective and objective measures, reports a study in Psychosomatic Medicine: Journal of Biobehavioral Medicine, the official journal of the American Psychosomatic Society. The journal is published by Wolters Kluwer.\n""Discrimination is an important factor associated with sleep measures in middle-aged adults,"" according to the report by Sherry Owens, PhD, of West Virginia University, Morgantown, and colleagues. The results add to previous research suggesting that discrimination and chronic stress may lead to sleep difficulties and increased health risks.\nDiscrimination Related to Both Objective and Subjective Sleep Problems\nThe study included 441 adults from a nationwide study of health and well-being in middle age and beyond (the MIDUS Study). The participants\' average age was 47 years; about one-third were of non-white race/ethnicity. Complete data were available for 361 participants.\nParticipants wore an activity monitor device for one week to gather data on objective sleep measures–for example, sleep efficiency, calculated as the percentage of time spent in bed that the person was asleep. They also completed subjective sleep ratings — for example, how often they had sleep problems.\nPerceived experiences of discrimination were assessed using a validated ""Everyday Discrimination Scale."" For example, subjects were asked how often they were treated with less courtesy or respect than others, or how often they were insulted or harassed.\nDiscrimination scores were analyzed for association with the objective and subjective sleep measures. Objective measures indicated that about one-third of participants had poor sleep efficiency. Subjectively, one-half of subjects rated themselves as having poor sleep quality.\nParticipants who perceived more discrimination had increased sleep problems, after adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and health factors. Higher discrimination scores were associated with 12 percent higher odds of poor sleep efficiency and a nine percent increase in the odds of poor sleep quality. Discrimination was also related to (objective) time spent awake after falling asleep and (subjective) overall sleep difficulties.\nNon-white subjects had nearly four times the odds of poor sleep efficiency. Otherwise, all differences in sleep measures between white and non-white subjects were related to discrimination.\nOlder participants and men were more likely to have some types of sleep problems. Age, sex, and mental/physical health factors explained only a small proportion of the effects of discrimination.\nPrevious studies have suggested that racial/ethnic minorities have worse sleep quality. Inadequate sleep is associated with adverse health outcomes, including increased cardiovascular risks and increased mortality. These consequences of poor sleep may account for some of racial/ethnic variation in health outcomes–possibly reflecting inadequate recovery from chronic daily stressors.\nWhile poor sleep has previously been linked to higher perceived discrimination, the new study is the first to look at how discrimination affects both objective and subjective sleep measures. ""The findings support the model that discrimination acts as a stressor than can disrupt subjective and objective sleep,"" Dr. Owens and coauthors write.\nThe researchers call for further study to confirm and clarify the implications of their findings. Meanwhile, they believe the study adds a ""finer resolution"" to previous knowledge the relationship between discrimination and sleep–and suggests a possible ""causal pathway"" connecting chronic discrimination to sleep problems, and thus to increased health risks.\nClick here to read ""Association Between Discrimination and Objective and Subjective Sleep Measures in the Midlife in the United States Study Adult Sample.""\nArticle: ""Association Between Discrimination and Objective and Subjective Sleep Measures in the Midlife in the United States Study Adult Sample.""

21	why transpose music scales practical uses	Music is transposed for several practical purposes. It helps accommodate different vocal ranges in vocal music, makes music easier to read for certain instruments like double bass, and allows musicians to play in any key by maintaining the same interval patterns and fingering positions. This is particularly useful for bass players who can simply move their fingering patterns up or down the fretboard. Additionally, transposition is necessary for transposing instruments like clarinets and saxophones, which produce different pitches than what is written in the musical notation.	"[""what do you notice about them with regard to intervals and half steps ?\nPlay the notes in each scale sequentially starting on the lowest C note, 3rd fret,\nA string and for the E major scale, starting on the E note, 7th fret, A string.\nCount the half-steps between the notes. You'll see that there are:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C major scale~~~~~~~~E major scale\n2 half-steps between the notes, C, and D.~~~~~~~~~~E and F#.\n2 half-steps between the notes, D and E.~~~~~~~~~~F# and G#.\n1 half-step between the notes, E and F.~~~~~~~~~~~G# and A.\n2 half-steps between the notes, F and G.~~~~~~~~~~~A and B.\n2 half-steps between the notes, G and A.~~~~~~~~~~~B and C#.\n2 half-steps between the notes, A and B.~~~~~~~~~~ C# and Eb.\n1 half-step between the notes, B and C.~~~~~~~~~~~ Eb and E.\n12 half-steps, total\nThe intervals and half-steps in both scales are the same.\nThese distances or numbers of half-steps remain the same for all major scales. This is an important idea because it is what enables the bass player to be able to easily play in any key (transpose) merely by moving his or her basic fingering position up or down the fret board (the neck of the bass), just starting the same patterns of fingering on a different fret!\nDefinition: transpose: to change to another key.\nPlay these scales again. Try to play other scales using the same intervals and fingering patterns. Just start on different notes.\nPlaying scales is one of the most boring things you can do. One thing you can do to make playing scales sound less boring and add excitement is to play small sections of scales in ascending or descending groups of two, three or four notes, the pattern of which you repeat starting on a higher (or lower) note each time. For example, using the positions of the major scale, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, play a group of three notes in a pattern such as 1 2 3, 2 3 4, 3 4 5, 4 5 6, 5 6 7, 6 7 8. And descending - 8 7 6, 7 6 5, 6 5 4, 5 4 3, 4 3 2, 3 2 1. Always play both ascending and descending.\nInvent some of your own. You can structure your pattern any way you choose and you can also choose any notes of the scale to include in the pattern. Whatever sounds good. In addition to making the playing of scales sound less boring you'll find as you listen to music with this concept in mind that these types of small groups of notes in a pattern which is repeated ascending or descending are used everywhere! They'll become tremendously useful to you! Guitarists use them all the time. Saxophonists do, too. John Coltrane, a twentieth century Saxophonist, used groups of two notes early in his career and progressed to using three notes in short bursts a little later. You can learn a lot about this by listening to talented and highly skilled musicians on all instruments and in all genres of music. This is a concept that you as a bass player can use use frequently. It's highly useful when soloing. It will also improve your fretting and plucking dexterity.\nDefinition: pattern: something to be copied. A group of relationships between select notes (of a scale in this case) of which the group can be copied or repeated."", 'The process of transposing a musical piece involves modifying the pitches but not the connections between them (or notes). Transposition is often used in vocal music to accommodate performers with varying ranges.\nSimilarly, How do you transpose in music?\nA singer who wants to transpose a work to modify its range may simply repeat the procedure of identifying the original key, choosing a new key, and shifting each note the same number of steps and half steps throughout the composition. The notes you read in this circumstance will be the real concert pitch.\nAlso, it is asked, What does it mean to transpose chord?\nWhat Is the Meaning of Transposition? Transposition is the procedure by which a musician alters the key of a piece of music that has already been created. Each chord and note will be changed to match a new key, and the piece will sound either higher or lower than it did before.\nSecondly, What does it mean to transpose music for an instrument?\nInstrument that creates a higher or lower pitch than the music intended for it (transposing musical instrument). Clarinets, English horns, and saxophones are examples. The relative pitches generated, rather than the precise pitches, are shown in musical notation when transposing instruments.\nAlso, Why do we need to transpose music?\nTo Make Music Simpler to Read One rationale for transposing music is to make it easier to read for the musician. The double bass, for example, interprets music at one pitch but produces notes that are an octave below.\nPeople also ask, Is a clarinet a transposing?\nBecause the clarinet is a transposing instrument, the notation pitch differs from the concert pitch.\nRelated Questions and Answers\nWhat is meant by transposition?\ntransposition definition 1a: a transposing or being transferred act, process, or event. b: the movement of a fragment of DNA from one part of the genome to another. 2a: the transfer of any term from one side of an equation to the other, with a matching change in sign.\nHow do you tell what key A song is in?\nThe quickest approach to figure out what key a song is in is to glance at the key signature on the sheet music. If the sheet music doesn’t contain a key signature, you’ll have to figure out the key by analyzing the chords or notes used in the song.\nWhat happens when you transpose a song?\nYou’ll have to transpose down if a song pushes the top boundaries of your vocal range. If you’re performing a song in the key of G, for example, transposing down means changing the key to a lower one, such as F. If it’s still too high, you may move down to E, and so on.\nIs the guitar a transposing instrument?\nBecause the heard note is an octave below the notated pitch, the classical guitar is a transposing instrument. Another example is the descant recorder (which is an octave above notation), which explains why it seems to be able to play lower than the (non-transposing treble recorder) But it can’t!\nWhy are songs in different keys?\nMusic for solo voice and piano is often offered in a variety of keys to accommodate various vocal ranges. You’d notice if the same performer performed the same song in multiple keys since the vocal range would be different.\nWhat key is a piano in?\nSeven octaves plus three lower notes (B, B flat, and A) are available on an 88-key piano. It contains 52 white keys and 36 black keys (sharps and flats), with seven white keys and five black keys in each octave.\nDoes A capo transpose up or down?\nThe open notes are transposed up using a capo. You can use a capo to keep playing open notes if you’re in the open position and transposing up the fretboard.\nIs there A program to transpose music?\nSimply download ScanScore and scan your sheet music with your smartphone, tablet, or scanner and have it played back to you. You may also transpose your score and export your notes to practically any music application to further alter them.\nCan you transpose from major to minor?\nTransposing a music allows you to simply alter its key. It’s a little more difficult to get from major to minor, however there is software that can help. To make a minor 3rd, you’d have to reduce every occurrence of the 3rd Scale degree.\nHow do I turn my major into a minor?\nSwitching from major to minor while maintaining the melody Make a basic two-chord progression focusing on minor, then shift it to relative major. Create a three- to six-note melody that complements your minor progression. Switch to major chords while keeping the same melody.\nIs a double bass a transposing instrument?\nThe double bass is traditionally a transposing instrument. Because so much of the range of the double bass is below the usual bass clef, it is notated an octave higher than it sounds to avoid having to employ too many ledger lines below the staff.\nHow do French horns transpose?\nTo get the pitches that would sound in music composed for a French horn, transpose down by a perfect fifth: a written C sounds like a written F, and a written D sounds like a G, and so on.\nIs trombone a transposing instrument?\nTrombone music, like that for euphonium and tuba, is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef, however there are exceptions, most notably in practically all brass-band work, where the tenor trombone is written in treble clef as a B transposing instrument.\nWhat is corni music?\nCorni in F stands for horns (often incorrectly called French horns). It refers to a natural horn that was similar to a hunting horn during that historical period.\nWhat is transposition in music theory?\nThe technique or procedure of shifting a group of notes (pitches or pitch classes) up or down in pitch by a consistent interval is known as transposition in music.\nWhat is an example of transposition?\nA transposition mistake is an accounting error that occurs when two (or more) consecutive digits are substituted. A transposition mistake occurs when a bookkeeper enters the number 56 instead of 65. Find the difference between the reported and correct amounts to identify the inaccuracies.\nWhat is transposition in drama?\nAdaptation is the process of adapting an existing book, play text, or screenplay to a new setting. Context: The medium’s context: a book might be adapted for the theatre.\nHow do you know if a song is in minor or major?\nYou may also listen to a song’s melody and see where it stops. Melodies usually resolve to the key’s tonic note. Again, a song is in C major if all of the melody notes are in C major/A minor and the last melody note is C. It’s in A minor if it concludes on A.\nTransposing is the process of moving all or part of a musical piece up or down in pitch. In music, transposing means changing the key. The word “transpose” comes from the Latin verb “transponere,” which means to move something around.\nThis Video Should Help:\n- types of transposition in music\n- transpose music chart\n- transposition in music pdf\n- transpose key chart\n- transpose music software']"	['<urn:uuid:2f7e2423-13b1-47f2-8078-801416841a7a>', '<urn:uuid:faae9a06-0a1f-4399-89c2-b5bcfff6aa7a>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	6	86	1794
22	What roles did Samora Machel and Oliver Tambo play in African liberation?	Both Samora Machel and Oliver Tambo were key leaders in African liberation struggles. Machel led FRELIMO to end 500 years of Portuguese colonization in Mozambique and became its first president. Meanwhile, Tambo led the ANC in exile, becoming the architect of its liberation army and building international solidarity networks. They worked together closely, with Machel supporting the ANC's struggle against apartheid in South Africa, while Tambo helped mobilize support for Mozambique's independence. Both were committed to liberating all peoples of Africa, particularly in Southern Africa, through armed struggle combined with political action.	"[""Portrait of Samora Machel Who Led the Nation of Mozambique to National Independence From Portuguese Colonialism\nOriginally uploaded by panafnewswire.\nBy President Thabo Mbeki,\nRepublic of South Africa\nCourtesy of ANC Today\nOctober 13, 2006\nOn October 19, at Mbuzini in Mpumalanga, President Armando Guebuza of Mozambique and I will lead a solemn ceremony to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the tragic death of the first President of independent Mozambique, Samora Moises Machel, in a plane crash at Mbuzini. With us will be Mrs Graça Machel, her children with Samora Machel, and other members of the Machel family.\nToday it seems such a long time ago that we had the privilege to sit with Samora Machel, to hear him speak, to draw inspiration from his seemingly inexhaustible energy, his effervescence and optimism, his confidence that Mozambique, South Africa and Africa would overcome their problems, in the same way that the great FRELIMO liberation movement he led had, through struggle, ended 500 years of Portuguese colonisation of Mozambique.\nAnd yet as we recall the memory of Samora Machel two decades after he died, the images of the living Samora flash in the mind, occasionally evoking an intense feeling that we can actually still see this great hero of the people of Mozambique and Africa and that we are indeed about to hear his voice once again.\nIt is during such moments that we come to understand the enormous and indelible impact that Samora Machel made on us as individuals, on our movement and struggle, and on the future of our country. It is at such moments that we come to understand that Samora Machel became part of us, our own national hero that cannot be separated from all our other national heroes and heroines.\nThe terrible news broke upon the world and us on October 20, 1986 that the plane carrying Samora Machel had crashed on South African territory the previous night, killing him and 34 other people, including the Soviet crew that flew the fated plane. And as we grieved, we asked a question that has still not been answered - was the apartheid regime responsible for the tragic deaths at Mbuzini!\nImmediately after the deaths at Mbuzini, the President of the ANC, the late O. R. Tambo, sent a Message of Condolences to the Central Committee of FRELIMO, which fully expressed the feelings of our movement and our struggling people, saying:\n“The tragedy that has befallen the people of Mozambique is without parallel in the history of the independent Africa. It is a tragedy that has shocked and stunned progressive mankind. It is a staggering blow to African people and especially to the people of southern Africa, a blow that is felt most intensely by the African National Congress and the entire oppressed and democratic people of South Africa, a tragedy they can never forget.\n“Our leader, comrade-in-arms, and brother, Samora Moises Machel, President and Marshal of the People's Republic of Mozambique, President of the FRELIMO Party, one of the most outstanding leaders of our continent, one of its best brains, an unsurpassed fighter who fought to turn Southern Africa into a liberated zone of humanity, this great fighter has been killed by the only enemy who stands to gain by his death, the apartheid regime of Pretoria and its agents.\n“President Machel fell in the cause of service to mankind. He was accompanied to his death by his great countrymen and by nationals of countries involved in the struggle against apartheid South Africa. On behalf of the African National Congress, the masses of South Africa, and on my own behalf, I send heartfelt condolences to the Mozambican nation, Graça Machel, and the children, as well as to the bereaved families of the deceased. The Mozambican people will yet again rise to the challenge of the hour, and use this great tragedy to execute a great leap forward. A Luta Continua; Venceremos.”\nEven twenty years after the event, as we read this message from Oliver Tambo, we feel moved once more to cry out in pain, which, still, we feel with undiminished intensity, and recall the memory of our leader, comrade-in-arms, and brother, one of the most outstanding leaders of our continent, one of its best brains, an unsurpassed fighter who fought for the liberation of all the peoples of Africa, including and especially our own.\nIn 1981 the apartheid armed forces invaded Mozambique and killed members and cadres of the ANC then living temporarily in Matola on the outskirts of Maputo. This act of aggression constituted part of the offensive of the oppressor regime in Pretoria directed against both liberated Mozambique and our movement.\nCorrectly it saw free Mozambique, led by Samora Machel, and the ANC, led by Oliver Tambo, as inseparable comrades-in-arms committed to act together to achieve the liberation of our people and therefore the final liquidation of the system of colonialism and white minority domination on our continent. To save itself from destruction, it was determined to fight and defeat both, with no holds barred.\nAlready in February 1980, the Secretary General of the ANC, the late Alfred Nzo, had issued a statement headed “Hands off Mozambique!”, in which he said:\n“Recent events have made it abundantly clear that the apartheid regime of South Africa is preparing for renewed attacks against the frontline states. For this purpose all manner of deceptive fabrications have been concocted and broadcast to the world seeking to justify these impending acts of aggression.\n“Over the last few days the Pretoria regime has put out two such fabrications. The first was that it had captured a cache of arms in the northern part of the South African province of Natal close to the border with Mozambique. The second was that some ten guerrillas had robbed and burnt down a shop in the same area and kidnapped the owner for military training...\n“The National Executive Committee of the ANC calls on the world community urgently to launch a vigorous campaign around the important watchwords - 'HANDS OFF MOZAMBIQUE'. We further call on the world community to give maximum assistance to the ANC for us to discharge our responsibilities, in the interests of international peace and security and the liberty of our people.”\nHowever, regardless of anything the international community did to respond to this urgent call, the apartheid regime was not about to give up its offensive against its common enemies, independent Mozambique and the African National Congress. That is why it carried out a massacre in Matola in 1981.\nA year later in 1982, Oliver Tambo came to Mozambique to participate in activities organised to mark the first anniversary of the Matola Massacre. Speaking at a Frelimo Rally at Bairro de Liberdade, Maputo, he said:\n“We are here today because, exactly a year ago this day, at Praça de Independencia in Maputo, the celebrated Leader and Commander of the heroic Mozambican people, Comrade President Samora Machel, responded to the Matola raid by summoning his people back to the war trenches they had known since September 25, 1964; back into battle, for the defence of their motherland, their sovereignty, their territorial integrity, their national dignity; for the defence of the gains of the Mozambican revolution - the gains of the African revolution; for the defence of their internationalist essence and their socialist future - a future of which the victory of the struggle led by the ANC and SWAPO against the Pretoria fascists is an integral part.\n“And we now know that the Mozambican people, from the Rovuma to the Maputo rallied to FRELIMO's call with their knobkerries, pangas and other weapons. When the raiders reappeared at Ponto d'Oro, the people plunged their pickaxes into the skulls of the fascist intruders.\n“Your response - the response of a nation forged in the furious furnaces of two brutal wars - had a dynamising impact throughout southern Africa, and throughout the continent. It was an act of mobilisation of the international progressive forces for resolute struggle against apartheid colonialism and fascism.\n“You riveted the 35 million people of Mozambique and South Africa together and joined them in solid unity with the peoples of the rest of the region in their determination to rid our continent of this painful and dangerous plague.”\nThis message of defiance did not sit well with the captains of apartheid. They decided to intensify the pressure against liberated Mozambique, especially by ensuring that RENAMO intensified its military offensive with the intention truly to bring liberated Mozambique to its knees.\nIn the end, Samora Machel, on behalf of the government and people of Mozambique, had to accept and sign the Nkomati Accord in March 1984, to bring peace to the Mozambican people and defend the independence of Mozambique.\nIn return for the promise to call of its dogs of war, which it did not keep, the apartheid regime demanded its pound of flesh - the expulsion of the ANC from Mozambique and the termination of the comradeship and friendship between FRELIMO and the ANC, between the peoples of Mozambique and South Africa, between Samora Machel and Oliver Tambo.\nWhen the day came when Samora Machel had to explain to Oliver Tambo what the Nkomati Accord meant to the ANC, he could not bring himself to do it. His revolutionary morality and conscience would not allow him to tell the story that in order to protect our liberated zone, Mozambique, saving it from total destruction, he had had to agree that our combined forces, liberated Mozambique and the ANC, had to retreat. He broke down and wept the bitter tears of arrogant humiliation by a criminal racist regime.\nHe was obliged to ask somebody else, his comrade, Mariano Matsinha, to break the news to his other comrade, brother and friend, Oliver Tambo, that liberated Mozambique had had to take on the desperately unhappy responsibility to ensure that the ANC closes down its Mozambique front, thus significantly reducing its capacity further to intensify its offensive against the common enemy of the peoples of Mozambique, South Africa and Africa, the apartheid regime.\nBut first among us, Oliver Tambo knew that the combined retreat of free Mozambique and the ANC was temporary. He knew, as he said at Bairro de Liberdade in Maputo, that by his actions, Samora Machel had “riveted the 35 million people of Mozambique and South Africa together and joined them in solid unity with the peoples of the rest of the region.”\nIn 1976 FRELIMO and the Government of Mozambique conducted a determined campaign to mobilise the Mozambican people to support the struggle for the liberation of Zimbabwe. During this campaign, Samora Machel asked Oliver Tambo to visit Xai Xai, the capital of Gaza Province, to see his father who had expressed a desire to meet President Tambo.\nThis was true. But in reality Samora Machel wanted Oliver Tambo to visit Gaza to persuade the population of this Province also to support the struggle for the liberation of Zimbabwe, prepared to withstand the inevitable violent retaliatory onslaught that would be launched by the forces of the Rhodesian Smith regime.\nSamora Machel asked Oliver Tambo to go to Gaza because the population of this Province of Mozambique, whose male population had been working on the South African mines and farms for many decades already, saw themselves as members and supporters of the ANC rather than FRELIMO. Thus they would sooner take their direction from the ANC rather than FRELIMO. They saw their own and most urgent task as being the liberation of South Africa, accepting that the rest of the country could focus on Zimbabwe.\nOliver Tambo spent many days travelling throughout Gaza, communicating the message to the people that the ANC and FRELIMO were completely at one in identifying the liberation of Zimbabwe as our common, principal and immediate strategic task. The peoples of Mozambique and South Africa were indeed riveted together and joined in solid unity with the peoples of the rest of the region.\nOn October 19, free Mozambique and free South Africa will convene at Mbuzini in Mpumalanga to pay tribute to a beloved son of the Mozambican people, a leader and hero of both the Mozambican and South African people, on the occasion of the 20th Anniversary of his tragic death.\nIn the 1987 January 8th Statement of our movement, when we celebrated our 75th anniversary, Oliver Tambo said:\n“The late President of the People's Republic of Mozambique, Samora Moises Machel, and others who have been murdered by the Pretoria regime and its agents, will forever remain examples of that steadfast refusal of the peoples of our region to surrender to racial and colonial domination, fascist tyranny and state terrorism.\n“Samora Machel was a towering giant of the African Revolution. He dedicated his life to our own liberation. His ideas and his deeds are a material force in the struggle for our emancipation. The blood he shed on our soil is and will forever be a fountain of freedom for all our people. On this historic day we make an undertaking to the brother people of Mozambique and our entire region that, at Mbuzini, where the fellow-combatant, Samora Machel, lost his life, we shall erect a monument that will symbolise the common suffering of the people of Southern Africa, a tribute to their heroism, and a solemn affirmation that we share a common destiny of liberty, peace and social progress.”\nOn October 19, at Mbuzini, we will, together with the leaders of the sister people of Mozambique, to whom we are riveted by unbreakable steel bands of comradeship, friendship and solidarity, formally dedicate the monument that will symbolise the common suffering of the people of Southern Africa, a tribute to their heroism and a solemn affirmation that we share a common destiny of liberty, peace and social progress, of which Oliver Tambo spoke almost 20 years ago."", 'For anyone to fully appreciate Oliver Reginald Tambo’s role in our socio-political make up, one needs to grasp the evolution of the ANC between 1912 and the 1940s when O.R. Tambo entered the political stage as the youth leader.\nIn order to appreciate this perspective we need to take a cursory look into the early South African Native National Congress (SANNC) - later the African National Congress (ANC). This was a movement formed by a leadership drawn from the aspirant members of the African proto-middle classes: lawyers, doctors, church ministers, landowners and traders.\nA glance at the leadership elected at the inaugural conference is a pointer. The first President, John Langalibalele Dube was an American trained educationist, church minister and newspaper editor. The Secretary General, Solomon Plaatjie was a newspaper editor and an author. The Treasurer General, Pixley ka Isaka Seme was a Columbia/Oxford and London trained lawyer.\nThe newly launched SANNC had to immediately deal with two draconian pieces of legislation, the discriminatory labour legislation of 1911 and the Natives Land Act of 1913. The latter Sol Plaatjie described as follows:\n“Awaking on Friday morning, June 20, 1913 the South African native found himself, not actually a slave, but a pariah in the land of his birth.”\nThe failure of the deputations and memoranda to Her Majesty resulted in a massive decline in the ANC during the period of the 1930s. The election of Dr Xuma in 1940, a period during in which the African Mineworkers Union and the ANC Youth League were formed, marked the beginning of a process of the renewal and radicalisation of the ANC. This is the period when OR Tambo comes to the fore.\nOliver Reginald Tambo, born into a modest peasant household in Mbizana travelled a long difficult journey from when he was part of the formation of the ANCYL in 1944. He received his education from two mission schools, Holy Cross in Flagstaff and St. Peter’s in Johannesburg where he matriculated - and later taught - in 1938. He was awarded a scholarship to the University College of Fort Hare where he graduated with a B.Sc degree in 1941. He remained in the College to do a teaching diploma but was expelled during the 1942 student strike. St Peter’s allowed him to take up the post of a mathematics and science teacher, where he remained for five years (1943-1947).\nOliver Reginald Tambo, together with his contemporaries, Lembede, Mbatha, Mda, Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu, became a founder member of the ANCYL. These young people who adopted the programme of action in the ANCYL, lobbied the ANC to adopt the programme of action in its 1949 national conference. This programme entailed, in the main, disobedience against the apartheid regime. Eight youth leaguers were elected to the NEC of the ANC in the 1949 conference, where Walter Sisulu was elected the Secretary General.\nWhen Walter Sisulu was served with a banning order in 1954 Comrade Oliver Tambo became the acting Secretary General. In 1958 he was elected Deputy President General alongside Duma Nokwe, who was elected the Secretary General. The ANC decided to launch the anti-pass campaign on 31 March 1960, only to be upstaged by the Pan Africanist Congress ten days earlier - leading to the Sharpeville massacre.\nThe banning of the liberation movement thereafter started a new chapter for Comrade Oliver Tambo. His task became that of mobilising the international solidarity and to establish ANC infrastructure in exile. This was to prove the words of the President-General, Chief Albert Luthuli, true when he said:\n“The quality of our Deputy President, Oliver Tambo’s speech makes me very happy - even if I and others in the leadership of the ANC were to die, there are young men like Oliver Tambo who are now ready to take responsibility for the ANC”\nThe banning of the liberation movement led the ANC to resolve that the non-violent path could not be sustained. (Thereby) created a military wing to prepare for the mode of struggle initially based on sabotage. (And) On 16 December 1961 Umkhonto we Sizwe, with Mandela as Commander-in-Chief, announced its existence with a manifesto and attacks on Government buildings in Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth and Durban.”\nOliver Reginald Tambo, became the architect of the ANC’s liberation army and porter of its international solidarity infrastructure, which made the ANC an integral part of the network of liberation movements in the African continent. Resultantly, the struggle for freedom was intensified in Tanzania, Algeria, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Angola, Namibia and many other parts of the continent.\nPropaganda, ensuring the movement keeps contact with the people, was an important part of the intensification of the struggle. An effective underground movement was equally important for the movement to increase the pool it would recruit from. Operating from Tanzania and later Zambia MK operatives had to go through a hostile terrain to be deployed in the battlefront.\nThe impatience among the trained cadres, keen to engage the enemy, led to the agreement to infiltrate through the then Southern Rhodesia in 1967, what is known as the Wankie and Spolilo encounter with the enemy. This was a bold and risky initiative, which further encouraged the desire among cadres to engage the enemy at home.\nThe rumblings in the camps that came in the aftermath of these expeditions led to the Morogoro Conference where delegates were allowed to be as critical as possible. Following the severe criticism that the leadership was subjected to the NEC resigned en masse to give delegates space to elect new leadership. The Morogoro Conference changed the ANC in two ways: first, it opened membership to all races and, also adopted a militant programme of action.\nIn order to fully understand the Strategy and Tactics one must read the political alliance report of Comrade OR (as he was affectionally known) to this conference, in which he set the agenda as follows:\n“The vital and central task of the African National Congress today is the intensification of armed struggle for the overthrow of the white fascist regime and the liberation of our motherland. Today armed struggle together with other forms of struggle constitute the weapons of the oppressed in our country against the oppressor. How can we intensify the revolution? What forms of organisation can ensure maximum mobilisation of resources at our disposal? What are the motive forces of our struggle and their potential? What strategy and tactics are to be employed?”\nThe Strategy and Tactics that emerged out of the Morogoro Conference characterised the international context as that of “transition to the socialist system, of the breakdown of the colonial system as a result of national liberation and socialist revolutions, and the fight for social and economic progress by the people of the whole world.”\nDescribing the relationship between the political and the military, the Strategy and Tactics explains that “when we talk of revolutionary armed struggle, we are talking of political struggle by means which include the use of military force even though once force as a tactic is introduced it has the most far-reaching consequences on every aspect of our activities. It is important to emphasise this because our movement must reject all manifestations of militarism, which separates armed people’s struggle from its political context.”\nUnder the leadership of O.R Tambo, this clarity kept the ANC intact in trying conditions. It assisted the ANC articulate our struggle and the four pillars of our revolution, the armed struggle, mass mobilisation, underground and international solidarity against apartheid. The momentum that took the struggle to heights in the 1980s was a combination of all these pillars and the coordination thereof.\nThe rent boycott and a series of strikes in 1987 drove the Afrikaner capital to Dakar to test the possibility of a negotiated settlement. It is the total impact of these pillars that forced the nationalist party into negotiating power away, between 1990 and 1994. Looked through biblically eyes, Oliver Reginald Tambo is like Moses who led the people to freedom; and Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela the Joshua who led the people into the Promised Land.\nThe question, however, is not what OR did and achieved, nor what his life and times are about. The question that must be confronted is whether we are upholding the ideals the ANC stood for under the leadership of the Comrade OR Tambo. An appropriate premise is a reminder of the core values of the ANC, namely, selflessness, honesty, respect for leadership, unity, humility, and discipline.\nThe ANC must remain the leader in building a non-racial and non-sexist society. It must remain a mass and a multi-class movement it has always been. The ANC has always led and must continue its leadership of society. A divided ANC loses the moral authority to lead and unite society. The integrity of individual leaders of the ANC determines the extent to which society can continue trusting our movement. No leader has a private life. We must continue engaging various structures and organisations in society, even when there are no elections.\nThe ANC must be the first to talk against corruption, real and perceived. We must support institutions set to fight corruption. The ANC must shed the perception of it being corrupt through taking a tough stance against corruption, irrespective of who is implicated or involved. We must instill and enforce discipline and enable members to appreciate that no revolution can succeed without discipline. Cadres of our movement must always appreciate that militancy without discipline is anarchy.\nWe must be guided by the following principles:\n* Discipline must not be used to settle political differences. However, in the same breath, ill-discipline must not be veiled as political differences.\n* Past errors must not be used to justify continued ill-discipline. Deviant behaviour in the run-up to Polokwane must not be elevated into a norm, but an anomaly that must be corrected.\n* Where transgression occurs the movement must act.\n* We must all work for unity and cohesion.\nThe 53rd National Conference of the ANC will, among other things, elect leadership. It is not about succession as there is heir to the throne. Leadership must be discussed and assessed by branches of the ANC, as opposed to narrow circles that are well resourced and tend to buy their access to power. We must liberate the branches of the ANC to appreciate their power and their rights. Our leadership must be assessed in terms of its performance as a collective, and as individual leaders. It should never be about regionalism and friendship.\nComrades must be made to understand that the ANC has culture and traditions and nominations are made at an appropriate time. By this we wish not ban discussions and assessment of leadership. Oliver Reginald Tambo was a thorough leader who paid attention to detail. As Comrade Thabo Mbeki noted:\n“OR was an intellectual in the best meaning of that word. He was a person of reason, a person of rational thought and rational action… a person who could deal with both the concrete and the abstract, the specific, the particular and the general; between tactics and strategy - that dialectical interaction...”\nAs we move towards the policy conference our branches must bear this in mind, be engaged and empowered to participate in policy debates. The aptly termed nationalisation debate is but one example. We must understand that this policy debate is beyond proponents and opponents. The NGC directed the NEC to look into a number of case studies and analyse how other countries handle the state ownership of mineral resources. The research team has completed eleven case studies and the two remaining are China and Malaysia. The discussion will be scientific and emotional.\nComrade OR invested a fortune in strengthening the alliance. He made us understand that the alliance is not just an agreement signed by leaders in boardrooms, however one forged in the trenches of struggle. The tripartite alliance is an alliance between the national liberation movement and the two working class formations.\nThese partners do not melt into an alliance and lose their class character and ideological outlook. They understand the National Democratic Revolution as the minimum programme. It is the preparedness to compromise that has made our unique alliance to work. We must continue working for the unity and cohesion of the alliance.\nBy: Gwede Mantashe, ANC Secretary General']"	['<urn:uuid:4856deef-af86-43af-8556-aaf7840f5c28>', '<urn:uuid:65260807-e02f-4c61-92e9-832b6b3c3bb2>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	12	92	4363

It is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. Fluticasone works by decreasing swelling and irritation in the airways to allow for easier breathing.\nHOW should this medicine be used?\nFluticasone comes as an aerosol to inhale by mouth using an inhaler and as a powder to inhale by mouth using an inhaler. Fluticasone aerosol oral inhalation (Flovent® HFA) is usually inhaled twice daily. Fluticasone powder for oral inhalation (Flovent® Diskus) is usually inhaled twice daily. Try to use fluticasone at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use fluticasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nTalk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with fluticasone inhalation. If you are using any other inhaled medications, ask your doctor if you should inhale these medications a certain amount of time before and after you inhale fluticasone inhalation. If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting at least 1 week after you begin to use fluticasone.\nFluticasone helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Do not use fluticasone during an asthma attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks.\nYour doctor will probably start you on an average dose of fluticasone. Your doctor may decrease your dose when your symptoms are controlled or increase it if your symptoms have not improved after at least 2 weeks.\nFluticasone controls asthma but does not cure it. Your symptoms may improve 24 hours after you begin using fluticasone, but it may take 2 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of the medication. Continue to use fluticasone even if you feel well. Do not stop using fluticasone without talking to your doctor.\nTell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment. Call your doctor if you have an asthma attack that does not stop when you use your fast-acting asthma medication, or if you need to use more of your fast-acting medication than usual.\nThe inhaler that comes with fluticasone aerosol is designed for use only with a canister of fluticasone. Never use it to inhale any other medication, and never use any other inhaler to inhale fluticasone.\nEach product is designed to provide 60 or120 inhalations, depending on the type of inhaler. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last. Dispose of the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. Do not float the canister in water to see if it still contains medication.\nDo not use your fluticasone aerosol inhaler while you are near an open flame or a heat source. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures.\nBefore you use fluticasone the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it. Practice using the inhaler while he or she watches.\nTo use the aerosol inhaler, follow these steps:\n- Before you use the aerosol inhaler for the first time, remove it from the overwrap. Dispose of the overwrap and the drying packet that is inside the overwrap.\n- Be sure that the inhaler is at room temperature.\n- Remove the cap from the mouthpiece. The strap on the side of the cap will stay attached to the actuator to keep the cap from getting lost. Check the mouthpiece for dirt and other objects before each use, especially if the cap was not used to cover the mouthpiece.\n- Be sure the canister is fully and firmly inserted in the actuator. Shake the inhaler well for 5 seconds.\n- If you are using the inhaler for the first time, prime it by releasing four test sprays into the air, away from your face. Shake the inhaler for 5 seconds before each spray. If you have not used the inhaler in more than 7 days, or if you have dropped the inhaler, shake the inhaler for 5 seconds and release one spray into the air. Be careful not to spray the medication into your eyes.\n- Breathe out through your mouth.\n- Hold the inhaler facing you with the mouthpiece on the bottom. Place your thumb under the mouthpiece and your index finger on the top of the canister. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it.\n- Breathe in deeply and slowly through your mouth. At the same time, press down firmly on the top of the canister with your index finger. Remove your index finger as soon as the spray is released.\n- When you have breathed in fully, remove the inhaler from your mouth and close your mouth.\n- Try to hold your breath for 10 seconds.\n- If your doctor told you to inhale more than one puff, wait 30 seconds, shake the canister again, and repeat steps 6 through 10 for each puff.\n- Put the cap back on the mouthpiece.\n- Rinse your mouth with water and spit the water out. Do not swallow the water.\nClean your aerosol inhaler once a week after an evening dose. To clean your inhaler, follow these steps:\n- Remove the mouthpiece cap, but leave the canister in the actuator.\n- Dampen the tip of a cotton swab with water. Use the damp swab to clean the small hole where the medication comes out. Twist the swab in a circular motion to remove any medication that is left in or near the hole.\n- Repeat step 2 with a second cotton swab.\n- Dampen a clean tissue with water. Wipe the inside of the mouthpiece with the damp tissue.\n- Leave the mouthpiece uncovered overnight to allow it to air dry.\n- Replace the mouthpiece cap when the actuator is dry.\nTo inhale the powder using the inhaler, follow these steps.

24	What role do crowns and black pepper play in cultural traditions?	Crowns play a significant role in the Festival of the Holy Spirit, featuring a distinctive crown topped with a dove image rather than a cross, symbolizing the Era of the Holy Spirit. This crown tradition originated from Queen Isabel's promise to donate her crown if people's suffering was reduced. Black pepper, on the other hand, has been historically significant in cultural traditions, being so valuable it was used in ancient Egyptian mummification, found in Ramesses II's nostrils. In Ayurvedic medicine, it was considered an important healing spice, combined with long pepper and ginger in a blend called trikatu.	"[""|San José State University|\n(An American of\n& Tornado Alley\nAzorean Portuguese Communities\nEach year in Portuguese communities, especially those with an Azorean background, there are held Festas do Espírito Santo (Festivals of the Holy Spirit). They involve a dressed parade with some paraders carrying baskets of bread on their heads, the crownings of queens of the festivals and a community meal in each community. Prominently displayed during each festival is a crown topped with an image of a dove. This festival is usually held on Pentecost Sunday (a.k.a. Whitsuntide or Whitsunday), the seventh Sunday after Easter, but could be held on any Sunday between Easter and Pentocost Sunday.\nThe participants and onlookers think of the festival as a quaint manifestation of Portuguese community spirit. It is usually organized and presented by a local non-church organization but utilizes church facilities. Little do the onlookers know that this festival had its origins in a radical theological movement that was wide-spread in Europe but survived largely only in Portugal because the King and Queen in Portugal moderated its radical elements and supported its observation.\nThere was a wide-spread belief throughout Europe as the year 1000 A.D. and a change in the millennium approached that something significant would happen that year. Some, called Millenarians believed a new era would begin, perhaps even the Second Coming of Christ. When nothing like a new era happened in 1000 the Millenarians shifted their projected time for a change in the era to sometime in the future.\nIn Italy there was a monk named Joachim who was born in 1132. He became the abbot of a monastery in Fiore, Italy. He considered what might be the implications of the concept of God as a trinity; i.e., the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit They were of equal importance. Joachim then reflected that the Old Testament of the Bible concerned the Father and the New Testament concerned the Son. He then reasoned that there must be three eras for humanity.\nAccording to Joachim, based upon his reading of Revelations and the Book of St. John, the Era of the Holy Spirit would bring peace, justice, equality, tolerance and brotherly love. People would lead lives of simplicity, innocence, happiness and freedom from sin. It would be the Empire of the Holy Spirit.\nAbbot Joachim died in 1202.\nJoachim's idea of a utopia on Earth captured the minds of many, notably many monks in the Franciscan Order. But also this utopian philosophy intrigued members of royalty. The intellectuals of the time, including Dante, were taken by the beauty of Joachim's image of paradise on Earth. Intellectuals throughout history have been captivated by plans or prescriptions for utopias.\nSome of the followers took the ideology of the Era of God the Holy Spirit a step further. They reasoned that the Catholic Church was an institution of the Era of the Son and should therefore disappear in the Age of the Holy Spirit.\nThis was too much for the Catholic hierarchy and the Church commenced a program to suppress the ideology of Joachim and his followers. In 1256 Pope Alexander IV condemned as heresy all writings promoting the ideology of the Joachim. Subsequently the movement concerning the Era of the Holy Spirit was wiped almost everywhere in Europe. Groups of Franciscan monks resisted the condemnation of the concept of an Era of the Holy Spirit as did the Order of the Knights Templar.\nIn Portugal the Queen Isabel, originally a Princess of Aragon, was an enthusiast for Joachim's vision and her husband King Dom Dinis also became one. They however saw no need for the disappearance of the Catholic Church and its hierarchy. Isabel was accepted by the populace as a saint in her own lifetime and made officially a saint by the Catholic Church after her death.\nSo the King and Queen of Portugal promoted the celebration of the Festival of the Holy Spirit throughout their kingdom. Sometime between 1296 and 1325 they established a church in the city of Alenquer dedicated to the Holy Spirit. It was staffed by Franciscan monks. Later a hospital was built in Alenquer along with the church.\nThe Royal Couple also created a lay brotherhood to organize the Festivals of the Holy Spirit. The Festivals included a ceremony for crowning a commoner as the representative of the Emperor of the Holy Spirit. The crown used in the coronation initially had a cross on top, but later that cross was replaced or superseded by a dove. The cross was a symbol of the Era of God the Son whereas the dove was the symbol of the Era of God the Holy Spirit. So the Festival of the Holy Spirit was thoroughly a celebration of Joachim's concept of the Era of the Holy Spirit. It survived in Portugal due to the support of the King and Queen of Portugal with their accomodation of the the Catholic Church.\nSeveral elements of the festival stem directly from the life of Queen Isabel, such as the distribution of bread. There was a famine in Portugal. Queen Isabel began to take food from her table to the poor. Her husband, King Dinis, admonished her to stop doing so. One time he saw her with something under her cloak and suspected it was bread and thus evidence of her disobeying him. Isabel said a quich prayer and when she opened her cloak it was roses which tumbled out instead of bread. The use of a crown in the festival stems from Queen Isabel praying for the suffering of the people to be alleviated and promising that she would give her crown to the ceremony if the people's suffering was reduced.\nThe Azores were discovered by Portuguese ship navigators spotting in the distance hawks soaring over the Islands. The name Azores means goshawk in Portuguese. The Azores consist of nine major island in three groups. Officially they were discovered in 1427, but they apparently were spotted by passing ships before that because they appear on some maps created before 1427. First sheep were brought to some of the islands and freed in hopes that they would multiply and provide food for passing ships and later for settlers. In the 1430's there were settlements made on two of the islands. However settlement of some of the islands did not begin until two decades later in 1439.\nThe settlement of the islands was under the administration of the Knights of the Order of Christ, the organization that was the successor to the Knights Templar. Prince Henry of Portugal was the Grand Master of the Order of Christ. Franciscan friars were involved in the early settlements. Those friars promoted the creation of brotherhoods to organize the Festivals of the Holy Spirit. The brotherhoods were also devoted to the building of hospitals.\nThere were many Flemish people involved in the early settlements partly because too few Portuguese were interested in migrating to distant volcanic islands. The Flemish were people of Dutch language and culture who lived in Belgium. The Flems had revolted against their ruler, Duke Philip of Burgundy. Duke Philip's wife was the sister of the Prince Henry of Portugal. She asked Prince Henry to allow the rebellious Flems to settle in the Azores. Prince Henry agreed and supplied transportation. Those transported Flemish families adopted Portuguese family names.\nThere were also Portuguese Sephardic Jewish families who had been forced to convert to Christianity who migrated to the Azores to escape the surveillance of the Inquisition.\nThe Festival of the Holy Spirit survived in the Azores and became a distinctive element of Azorean culture. Therefore the Festival was brought to America and preserved as a treasure of their culture. Thus a remnant of a radical utopian ideology created in the 14th century was preserved as a cultural heritage without the participants being conscious of its radical origin. However consider this popular Azorean song\nDivino Espírito Santo,\nSenhor de ceptro e coroa;\nVós na terra sois pembinha,\nNo ce´ divina pessoa.\nOh Most Divine Holy Spirit\nLord of scepter and crown;\nOn Earth you're a little dove,\nIn Heaven, a divine person.\nTony P. Goulart (Project Coordinator), The Holy Ghost Festas: A Historic Perspective of the Portuguese in California, Portuguese Chamber of Commerce of California, San Jose, California, 2002.\nHOME PAGE OF Thayer Watkins"", 'Improve the Benefits of Turmeric by Adding Black Pepper\nThis article looks at turmeric and why we should be including black pepper in our meal, to increase the benefits associated with using turmeric.\nTurmeric is increasing in popularity for its health benefits, having been used in Ayurvedic medicine over 5,000 years ago!\nBlack pepper in its own right, also, has an abundant amount of health benefits. It is a great source of manganese, which helps the body form connective tissues, bones and sex hormones. However, there is also another beneficial function of black pepper, when you combine it with turmeric, which we will now look at.\nTurmeric contains a compound called curcumin, a bright yellow chemical, which gives turmeric its vibrant colour. Curcumin has been identified as being beneficial for its anti-inflammatory properties.\nWhen you ingest turmeric with black pepper, you are increasing the amount of the curcumin you can absorb and your body can use.\nCurcumin has been associated with numerous health benefits including anti-inflammatory and an antioxidant, protecting healthy cells from free radicals which can cause damage.\nThe reason that black pepper enables this increase in our body using curcumin, is due to piperine a compound found in black pepper, which slows our liver from metabolising the curcumin too quickly and removing it through urine.\nBy slowing this process our body is able to utilise more of the curcumin and its beneficial effects!\nCurcumin is quickly metabolised and removed from the body by the liver and the intestinal wall, due to its poor bioavailability.\nWhat is ‘Bioavailability’?\nThe bioavailability of a food is the amount of a nutrient which is available and readily absorbed by the body to use for metabolic purposes in the body, from the food that we ingest.\nSome nutrients have a high bioavailability and can be digested, absorbed and metabolised by the body with ease, however, when it has a poor or low bioavailability (certain vitamins and minerals) the process of digestion, absorption and metabolism can vary and this can also be impacted by other vitamins and minerals that we consume these can either inhibit or facilitate these processes.\nTo facilitate our body to increase the bioavailability of curcumin it has been found that adding black pepper enables this increase in bioavailability.\nA 6 month randomised, double-blinded and placebo controlled (high standard for testing) study, on subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, found that those who were not taking the placebo and had 3 capsules twice a day of curcumin, had a lower atherogenic risk, and an improvement in their metabolic profile (Chuengsamarn et al., 2014).\nPiperine in Black Pepper\nThe compound, piperine, found in black pepper is what gives black pepper its taste.\nPiperine has been shown to increase the bioavailability of nutrients in both food and supplements. This includes selenium, the B vitamins, and beta-carotene.\nPiperine has also been found to support and enhance the liver’s detoxification process (Murray et al., 2005).\nThe way that piperine enables the increase of bioavailability of nutrients and in this case curcumin, is that it inhibits the rate of metabolism of curcumin by increasing the time it resides in the intestines to increase intestinal absorption, and inhibits some of the enzymes (which are drug detoxifying enzymes) in the intestines that would usually break down and metabolise the curcumin (Ajazuddin, 2014).\nThis process of inhibiting enzymes is beneficial in the case for increasing the bioavailability of curcumin and another compound called EGCG (a polyphenol found in green tea which has been linked to certain health benefits). However, this can also negatively implicate the process in which our body excretes excess drugs through urine, halting the process, leading to elevated levels of the drugs in our system. This excretion of drugs helps to protect us from toxic chemical substances.\nA study found that when participants took a 2g capsule of curcumin alone, it was found at undetectable or very low levels in the serum levels in the blood (Shoba et al., 1998).\nWhen it was accompanied with 20mg of piperine, a higher concentration of serum levels was found from 0.25 to 1-hour post administration, the researchers found an increase in bioavailability of 2000%. It was found that piperine increases the bioavailability of curcumin with no adverse effects (Shoba et al., 1998).\nIt was also found that when curcumin and piperine are administered together, the intestinal absorption rate increased, and stayed significantly longer in the body tissue than when curcumin was administered alone (Suresh and Srinivasan, 2010).\nHow Much Black Pepper Do You Need?\nAlthough there is limited information on how much black pepper is required to aid bioavailability, it is advised that we eat between 1 to 3g of powdered turmeric a day.\n5% of turmeric is composed of curcumin, and 5% (varies between 4.6%-9.7%) of black pepper (by weight) is composed of piperine. Sources state that even just 1/20th of black pepper can increase the bioavailability, and just 20mg of piperine is effective in enhancing bioavailability.\nAddition of Fat\nThe curcumin is also fat-soluble, which means that it needs fat to be dissolved and then absorbed directly into the bloodstream, where it does not need to be metabolised by the liver.\nIn meals where turmeric is used, there is usually a fat and black pepper in the meal, which aids the bioavailability and absorption of the turmeric. This is why in our turmeric latte, we include both black pepper and Lucy Bee Coconut Oil.\nStorage and Use of Pepper and Turmeric\nTo get the best flavour from your pepper, you should buy whole peppercorns, and grind them up yourself. This means that you will just be receiving peppercorns, and not pepper with other spices, which can happen when you purchase pre-ground pepper.\nYou should store pepper in a cool, dark and dry place. It is also best if you add pepper towards the end of cooking, as the oils in the pepper lose their flavour and aroma if heated for too long.\nYou can get turmeric in powdered form or fresh. When fresh it should be kept in the refrigerator, where it can last for a month. You can also slice it and store it in an airtight container for 3 months.\nIf using powder, you should store it in a tightly sealed container in a cool, dark and dry place, where it will last for up to a year.\nPoints to Note\nIf you suffer with a history of oxalate-containing kidney stones, you should avoid over consuming black pepper as it contains low amounts of oxalates (these prevent the absorption of calcium) (Murray et al., 2005).\nAs black pepper slows down the rate that the liver clears drugs, it is advised not to consume over 1tsp. a day with certain medications – please consult your health advisor if you are considering consuming over 1tsp. a day and on medication including digoxin or phenytoin (Turmeric for Health, 2016).\nUnless advised or discussed with your health professional, there is no need to take turmeric capsules. You can use the powered or fresh turmeric within meals and drinks.\nLong term ingestion of turmeric capsules may lead to nausea, diarrhoea, stomach ulcers, and other problems.\nResearch has shown that turmeric may slow blood clotting, so if you’re taking medication for blood thinning you should talk to your health advisor as well, before considering taking turmeric supplements.\nIt is also recommended that pregnant women do not take turmeric supplements as it can stimulate the uterus which can cause menstrual flow, but is safe to use when seasoning foods.\nBoth turmeric and black pepper have been used in Ayurvedic medicine. Black pepper is indigenous to Kerala, and in Ayurvedic medicine it was known as an important healing spice. It was combined with long pepper and ginger, forming a herbal blend called trikatu, an important ingredient in Ayurvedic formulas.\nBlack pepper was highly prized within trading and expensive to buy – it was even found stuffed in Ramessess II nostrils as part of the mummification process.\nIn Ayurvedic medicine, turmeric was believed to balance the three doshas, and was taken both internally and externally to help with a variety of ailments (Gallant, 2016).\nTurmeric has an abundance of beneficial health effects that you can research and read up on, especially with more research being conducted on just how powerful it is.\nJust be warned when it gets onto your hands it can stain them yellow!!\nI even put it on my fried egg (cooked in Lucy Bee Coconut Oil) in the morning, with some black pepper, delicious!\nAjazuddin.

25	cryptocurrency investment risks and phishing scam protection measures	Cryptocurrency investments carry high risks including price fluctuations and potential total loss. Cryptocurrencies are not legal tender but substitute currencies with uncertain market acceptance. To protect against phishing scams targeting crypto investors, companies should implement mail filters to block spam and malware, use multifactor authentication, encrypt sensitive data, and provide thorough user training. Additionally, watching for warning signs like exaggerated promises, foreign headquarters, and unsolicited contacts can help avoid fraudulent schemes.	"['How do you rate a crypto currency\nCrypto currencies: dubious business around Bitcoin & Co.\nThe soaring of Bitcoin stocks has sparked a real hype about cryptocurrencies. In addition to reputable providers, there are also black sheep at the start who take advantage of the gold digger mood around Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano & Co. Dubious companies and private individuals present themselves in Facebook groups, on Instagram and in messenger services or contact consumers unsolicited by e-mail. They promise financial freedom, high returns or permanent passive income through crypto mining, trading or investments in new, supposedly future-oriented cryptocurrencies.\nBusiness models unclear, cryptocurrency providers often abroad\nThe offers are often completely non-transparent and the business models incomprehensible. More detailed information is often only available after contacting or registering on the advertising websites. Often, however, the provider imprint is missing entirely on the websites or the providers are based abroad - also on Caribbean island states. If you have to try to enforce your rights over this distance, you have high costs and bad cards in case of doubt.\nConsumers are increasingly complaining about providers who lure them into dubious investments with deals in Bitcoins, Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano and other cryptocurrencies. The market watchdog experts at the Hessen Consumer Center are currently investigating complaints about almost 20 different providers and six different currencies.\nNew motto, old scam: pyramid schemes\nMany offers seem to be based on forbidden pyramid schemes. As a participant, for example, you should pay an entry fee or, as an ""agent"", recruit new prospects. For this you should receive commissions. Pyramid schemes like to promise investors high returns. But you need a steadily growing number of participants, because the payments to the members are financed by the contributions of the new participants. These constructs inevitably break down.\nAs with other investment offers, fraud cannot be ruled out either: if the provider has collected a large amount of money from bona fide investors, it disappears, never to be seen again.\nSix signs by which you can recognize dubious cryptocurrency providers\n- Exaggerated promises\nIgnore offers with conspicuously high returns or permanent passive income.\n- Headquarters abroad\nMake sure that the provider is not based abroad. In case of doubt, this can make it even more difficult for you to enforce your rights.\n- Refer friends\nIgnore requests to recruit new prospects yourself, even if you are promised high commissions or returns.\n- No imprint\nCheck whether the provider\'s website has an imprint.\n- Lack of transparency\nDo not trust opaque and incomprehensible business models about which you should only receive more information after contacting or registering.\n- Unsolicited contact\nIf you are contacted without having shown interest in cryptocurrencies beforehand, you should be suspicious.\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies is high risk\nBut you should be extremely careful even with presumably reputable offers. Cryptocurrencies are subject to high price fluctuations. A total loss cannot be ruled out. Bitcoin, Ethereum & Co. are not legal tender, but substitute currencies. Where they will be accepted as a means of payment and whether they will be able to assert themselves on the market can hardly be reliably predicted.\nThe Federal Government and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) also point out the risks for investors and the potential for fraud on their websites. Transactions with ""OneCoins"" - an alleged crypto currency - for example, has been banned by BaFin and the accounts of a company involved in trading have been blocked.\nInvestments without risk and effort, but with enormous profits in a short time, simply do not exist. If you want to build up assets, you can use suitable strategies such as a suitable diversification of your investments to reduce risks. Above all, it is important that you have a long investment horizon and compare different types of investment with one another.

Phishing campaigns focus on sending out high volumes of generalized emails with the expectation that only a few people will respond.\nIdentifying phishing email\nPhishing attacks work because they focus on simple human curiosity as opposed to other types of cyber-attacks that are bot driven and target software vulnerabilities. In the basic phishing attack, a social “engineer” may say or claim that:\n- They’ve noticed suspicious activity or log-in attempts (which they will fix if you click here…)\n- There’s a problem with your online account or payment information (just enter your credential here…)\n- You have to confirm some personal information (just enter it here…)\n- The attached invoice needs confirmation (open it to confirm your order)\n- You need to make a payment (just go to this link)\n- You’re eligible to register for a government refund (click here to find out how much)\n- You’re eligible for a free product (click here to see what that is)\nIn all instances, these emails will include a link or attach a document that will carry a malicious payload. Once clicked or opened, the malware will take over.\nWhat do you do if you inadvertently click on the link or open the document? Time is of the essence here. Shut down your computer completely and call your IT Department.\nWhat should the IT Department do?\nThe IT Department should have a cyber incident response plan that will:\n- Isolate the compromised device from the company network\n- Contact a forensic expert, if necessary, to:\n- collect and preserve the mailbox from compromised account\n- collect and preserve audit logs associated with the known compromised account\n- Review available audit log data to attempt to identify scope of compromise, including any evidence of data exfiltration\n- Assess security settings and configurations for the company’s Office 365 (the typical target) account for:\n- Known and potential vulnerabilities\n- Audit logs and associated settings\n- Forwarding and mailbox configurations / rules\n- Accounts and policies\n- Authentication practices\nHow to protect your company from phishing attacks?\nTraining, training, training. It’s all about being wary of the suspicious email and training tends to sharpen the user’s senses to emails that smell like phish.\nImplement a company-wide mail filter system that will block spam, viruses, and malware. Keep in mind that these products will not filter out all phishing email.\nImplement multifactor authentication across the company platform. If a user’s credentials are stolen, it’s not likely the user’s cell phone or YubiKey (a hardware authentication device) was also stolen. MFA serves as a potent speed-bump in the hacker’s plan. It won’t keep the phishing attack from spreading if the hacker successfully exfiltrates the target’s mailbox, but it does minimize internal havoc. Research shows that once in, the malware can spread throughout a network in less than two hours.\nClean up those mailboxes. One thing we’ve learned over 15 years of data breach work is that users’ mailboxes contain far more damaging information than they should for normal business purposes. We see social security numbers, medical/health information, driver’s license numbers, credit card numbers (complete with expiration dates, and CVV codes), tax returns —everything imaginable that a hacker can sell on the dark web. Such personal data should only be transmitted securely and should not be stored unencrypted in a mailbox.\nEncrypt your data (and keep the decryption key off the network). Encrypted data would be useless to the hacker and firm-wide encryption is not a heavy lift to accomplish these days.\nBack up your data (and confirm that you can restore your data from the backup).\nCarry cyber insurance. When all else fails, make sure your cyber insurance coverage includes losses from phishing attacks. Some policies characterize the clicking on a phishing email as a “volitional act” that could have been avoided and won’t cover it.\nWhat impact does a remote workforce have on the likelihood of a successful phishing attack?\nSimply stated, a remote workforce adds tremendous vulnerability to any company’s IT network. We’ve seen this many times in the years before the pandemic shutdown in companies that are staffed by in-home contract workers. These workers will use personal devices that may lack the necessary security measures, and they may be less guarded in their home setting. The risks have increased with more people working at home due to COVID-19. ZDnet reported Dec. 1 that “research suggests that remote workers have become the source of up to 20% of cybersecurity incidents.”\nHas the COVID-19 pandemic impacted phishing attacks?\nDuring the pandemic, many attackers pivoted to capitalize on the crisis. With more email flooding mailboxes and an “always connected” attitude, users are more vulnerable than ever to attacks. Studies suggest that one out of every four Americans received a phishing email related to the pandemic. Many of these relate directly to the pandemic and include fake job termination meeting alerts, access to federal funds, or links to health information.\nHow can experienced cyber counsel help with phishing attacks?\nFirst, experienced cyber counsel knows the drill, is used to the 24/7 nature of the response, and has a ready list of additional cyber responders, such as forensic and public relations experts. Cyber counsel will protect the early—and largely chaotic—communications with attorney client privilege and knows the proper order in contacting the insurance carrier, enforcement agencies, and any necessary public response.\nClaudia Rast is Practice Department Chair for the Intellectual Property, Cybersecurity and Emerging Technology Group at Butzel Long.

26	data interpretation process qualitative versus quantitative research	The data interpretation process differs substantially between qualitative and quantitative research. In qualitative research, conclusions are tentative and can change, being reviewed on an ongoing basis, with the validity of generalizations being the reader's responsibility. In quantitative research, conclusions and generalizations are formulated at the end of the study with a pre-determined degree of certainty, and the inferences/generalizations are the researcher's responsibility. Additionally, qualitative research develops initial understanding through process-oriented inquiry, while quantitative research provides conclusive results through statistical analysis to recommend final courses of action.	['Research is the most widely used tool to increase and brush-up the stock of knowledge about something and someone. In the field of marketing, business, sociology, psychology, science & technology, economics, etc. there are two standard ways of conducting research, i.e. qualitative research or quantitative research. While the qualitative research relies on verbal narrative like spoken or written data, the quantitative research uses logical or statistical observations to draw conclusions.\nIn a qualitative research, there are only a few non-representative cases are used as a sample to develop an initial understanding. Unlike, quantitative research in which a sufficient number of representative cases are taken to consideration to recommend a final course of action.\nThere is a never-ending debate on, which research is better than the other, so in this article, we are going to shed light on the difference between qualitative and quantitative research.\nContent: Qualitative Research Vs Quantitative Research\n|Basis for Comparison||Qualitative Research||Quantitative Research|\n|Meaning||Qualitative research is a method of inquiry that develops understanding on human and social sciences, to find the way people think and feel.||Quantitative research is a research method that is used to generate numerical data and hard facts, by employing statistical, logical and mathematical technique.|\n|Elements of analysis||Words, pictures and objects||Numerical data|\n|Objective||To explore and discover ideas used in the ongoing processes.||To examine cause and effect relationship between variables.|\n|Methods||Non-structured techniques like In-depth interviews, group discussions etc.||Structured techniques such as surveys, questionnaires and observations.|\n|Result||Develops initial understanding||Recommends final course of action|\nDefinition of Qualitative Research\nQualitative research is one which provides insights and understanding of the problem setting. It is an unstructured, exploratory research method that studies highly complex phenomena that are impossible to elucidate with the quantitative research. Although, it generates ideas or hypothesis for later quantitative research.\nQualitative research is used to gain an in-depth understanding of human behaviour, experience, attitudes, intentions, and motivations, on the basis of observation and interpretation, to find out the way people think and feel. It is a form of research in which the researcher gives more weight to the views of the participants. Case study, grounded theory, ethnography, historical and phenomenology are the types of qualitative research.\nDefinition of Quantitative Research\nQuantitative research is a form of research that relies on the methods of natural sciences, which produces numerical data and hard facts. It aims at establishing cause and effect relationship between two variables by using mathematical, computational and statistical methods. The research is also known as empirical research as it can be accurately and precisely measured.\nThe data collected by the researcher can be divided into categories or put into rank, or it can be measured in terms of units of measurement. Graphs and tables of raw data can be constructed with the help quantitative research, making it easier for the researcher to analyse the results.\nstroitkzn.ru Between Qualitative And Quantitative Research\nThe differences between qualitative and quantitative research are provided can be drawn clearly on the following grounds:\n- Qualitative research is a method of inquiry that develops understanding on human and social sciences, to find the way people think and feel. A scientific and empirical research method that is used to generate numerical data, by employing statistical, logical and mathematical technique is called quantitative research.\n- Qualitative research is holistic in nature while quantitative research is particularistic.\n- The qualitative research follows a subjective approach as the researcher is intimately involved, whereas the approach of quantitative research is objective, as the researcher is uninvolved and attempts to precise the observations and analysis on the topic to answer the inquiry.\n- Qualitative research is exploratory. As opposed to quantitative research which is conclusive.\n- The reasoning used to synthesise data in qualitative research is inductive whereas in the case of quantitative research the reasoning is deductive.\n- Qualitative research is based on purposive sampling, where a small sample size is selected with a view to get a thorough understanding of the target concept. On the other hand, quantitative research relies on random sampling; wherein a large representative sample is chosen in order to extrapolate the results to the whole population.\n- Verbal data are collected in qualitative research. Conversely, in quantitative research measurable data is gathered.\n- Inquiry in qualitative research is a process-oriented, which is not in the case of quantitative research.\n- Elements used in the analysis of qualitative research are words, pictures, and objects while that of quantitative research is numerical data.\n- Qualitative Research is conducted with the aim of exploring and discovering ideas used in the ongoing processes. As opposed to quantitative research the purpose is to examine cause and effect relationship between variables.\n- Lastly, the methods used in qualitative research are in-depth interviews, focus groups, etc. In contrast, the methods of conducting quantitative research are structured interviews and observations.\n- Qualitative Research develops the initial understanding whereas quantitative research recommends a final course of action.\nAn ideal research is one, which is conducted by considering both the methods, together. Although, there are some particular areas which require, only one type of research which mainly depends on the information required by the researcher. While qualitative research tends to be interpretative, quantitative research is concrete.', 'Difference Between Qualitative vs Quantitative Data\nThe analysis in any research project involves summarizing the mass of information that has been collected and presenting the end results in such a way that it communicates the foremost necessary findings or options. For example, if a vesture complete is making an attempt to spot the most recent trends among young girls, the complete can initially reach young girls and raise their queries relevant to the analysis objective. Once collecting this information, the vesture can analyze the data to spot patterns – for example, it should discover that almost all young girls would really like to examine additional sort of jeans. There are many alternative data analysis ways, but the two most commonly and majorly used are Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis.\nHead to Head Comparison between Qualitative vs Quantitative Data (Infographics)\nBelow are the top 8 differences between Qualitative vs Quantitative Data:\nKey Differences between Qualitative vs Quantitative Data\nOne variety of data is objective, up-to-the-point, and conclusive. The other variety of data is subjective, interpretive, and explained easily. Quantitative data can be counted, measured, and expressed using numbers. Qualitative data is descriptive and abstract and may be classified on traits and characteristics. The key variations between Qualitative and Quantitative data are as prescribed below:\n- The data type, in which the classification of objects is based on attributes (quality) is called qualitative data. The type of information that might be counted and expressed in numbers and values is called quantitative data.\n- Quantitative data relies on numbers. Simple arithmetic or additional advanced applied mathematics analysis is employed to get commonalities or patterns within the information. The results are usually seen in graphs and tables. Applications like Excel, SPSS, or R can be accustomed to calculate things like Average scores, range of times a specific answer was given, the correlation between two or additional variables, dependability, and validity of the results.\n- The approach to the inquiry within the case of qualitative data is subjective and holistic, whereas quantitative information has an associative objective and targeted approach.\n- Qualitative data determines the depth of understanding, whereas quantitative data ascertain the amount of prevalence.\n- In qualitative data, the sample size is small and is drawn from non-representative samples. Conversely, the sample size is massive in quantitative data drawn from the representative sample.\n- Qualitative data develops initial understanding, i.e. it defines the matter. In contrast to quantitative data, which recommends the ultimate course of action.\n- In the Qualitative kind, verbal data is collected. Conversely, in the quantitative kind, measurable data is gathered.\n- Qualitative analysis and data is conducted with the aim of exploring and discovering concepts utilized in the continuous processes. As hostile quantitative analysis data, the aim is to look at cause and result relationships between variables.\n- Elements utilized in the analysis of qualitative research are words, pictures, and objects whereas that quantitative analysis are of numerical information.\n- Lastly, qualitative data develops the initial understanding whereas, quantitative data recommends a final course of action.\nQualitative VS Quantitative Data\n|Meaning/Definition||This type of data analysis is a technique of inquiry that develops an understanding of human and social sciences, to seek out the means individuals think and feel.||This type of data analysis is a technique that is used to generate numerical information and hard facts, by using applied mathematics, logical, and mathematical technique.|\n|Approach||Qualitative may be a variety of subjective analysis that is more involved with non-statistical data that cannot be computed.||Quantitative may be a variety of objective analysis that quantifies data.|\n|Sample||Sample is small and is non-representative of the whole population||The sample is massive and can be generalized to hide the whole population.|\n|Data||Typical data embrace color, gender, nationality, religion, and plenty of additional.||Typical data embrace measurable quantities like length, size, weight, mass, and plenty of additional.|\n|Analysis||The analysis is employed to grasp why an exact development happens.||The analysis is bothered by what number or what quantity an exact development happens.|\n|Data Type||Qualitative data is text-based.||Quantitative data is number-based.|\n|Collection Method||Collected using interviews, written documents, observations.||Collected using surveys, observations, experiments, and interviews.|\n|Results||Results are simply aggregated for analysis and simply conferred.||Understanding of what individual variation means; deepening understanding, insights.|\n|Perceived Quality||It can be perceived as biased, inevitable, or lateen to get sure results.||Offers credibility of an associate outsider creating an assessment.|\nQualitative vs Quantitative Data Comparison Table\nLet us discuss the top comparison between Qualitative vs Quantitative Data:\n|Hypothesis||Tentative, Evolving, supports a specific study.||Specific, testable, explicit before a specific study.|\n|Sampling||Purposive: Intent to pick out “small”, not essentially representative, sample so as to induce in-depth understanding.||Random: Intent to pick out “large”, representative sample so as to generalize results to a population.|\n|Research Setting||Controlled setting not as necessary.||Controlled to the degree potential.|\n|Approach to Inquiry||Subjective, holistic, process-oriented||Objective, focused, outcome-oriented.|\n|Data Interpretation||Conclusions are tentative (can change), reviewed on an ongoing basis, conclusions are generalizations.

27	As a musician, I'm curious about Youssra El Hawary's musical style.	Youssra El Hawary is a singer/songwriter who blends Cairo's underground music scene with French chanson, Indie rock and jazz. She plays the accordion while singing original songs, and performs as the leader of her band from Cairo, Egypt.	['Music Is the Universal Language\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow was credited with the following quote many years ago: “Music is the universal language of mankind.”\nJoe Clifford, Executive Director of the Lebanon Opera House, apparently is an exponent of that theory and from October 10-12 he made that bit of wisdom a reality for the Lebanon community and the Upper Valley. Joe arranged to host a group of musicians from Egypt to tour the region and give performances for area music students and concert-goers.\nThe musicians were part of a band from Cairo, Egypt who were making their American debut. The group was led by Youssra El Hawary, a singer/songwriter who playfully blends the sounds of Cairo’s underground music scene with French chanson, Indie rock and jazz. She proved to be a captivating performer who plays the accordion while singing original songs. The Upper Valley tour began with a performance at Lebanon High School to treat the music students and others, followed by a another appearance for the Dartmouth College music department at the Hopkins Center for The Arts. Before departing the area, the band gave a stunning farewell concert at Lebanon’s First Congregational Church.\nThe reception by area music devotees turned into a rewarding experience for all involved, including the band itself. Perhaps the music was a new concept and the lyrics were in Arabic, but the message remained the same. Music is indeed universal. How did all this musical magic come about? Joe explains.\n“The band embarked on their US tour this Fall thanks to a program called Center Stage. Center Stage is a partnership between the US State Department and the New England Foundation For The Arts. Every two years they produce tours from a handful of artists between two countries in conflict and this round featured Egypt and Ukraine. I have long admired Center Stage and decided this was the year the Lebanon Opera House would jump into the mix. Once the show was booked, I worked with the band’s managers to develop an enriching residency in the Upper Valley. It was great fun drawing on my experiences doing this kind of work at the Hopkins Center at Dartmouth.”\nThe band kicked off the local tour at Lebanon High School by conducting a lecture/demonstration which proved to be a fantastic way for the students, many Lebanon High band members, to be exposed to unfamiliar rhythms and instrumentation. Lauren Haley, the director of bands at Lebanon High School, noted the local reaction by her students.\n“Youssra El Hawary is a very talented artist and it was wonderful having her band come to our school to perform for our students. I was particularly excited that the band so openly discussed what their music was about. They answered thoughtful questions from our students and together we were able to discuss similarities and differences between our music and cultures.” Lauren said.\nThe musical exchange tour proved to be a true highlight for the band, as well. Youssra El Hawary pointed out that for her and the band, it was an equally rewarding experience.\n“We were delighted to see that everyone was so interested in our music and our culture,” Youssra explained. “The people here are so open and friendly… it is amazing! What people may not realize, however, is that in our native Egypt, American music has a huge following. Our band members all grew up listening to all types of American music including Rock ’n’ Roll. My favorite growing up was Michael Jackson! We were most delighted with all the feedback we received and the reaction to our performances.”\nJoe Clifford now looks toward the future and the prospect of presenting more cultural events for Lebanon and the surrounding communities.\n“Given my extensive background connecting artists and audiences through contact and content, I hope to continue this kind of engagement at the Lebanon Opera House at least once per season. It’s our mission to serve as the Upper Valley’s community arts hub and Lebanon’s shifting demographics.”']	['<urn:uuid:06b126e9-d2b8-4249-a937-b50f89719263>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	11	38	666
28	I'm interested in learning about fish populations. What makes fish stock levels go up and down even when fishing is kept at a steady rate?	When a stock is fished at a constant fishing value, the spawning stock biomass will not remain constant but will fluctuate due to natural factors, particularly naturally varying recruitment. Fish stocks can be expected to fluctuate around a notional biomass level, conditional on recruitment and abundance of potential predator species.	"['The latest scientific advice on spurdog points to the reintroduction of a bycatch allowance as…\nMulti-annual Management Plans in the Common Fisheries Policy\nA briefing note for Co-legislators\n1. Multi-annual Management Plans will be the principal vehicle for the delivery of CFP objectives in the years ahead. As such, it is of paramount importance that they are well designed, workable, absorb the lessons learned from the past, and fit well within the wider context of the CFP and the EU’s international obligations.\n2. Co-legislators are currently engaged in trialogue discussions over the shape and design of a multi annual plan for the Baltic. Although not set in stone, there is a belief that as the first of the new generation plans, the Baltic will set the pattern for future plans in the North Sea and Western Waters\n3. Multi-annual plans, along with implementation of the EU landing obligation, the achievement of maximum sustainable yield and regionalisation lie at the heart of the CFP as reformed in 2013. It is important that all of these elements are treated with equal respect.\n4. The experience of the EU Cod Management Plan, and its subsequent evaluation by STECF (the scientific body which advises the Commission) illustrated the weakness of single-species management plans. It also highlighted the need to ensure that, as far as possible, quotas in mixed fisheries are coherent and do not move too far in divergent directions. This led the Commission to request ICES to suggest fishing mortality ranges in the area at the top of the MSY effort/ yield curve. Using this understanding of MSY would provide managers some room to manoeuvre to achieve maximum sustainable yield for a group of species caught together in a mixed fishery and would greatly assist the process of implementing the EU landings obligation. To us it would seem that this approach would be the most consistent with the CFP’s legal obligation to ensure that fishing … “activities….are environmentally sustainable in the long term and ….consistent with the objectives of achieving economic, social and employment benefits, and of contributing to the availability of food supplies.” (Article 2.1 of the CFP Basic Regulation. 1380/2013)\n5. Looking forward to the full implementation of the landing obligation, using F ranges to provide this flexibility is likely to be one of the most important ways in which choke species in mixed fisheries may be mitigated. This is going to be an absolutely essential tool in dealing with chokes in mixed fisheries under the landing obligation. Chokes arise under the landing obligation when the quota for one species in a mixed fishery is exhausted, precluding a vessel, fleet or country from catching its main economic species.\n6. Fisheries managers and fisheries stakeholders need the co-legislators to provide a workable framework which provides ambition, direction and guidance, whilst simultaneously avoiding the rigidity of inflexible plans that cannot adapt to changing circumstances. But to achieve this it will be important to avoid a narrow, unduly legalistic, interpretation of MSY which understands MSY only as a point at the top of an equilibrium single-species yield curve rather than an area in which sustainable high long term yields can be produced.\n7. In this context, it is extremely important to appreciate that across all the main species groups in the North East Atlantic, North Sea and Baltic we are no longer talking about seriously depleted stocks but rather fisheries at or close to the top of the effort/yield curve. In the words of ICES:\n""Over the last ten to fifteen years, we have seen a general decline in fishing mortality in the Northeast Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. The stocks have reacted positively to the reduced exploitation and we\'re observing growing trends in stock sizes for most of the commercially important stocks. For the majority of stocks, it has been observed that fishing mortality has decreased to a level consistent with Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) – meaning levels that are not only sustainable but will also deliver high long term yields.""\nEskild Kirkegard, Chairman of the Advisory Council of the International Council for Exploration of the Seas, July 2015, State of the Stocks Seminar, Brussels\n8. Against this background, the fierce but ultimately sterile arguments currently raging about the precise definition of maximum sustainable yield, tend towards the theological; This applies especially to the definition and use of Bmsy as the putative goal of fisheries management. During the meeting with stakeholders in 2015, ICES explained very clearly that:\n""When a stock is fished at a constant F value, the SSB will not remain constant but will fluctuate due to natural factors, particularly naturally varying recruitment. If the fishery is constrained so that F = Fmsy, the stock can be expected to fluctuate around a notional biomass Bmsy.""\n(MIACO 2015 Document 6a Fisheries Advice MSY approach)\nWe concur with this notion that aiming and realising fishing mortalities in the region of Fmsy are expected to lead to stocks growing to high biomass levels but always conditional on recruitment and abundance of potential predator species.\nThe essentially pointless doctrinal disputes about MSY overlook the broader issue: how do we manage mixed fisheries within the context of the EU landings obligation? For most stocks we are already in the zone of high yield fisheries and narrow legalistic arguments about the exact point of MSY misses the big picture which is that understanding MSY in terms of fishing mortality ranges will provide managers with scope to set TACs that are coherent in mixed fisheries.\n9. It is worth recalling that the political reality for those stocks which are jointly managed with Norway is that the quotas are set through mutually agreed consultations each year, notwithstanding the contents of any EU plans that are in place.\n10. It is a tenet of good governance that the views of the regulated should be taken into account by the regulators in both the design and implementation of new regulations; Europêche represents the collective views of some 45 thousand fishing vessel operators and 80 thousand fishermen working many diverse fisheries and from many different sizes and styles of vessels; all of whom will be directly affected by the new generation management plans. As such we consider that we are not just opinion-holders but stakeholders and that as such our view should be given due weight.']"	['<urn:uuid:9ff11b3e-be6e-42b1-a52c-ae06ff350b7f>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	25	50	1054
29	identify real differences features malware vs antivirus software purpose functions compared	Malware and antivirus software have opposite purposes and functions. Malware is malicious software designed to harm computers by causing damage, stealing information, or disrupting normal operations. It includes various types like viruses, adware, rootkits, and worms that can slow down systems, create pop-ups, lock files, and steal personal data. In contrast, antivirus software is protective software specifically designed to prevent, scan, detect and remove malware from computer systems. Antivirus programs use various techniques including pattern recognition and heuristics to identify and eliminate malicious code, though they may sometimes generate false positives by incorrectly identifying legitimate files as threats.	['Malware is a type of infection that can cause damage to your computer. It usually comes in the form of a malicious software package, a rootkit, that combines different software tools to gain root access and control over your system. Adware can also become malware, forcing your browser to be redirected to websites that advertise products and services. Adware is particularly dangerous because it often tries to trick you into downloading more malware.\nSymptoms of a Malware infection\nIf your computer is slowly running and it seems as if everything is sluggish, there may be a malware infection on your system. This can affect the performance of your operating system, Internet connection, and applications. Besides malware, other common causes of a slow PC include memory issues, a fragmented system, a lack of disk space, and hardware problems. If you suspect your computer is running slowly, here are some easy tips for diagnosing the problem.\nOne of the most common symptoms of malware infection is the appearance of pop-ups. These are annoying, especially when they show up when you’re not online. These pop-ups may contain pornographic material and make you feel uncomfortable. You should never click on them; instead, run anti-malware software to remove them. Additionally, being wary of suspicious emails or attachments would be best.\nMalware is a broad term for any malicious software affecting your computer. It includes adware, viruses, and Trojans. These programs can cause your computer to run slowly, cause pop-ups, and even lock your files. Malware can also cause your computer to crash frequently, leading to data loss. To prevent this problem, it’s essential to back up your files often.\nMalware usually requires an internet connection to complete its attack. Therefore, disabling Wi-Fi, data, and Bluetooth can make your computer less vulnerable to attacks. You can also run system scans to remove the malicious code that has infected your device. You may have to reformat your PC or wipe it clean if you can’t remove the malware.\nTypes of Malware\nMalware has several different types, each of which can damage your computer. These infections often come in email attachments or executable files, and they replicate themselves from computer to computer. They can also be hybrids, which combine several types of characteristics. In addition, some classes may affect different targets. Understanding the different types of malware can help you defend your computer. If you’re unsure which type of infection you have, you can find more information about malware at www.com.\nThe most common type of malware infection is a virus. Other types of malware include adware and spyware. These types of malware are often used to steal personal information from computers. Ultimately, these attacks aim to take advantage of your system to gather financial gain. In essence, malware is any software that is designed with malicious intent.\nRootkits: These infections are often hard to remove. These programs are injected into the operating system, which grants the malicious actor complete control over the computer. They can also hijack antivirus and security software, causing significant damage to the computer. They are distributed through phishing, malicious downloads, or infected shared drives.\nViruses: Computer worms are another type of malware. They replicate and infect other computers without human intervention. They usually get inside the system through a security vulnerability, malicious file, or link. These worms look for different networked devices to attack, and many disguise themselves as legitimate work files.', 'Difference between Antivirus and Malware\nKey Difference: Antivirus or anti-virus software is a software that is used to prevent viruses from entering the computer system and infecting files. Many antivirus programs these days also eliminate different kinds of malware in addition to viruses. Malware, short for malicious software, is an umbrella term that incorporates all kinds of software or programs that can be used to disrupt normal computing capabilities.\nJust as it has become quite easy to find everything online, it has also become the best place to target people for personal information. There are many different malware that are looking out to harm the computer system or collect private data about the user. Fear not, there are companies that have built software and programs that can protect the user’s system. These are known as Antivirus and Antimalware software.\nAntivirus or anti-virus software is a software that is used to prevent viruses from entering the computer system and infecting files. Many antivirus programs these days also eliminate different kinds of malware in addition to viruses. The main purpose of an antivirus software is to scan, detect, prevent and remove many different kinds of software. The software employs a variety of strategies to detect viruses including searching for known patterns of data within executable code. However, the computer is still vulnerable against new types of viruses that may use different codes.\nIn order to counter this, many antivirus programs use heuristics, which is a technique that is designed to solve a problem more quickly than a classic method. This is done by creating an approximate solution when the classical solution fails. Initially, only executable files were corrupted or infected with viruses but with the new viruses, many files could also become infected requiring antivirus programs to manually search all files and folders that are available in the system. There are also drawbacks to having antivirus programs such as false-positive. This is when the antivirus program detects a non-malicious file as a virus and deletes it from the system. If the file is an important file, it could cause the operating system to stop working or certain applications to crash. Hence, files should be reviewed before they are deleted from the system.\nMalware, short for malicious software, is an umbrella term that incorporates all kinds of software or programs that can be used to disrupt normal computing capabilities. These software or programs can be used by attackers disrupt computing operation, gather sensitive information or access private secure systems. Almost all kinds of disruptive programs including spam mail are included under malware. Malware includes computer viruses, ransomware, worms, trojan horses, rootkits, keyloggers, dialers, spyware, adware, malicious BHOs, rogue security software, etc.\nMalware comes in forms of code, scripts, mail, software and even legitimate programs. Malware is commonly used as a means to gather statistics, sensitive data (name, address, credit card information, etc.), send mass spam e-mails, host contraband data, send advertisement, etc. The most common used malware includes viruses and worms. Malware exploits security defects in software, operating system and applications. The most common way to keep the system from malware includes anti-malware and anti-virus software. If a system is already infected, then system restore and formatting can be used to fix the computer. There are also professionals that work to clean the computer of the malware for a cost.\nMalware are software that cause problems in the computer including causing files to crash, altering or deleting files, saving private information and recording browsing habits. Antivirus is a software that aims at removing many different kinds of malware from a computer by detecting and preventing the malware from entering the computer in the first place.\nImage Courtesy: ideologics.co.uk, outsourcemanila.com']	['<urn:uuid:cd9c1753-4253-4f32-9988-7a96c965cc60>', '<urn:uuid:46a8a6d0-e775-4667-93c1-03eb707e4c09>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	11	98	1185
30	planning process risk monitoring steps	The planning process involves first establishing current state metrics across all relevant processes, then defining ideal future states with detailed measurements. This is followed by identifying obstacles and setting realistic timelines for achieving goals. The risk monitoring component requires identifying risks through analysis of internal and external factors, analyzing risks by creating probability distributions, responding with appropriate strategies, and continuously measuring both risks and opportunities. This monitoring process is complicated by the rapid speed of information flow and the complexity of modern business environments, requiring organizations to develop proactive response strategies and maintain continuous oversight of different management approaches.	"[""What's new in Polymer: Mar 29, 2023\nSecondary axes, Google Ads connector improvements, & more\nA gap analysis can show you where you are, where you want to be, and what to do to breach the gap between the two. Here's how to conduct a gap analysis, step by step.\nLearning how to conduct a gap analysis is vital to evaluate your company’s current state and help you ensure you’re going where you need to go.\nThat’s why, here, we’ll tell you everything you need to know about gap analyses, what they’re for, and how to conduct them step by step. We’ll also show you the tools and frameworks to get your gap analysis started.\nLet’s dive right in.\nA gap analysis is an audit that allows you to assess the current performance of your business, and compare it to an ideal performance. If needed it can also show the goals needed to bridge the gap between both of them, getting your performance as efficient as possible.\nA gap analysis is usually conducted by the heads of the departments involved, using different frameworks according to their industries, goals, and needs.\nGap analyses are used for analyzing the current state of a business, so they work great at providing a view of the current state, and establishing a road towards achieving your business goals.\nWith a gap analysis, you can get an external view of your processes, finding and understanding the roadblocks on your way towards your goals and quotas. With them, it can be easy to prioritize urgent tasks, better understand your problems, and help you find the right solutions.\nFinally, a gap analysis can not only show you how to reach your goals but anticipate the potential issues you may encounter down the line.\nHere’s how to conduct a gap analysis, step by step:\nThe first thing you need to do is to establish the current state of the business or process you’re analyzing.\nThe right way of determining your current state will depend on your measurements of success for each of your processes. You can, for example, establish the current state of your sales department as the average of both how much they sell per period and how often they hit their sales quota.\nYour current state can also be the level of engagement you have on social media, or your growth percentage in a new sector.\nMake sure to measure and establish a “current state” for all processes involved within the scope of your gap analysis.\nNow that you’ve defined where you are, it’s time to define where you want to be. If everything worked out perfectly, where would you want to be?\nThis is the part of the analysis where you get to be idealistic and imagine the ideal state of things, defining what you’re working towards. You can also define what you’d like to have or not have, the issues you’d like to have solved, and the numbers you’d like to be seeing.\nDefine it in detail, measuring the same way as you defined your current state.\nNow that you know where you are and you’ve defined where you want to be, we can define the gap in between to figure out how to bridge it.\nStart by analyzing your current state, determining the obstacles preventing your ideal state from becoming a reality. Some of these may be obvious, like the lack of staff or the overhead costs. Some, like the lack of training or an issue in your sales funnel, may be a bit harder to decipher.\nYou can also set a goal defining when you’d like to achieve your ideal state, and break down the progress you’d need to make month to month and year to year. If the goals aren’t realistically achievable, check why. Is there a bigger obstacle on your way or is your timeline just too short?\nKeep defining the goals you need to set to bridge the gaps between your ideal state and your current state until you have a realistic view of the issue.\nFinally, once you have a better understanding of where your gap is and why it’s there, you can start developing a plan to bridge it.\nThis process will likely involve the heads of each department affected, ensuring everyone is working together towards bridging that gap. Make sure your plan is composed of achievable goals with clear measurements of success, so the plan is clear down to every team member.\nNow, all that’s left is to implement it, and keep track of your goals every period to achieve your ideal state!\nHere are some common gap analysis frameworks to get you started:\nSWOT is a great framework to use when figuring out where your business stands within the market.\nThis framework focuses on defining your Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. Since determining these accurately is vital for the success of the analysis, you may want to invite experts from all departments involved to help define them. This will make for a data-driven framework that can better define the strengths and weaknesses of your business.\nThe Nadler-Tushman model is a dynamic framework made around defining the relationships between processes and finding all gaps involved with their efficiency. The framework does this by looking at all processes from start, or “input”, to finish, or “output”. Then, the framework takes a look at the culture, structure, people, and work, to determine how they relate to each other within one process.\nThis holistic view makes it a great framework to use when trying to align all departments and components of your company to work together towards a single goal.\nSource: Visual Paradigm\nThe McKinsey framework is made up of the 7 “S”s: Strategy, Structure, Systems, Shared values, Skills, Style, and Staff. The framework then divides those into two groups: the hard elements, composed of the first three “S”s, are tangible, measurable, and controllable elements. The soft elements, made up of the rest, are intangible and uncontrollable events.\nThis approach is especially useful when measuring the efficiency of your marketing efforts, and determining if a new route needs to be taken.\nFinally, the fishbone diagram is a simple cause-and-effect diagram made to get to the root of an issue by exploring and categorizing potential candidates. The diagram starts with an issue, or “effect”, and works backward dividing issues into six different sources: Methods, Machines, People, Materials, Measurement, and Environment.\nThis diagram, also called the Ishikawa diagram, is highly useful in brainstorming environments, providing a simple framework to organize ideas and visualize potential causes of an issue.\nAs we can see, conducting a gap analysis can help you figure out where your company stands, where it wants to go, and how to get there.\nOnce you’re conducting one, don’t spend too long adding on details. Instead, use your gap analysis to make data-driven decisions and develop an action plan to bridge that gap!\nSecondary axes, Google Ads connector improvements, & more\nAs artificial intelligence technology continues to advance, language models like ChatGPT are pushing the boundaries of what's possible.\nSee for yourself how fast and easy it is to create visualizations, build dashboards, and unmask valuable insights in your data.Start for free"", 'What is business risk management?\nBusiness risk management is a subset of risk management that is used to examine and understand the risk occurring due to changes in the processes, systems, or other business operations. A business risk framework identifies, tracks, prioritizes, and addresses risks to minimize adversities from unexpected events. Companies can gain the ability to make more informed risk-based decisions with the help of business risk management plan.\nWith a business risk management plan, businesses can prepare for the unexpected by minimizing risks and extra costs before they happen. By having a risk management plan in place, companies can also save money and make the organization’s future secure.\nBusiness risk management process\n- Identifying risks – Identifying the evolving risks by analyzing internal and external factors that affect the key business objectives.\n- Analyzing risks – It includes the standardization and creation of probability distributions of outcomes for each material risk.\n- Responding to risk – Once potential risks are identified and analyzed, an appropriate strategy needs to be incorporated to address the risk. This is done either by establishing new processes or eliminating the risk, depending on the type and severity of the risk.\n- Monitoring risk and opportunities – The final step in a business risk management process involves continually measuring the risks and opportunities of the business environment. Companies must also keep a check on the performance of different management strategies.\nBusiness risk management challenges and how to overcome them\nSpeed of information\nIn an era where news and information travel faster than wildfire, businesses do not have the luxury of time to undertake decision-making and formulate strategies as a part of business risk management once the news of a risk event is released. In several cases, a single risk event is attached to other unrelated risk events and when combined it may rapidly begin to erode the organization’s reputation and goodwill. To address such situations, some organizations are working proactively to consider their organization’s responses and business risk management strategies more robustly and well in advance of an actual event. Having different response playbooks that have business risks management strategies and responses identified in advance helps them to quickly respond to risk issues and diffuse some of the adverse effects on a timely basis.\nComplexity of business\nCyber threats, disruptive innovation, regulatory shifts, and changing social demographics may trigger significant risks for an organization. Furthermore, these risk drivers may be related to or can trigger other risks, adding to the complexity of the business risk management challenge. Despite this, the top management in most companies fail to recognize the value of embracing a more holistic and team-based enterprise-wide approach to risk assessment and mitigation. To overcome such setbacks, some organizations are rethinking how they approach risk identification and assessment to find ways to bring together the collective minds of a number of individuals to think through potential risk drivers explicitly and proactively. This is done based on the perceived benefits of putting several minds to work when identifying and assessing risks. It is essential to have varied perspectives on complex risk issues in order to face the realities of today’s complex business environment.\nIntegration of risk oversight and strategy\nSome organizations may experience a disconnect between their organization’s business risk management and strategic planning activities. In many companies, business risk management is viewed as a compliance or regulatory activity. This means that often risk management in organizations are transferred to a lower level, non-strategic position. As a result, the organization’s business risk management efforts are often inadequately integrated with strategic planning. To address this challenge, rather than starting off by analyzing what drives value for the organization, companies must first understand what risks are on the horizon. By starting the conversation with what is strategically important to the business and then asking what might prevent that from succeeding, business leaders will be able to identify how business risk management can be positioned to provide strategic value.']"	['<urn:uuid:c7e028c4-91f6-49c5-9285-744ed4e28e38>', '<urn:uuid:70a7e1e4-4d34-4708-8ffc-19683a216447>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	5	99	1863
31	What are the specific flying skills that commercial maneuvers help develop, and what safety resources and attitudes should pilots maintain during flight?	Commercial maneuvers develop several crucial flying skills, including proper rudder usage, cross-coordination during climbs and turns, precise control during steep turns up to 60 degrees, and proper handling of the aircraft during slow flight and stalls. These maneuvers require an aggressive eyes-out flying style and help internalize a solid 'feel' for the airplane. Regarding safety resources and attitudes, pilots should maintain access to Aircraft Emergency frequency 121.5, ATC communication, weather briefings, and current charts. They should approach flying with a balanced attitude - avoiding overconfidence while maintaining competence, following FAA rules, making thoughtful rather than impulsive decisions, and leaving ego aside to focus on safe flying practices.	"['Commercial-level pilot maneuvers provide a wonderful challenge and new skills for every pilot. These are not only fun but teach correct rudder usage when flown properly. Many pilots at the private level do not understand or apply correct rudder inputs. “Rudder deficit” is a primary reason for LOC-I. Search out a qualified instructor and take your flying to a higher level of proficiency with some commercial maneuvers. Learning new skills and extending your flight envelope creates greater flight safety and is also great fun! These maneuvers are a gateway to an upset recovery course and aerobatics – but these should be mastered first to get full value from this kind of advanced training.\nMastering commercial maneuvers requires an eyes-out aggressive flying style at the edge of the flight envelope. This begins with a thorough aerodynamic knowledge of the forces at work. The heart of all the commercial maneuvers is a concept called “cross-coordinated.” When you are climbing in a chandelle or navigating your way through a lazy eight you are often applying “crossed controls” to create coordinated flight. The control inputs and forces at work are not initially intuitive. Mastery requires study and practice to internalize a solid “feel” for the airplane during this more aggressive commercial-level maneuvering. And though all these maneuvers are “non-operational,” but you will be rewarded with much more precise (and safer) flying skills as well as a greater sense of confidence and control.\nStep one in discovering commercial maneuvers is getting the eyes outside and rediscovering aggressive VFR flying; “yank and bank.” Most pilots in a normal flight training progression just completed an instrument rating (smooth standard rate turns with reference to their trusted instruments). Commercial training can come as a shock, requiring outside visual references and a “tuned up butt” to properly sense and correct yaw. Try some private pilot steep turns at 45 degrees and work up to 60 degrees. Then reverse at 180 degrees of turn and work up to “60/90s” (reversing a 60-degree banked steep turn after 90 degrees of turn). This is “old school” flying – find a good instructor to help you. This will get a little sweat going as well as demonstrate the need for an outside sight reference and positive control usage.\nStep two is serpentine climbing 30 degree turns right and left with full power and a Vx attitude. This will quickly demonstrate the need for right rudder while climbing in a left turn and left aileron while climbing in a right turn. Initially, this feels “unnatural” for many private pilots, but this is the beginning of understanding “cross-coordination” and will progress into chandelles. Your pattern crosswind turns will be immediately safer with your newly-mastered “cross-coordination.”\nA series of climbing and descending (coordinated) wingovers – working toward a lazy eight – will demonstrate the need for quick and accurate rudder usage as the wing loads and unloads. Suddenly pilots are “flying again” after 40 hours of instrument standard rate turns (or years of rope-a-doping around the pattern); fun! These climbs and descents also illustrate the changing yoke forces necessary to maintain specific flight attitudes as the speed of the aircraft changes the effectiveness of the flight controls.\nThe last step in this introduction to commercial flight maneuvers is some slow flight and stalls first straight ahead, then turning. Flight training is an opportunity to fly at minimum control speed with the horn blaring (just don’t do it on a flight test – the FAA is sensitive about this). Bank 30 degrees right and left aggressively at the edge of a stall. Coordination is essential and LOTS of rudder is required to pivot left and right on the edge of a stall. Then demonstrate an old-style power off stall recovery letting the nose fall through the horizon with the yoke all the way back (stay stalled till the nose is down). As an instructor, when your pilot-in-training sees this dramatic nose-down attitude (while still feeling the stall) some understanding of angle of attack will be immediately built. (The angle of attack indicator in every plane is how much chrome is showing on the control yoke shaft).\nTurning stalls recovered without power (just releasing AOA) are the last maneuver in this sortie as you descend turning right and left while stalling and recovering. This again shows the need for coordination and the power of AOA for recovery. Turning stalls are part of the Private Pilot ACS and often missed during initial training. Engage a qualified instructor and master some commercial maneuvers. Soon you will add finesse, safety (and FUN) to your regular flying.

Join SAFE and receive other great benefits (1/3 off ForeFlight!) Flying Mag, GA News.', 'There is a truism in aviation that flying requires safety and there is nothing funny about safety. While stern in appearance, this is not the same as saying there is no fun in flying. If there weren\'t, why would we pursue flying in the first place? Ask any pilot and you get stories of flying adventures, feelings of freedom in the air, and pure ""joie de vivre"" through flight. Safety, and the procedures required for it, are part of the aviation process. Redundancies are part of the pre-flight check, general aviation safety and FAA regulations.\nAny flight, whether a short hop to an adjoining airfield, or a long jaunt cross-country, requires a pre-flight check. Too often, pilots become complacent and do a perfunctory pre-flight. This is a dangerous attitude and one that needs to be checked at the door. Make a list for your aircraft and stick to it, each and every time. The pre-flight needs to include sumping and checking the fuel, checking oil levels, feeling tightness on the belts, looking for any bends or compromises in the air frame, a full check of the landing gear, and going over the empennage and ailerons. The pitot tubes must be checked for debris and any ""remove before flight"" tags removed. This list is a basic outline, and with each different aircraft there may be more items to go over. The notion of ""familiarity breeds contempt"" changes to ""familiarity leads to laziness"" as many pilots may develop bad habits when carrying out pre-flight checks on familiar aircraft. For safety\'s sake do not compromise on the pre-flight check.\nPilot Attitudes Towards Safety\nThere are several attitude ""killers"" in aviation, and all of them need to be addressed, recognized and corrected if you wish to be a safe pilot who lives to fly another day. Ask any Alaska bush pilot and you hear the adage ""there are old pilots, and bold pilots, but there are no old and bold pilots."" Having too much sense of bravado or invincibility leads to poor decisions and an over-inflated sense of skills. This is not to say you should not recognize or admit aptitude, but there is a fine line between competence and cockiness.\nThe Safety Killing Attitudes\nAmong the attitudes that contribute the most to declining safety are outlined below. Learn how to recognize these in yourself and fellow aviators so that you are able to correct them before you get into trouble:\nAnti-Authority: When an anti-authority stance is taken, ""cowboy"" attitudes envelope decision-making. Contrary to popular opinion, the FAA is not here to ruin our day, the agency\'s rules are there for a reason. In order to keep all of us safe, each of us is duty bound to follow rules.\nResignation: By taking this tact, you give up before you begin. Look around at most aviators and you see confidence and aptitude. However, when resignation appears, self-fulfilling prophecies swallow good piloting decisions.\nInvincibility: The idea you are not going to have any accidents or you possess some sort of magic aura that protects you from all things bad. Get over it. Bad things can and will happen to you with this attitude.\nRashness: Impulsive decisions lead to errors. Take the time to think out your moves and choices. Even in emergency situations, the difference between a one or two second breath and immediate reactions often leads to better decisions. Slow down.\nMachismo/Bravado: This is not limited to men only. This attitude has the potential to affect female pilot decisions as well. Ask yourself why are you up here flying. Is it to have bragging rights or to show off, or is it for the pure love of flying? Leave the ego at the door and just fly.\nIn Flight Safety\nWhen in the air, you need to be familiar with the many facets of safe flight. Knowing the proper altitude to fly at (are you flying east or west?), how to communicate on the radio, use a chart, and recognize lights and markers are essential (and part of any pilot\'s training).\nWhen in doubt, call and ask for help. There are many resources for safety while on the ground or in the air. Examples include:\nAircraft Emergency 121.5\nTalk to ATC\nKnowing how weather behaves, what the topography does to influence the weather and how the airplane reacts or is affected by weather is important for safe flight. Go through a full weather briefing before flights, using any ASIS, or weather resource available at your location. Charts have this information and with Internet empowered devices, pilots have access to weather and changing conditions at the tips of their fingers.\nPlan contingencies if mountain flying and go over the route prior to taking to the air. Foreknowledge is power and power is safety. Keep charts at the ready, or electronic devices programmed with the charts and left on the home screen.\nCome Home and Enjoy Safe Flight\nSafety is not boring or the realm of worriers. Safety is the key to fun flying. May the wind be on your tail and the sky blue.\n- FAA – FARS, 14CFR http://www.flightsimaviation.com/data/FARS/part_121-127.html\n- AOPA Safety http://www.aopa.org/asf/\n- FAA-AIM – Regulations http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/faa_regulations/\n- Aviation Knowledge http://aviationknowledge.wikidot.com/sop:hazardous-attitudes']"	['<urn:uuid:5b838293-cbd2-49b9-8e3c-baf781188526>', '<urn:uuid:8b9cc92a-26e8-4590-9b6c-56de4ce0637f>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	22	107	1674
32	As a classical viola enthusiast, I'm curious about the Bartók Viola Concerto - could you tell me what makes it unusual in terms of its composition history?	The Bartók Viola Concerto was the composer's final composition, begun in 1945 and left incomplete at his death as just a few sketches. It was later completed by Bartók's assistant Tibor Serly, though according to Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Serly's completion 'cannot be considered definitive.' Despite its questionable pedigree, it has become a staple of the viola repertoire.	['When a new recording of the Bartók Viola Concerto crossed my desk recently it immediately caught my attention. Begun in 1945 and left incomplete at the time of his death – actually it was just a few sketches – this was the composer’s final composition. Although in the words of Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians Bartók’s assistant Tibor Serly’s completion of the concerto “cannot be considered definitive,” it has always been a favourite of mine. Motherland (Warner Classics 0190295697693 warnerclassics.com) features young superstar violist David Aaron Carpenter performing concertos by Dvořák, Bartók and Walton, plus a number of concerted works by Kiev-born, New York City resident Alexey Shor (b.1970) with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.\nCarpenter, born in NYC in 1986, has had a remarkable career, winning the 2005 Philadelphia Orchestra Young Artists Competition, the Walter W. Naumburg Viola Competition the following year and an Avery Fisher Career Grant in 2010. His first recording, Elgar and Schnittke concertos, was praised highly in these pages in October 2009 by Terry Robbins, and two subsequent outings met with similar attention in Robbins’ Strings Attached column in recent years. With that in mind, I had no qualms about holding back Carpenter’s latest recording for my own collection. Of course I had to start with the Bartók, and I was immediately transported back to the heights I first scaled when introduced to this work by Yehudi Menuhin’s performance with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Antal Dorati’s direction half a century ago. We’ll likely never know just how much of this atypical work is Bartók’s and how much that of Serly. Strangely though, it is a much more original work than Serly’s own Rhapsody for Viola and Orchestra which is replete with borrowings from his master. Carpenter’s stunning performance reminds us why, its questionable pedigree notwithstanding, this concerto is a staple of the viola repertoire.\nThe first CD (of two) opens with Joseph Vieland’s transcription of Dvořák’s masterful Cello Concerto, to which Carpenter has added his own refinements. It is very effective, but as a cellist I can’t help but notice that the power and anguish of the cello’s upper register, its chanterelle range, is not equalled when the viola plays the same pitches. That being said, it is still a captivating performance, with the orchestra under Kazushi Ono in fine form. Especially noteworthy are the horn solos. The second disc begins with William Walton’s concerto, which was commissioned by Lionel Tertis in 1929. Tertis was not convinced and declined to premiere the work but later, in words of Andrew Morris “was good enough to admit his mistake.” Tertis said: “The innovations in [Walton’s] musical language, which now seem so logical and so truly in the mainstream of music, then struck me as far-fetched.” To our modern ears it seems hard to imagine this lush and romantic work being received as anything but a masterpiece.\nThere is more than an hour of music by Shor dispersed across the two discs, and frankly I don’t know why. The inclusion of his Seascapes, a four-movement work for viola and orchestra, would have more than sufficed. His motion-picture soundtrack sensibility makes even the Dvořák and Walton sound modern, and the 13-movement Well Tempered Chanson, a compendium of encores written for Carpenter, seems like just too much dessert. The Bartók, however, is worth the price of admission.\nSpeaking of film scores and people named Shor(e)… last year Canadian superstar film composer Howard Shore took time out from his day job to compose a celebratory cantata to honour Canada’s sesquicentennial. Sea to Sea/D’un ocean à l’autre was commissioned by the New Brunswick Youth Orchestra (nbyo-ojnb.com) and was first performed on July 2, 2017 at the Canada 150 Stage, Riverfront Park, Moncton. That performance featuring New Brunswick’s pride and joy, soprano Measha Brueggergosman, and the Choeur CANADA150 Choir was recorded and is now available from Leaf Music (LM217 leaf-music.ca). With bilingual lyrics by Elizabeth Cotnoir, the nine-minute work opens with a horn fanfare to set the stage and then launches into jubilant praise for our fair land. After the bombastic opening there is a contemplative middle section gently declaring “We hold a vision.” The final section is a return to the opening exuberance, this time en français. The CD single also includes two “radio edit” versions, just under three minutes each, one in English and one in French.\nThe latest project from the 2016 Canadian Folk Music Awards Best Instrumental Group of the Year – Andrew Collins Trio – is the cleverly named pair of CDs Tongue and Groove (andrewcollinstrio.com). The first is a departure for the band, with 11 tracks featuring lead vocals by multi-mando frontman Collins for the most part, with harmonies and occasional lead lines provided by bass player James McEleney. The third member of the trio, Mike Mezzatesta, keeps busy on guitar, mandolin, fiddle and mandola. It’s an eclectic collection of traditional “down homey” numbers, novelty songs, cover versions and a few originals. Of particular note are Collins’ own reworking of Marijohn Wilkin and Danny Dill’s Long Black Veil and Roger Miller’s The Hat. But for me it is the instrumental disc Groove that really shines. Replete with some of the finest bluegrass pickin’ you’re likely to find this far north, there’s also a mix of styles, including some very Django-like vibes to which the double strings of Collins’ mandolin give a new twist, a beautiful lullaby and a couple of fiddle tunes. Standouts include Poplar Bluff, Kentakaya Waltz, Badabada Ba Ba and Big Toaster.\nIt seems that every month we receive a dozen or more CDs from the Parma Recordings group, which includes the labels Ravello, Big Round, Asonica and, in this case, Navona Records. Although my current activities as an amateur cellist are focusing on string-only ensembles, quartets and at the moment a trio, for many years I also played with pianists in the traditional piano trio formation – violin, cello and piano. Beginning with the classics, Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn (Felix and Fanny), Schumann (Robert and Clara), but eventually moving into the 20th century with Debussy, Shostakovich and contemporary Canadians including Colin Eatock and Daniel Foley – both of whom will be familiar to readers of The WholeNote – I spent countless hours exploring the repertoire with friends. So I was quite interested when a new double CD from Trio Casals, Moto Bello (nv6156 navonarecords.com) arrived. The Moto series “represents a curated collection of contemporary music by living composers with the traditional instrumentation of the acclaimed Trio Casals.” The group’s acclaim began in 1996 at the Pablo Casals Festival in Puerto Rico, from which I assume their name derives. There are ten composers included in this two-disc package, none of whom were previously known to me. The repertoire runs the gamut of contemporary styles, from approachable melodic works, through minimalism to craggy modernist sensibilities, and although most utilize the full trio resources, there are several solo and duo pieces. Of particular note is Beth Mehocic’s Somewhere Between D and C# for solo cello, with its exploration of ambiguous resolution. L. Peter Deutsch’s Ocean Air is a lovely suite in three movements harkening back to the late 19th century. Giovanni Piacentini’s Ondine begins in quiet Debussy-like arpeggiation that gradually builds into a stormy tempest before calming to gentle seas again. Each of the ten composers brings an individual voice to the medium, making for a varied and satisfying program. The playing is convincing and committed throughout. I was especially impressed by how complete the package was: a simple folded cardboard cover containing two CDs and a 12-page booklet with composer bios and program notes. I only wish that there was more information about the trio itself, and that the composers’ names were more discernable – pale blue type on a blue background is hard to read.\nAnother Navona recording that arrived recently looked strangely familiar to me. The Eloquent Saxophone featuring Toronto (now Cobourg) saxophonist, professor and founding member of the pioneering band Lighthouse, David Tanner and pianist Marc Widner (nv6158 navonarecords.com). It’s a charming collection of mostly French repertoire from the early 20th century, but also including more recent works by American Leslie Bassett and Gene DiNovi – a saxophone ensemble piece achieved through overdubbing the various parts. The disc begins with another saxophone quartet, the aptly named Serenade comique by Jean Françaix. Although most of the works were written for the saxophone, there is an effective transcription of Debussy’s Syrinx (originally for solo flute) in a warm and thoughtful rendition. Widner is the perfect accompanist for this repertoire, whether playing original piano lines or, in the case of Paule Maurice’s Tableaux de Provence, subbing for an entire orchestra. Also of note is Charles Koechlin’s Etude No.VIII from a set of saxophone and piano studies that were not published until 1970, 20 years after the composer’s death. The credits tell us that the recordings were made in 1988 in Toronto, the multi-tracking at Axon Music Productions and the rest in Walter Hall. That’s when I figured out what was so familiar. I checked my file card catalog of LP recordings, and sure enough, I have the original vinyl version of this disc put out on Apparition Records. Even the cover art is the same. The brief performer bios have been updated nominally and the order of the tracks has been modified – it used to start with Syrinx – but with the exception of the program notes, unfortunately missing from the CD reissue, the recording is the same. It was a welcome addition to my collection three decades ago, and it is welcome again now.\nOne final note, an intriguing percussion-centric disc of music by Baljinder Sekhon. Places & Times (innova 988 innova.mu) is, in the words of the composer, “no ordinary album of percussion ensemble music. These compositions explore a wide spectrum of possibilities offered by the percussion family, from the aggressive noise of a cymbal on piano strings and peaceful meditations created by finger cymbals gently buzzing on a vibraphone, to the curious thump of a person falling on a bass drum.” The disc features three percussion ensembles: Los Angeles Percussion Quartet; McCormick Percussion Group and Line upon Line Percussion. Three of the tracks include soloists: Dave Gerhart, steel pan; Dieter Hennings, guitar and Eunmi Ko, piano. Musica Casera, a 12-minute track that features guitar holding its own against a battery of percussion instruments, through delicate passages and thunderous sections, is particularly captivating. Another highlight is Sun for three percussionists all equipped with similar outfits: one keyboard, one skin, one wood and one metal instrument. They all share access to a large cymbal in centre stage, presumably the namesake of the piece. Despite similar resources, the combinations provide a very broad spectrum of sound and range.\nWe welcome your feedback and invite submissions.

33	What advantages do delta connections offer, and what grounding methods suit them?	In delta/delta connections, if one transformer is disconnected, the resulting open-delta can still maintain balanced 3-phase voltages while operating at 58% of normal rating. For delta-connected transformers lacking a neutral point, grounding can be achieved using star-connected earthing transformers, or alternatively, a Star-Delta Transformer can be used for operating voltages between 2.2KV to 3.3KV.	['Three Phase Transformer Connections:\nIn generation, transformation, transmission and utilization of electric energy it can be shown that it is economical to use the three-phase system rather than the single-phase. For Three Phase Transformer Connections, three single-phase transformers are needed. Two arrangements are possible: a bank of three single-phase transformers or a single three-phase transformer with the primary and secondary of each phase wound on three legs of a common core. The Three Phase Transformers unit costs about 15% less than that of a bank and furthermore, the single unit occupies less space. There is little difference in reliability, but it is cheaper to carry spare stock of a single-phase rather than a Three Phase Transformers. In underground use (mines) a bank of single-phase units may be preferred as it is easier to transport these units.\nThe bank also offers the advantage of a derated open-delta operation when one single-phase unit becomes inoperative. Reduced cost being an overweighing consideration, it is common practice to use a three-phase transformer unit. In a three-phase bank the phases are electrically connected but the three magnetic circuits are independent. In the more common three-phase, 3-limb core-type transformer (Fig. 3.39(a)), the three magnetic circuits are also linked. Where delinking of the magnetic circuits is desired in a three-phase unit, a 5-limb shell type transformer could be used (Fig. 3.39(b)).\nA variety of connections are possible on each side of a 3-phase transformer (single unit or bank). The Three Phase Transformer Connections could be connected in star, delta, open-delta or zig-zag star. Each of the Three Phase Transformers could have two windings or may have autoconnection. Further, certain types of connections require a third winding known as tertiary.\nLabelling of Transformer Terminals:\nTerminals on the HV side of each phase will be labelled as capital letters A, B, C and those on the LV side will be labelled as small letters a, b, c. Terminal polarities are indicated by suffixes 1 and 2 with 1’s indicating similar polarity ends and so do 2’s. Labelling of terminals is illustrated in Fig. 3.40 for phase a. Assuming the transformer to be ideal, VA2A1 (voltage of terminal A2 with respect to A1) is in phase with Va2a1 and IA is in phase with Ia.\nStar Star Transformer Connection (Y/Y):\nStar connection is formed on each side by connecting together phase winding terminals suffixes 1 as in Fig. 3.41(a). The phasor diagram is drawn in Fig. 3.41(b) from which it is easily seen that the voltages of the corresponding phases (and therefore of the corresponding lines) are in phase. This is known as the 0°-connection. The letters within brackets on the phasor diagram indicate the lines, to which the terminals are If the winding terminals on secondary side are reversed, the 180°-connection is obtained.\nIt is also observed from Fig. 3.41 that if the phase transformation ratio is x : 1, the line transformation (line-to-line voltages, line currents) the ratio is also x : 1.\nDelta Delta Transformer Connection (Δ/Δ):\nFigure 3.42(a) shows the delta/delta connection and the corresponding phasor diagram is given in Fig. 3.42(b). The sum of voltages around the secondary delta must be zero; otherwise delta, being a closed circuit, means a short circuit. With polarities indicated on the primary and secondary sides, voltages Va2a1,Vb2b1 and Vc2c1 add to zero as per the phasor diagram if the delta is formed by connecting a1b2, b1c2 and c1a2. It is easily seen from the phasor diagram that the primary and secondary line voltages are in phase so it is the 0°-connection. However, if the secondary leads a, b, c are taken out from the delta nodes a1b2, b1c2, c1c2, the secondary voltages are in phase opposition to the primary voltages can be visualized from the phasor diagram of Fig. 3.42(b). This is the 180°-connection.\nIt is also seen from Fig. 3.42(a) that if the phase transformation ratio is x : 1, the transformation ratio for line quantities is also x : 1.\nIn the delta/delta connection if one of the Three Phase Transformer Connections is disconnected, the resulting connection is known as open-delta. Supposing the b-phase transformer in Fig. 3.42(a) is removed, and the open-delta is excited from balanced 3-phase supply, then it easily follows from the phasor diagram of Fig. 3.42(b) that the voltage Vb2b1 = Vbc, does not change as it equals -(Vca + Vab); thus the voltages on the secondary side still remain balanced 3-phase. The open-delta connection supplying a balanced load is shown in Fig. 3.44. If the maximum allowable secondary phase current is Iph, the transformer can handle VA of\nThus the open-delta connection has a VA rating of 1/√3 = 0.58 of the rating of the normal delta/delta connection.\nStar Delta Transformer Connection (Y/Δ):\nStar connection is formed on primary side by connecting together 1 suffixed terminals; 2 suffixed terminals being connected to appropriate lines; the delta is formed by connecting c1a2,a1b2 and b1c2 with the lines connected to these junctions being labelled as a, b and c respectively as shown in Fig. 3.45(a). The phasor diagram of Three Phase Transformers is drawn in Fig. 3.45(b). It is seen from the phasor diagram on the delta side that the sum of voltages around delta is zero. This is a must as otherwise closed delta would mean a short circuit. It is also observed from the phasor diagram that phase a to neutral voltage (equivalent star basis) on the delta side lags by — 30° to the phase-to-neutral voltage on the star side; this is also the phase relationship between the respective line-to-line voltages. This connection, therefore, is known as — 30°-connection.\nThe + 30°-connection follows from the phasor diagram of Fig. 3.46(a) with the corresponding connection diagram as in Fig. 3.46(b).\nSimilarly ± 90°-connections are also possible in the star/delta connection by relabeling the delta side lines. For example for + 90° connection relabel c —> a, b —> c and a —> b. Reader may work out relabeling for — 90° connection.\nIn Indian and British practices ± 30°-connections are employed. The American practice is to use ± 90°-connections.\nIt follows from Fig. 3.45(a) that if the phase transformation ratio of the star/delta connection is x : 1, the line transformation ratio in magnitude is √3 : x/1.\nDelta Star Transformer Connection (Δ/Y):\nThis connection is simply the interchange of primary and secondary roles in the star/ delta connection. One just interchanges capital and small letter suffixings in Figs 3.45 and 3.46. Of course what was the — 30°-connection will now be the + 30°-connection and vice versa. If the phase transformation ratio is x : 1 (delta/star), the transformation ratio for line quantities will be (x/√3) : 1.\nDelta Zig Zag Star Connection:\nThe winding of each phase on the star side is divided into two equal halves with labelling as in Fig. 3.47. Each leg of the star connection is formed by using halves from two different phases. The phasor diagram for this connection is given in Fig. 3.48 from which the connection diagram easily follows. Obviously it is the 0°-connection. Reversal of connections on the star side gives us the 180°-connection.\nPhase transformation = x : 1\nThe Three Phase Transformer Connections is indicated by the phasor diagram of Fig. 3.49.\nVarious Three Phase Transformer Connections with the same phase shift are grouped together. Thus there are Group I (0°), Group II (180°), Group III (30°) and Group IV (— 30°).', 'Methods Of Neutral Grounding (Neutral Earthing)\nNeutral grounding also called as neutral earthing is a technique used to protect the power system from abnormal fault current and hence the stability of the power system won’t get affected. The different methods of Neutral Grounding (Neutral Earthing) techniques are discussed below.\nIn Solid Grounding, the neutral point is directly grounded to earth by a metallic connection or a wire which is having negligible resistance or reactance. During abnormal condition, the fault current flows through the neutral which is linked to the ground. The healthy phases won’t get affected by fault current.\nThe following figure shows the Solid Earthing.\nLet R, Y, and B be the three phases. Consider a fault has occurred on the phase B. In Solid Grounding Technique the fault current flows through the neutral which is linked to the ground. The Healthy phases won’t get affected by the fault current.\nDisadvantages of Solid Grounding:\n1. The high fault current can make the system unstable.\n2. The fault current can interfere with the neighboring systems.\n3. The circuit breakers are difficult to high fault currents.\nThe highspeed circuit breakers can be used to overcome the drawbacks.\nThis method is only suitable for voltages below 33KV.\nIn Resistance Earthing, the neutral point is not directly grounded, instead, it was done by using a current limiting resistor. During abnormal condition, the fault current flows through the neutral through the current limiting resistor. The healthy phases remain healthy and don’t get affected by fault current.\nThe following figure shows the Resistance Earthing.\nLet R, Y, and B be the three phases. Consider a fault has occurred on the phase B. In Resistance Grounding, the fault current flows the neutral via a current limiting resistor. The healthy phases won’t get affected by the fault current.\nAdvantages of Resistance Earthing:\n1. The neighboring system interference can be minimized.\n2. The arcing ground hazards are minimized.\n3. The system stability can be improved.\nThis method is suitable for the systems with voltages in the range between 2.2KV and 33KV.\nIn Reactance Earthing, the neutral point is grounded through a reactance. During abnormal condition, the fault current flows through the reactance which is connected between neutral and earth.\nThe Circuit representation of Reactance Earthing is shown in the figure.\nLet R, Y, and B be the three phases. Consider a fault has occurred on the Phase B. The Fault current will flow through the neutral Via Reactance. The healthy phases won’t get affected by the fault current.\nDrawbacks of Reactance Earthing:\nThe increase in reactance will increase the transient. This method is only used in case of satisfactory purpose and Less budget.\nArc Suppression Coil Grounding:\nThis system is also referred to as Resonant Grounding. This system consists of a Peterson coil or arc suppression coil or ground fault neutralizer whose function is to self-extinguish the arcing earth fault and in the situation of sustained faults, it should reduce the earth current to a low value so that the system can supply power with one line earthed.\nThe system works on the principle that when inductance and capacitance are connected in a parallel configuration, resonance takes place between them and because of resonance characteristics, the fault current can be reduced or it can be neutralized.\nLet R, Y, and B be the three phases. The figure shows that the fault has occurred on the phase B. The coil is tapped to select reactance according to the length of the transmission line.\nThe following expression is used to evaluate the reactance of the coil L = 1/ (3*ꙍ* ꙍ *C)\nThe circuit breaker will close and open automatically during fault current using the trip circuit.\nThis method of grounding technique is used in the high-end transmission line. The main aim of this grounding technique is to protect the power system from fault current which occurs due to lightning.\nVoltage Transformer Earthing:\nIn this method of earthing technique, a single-phase voltage transformer is connected to the neutral point. The system now acts as an insulated neutral system. The Voltage transformer provides a very high reactance earthing. A surge diverter is used between earth and neutral to prevent the voltage rise.\nConsider a fault has occurred on the phase B. The fault current passes through the Single-Phase Transformer. A surge divider is also provided to prevent the rise of voltage.\nThe overvoltage which arises due to the arcing ground is eliminated.\nIn case if transformers or generators is delta connected or if there is no possibility for a neutral point, the neutral point can be created with the star connected earthing transformer. Those transformers don’t have secondary and each phase of primary has two equal parts. There are three limbs with each limb has two windings.\nThis method is suitable for the operating voltages between 2.2KV to 3.3KV. In case there is no availability of Earthing Transformer, a Star-Delta Transformer can be used.']	['<urn:uuid:c9bc6564-254a-4ddc-a802-506c84dceb3f>', '<urn:uuid:d84f7e30-2d05-4620-aeca-309222c2e1f8>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	12	54	2065
34	Can a belt or brace fix my hernia?	Wearing a truss or binder may temporarily alleviate symptoms but will not cure the hernia. Only surgery can correct the defect in the belly wall.	"['A hernia is an opening or weakness in the abdominal wall. The abdominal wall is made up of muscle layers and if these layers weaken the abdominal contents and their lining can protrude through the wall causing a bulge. This bulge is made up of the abdominal lining (peritoneum), tissue, or organ membrane that normally holds an organ in place. Hernias occur more frequently in certain parts of the body such as the abdominal wall, groin, upper thigh (femoral), and belly button region. They can also occur in any place where you have had an incision from previous surgery.\nHow do I get hernia?\nHernias can be present at birth or occur over time due to stress and strain on the abdominal wall. Most hernias become apparent later in life because it takes time for the hernial sac to enlarge enough for tissue to fall into it.\nTypes of Hernia\nThere are different types of hernias based on their location. The most common types are listed below.\nInguinal hernia - These are the most common type of hernias and there are two main types of Inguinal Hernias. They are called Direct and Indirect hernias. These hernias can appear as a bulge in the groin or protrude into the top of the scrotum depending on the exact type and size of hernia that is present.\nA Direct Inguinal hernia is a protrusion of abdominal contents and it\'s lining (peritoneum) through the lower abdominal wall.\nAn Indirect Inguinal hernia is a protrusion of abdominal contents and it\'s lining (peritoneum) through the inguinal canal. The Inguinal canal is a series of small openings like a passage way, through the layers of the abdominal wall in the groin, which the blood supply and vas deferens for the testicles in the male travel. In the female, the round ligament of the uterus is the only structure that travels through the inguinal canal. The inguinal canal is recognized as one of the several weak points in the abdominal wall where a hernia could develop. Inguinal hernias are more common in men than women.\nFemoral hernia - This type of groin hernia can appear as a bulge in the upper thigh. A femoral hernia is a loop of intestine, or another part of the abdominal contents, that has been forced out of the abdomen through a channel called the ""femoral canal"" - a tube-shaped passage at the top and front of the thigh. This type of hernia tends to occur in older people and is more common in women than in men.\nIncisional hernia - Is a Hernia that has formed through an incision (scar) from previous abdominal surgery that a patient has undergone.\nUmbilical hernia - Umbilical hernia is a small bulge around the umbilicus (belly button). An umbilical hernia in an infant is caused by the incomplete closure of the muscles around the umbilicus.\nHiatus hernia - Normally, the stomach is completely below the diaphragm. A hiatus hernia is when part of the stomach slides through the diaphragm, the muscular sheet that separates the lungs and chest from the abdomen.\nRisk Factors for Hernias in general include:\nFamily history of hernias\nOverweight or Obesity\nUndescended testes in an infant male\nAny condition that increases the abdominal pressure is a potential risk factor for abdominal hernias. Some examples include: chronic coughing, chronic constipation, enlarged prostate causing straining with urination, and carrying or pushing heavy loads at work or sport for instance.\nWhy should hernias be repaired?\nOnce a hernia has developed it will tend to enlarge and cause discomfort. If a loop of bowel gets caught in the hernia it may become obstructed or its blood supply may be cut off. This could then become a life-threatening situation. Since hernias can be repaired effectively and with minimal risk most surgeons therefore recommend that hernias be repaired when diagnosed unless there are other serious medical problems.\nWhat are my options?\nWearing a truss or binder may temporarily alleviate symptoms but will not cure the hernia. Only surgery corrects the defect in the belly wall.\nTraditional repair techniques involve pulling together muscles and ligaments for reinforcement. Since muscles are soft and movable, while ligaments remain rigid and stationary, these structures can separate over time causing hernia recurrence.\nIn fact, approximately 10% of hernias do recur.\nHow are hernias repaired?\nThe standard method of hernia repair involves making an incision in the abdominal wall. Normal healthy tissues are cut until the area of weakness is found. This area, the hernia, is then repaired with sutures (stitches). Usually a prosthetic material such as nylon is used to strengthen the area of weakness. (A nylon mesh patch or plug). Finally the skin and other healthy tissues that were cut at the beginning are stitched back together to complete the repair.\nHow does the laparoscopic method differ?\nWith the laparoscopic repair the defect in the abdominal wall is repaired from the inside of the abdominal cavity. This method is usually only used for groin hernias. Instead of closing or patching the repair from the outside the patch is secured in place from the inside. This eliminates the necessity of cutting the skin and normal tissues of the groin to get down to and repair the hernia.\nFor all appointments and enquiries\nWe are open Monday to Friday (except Holidays) between 0900 to 1700 Hours']"	['<urn:uuid:f175da3f-4217-498c-a4a3-c253450f5b21>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	8	25	892
35	How does copyright protection differ from trademark protection in terms of duration and automatic rights, and what specific elements of a brand can be protected under each?	Copyright protection is automatic upon creation and lasts for 70 years after the creator's death, after which the work enters the public domain. It specifically protects creative content and the way ideas are expressed, rather than the ideas themselves. In contrast, trademarks protect brand elements including logos, names, wording, shapes, domain names, colors, sounds, and aspects of packaging. While you can use the TM symbol immediately, proper legal protection requires registration. A registered trademark lasts for potentially unlimited consecutive ten-year periods as long as the owner meets legal requirements for maintenance and renewal. For logos specifically, they are protected under both systems - copyright protects the artistic elements, while trademark protects their use as brand identifiers.

You can use the symbol on any mark that your company uses without registering it. The most common use of the TM symbol is on a new phrase, logo, word, or design that a company plans to register through the USPTO.\nDo I need to copyright or trademark my logo?\nYes. A logo that includes artistic or design elements, (i.e. not just the name on its own), is legally regarded as being a work of artistic creation and therefore will be protected under copyright law. Copyright protects the logo as an artistic work.\nWhat are the 3 types of trademarks?\nDifferent Types of TrademarksDescriptive Trademarks;Merely Descriptive Trademarks;Generic Trademarks;\nIs it worth getting a trademark?\nEntrepreneurs often ask whether they should incorporate, trademark or patent their inventions when they start their businesses. The default answer is always – no. Entrepreneurs should only incorporate, trademark or patent their inventions when absolutely necessary because doing so is expensive and time consuming.\nCan I sue someone for using my trademark?\nA trademark owner who believes its mark is being infringed may file a civil action (i.e., lawsuit) in either state court or federal court for trademark infringement, depending on the circumstances. However, in most cases, trademark owners choose to sue for infringement in federal court.\nHow much does a trademark cost UK?\nHow much it costsFeeEach additional classStandard application (online)£170£50Right Start application (online)£200 (£100 up front plus £100 if you go ahead with your registration)£50 (£25 up front plus £25 if you go ahead with your registration)\nHow long does a trademark name last?\nHow long does a trademark registration last? A trademark registration may remain in force for potentially unlimited consecutive ten-year periods as long as the owner meets the legal requirements for post-registration maintenance and renewal and timely files all necessary documents.\nWhat protection does a trademark provide?\nA trade mark is a way of identifying a unique product or service. It’s a form of brand protection which distinguishes between your products or services and those belonging to your competitors. A trade mark is not just ‘a logo’.\nWhat words can you not trademark?\nWords that don’t serve to identify the source of a product can’t be trademarked. Generic words, offensive words, and certain proper names can’t be trademarked. Words that are already trademarked for goods within the same industry can’t be trademarked.\nCan I trademark a name already in use but not trademarked?\nA registered trademark offers legal protection to unique logos and designs affixed to a tangible object. For this reason, you can’t file to register a trademark that someone else is already using if they used the trademark first.\nIs a trademark necessary?\nIt is A Company’s Greatest Asset Thus, it is important to use a trademark for marketing strategies to aid the enhancement of brand recognition and to draw in more consumers. Once a startup has attained positive repute for its product or service, consumers will associate its trademark with how the business is running.\nCan I trademark a name already in use but not trademarked UK?\nreplied 3 years ago. You would have a hard time keeping the mark at that point – because you are using a name which belongs to someone else. … So yes, in the short term you can trademark a name, but it may well be open to challenge.\nIs Apple a trademark?\nThe Apple trademark is a good example: While an apple cannot be copyrighted, its artistic representation can be—its use as a symbol for an electronics and software company is protected as a trademark.\nHow long does a trademark take UK?\napproximately three to five monthsThe time it takes to register a trademark varies depending upon whether objections are raised. A straightforward trade mark application takes approximately three to five months to register in the UK. An uncomplicated European Union Trademark application typically takes between six and nine months.\nCan you trademark a word UK?\nYou can register your trade mark to protect your brand, for example the name of your product or service. When you register your trade mark, you’ll be able to: take legal action against anyone who uses your brand without your permission, including counterfeiters.\nWhat a trademark is and why it might be important to protect it?\nWith a trademark, you retain exclusive rights to mark your products, with no one else being allowed to use your symbol, name, or slogan in that particular region. Trademarks are also used as a way of protecting consumers.', 'So, what is intellectual property?\nUnlike material goods, intellectual property (IP) cannot be touched – it covers things like images, writing, branding, films, software and inventions. Basically, if it’s something you’ve created, it *should* be your intellectual property.\nYou’re probably familiar with the terms ‘trade mark’, ‘copyright’ and ‘patent’ but may not know what the difference is. At what point do you get to use those little symbols (©,®, TM) you see everywhere? What do you do if someone steals your IP? Don’t know? Don’t worry! Thankfully, Emma Richards from the Intellectual Property Office popped by Propeller Networking last week to fill us in on all the details.\nCopyright – for creative content\nCopyright is automatic: once you create something it is yours. However, it’s not official. Although people shouldn’t steal your content, they still might, and you can’t use the copyright mark © without registering. If somebody plagiarises you (uses your content without permission) you must be able to prove that it was yours in the first place. Once you’ve done that, you’ll be able to register your content.\nEven once registered, copyright doesn’t protect the idea of the work, only the way you express the idea. Copyright gives you the exclusive rights to allow people to use your work. So if you are working with other companies, it’s important to have the right documentation. Make sure you have a contract saying that you retain the copyright for your content and if giving content to someone else, state how they can use it, where, and for how long.\nCopyright will remain yours until 70 years after your death, after which it becomes public domain, and anyone can use it. For films, copyright runs out 70 years after the death of the last creative team (although the production company may have rights).\nTrade marks – protecting brands\nTrade marks protect brands, including its logo, name, wording, shape, domain name, colour, sound or aspects of packaging. Obviously, there are limits, but if the brand ‘Cora Coka’ was in the same font and colours as ‘Coca Cola’, then there’d certainly be questions. You can use the TM trademark symbol straight away without registering, but you can only use the ® symbol for registered trademarks. It’s completely free to check the trademark registry! Once you’ve checked the validity of your own trademark it costs £170 for national registration (10 years), and £850 for European registration.\nPatents – protecting inventions\nPatents protect inventions and allows you to decide who makes, uses, sells or imports your invention. Your invention won’t be kept a secret – you’ll still have to share how you created your invention – but people won’t be able to use it until your patent expires. A UK patent gives you protection for 20 years as long as renewal fees are paid annually. The IPO does not judge whether your product or method will be a success. A patent protects innovations such as machines, industrial processes, production methods, electrical appliances, biological products and processes, and computer hardware.\nYou don’t have to register your designs, but they are much harder to protect without proper registration. Registering product design can be important. If you’ve ever been to a bargain supermarket you will have seen imitation brands. They look almost identical to established products, which is a clever ploy to make you trust a brand. Generally, in the UK, there aren’t many safety risks as everything is regulated, but this type of design imitation can still infer a quality that the product simply does not have. Due to the halo effect, the quality of an imitation product can affect your own product’s reputation, so it deserves some caution. In order to be registered, designs cannot simply be shaped in such a way so as to serve a technical function.\nValuing your Intellectual Property\nIntellectual property should be a part of your business plan. Quality products or services give you a competitive edge when marketing and if they are unique, your entire reputation may rest on keeping them so.\nIdentify which products or services are essential for your business. Consider the market advantage they give you and whether your business will still be valuable if someone has an almost identical offering. A good way of assigning value to these products or services is to estimate how much it would cost to create these from scratch or how much a competitor would be willing to pay for them.\nLicensing Intellectual Property\nSince you own your own intellectual property, it’s up to you how people use it. For businesses that buy usage of your intellectual property it makes a lot of sense: they can reduce the cost of R&D, save time in development, gain competitive advantage and access expertise they may not possess.\nRevenue Generation – You can use the product yourself to make money, but you can also license it to someone else at the same time. This way, you profit from their efforts too.\nLicensing – Generic licensing means that you give the right to manufacture and sell products to someone else. You receive profit without the risk of manufacturing, promoting or selling them yourself. The licensee gets to use the product without paying to develop it themselves.\nIncreasing market penetration – You can give other businesses permission to use your IP in other territories, expanding your reach.\nFranchising – Companies like Macdonald’s are franchises. They are owned by one company (Macdonald’s), but each individual restaurant is owned by someone different. They license the right to be Macdonald’s, provide their products and services, for a portion of the profits. The franchisee typically pays royalties to the umbrella company in return for a trade mark license.\nSo, that’s IP in a nutshell. Hopefully you’ve got a better idea of whether you need to register your own intellectual property and a basic guide of what kind of cover you need. There’s plenty more information on the IPO’s website, but our mentors can also help you get everything sorted.']	['<urn:uuid:30d8ee72-6923-443f-b9a1-d58d7cf3b137>', '<urn:uuid:17ab2e3c-a807-4b7c-a6e7-664a2a1ea90c>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	27	116	2028
36	Do student stories and negotiation training both use real examples?	Yes, both use real examples - the student perspective stories are written about actual everyday objects like pencils, chairs and phones, while the negotiation training includes case examples and a group exercise based on a complex real multi-sector issue.	"['Story Writing from an Object\'s Perspective\n- Preview |\n- Standards |\n- Resources & Preparation |\n- Instructional Plan |\n- Related Resources |\nStudents explore how to write from an object\'s perspective. The teacher uses a picture book, Dear Mrs. La Rue, to introduce the idea of writing from a non-human\'s perspective. A mini-lesson follows in which students work together to define the word ""perspective."" Students collaboratively write and share a short example of writing from a pencil sharpener\'s perspective. Students ultimately write their own stories from an object\'s perspective after reading the model story. This lesson takes multiple days as students prewrite, draft, revise, edit, and publish their stories.\n- Read aloud book Dear Mrs. La Rue\n- Perspective Story Pre-Writing\n- Perspective Story Model\nFrom Theory to Practice\nIn this lesson, students learn to write from a perspective far from their own. Instead of writing about themselves, other humans, or even animals, students write from an object’s perspective. This type of writing process is developmentally challenging because, as Deborah Dean explains, “writing about a topic from different perspectives can help writers explore the topic and learn more about what they know and what they still need to learn.” By writing from a perspective other than their own, students can challenge their insights and assumptions by investigating the world from an unfamiliar vantage point.\nCommon Core Standards\nThis resource has been aligned to the Common Core State Standards for states in which they have been adopted. If a state does not appear in the drop-down, CCSS alignments are forthcoming.\nThis lesson has been aligned to standards in the following states. If a state does not appear in the drop-down, standard alignments are not currently available for that state.\nNCTE/IRA National Standards for the English Language Arts\n- 1. Students read a wide range of print and nonprint texts to build an understanding of texts, of themselves, and of the cultures of the United States and the world; to acquire new information; to respond to the needs and demands of society and the workplace; and for personal fulfillment. Among these texts are fiction and nonfiction, classic and contemporary works.\n- 2. Students read a wide range of literature from many periods in many genres to build an understanding of the many dimensions (e.g., philosophical, ethical, aesthetic) of human experience.\n- 3. Students apply a wide range of strategies to comprehend, interpret, evaluate, and appreciate texts. They draw on their prior experience, their interactions with other readers and writers, their knowledge of word meaning and of other texts, their word identification strategies, and their understanding of textual features (e.g., sound-letter correspondence, sentence structure, context, graphics).\n- 4. Students adjust their use of spoken, written, and visual language (e.g., conventions, style, vocabulary) to communicate effectively with a variety of audiences and for different purposes.\n- 5. Students employ a wide range of strategies as they write and use different writing process elements appropriately to communicate with different audiences for a variety of purposes.\n- 6. Students apply knowledge of language structure, language conventions (e.g., spelling and punctuation), media techniques, figurative language, and genre to create, critique, and discuss print and nonprint texts.\n- 12. Students use spoken, written, and visual language to accomplish their own purposes (e.g., for learning, enjoyment, persuasion, and the exchange of information).\nMaterials and Technology\n- Dear Mrs. La Rue by Mark Teague\n- Screen/overhead to display materials\n- Internet access\n- Inanimate objects such as shoe, pencil, chair, notebook, cell phone, water bottle\n- Whiteboard/chalkboard and markers/chalk\n- Dear Mrs. La Rue Read Aloud Procedures\n- Perspective Definition and Examples\n- Exit Slips\n- Perspective Match-Up Cards\n- Perspective Group Practice Writing Prompt\n- Perspective Story Model\n- Perspective Story Pre-Writing\n- Perspective Story Pre-Writing Model\n- Editing and Revising Checklist\n- Perspective Writing Rubric\nCandlewick Press offers an excerpt from the story The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, a story from a china rabbit’s point of view. Provides excellent modeling of perspective writing.\n- Familiarize yourself with the book Dear Mrs. La Rue.\n- Print out the following hand-outs for student use: Perspective Definition and Examples, Exit Slips, Perspective Match-Up Cards, Perspective Group Practice Writing Prompt, Perspective Story Model, Perspective Story Pre-Writing, Editing and Revising Checklist, and Perspective Writing Rubric.\n- Sort students into pairs.\n- Gather inanimate objects used by students regularly such as a pencil, chair, shoe, cell phone, water bottle, umbrella.\n- explore perspective by asking questions and reflecting on the text during the reading of a picture book.\n- explore perspective by practicing with definitions and examples.\n- design a one page story from the perspective of an inanimate object using the complete writing process.\n- Gather students together and read Dear Mrs. La Rue using the following ideas and questions as guidelines:\n- Introduction: Have you ever wondered what pets think about? Introduce basic plot and ask students to pay attention to Ike’s interpretation of story events compared to his owner’s.\n- Middle of Story: Discuss the author’s use of black/white pages compared to colored pages. What do each represent?\n- End of Story: What did you notice about Mrs. La Rue’s opinions during the story compared to Ike’s? Why did this happen?\n- Send students back to their seats and pass out Perspective Definition and Examples printout. Introduce this task to students by explaining that Dear Mrs. La Rue dealt with looking at life from the perspective of a dog. Similarly, the two pictures on the page show how perspective can impact someone’s beliefs. Tell students to use Dear Mrs. La Rue and the two pictures on the printout to write their own definition of perspective. Emphasize that this is just practice- it is okay if they are not fully correct!\n- After students have studied the example and created their own definitions, give them one minute to share their definitions with two classmates.\n- Once students have each shared their definitions, hold a brief class discussion to agree upon the definition. Students will write that definition on their printouts, and the teacher will write the definition on the board. (Possible definition: a person’s opinions or feelings based on how he/she views a situation)\n- Now that a definition has been agreed upon, challenge students to brainstorm three examples of instances in which people might hold different perspectives. Give them two minutes to do this, then have them share their examples.\n- End this session by passing out an exit slip of your choice from the Exit Slips printout. Students fill out exit slips and turn in before leaving. Read these before the next session to gain insight into students’ understanding of lesson.\n- Review the idea of perspective with students by mixing up the Perspective Match-Up Cards and handing one to each student. Explain to students that there are two types of cards: One has a picture and a question, and one has a phrase. Students who receive a picture/question must find the phrase that matches, and students who receive a phrase must find the picture/question that matches. Give students a few minutes to circulate around the room and find their matches. Instruct students to buddy up with their partners. Once they have found their partners, move around the room with their partners to find the other set of partners that have the same picture. Once all four students have found each other, they should sit down and read each other’s cards.\n- Now that students are seated in groups of four, hold a brief discussion in which students explain how their group’s pictures, questions, and phrases show different perspectives. Refer to the definition of perspective agreed upon in the previous lesson. (Ex: a person’s opinions or feelings based on how he/she views a situation)\n- Ask students to return to their seats. Explain to students that they will now be working with a partner to create a short one-paragraph story that shows the perspective of the classroom’s pencil sharpener.\n- Place students into pre-determined pairs and ask students to move to sit with partners.\n- Pass out or display Perspective Group Practice Writing Prompt. Read the prompt with students and re-emphasize class expectations (work quietly with partner, write one paragraph only, show clearly the pencil sharpener’s feelings and opinions about being a class sharpener, work efficiently).\n- Allow students 15 minutes to craft their written paragraph. While students work, circulate between groups and offer support, suggestions, and compliments.\n- Let three student groups volunteer to share their writing. After each student reads, allow the class to make positive comments. Teacher gives positive reinforcement and makes suggestions when possible.\n- Explain to students that in the next lesson they will choose an inanimate object to write “A Day in the Life of a ________” story from the object’s perspective.\n- Begin this session by displaying inanimate objects that students use regularly: shoe, chair, pencil, water bottle, phone, notebook\n- Ask students to stand up if they use at least two of the displayed items at least once a day. Have students sit back down.\n- Introduce task to students: They will write “A Day in the Life of a ________”: a story from the object’s perspective. Discuss how the objects displayed are used every day and thus can become excellent main characters in a story. Explain that students will pick one of the objects displayed to use as character in story. If students have alternative object they’d like to use, they must have teacher approve the idea.\n- Display/project the Perspective Story Model and read aloud as students follow along.\n- Discuss with the class how this story depicts the laptop’s daily life with its owner. Ask students to raise their hands to share the strengths of the story. Make a list of these strengths on the board (i.e. interesting vocabulary, chronological order, specific descriptions), along with suggestions for improvement.\n- Explain to students that they will begin their prewriting for their own stories at the end of class, but first they will create a practice pre-writing with the entire class. Pass out Perspective Story Pre-Writing printout to each student. Review this printout with students and emphasize expectations.\n- Using the Perspective Story Pre-Writing Model as a teacher guideline, use Shared Writing to work with the students to complete a practice version of the Perspective Story Pre-Writing. Do this by agreeing on a class topic such as “A Day in the Life of a Mailbox”. Complete the process with students by allowing them to share ideas and by providing feedback and structure that will help students identify proper pre-writing procedures.\n- Give students the rest of the session to complete their personal pre-writing. Circulate as students work to provide support.\n- Either collect prewriting organizers or instruct students to store them securely.\n- Explain expectations to students: students will receive, read, and practice with the Perspective Writing Rubric, which will be used for grading the stories.\n- Pass out Perspective Writing Rubric to each student. Read and discuss with students. Emphasize expectations and reiterate that this will be used to assess their stories.\n- Display Perspective Story Model from session three and explain to students that they will work as a class to assess this story using the rubric.\n- Using student participation and teacher guidance, assess the model story in each rubric category. Students who disagree on a grade should come to a shared decision.\n- Explain to students that they should staple this rubric to the bottom of their stories when handing stories in to teacher.\n- Either collect rubrics or instruct students to keep themfor the next session.\n- Explain expectations to students: they will use Perspective Story Pre-Writing and Perspective Writing Rubric guidelines to create their rough drafts.\n- Keep the Perspective Story Model displayed for students as they write\n- Provide students with paper or computers for writing. As students work quietly, circulate through the classroom and provide support to each student.\n- When the working period is over, collect rough drafts/rubrics or instruct students to keep them securely. Explain to students that tomorrow they will edit and revise their work with a partner.\n- Pass out Editing and Revising Checklist to each student.\n- Read this checklist with students and review each expectation. Explain that students will work in previously assigned pairs to peer-edit using the Editing and Revising Checklist.\n- Give students the rest of the period to work with their partners using whisper-voices. As students work quietly, circulate through the classroom and provide support to each student.\n- When the working period is over, collect rough drafts/rubrics or instruct students to keep them securely. Explain to students that tomorrow that will begin writing/typing their final copies.\n- If students are typing final copies, provide students with computers and provide any necessary computer instructions before students begin working.\n- If students are handwriting final copy, provide students with paper if needed and provide any desired instructions for final copy format.\n- As students work quietly, circulate through the classroom and provide support to each student.\n- Explain to students that for homework they must bring in their chosen object for tomorrow’s presentations (i.e: if a student used a shoe as his object, that student must bring that type of shoe to display when presenting). Students who may have difficulties bringing in the necessary object should work with the teacher to find a solution (the teacher or another student could provide the needed object).\n- Split the class into four groups of 6-8 students.\n- Explain expectations to students: They will be orally presenting their stories in their groups, using the objects they brought from home as their props. Each group will need to keep a list of the story titles on a piece of paper, along with a brief summary of each story.\n- Students spend the rest of the period meeting with their groups, listening to each other’s stories, responding constructively, and recording titles and summaries.\n- At the end of class, students hand in stories to be assessed. The teacher can post these stories on a bulletin board with the title “A Day in the Life of...”\n- Students can take pictures of object and create a PowerPoint or video presentation using the pictures. Students can record their voice narrating the story as the pictures are shown.\n- Students can exchange stories and write an alternative ending or sequel to each other’s stories.\n- Students can use ReadWriteThink Book Cover Creator to design a story cover.\n- Students can use the idea of perspective writing in an applicable social studies/history unit by writing two stories about the same historical event but from the perspectives of two enemies or different historical figures.\nStudent Assessment / Reflections\n- Use Exit Slips to evaluate student understanding and comprehension of lesson.\nConference with students during the writing process to ask them questions and evaluate their progress, strengths, areas of concentration, and use of the writing process.\nUse the Perspective Writing Rubric to assess stories.\nAdd new comment', 'Negotiating, Collaboration and Partnering\nThe relevance of collaborative versus competitive actions is investigated, together with a review of current research and practice regarding organisations in networks and ecosystems and the barriers which make collaborative actions difficult. The role and importance of integrative approaches to finding agreement is explored in depth, alongside best practice approaches and processes to developing and managing cross-sector and multi-stakeholder arrangements. The content is communicated through a combination of interactive lectures and discussion of group based case examples and case examples, and developed through a group-based exercise embedded into the module, which is structured as a four-party negotiation of a complex multi-sector issue.\nThere is no national basis to this module as it is completely culturally independent. The embedded group exercise, running throughout the module, explores cross-cultural aspects to reaching agreement.\nYou will have the option of developing your individual assignment with an external organisation of your choice. A guest speaker will develop the module themes referencing a current business context.\nThis is a very practical module with extensive reference to academic research on the subjects of collaboration, cooperation, negotiation and partnership process and practice. You will have the opportunity to gain both practical experience and an understanding of negotiating, resolving tensions or conflicts, identifying mutually beneficial outcomes and overcoming biases held by individuals or organisations that might impede future value creation.\nThe entire content is related to the main theme of sustainability, and a significant part of the module is concerned with moving beyond economic value towards social, environmental and other forms of value that are recognised as drivers of sustainable and responsible management practice.\nAll of the resources for this module are available on the ELE (Exeter Learning Environment).\nFull module specification\n|Module title:||Negotiating, Collaboration and Partnering|\n|Duration of module:||\nDuration (weeks) - term 2: |\n4 day module (+ 8 weeks study)\nCompetition brings a host of benefits through the efficient allocation (and constant reallocation) of resources towards the achievement of productive outcomes. A growing body of evidence however suggests that competition works best alongside active and considered cooperation, and that behaviours based on simplistic judgements of winning or losing will very often lead to lost opportunities, and to sub-optimal outcomes.\nThis module aims to introduce you to the challenges and benefits of negotiating, collaboration and partnering to achieve strategic objectives in a sustainable manner. Developing and implementing good strategy is difficult enough in simple environments: it is even tougher in a world where organisations are interconnected through multiple alliances and partnerships, by ever more closely aligned value networks, and by their common use of limited resources. Collaboration can be a strategic objective in itself, for accessing new markets, skills, experience, resources and capabilities: while responses to systemic social, environmental or developmental challenges might require partnership across organisations in more than one of the business, civil society and public sectors. Whatever the reason, the imperative to collaborate is increasingly significant: yet there is much evidence that many partnerships and collaborative initiatives fail. This raises a challenge for leaders, who must demonstrate competence in identifying where cooperative approaches might be relevant in meeting their strategic aims, while showing that they can make them work successfully.\nILO: Module-specific skills\n- 1. Understand the basic principles of negotiating, collaboration and partnering as relevant in different strategic contexts.\n- 2. Understand key areas of risk and opportunity associated with inter-organisational networks and alliances, how different roles and relationship effectiveness impact on their success, and approaches by which these can be surfaced and managed.\n- 3. Understand and recognise the relevance of different perspectives of value in planning cooperative activities.\n- 4. Recognise sources and types of potential conflict, and describe approaches by which they can be managed or resolved.\nILO: Discipline-specific skills\n- 5.

37	arctic wildlife oil drilling impact climate change	The Arctic region faces multiple interconnected challenges. The Alaska pipeline had to be designed to protect caribou migration while being earthquake-resistant. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) hosts important wildlife populations while also containing oil resources. Additionally, Arctic coasts are becoming increasingly vulnerable due to climate change, with projected increases in sea-ice-free conditions making shores more susceptible to storm surge and wave energy. This is particularly concerning during autumn when large storms are more common. Rising air and sea water temperatures may also accelerate erosion of ice-rich coastal permafrost bluffs along Alaska's Arctic coast. These changes threaten both wildlife habitats and existing infrastructure.

Here are a few pictures from ANWR, and some shots showing oil wells, coal mines, and the occurrence of oil, gas, and coal in the U.S. You might want to know that, with heating, plants turn into peat and then into lignite and into bituminous or into anthracite, and that western PA has bituminous and eastern PA has anthracite, and that making oil too hot produces natural gas so western PA has oil, but eastern PA doesn’t.\nThe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (above) and its caribou (right).\nSource.

The map shows that oil and gas are produced in only certain areas, with much of the country not having any resource, and that oil companies have drilled many, many holes that did not produce commercially useful quantities of oil or gas.\n(left) Historical photo of the world’s first oil well, Drake Well Museum, Titusville, PA.

Lignite is especially common in the west and south, bituminous in the west and Appalachians, and a little anthracite in the parts of the Appalachians that were heated most strongly during mountain building, in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Virginia, and also Arkansas and Oklahoma.\nLeft: coal-fired Navajo power plant near Page, AZ.

In much of the world, competition for resources between large animals and humans is greatly endangering the animals; however, big animals in the U.S. and Canada, such as this bighorn sheep in the Canadian Rockies, are actually doing quite well. This slide show is mostly for fun, but the point--that humans endanger the biodiversity from which we benefit--is important. All photos by R., C., J. or K.

Changes are clearly human-caused.\nInstrumental record (from thermometers) of global average temperature from 1860-2000. Corrections have been made for the heating effect of cities, so this shows real warming. Instrumental record (red) and proxy-data record (tree-rings, etc., blue with uncertainty in gray) of global average temperature over last 1000 years. Details of proxy interpretation are still debated, but other approaches give similar results.\nwww.ipcc.ch UN IPCC Each panel shows measured global-average temperature 1860-2000 (red line) and a model reconstruction with uncertainty (gray band). Natural causes (more sun, fewer volcanoes) started warming (upper left) but switched to cooling; human causes (greenhouse gases, plus acid rain blocking sun) cooled in 1950s, now warming strongly (upper right and bottom).\nHow much more fossil fuel is there? We’re sure of reserves; we think we have resources, and unconventional reserves. Resources include oil shale, tar sands and such. Most of the fossil fuels have not been burned yet, but we’re burning them much faster now than we have in the past.\nPast changes in CO\n2 levels are small compared to the change that is coming. CO 2 is still likely to be going up in 2100, and the world doesn’t end then (you may live past 2100…).\nPast temperature change is small compared to the expected change for all scenarios and climate models tested. Change so far has been small enough that only those really paying attention have noticed; future change is expected to be much greater. All projections show temperatures rising beyond the year 2100, which is not the end of time.\nProjected warming in the greenhouse future, compared to changes over the last millennium. Again, all the projection curves are rising as they cross the year 2100, and the world does not end in 2100.\nWarming of mean-annual temperature by the year 2100, in degrees Celsius. (To get Fahrenheit, multiply by 1.8; the largest warmings in the Arctic are almost 10oC or 18oF.) Scenario A2 is one in which the economy does pretty well, and we don’t try very hard to clean up, giving warming toward the upper end of the scenarios tested by the UN IPCC.\nExperts were asked how much warming would worry them about various things. White means few were worried, and red means most were worried. Even a little warming endangers rare species (category I)--they need to move as climate changes, but humans in the way may block migration. Much warming is required before most experts are worried about ice-sheet or thermohaline-circulation collapse (category V), but beyond 2100, such warming becomes increasingly likely unless actions are taken.

Along the Arctic coast of Alaska, coastal erosion is widespread and threatens communities, defense and energy-related infrastructure, and coastal habitat. As coastal populations continue to expand and infrastructure and habitat are increasingly threatened by erosion, there is increased demand for accurate information regarding past and present trends and rates of shoreline movement.\nShoreline change was evaluated by comparing three to four historical shoreline positions derived from 1950s-era topographic surveys and black and white aerial photography, 1980s-era color-infrared Alaska High-Altitude Aerial Photography, 2003 natural color aerial photography, and 2010s-era natural color aerial photography. Long-term (1950s–2010s) and short-term (1980s–2010s) shoreline change rates were calculated using linear-regression and end-point methods, respectively, at transects spaced approximately every 50 meters along both the mainland and barrier island coasts.\nShoreline change rates calculated on more than 24,000 individual transects indicate that between 1948 and 2016 the northern coast of Alaska between Icy Cape and Cape Prince of Wales was slightly erosional, with 68 percent of the total transects showing shoreline retreat over the long term and 63 percent over the short term. However, only 9 percent of the total transects showed shoreline retreat greater than 1 meter per year (m/yr) over the long and short term, respectively. Mean rates of shoreline change of −0.2±0.1 and −0.2±0.3 m/yr, were calculated for the long and short term, respectively. Many rates measured were near the limit of our shoreline change uncertainty estimates. Erosion and accretion rates on individual transects ranged from −8.3 to +9.6 m/yr over the long term and −16.0 to +20.0 m/yr over the short-term analysis periods. The highest rates of erosion and accretion were associated with the formation and migration of inlets along barrier island coasts. The highest erosional rates of change were measured in the southern part of the study area between Sullivan Lake and Cape Prince of Wales. The highest accretional rates of change were measured in the northern part of the study area on the open-ocean coast of barrier islands fronting Kasegaluk Lagoon.\nOpen-ocean exposed shorelines compose 85 percent of all transects and 70 percent were erosional over the long term. Sheltered mainland-lagoon shorelines compose 15 percent of all transects in the study area and 58 percent were erosional over the long term. Although mean shoreline change rates were quite low along all coasts, exposed shorelines retreated at twice the rate (−0.2±0.1 m/yr) of sheltered shorelines (−0.1±0.1 m/yr). Barrier shoreline transects (includes barrier islands, spits, and beaches) compose 49 percent of the total transects and 56 percent of all exposed shoreline transects. Mean shoreline change rates on exposed barrier shorelines were only slightly greater than exposed mainland shorelines (−0.3±0.1 and −0.2±0.1 m/yr, respectively). Mean shoreline change rates on sheltered barrier shorelines were similar to sheltered mainland shorelines (−0.1±0.3 m/yr).\nIn contrast to the majority of the Nation’s shorelines, for all but three months of the year (July–September), the north coast of Alaska has historically been protected by landfast sea ice from processes such as waves, winds, and currents that typically drive coastal change on beaches in more temperate regions of the world. Projected and observed increases in periods of sea-ice-free conditions, as sea ice melts earlier and forms later in the year, particularly in the autumn, when large storms are more common in the Arctic, suggest that Arctic coasts will be more vulnerable to storm surge and wave energy, potentially resulting in accelerated shoreline erosion and terrestrial habitat loss in the future. Increases in air and sea water temperatures may also increase erosion of the ice-rich, coastal permafrost bluffs present along much of Alaska’s Arctic coast. More frequent shoreline change data collection and analysis in this rapidly changing environment should be considered in order to evaluate shoreline change trends in the future.\nGibbs, A.E., Snyder, A.G., and Richmond, B.M., 2019, National assessment of shoreline change — Historical shoreline change along the north coast of Alaska, Icy Cape to Cape Prince of Wales: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2019–1146, 52 p., https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20191146.\nISSN: 2331-1258 (online)\nTable of Contents\n- Executive Summary\n- Previous National and Northwestern Alaska Shoreline Assessments\n- Methods of Analyzing Shoreline Change\n- Calculation and Interpretation of Shoreline Change Rates\n- Results from Analysis of Historical Shoreline Change\n- Discussion and Additional Considerations\n- References Cited\n|Publication Subtype||USGS Numbered Series|\n|Title||National assessment of shoreline change — Historical shoreline change along the north coast of Alaska, Icy Cape to Cape Prince of Wales|\n|Series title||Open-File Report|\n|Publisher||U.S. Geological Survey|\n|Publisher location||Reston, VA|\n|Contributing office(s)||Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center|\n|Description||Report: vi, 52 p.; Data Release|\n|Online Only (Y/N)||Y|\n|Google Analytic Metrics||Metrics page|']"	['<urn:uuid:70dbf4e6-375e-42d0-846c-d6e76e46cfb7>', '<urn:uuid:0d2b7d97-48fb-4e86-b839-2e1ce7bd9f03>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	7	103	2651

"[""ADDRESS OF HIS HOLINESS BENEDICT XVI\nTO MR FRANCIS MARTIN-XAVIER CAMPBELL\nAMBASSADOR OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN\nAND NORTHERN IRELAND TO THE HOLY SEE*\nFriday 23 December 2005\nI am pleased to welcome you to the Vatican and to accept the Letters accrediting you as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the Holy See. In thanking you for the greetings that you bring from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and her Government, I ask you in return to convey my respectful good wishes and prayers for the peace and prosperity of the realm.\nThe Holy See greatly values its formal links with your country, restored in 1914 and raised to full diplomatic status in 1982. These relations have made possible a significant degree of cooperation in the service of peace and justice, especially in the developing world, where the United Kingdom has played a leading role in international efforts to combat poverty and disease. Through such initiatives as the International Finance Facility, Her Majesty’s Government has taken concrete steps to promote the timely realization of the Millennium Development Goals. Especially in Africa, many have drawn comfort from the aid resolutions taken at July’s Gleneagles summit, when the G8 Group met under the presidency of Great Britain. I pray that this effective solidarity with our suffering brothers and sisters will be maintained and deepened in years to come. In the words of my venerable predecessor, Pope Gregory the Great, “When we attend to the needs of those in want, we give them what is theirs, not ours. More than performing works of mercy, we are paying a debt of justice” (Pastoral Rule, 3:21, quoted in Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, 184). As you have observed, Mr Ambassador, your country is no stranger to the strife caused by the sad divisions within Christianity. The wounds resulting from more than four centuries of separation cannot be healed without determined efforts, perseverance, and above all, prayer. I give thanks to God for the progress that has been made in recent years in the various ecumenical dialogues, and I encourage all those involved in this work never to rest content with partial solutions but to keep firmly in view the goal of full visible unity among Christians which accords with the Lord’s will for his Church. Ecumenism is not simply an internal matter of concern to Christian communities; it is an imperative of charity which expresses God’s love for all humanity and his plan to unite all peoples in Christ (cf. Ut Unum Sint, 99). It offers a “radiant sign of hope and consolation for all mankind” (Letter of Pope Paul VI to Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I, 13 January 1970), and as such has an essential part to play in overcoming divisions between communities and nations.\nIn this regard, I am pleased to note the significant progress that has been made over the last few years towards achieving peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. Local Churches and ecclesial communities have worked hard to overcome historic differences between sections of the population, and among the most visible signs of the growth in mutual trust is the recent decommissioning of weapons by the Irish Republican Army. This would not have been possible without immense diplomatic and political efforts to achieve a just solution to that long-standing conflict, and it brings great credit upon all who were involved.\nSadly, in the wake of the bombings that took place in London last July, your country still has to cope with acts of indiscriminate violence directed against members of the public. I wish to assure you of the continuing support of the Church as you seek solutions to the underlying tensions that give rise to such atrocities. The Catholic population in Great Britain is already marked by a high degree of ethnic diversity and is eager to play its part in furthering reconciliation and harmony between the various racial groups present in your country. I know that Her Majesty’s Government recognizes the importance of inter-religious dialogue, and I welcome the openness that the Government has shown towards involving faith communities in the process of integrating the increasingly disparate elements that make up British society.\nTolerance and respect for difference are values that the United Kingdom has done much to promote both within its borders and beyond, and they derive from an appreciation of the innate dignity and the inalienable rights of every human person. As such they are deeply rooted in the Christian faith. You have spoken of the importance for the United Kingdom of remaining faithful to Europe’s rich traditions, and such fidelity naturally involves a profound respect for the truth that God has revealed concerning the human person. It requires us to recognize and protect the sanctity of life from the first moment of conception until natural death. It requires us to acknowledge the indispensable role of stable marriage and family life for the good of society. It obliges us to consider carefully the ethical implications of scientific and technological progress, particularly in the field of medical research and genetic engineering. Above all, it directs us towards a proper understanding of human freedom which can never be realized independently of God but only in cooperation with his loving plan for humanity (cf. Homily for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, 8 December 2005). Tolerance and respect for difference, if they are truly to benefit society, need to be built upon the rock of an authentic understanding of the human person, created in the image and likeness of God and called to a share in his divine life.\nYour Excellency, I am confident that the diplomatic mission which you begin today will serve to strengthen the good relations that exist between the United Kingdom and the Holy See. In offering you my best wishes for the years ahead, I assure you that the various departments of the Roman Curia are always ready to provide help and support in the fulfilment of your duties. Upon Your Excellency and all the people of Great Britain and Northern Ireland I cordially invoke God’s abundant blessings.\n*L'Osservatore Romano 24.12.2005 p.5.\nInsegnamenti di Benedetto XVI vol.

39	How does marine pollution impact ecosystems and food security?	Marine debris poses cascading impacts on marine ecosystems and biodiversity, threatening food security as marine capture fisheries are already at maximum ecosystem productivity. The pollution problem is pervasive across all ocean areas. This ecosystem damage is compounded by unsustainable fishing causing marine ecosystem imbalance through targeted catching of essential predators like sharks and tuna, leading to increased numbers of smaller marine animals and compromised coral health.	"[""MARINE DEBRIS CONFERENCE - MARCH 2018\nWILD FISH SHORTAGES: According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA 2009), the world population is expected to grow from the present 6.8 billion people to about 9 billion by 2050, mostly in developing countries (5.6–7.9 billion). Marine debris is thought to be a danger to fish health and the marine environment generally, with follow on effects for human health, not least of which is food insecurity.\nIn March 2011, the Fifth International Marine Debris Conference (5IMDC) was held in Honolulu, Hawaii in cooperation with NOAA, the United Nations Environment Programme, and other agencies and organizations. The conference brought over 450 participants from the marine debris community together to develop and create a document known as the Honolulu Strategy. During the 2011 event there were 45 sessions with 213 oral presentations, 5 panels, and 65 poster presentations on issues ranging from the role of government, industry and consumer choice in preventing marine debris to community led coastal cleanups. Several sessions focused on the latest research in the field of marine debris and illustrated that the problem is pervasive, impacting all ocean areas.\nCollectively, these sessions and the numerous plenary speakers highlighted the complexity of the marine debris challenge facing the international community. Many speakers highlighted the challenges surrounding the presence of plastics in the marine environment. Importantly, the conference drew attention to the detrimental and cascading impacts of debris to marine ecosystems and their biodiversity.\nHARBOR: Considered one of the best natural harbors on the west coast of North America, San Diego has long been at the front lines of ocean conservation. The area boasts 17 miles of coastline, 600 acres of public land in Mission Bay Park, and consistently sunny weather. The conference participants can access these resources, use indoor and outdoor spaces, and collaborate on global marine debris issues in an ideal coastal environment.\nOur oceans are filled with items that do not belong there. Huge amounts of consumer plastics, metals, rubber, paper, textiles, derelict fishing gear, vessels, and other lost or discarded items enter the marine environment every day, making marine debris one of the most widespread pollution problems facing the world's ocean and waterways.\nMarine debris or marine litter is defined as any persistent, manufactured or processed solid material discarded, disposed of, or abandoned in the marine and coastal environment. It is a global problem, and it is an everyday problem. There is no part of the world left untouched by debris and its impacts. Marine debris is a threat to our environment, navigation safety, the economy, and human health. Most of all, marine debris is preventable.

About 85% of the world’s fisheries could be over-exploited, totally depleted, or recovering from exploitation.\nFor this article, the purpose is to explore the major causes and effects of overfishing. Shall we start with the causes first?\nCauses of Overfishing\nThere are numerous reasons for overfishing. The major ones include:\n1. Poor Fisheries Management\nThe fishing industry has long been weighed down by a lack of management oversight and proper government regulations. Traceability of fishing activities has been a great challenge as well.\nThe rules and regulations we have today have proven to be ineffective when it comes to limiting fishing capacity to sustainable levels. And the high seas are the most affected.\nNamely, there are insufficient fishing regulations in the high seas. And the existing regulations are normally not enforced. Most fisheries management organs lack the capacity to adequately apply scientific advice of fish quotas.\nMoreover, customs agencies and fish retailers can’t always ascertain the fish coming into their country is caught through proper channels.\n2. Unsustainable Fishing\nUnsustainable fishing encompasses the use of nets, fishing methods and other fishing gear that catch so much fish to a level that they are endangered.\nIt may also involve catching other sea creatures other than fish in the process. The unwanted animals are called By-catch. And they are normally destroyed and discarded into the sea, hence the name Discards.\nDiscards may include turtles, cetaceans, young fish, sharks, corals, and seabirds. Invertebrates such as crabs, starfish, brittle stars, sea urchins, sponges, mollusks, and warms could also be caught, destroyed, and thrown back into the sea.\nSome fishermen also catch tiny fishes, depriving them of the opportunity to grow and reproduce.\n3. Illegal and Unregulated Fishing Activities\nIllegal fishing activities include poaching, taking more than the allowed amount of catch, and fishing out of season. According to WWF, illegal fishing accounts for about 20 percent of the world’s catch and up to 50 percent in some fisheries.\nUnregulated fishing practices that result in grave harm include by-catch (as explained in the previous point) and Trawling. Trawling involves scraping along the bottom of the sea to gather fish. This practice is one of the major causes of destruction to marine habitats.\n4. Economic and Food Needs\nMarket availability and consumer demands are the major factors that determine the amount of fish that fishing companies bring ashore.\nIn the last 100 years, human population has increased in many folds. This has, in turn, pushed the need for food and fish up significantly. Coupled with economic aspirations of fishing industries, these factors have compelled fishers to catch more fish than the seas can replace.\n5. Government Subsidies\nMany governments around the world continue to subsidize their fishing equipment. This allows unprofitable fishing entities to survive, eventually leading to overfishing. Today, fishing fleet across the globe is estimated to be up to 250 percent of the actual capacity needed to catch what the world needs.\n6. Open Access Fisheries\nThe ‘open access’ nature of fisheries is another major problem of overfishing. In light of the fact that there are no or limited property rights, fishermen lack the motivation to leave fish in the water.\nMoreover, only about 1.5 percent of water bodies have been declared protected areas. And most of those areas still remain accessible to fishermen, exposing them to destruction and depletion.\nNow, let’s let quickly look at some of the effects of overfishing.\nEffects of Overfishing on the Environment\nAt the beginning of this article, we pointed out that overfishing has impacted at least 85 percent of the world’s fish resources. The fact that most fisheries are harvested far beyond their sustainable capacity is poised to have wide-ranging effects on marine life and the socio-economic well-being of humans.\nThat said, here are some of the major effects of overfishing:\n1. Marine Ecosystem Imbalance\nTargeted catching of essential predators such as sharks, tuna, and billfish disrupts marine ecosystem in the long run. This results in increased numbers of smaller marine animals below the food chain.\nThis ends up affecting the rest of the ecosystem, with issues such as the increased growth of algae. Coral health becomes compromised as well. Overfishing is also associated with bycatch, one of the major threats to marine life as it causes unnecessary loss of massive fish population along with other marine animals like turtles.\n2. Dwindling Harvests of Targeted Fish\nThe population of fish that is worth consuming is increasingly reducing, thanks to overfishing. Overfishing has led to a decrease in the population of productive fish, resulting in lesser stocking of the fish.\nThere is urgent need to curb overfishing in a bid to restore the dwindling marine population in a couple of years. Limiting fishery activities will allow fish to breed and reproduce, and well will eventually have a great supply of fish available again.\n3. Fishing of Untargeted/Endangered Marine Species\nBycatch leads to the capturing of marine animals that are not used or required. The animals may include protected or endangered species or species that are of little or no economic value. If caught, they are normally destroyed and discarded either in the water or ashore.\n4. Unsustainable Aquaculture\nFish farming requires feed for reared fish. For example, you will need between four and eleven pounds of prey fish to raise just one pound of farmed salmon.\nWith the rapid expansion of the aquaculture industry, prey fish population is reducing at alarming and untenable rates. According to some researchers, if this trend continues, fish farming will have outstripped the supply of fishmeal by 2020.\n5. Socio-economic Impact\nMillions of people around the world have pegged their livelihood and nutritional needs on fishing. Oceans have supplied us with sufficient seafood for years, but that is no longer the case.\nOverfishing and untenable fishing practices over the last couple of decades have stripped the oceans of their fish supply. And this has affected many people’s everyday way of life and source of income. With no valuable fish left in the waters to fish, the fishing industry is on the verge of collapse.\nFishing boats, trawlers, and vessels hurt marine life not only through overfishing but also through oil and liquid, and chemical spills.\nYou may think that oceans are so expansive that these are not significant threats. However, a slight pollution by thousands of fishing vessels every day results in a massive disturbance. And water pollution has grave consequences to both aquatic and terrestrial lifeforms.\nWe may dismiss overfishing as a harmless practice oblivious to the fact that it is causing untold harm to the world’s ocean and marine life. Overfishing depletes the population of adult fish and doesn’t leave enough fish to reproduce and replenish their dwindling numbers. This can be attributed to poor fisheries management, unsustainable fishing, economic needs, as well as illegal and unregulated fishing. And its effects include marine life imbalance, loss of income, and harvesting of endangered marine species.\nPhoto by: pixabay\nLatest posts by Sonia Madaan (see all)\n- Raised Floor System: The Need for Adaptive Whole Building Design - January 13, 2020\n- Sustainability Matters to Long Term Guests - December 5, 2019\n- 25+ Disturbing Facts About Water Wastage That Will Leave You Highly Disturbed - December 1, 2019']"	['<urn:uuid:7ef4c78d-ab3f-4c2a-b321-91cb194f7fea>', '<urn:uuid:14da101e-6008-4330-b50e-0e7c2b52be04>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	9	66	1954
40	How does ambient temperature affect zener diode performance?	Ambient temperature directly affects a zener diode's breakdown voltage, with a typical change of about 0.1% per degree Centigrade.	"[""A zener diode is a type of diode that acts as a voltage regulator when installed by itself or with other semiconductor devices. This device is unique because it's primarily used to conduct current under reverse bias conditions. (See Part 1 in last month's issue for description of reverse bias.) As we know, standard diodes most often conduct current in the forward bias condition; as such, they can be damaged or destroyed if the reverse voltage or bias is exceeded.\nAnother name for the zener diode is avalanche diode. This name is applied because the zener diode usually operates in reverse breakdown.\nThe basic symbol used to designate a zener diode is shown in Fig. 1. Note that this symbol differs from that of the standard diode: the normally vertical cathode line is slightly bent at each end.\nHow does a zener diode work?\nTo better understand how a zener diode works, let's refer to Fig. 2. Here we see an operating characteristic curve for a typical zener diode. Relatively speaking, a zener diode's forward and reverse characteristics are similar to those of a standard diode. There are some very important differences, however.\nForward direction source voltage. When a source voltage is applied to a zener diode in the forward direction (blue portion of curve in Fig. 2), the result is a breakover voltage and a forward current.\nReverse direction source voltage. When the source voltage is applied in the reverse direction (red portion of curve in Fig. 2), the current remains very low until the reverse voltage reaches reverse breakdown, or what is commonly called zener breakdown. At this breakdown point, a zener diode will conduct heavily, or avalanche. This is the important difference between a standard diode and a zener diode: when a zener diode conducts, it may continue to conduct for some time, and at considerable current, without damage in the reverse direction.\nWhat's important about this characteristic? It's the voltage regulation: the voltage drop across a zener diode remains almost constant, despite the very large current fluctuations.\nHow is voltage regulation maintained?\nThe zener diode acts as a constant voltage source because of resistance changes taking place within the PN junction. (See Part 1 in last month's issue for description of PN junction.)\nLet's look at Fig. 3 for a better understanding. Here we see a reverse operating characteristic curve. When a source voltage is applied in the reverse direction, the PN junction's resistance stays high; thus a reverse current only in the microampere range will be produced. As the reverse voltage is increased, however, the PN junction reaches a critical voltage and the zener diode begins avalanching.\nWhat's happening at this particular point? Well, once the avalanche voltage is reached, the PN junction's normally high resistance drops to a low value. The current then increases rapidly, but generally is limited by a circuit resistor or resistance [R.sub.L], as shown in Fig. 4. The breakdown current usually will not destroy the zener diode; however, it may be destructive if it becomes extremely excessive or if the zener diode's heat dissipating capabilities are exceeded.\nWhat are pertinent ratings?\nAs we mentioned earlier, zener diodes are designed to have a specific breakdown voltage rating, usually a close approximation of the necessary circuit control voltages. Examples include 4.7, 5.1, 6.2, and 9.1V.\nZener diodes are manufactured to certain breakdown voltage tolerances, such as [+ or -] 20%, [+ or -] 10%, or [+ or -] 5%. For high precision applications, they are available in the [+ or -] 1% range.\nZener diodes are available in wattage ratings of one millionth of a watt to 50W; popular ratings are 1W and lower. These power dissipation ratings are usually given for a specific operating temperature, which is usually an ambient of 25 [degrees] C.\nSpeaking of ambient temperature, this temperature will directly affect a zener diode's breakdown voltage. As such, manufacturers usually list a zener voltage temperature coefficient, which identifies the percentage of change in zener voltage per degree of temperature change. Typically this change is about 0.1% per degree Centigrade.\nHow are zener diodes tested?\nEither a zener diode provides voltage regulation, or it fails. If it does fail, it obviously must be replaced so that the circuit can operate properly.\nSometimes, however, a zener diode may fail only in certain situations. This type of failure is called an intermittent. To check for an intermittent, the zener diode must be tested while it's in operation. Here, an oscilloscope is the best troubleshooting tool because it displays the diode's dynamic operating characteristics.\nLooking at Fig. 5, we see an oscillo-scope display, with the horizontal axis representing voltage across the zener diode and the vertical axis representing current. A good test display pattern is shown on this oscilloscope display.""]"	['<urn:uuid:6ceccd42-9e27-4a4e-80b2-2f50f47b1b75>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	8	19	797

Since then, black tea was brought to the British court, and drinking\nThe originator of black tea is in China. The earliest black tea in the world was invented by tea farmers in the Wuyishan tea area in Fujian during the Ming Dynasty in China, and it was named "" Lapsang souchong"". The Jiang family in Tongmu Villag\nThe purpose of black tea fermentation is to promote profound changes in the contents and prepare a substrate for the formation of the unique color, aroma and taste qualities of black tea. The essence of black tea fermentation is a chemical change process with the profound oxidation of polyphenol compounds as the core. How to control the fermentation time and temperature of black tea?\nBlack tea is normally fermented for 4 to 6 hours. However, the specific fermentation time depends on the age and tenderness of the tea, the cold and hot weather, the dryness, wetness, and the degree of twisting. Generally, young leaves, well-kneaded raw materials, and high-fermentation temperature leaves ferment quickly and the time is relatively short. Otherwise, the time will be longer. I have encountered that it has not been fermented for 12 hours. As long as it is not sour or stuffy during fermentation. The tea maker must keep track of the fermentation progress.\nFermentation time is only a reference indicator. Whether fermentation should be terminated, or should it be based on the degree of fermentation. Moderate fermentation is generally based on the fact that the leaf color changes to reddish-yellow, the blue aura disappears, and the floral and fruity aroma appears as the standard. If it is mass production, finally use the evaluation method to look at the color of the soup, taste the taste, look at the bottom of the leaf, and check the degree of fermentation. The book says how much temperature and humidity are, and how many hours are normal. The top tea maker only says ""watch tea and make tea"". The way inside is very mysterious!\nTemperature has a great influence on fermentation quality, including air temperature and leaf temperature. The level of temperature directly affects the leaf temperature. During the fermentation process, the polyphenol compounds are oxidized and exothermic, which increases the leaf temperature. The leaf temperature has a changing law from low to high and then low. Fermentation leaf temperature should be kept at 30℃, and the temperature should be 24℃～25℃. The temperature and leaf temperature should not be too high or too low. If the leaf temperature is too high and exceeds 40°C, the fermentation changes will be too intense, resulting in low aroma and low taste and dark color, which will seriously damage the quality. Therefore, cooling measures should be taken in the high temperature season, and the spread leaves should be thin to facilitate heat dissipation and cooling. If the temperature is too low, the fermentation time will be prolonged and the endoplasmic transformation cannot be fully developed. Therefore, when the leaf temperature is too low, the leaf layer should be thickened to facilitate heat preservation, and other heating measures should be taken if necessary.', ""After sensible Mango Lassi Kefir Smoothie from 'True Brews' How to craft Fermented Cider, Beer, Wine, Sake, Soda, Mead, Kefir and Kombucha at Home (Ten Speed Press, Spring 2013) by Emma Christensen, here's something way stronger.\nCloudy Cherry Sake\nMakes 1 gallon\nThis may just be the prettiest sake you’ll ever drink. Nigori is a style of unfiltered “cloudy” sake, so named because the rice sediment left in the sake turns it milky white in the glass.

Combine the cherries with the water in the bucket. Crush the Campden tablet and stir it in. Snap on the lid and attach the air lock. Wait 24 hours for the Campden to sterilize the cherries.\nThe next day, soak, steam, and cool rice as described on page 140. Add the steamed rice, koji rice, yeast nutrient, acid blend, pectic enzyme, and yeast to the bucket with the cherries. (If you are steaming your rice in batches, combine everything with the first batch and add the remaining rice to the fermenter as it is cooled and ready.) Stir vigorously to distribute the yeast and aerate the rice mash.\nSnap on the lid and attach the air lock. Store the sake somewhere cool and dark, ideally around 55°F. You should see active fermentation as evidenced by bubbles in the air lock within 48 hours. Ferment the sake for 2 weeks, stirring daily with a sanitized spoon.\nTo finish the sake, sanitize a strainer, flour sack towel, stockpot, funnel, a 1-gallon jug, and its stopper.\nFirst, pour the sake through the strainer into the stockpot. Discard all the rice and cherry solids. Set the funnel in the 1-gallon jug and line it with the flour sack towel. Strain the sake again, this time into the jug. Because of all the rice sediment, this can take a while. Stir the liquid in the funnel frequently to prevent the sediment from compacting and slowing down the straining. If the flour sack towel becomes clogged, rinse it out, sanitize it, and replace.\nClean the stockpot. Set the jug of sake, uncovered, inside the pot and fill the pot with water until the water is level with the surface of the sake. Set the pot over medium heat. Warm the sake to 140°F to pasteurize the sake and stop the koji and yeast activity (this does not affect the alcohol content). Allow the sake to cool.\nTo bottle the sake, sanitize ten 12-ounce bottles or six 22-ounce bottles (or five 750-milliliter wine bottles), their caps (or corks), the siphon hose, the racking cane, its tip, and the bottle filler. Shake the jug of sake to make sure the sediment is fully suspended in the sake during bottling. Siphon the sake into the bottles, shaking the jug again if the sediment begins to settle. Cap (or cork) the bottles and label.\nSake can be drunk immediately or aged for up to 1 year. Shake the bottles before serving and serve chilled.\nMake your own Nigori for Tokyo Thursdays # 260\n( Reprinted with permission from True Brews: How to Craft Fermented Cider, Beer, Wine, Sake, Soda Kefir & Kombucha at Home by Emma Christensen, copyright © 2013.

42	How do the data organization approaches differ between koboloadeR's survey analysis system and R's basic data structures when handling complex statistical information?	KoboloadeR and R's basic data structures handle complex statistical information differently. KoboloadeR implements survey data analysis plans directly within xlsform excel files used for questionnaire development, adding specific columns for configuration and generating predefined reports. In contrast, R's basic data structures (like vectors, matrices, and data frames) provide more general-purpose organization - vectors for one-dimensional arrays, matrices for two-dimensional data of the same type, and data frames for mixed-type data in rows and columns. While koboloadeR focuses on specialized survey analysis with features like sample weights and hierarchical dataset structures, R's basic structures offer more flexible but less specialized data organization capabilities.	"['koboloadeR is a metapackage, that brings together a series of specialised packages in an organised data analysis workflow, to conduct data discovery and analysis for data collected through KoboToolbox, ODK, ONA or any xlsform compliant data collection platform.\nkoboloadeR aims at helping humanitarian data analysts to focus in data interpretation by saving the time needed to quickly generate the graphs and charts required to discover insights from a dataset. It also ensure analysis reproducibility through a separation of the analysis configuration and the analysis process. The package allows to account for sample weights and hierachical dataset structure (both capacities that are not available through the default reporting engine or the excel-analyzer).\nThe main concept behind the package is to implement a survey data analysis plan and configuration directly within the same xlsform excel file that has been used to develop the questionnaire. A few additional column are created in this excel document, the package read those column to generate a series of predefined report.\nThe approach offered through the package has the following advantages:\nEnd users do not need to code in R and to master the language in order to use the package as the configuration is done in excel;\nThe data analysis plan is de facto fully documented and described;\nThe resulting data crunching reports are fully reproducible;\nAnalysis iterations are facilitated;\nGood practices are enforced through the package.\nA more detailed introduction to the concepts used in the package is presented in the Data Crunching article.\nThe data crunching allows to generated quickly initial reports through a series of semi-automated processes:\nHave all the configuration used to generate the reports (details of tabulation and crosstabulation plans, weighting approach) documented within the xlsform allow to track easily all changes to the data and to facilitate ( koboloadeR::kobo_dico)\nHave a clear and consistent folder structure and naming conventions for all the files coming in and out of the crunching workflow ( koboloadeR::kobo_projectinit)\nEnsures that files containing questions and respondents have been all considered: form & data to be checked to each other ( koboloadeR::kobo_check_analysis_plan)\nMake question and choices labels readable within charts by adjusting them where needed (for instance question labels to be less than 80 char and choices labels less than 40), resolve typos if any...

At its simplest form, it can be used as a calculator. However, as you get more affluent with this tool, you can use it to accomplish all sorts of things. Among all the popular programming languages and despite its learning curve at the beginning, R should be your first langugage. In this section, we will introduce some basics of R using RStudio, a GUI of R, which is the main program you will rely on for the rest of the semester. See here for an intro of the RStudio interface, though you will be familiar with it soon.\nThe script/code in R is commented by the\n# sign, which means the code following it will not be executed. This is useful in that it helps you and others understand what the code is about. For instance,\n# calculate 1 + 1 1 + 1 + 1\nAs you learn more about the langauge, you should also develop a good R style, which makes your code easier to read (or reread, say, 5 months after submitting your paper), share, and verify.\n2.1 R as A Calculator\nLet’s begin with some basic arithmetic operators (for more, type\n?""*"" in the console, which gives you the help page for all opeartors).\nPlay them around in your console to see how it works. In particular, try the last two operators, which might be unfamiliar to some of you.\n# Exponentiation: raises a number to a certain power 3^2 2^3 # Modulo: returns the remainder of a division 27 %% 7\nIn addition, you should pay attention to the order of operations. Try this,\n3 + 4 / 7 (3 + 4) / 7\n2.2 Basic Data Types in R\nR works with many data types. In the previous section, we work with numbers, which are called numeric. Here are some basics to start with,\n- Decimal values like\n1.111are called numeric.\n- Natural numbers like\n2are called integer. Integers are also numerics.\n- Boolean values (\nFALSE) are called logical.\n- Text (or string) values (\n""R rocks"") are called character.\nBefore we proceed, let’s also talk about variable assignment. A variable is a basic concept in statistics. In R, we use it to store a value or an object (e.g., functions, plots, and datasets.) You can later access the stored value or object by simply typing the variable’s name. To assign a variable, we use this operator\n= (the former is preferred). Try this,\n## assign a value to the variable apples apples <- 4 ## print out the value of apples apples\nNow try this,\n## assign a value to the variable oranges oranges <- 6 ## print out the value of apples and orages apples + oranges\nYou can assign characters by either double or single quotation marks, though the former is preferred. Also, R is case sensitive. Recall there are different data types. Sometimes, you can’t compare apples and oranges.\n## assign a value to the variable oranges oranges <- ""six"" ## print out the value of apples and orages apples + oranges\n2.2.1 Logical Operators\nWe introduce some arithemetic operators previously. Now let’s look at some logical operators, which yields Boolean values (\nFALSE). For a list of both types of opertors, see here. Some basics to start with,\n<=less than or equal to\n>=greater than or equal to\n==exactly equal to\nNow try this,\n## is 1 smaller than 2 1 < 2 ## does 1 plus 1 equal 3 1 + 1 == 3\nTRUE equals 1 and\nFALSE equals 0. Now let’s try this,\napples <- 4 oranges <- TRUE apples + oranges\nRecall that R is case sensitive. Try this,\n## lower case and upper case oranges <- ""six"" Oranges <- ""Six"" oranges == Oranges\nPreviously, we talk about variables. Another basic statistic concenpt is a vector, which is a one-dimension array to hold as many data as you want. In R, we use the combine function\nc() to create a vector. Elements you wish to place in the vector are separated by a comma. For instance,\n## a numberic vector num_vec <- c(1, 2, 3)\nNow try creating a character vector and a Boolean vector yourself. You can check the data type of your vector by using the\nclass() function. After you are done, try this\n## a numberic vector mix_vec <- c(1, ""Hi"", TRUE) class(mix_vec)\nFor arithmetic operations of vectors, R proceeds element-wise. For addition, try this\nc(1, 2, 3) + c(4, 5, 6) c(1 + 4, 2 + 5, 3 + 6)\nHow about other operations, say multiplication? What happen when the length of two vectors is not equal? Try these out yourself.\nTo select an element, you tell R which element you want by using square brakets. To select multiple elements, use the combine function\nc(). For instance,\nnum_vec <- c(11, 21, 63, 44, 95, 86) num_vec num_vec[c(1,4)]\nThe third statistical concenpt we’ll introduce today is a matrix, which is a two dimension (with a fixed number of rows and colummns) collection of elements of the same data type. You can construct a matrix using the\nmatrix(1:12, byrow=TRUE, nrow=3)\nYou can also construct matrices by combining vectors or matrices using the\ncbind() or the\nc1 <- 1:3 c2 <- 4:6 c3 <- 7:9 cbind(c1,c2,c3) rbind(c1,c2,c3)\nTo select an element of a matrix, we also use the square brackets. Since matrices are two dimensional, it means we need to index the element by both its row number and column number. For instance,\nmy_matrix[1,2] gives you the element that is at the first row and second column. How about\nmy_matrix[,2]? Create a matrix that has at least two rows and three columns and play around with this code.\nFor basic arithmetic operations, matrices also work in an element-wise order. For instance,\n11+my_matrix adds 11 to all elements of\nmy_matrix. You can also perform basic arithmetic between matrices, with an addition caveat: the matrices need to be conformable, meaning they have the same dimension. For instance,\nmatrix(1:6, nrow = 2)+matrix(1:9, nrow=3) gives you an error. As you can more affluent with R and statistics, you may need more involved operations, such as inner and outer products. You do not need to worry about them for now.\n2.5 Data Frame\nRecall all elements within a matrix need to be of the same type. In many cases, however, this is not a desirable feature. For instance, in International Relations studies, you might want to have data of different types within a dataset.\n- ‘Which country?’\n- GDP of the country.\n- ‘Is the country a democracy?’ `\nA data frame helps you store data of various types, with the variables as columns and the observations as rows.\n# print out built-in R data frame mtcars\nThere are several functions to help you examine a data frame, including\ndim(). Try these out yourself. Also, if you are not sure of how a function works, type\n? before a function and R will give you a help page with more details. Try\n?head, read the help page, and show the first 3 rows of the\nA package in R is a collection of functions and objects. Whenever you open RStudio or R, it automatically loads a number of packages. You can check the packages that have been loaded using the\nsessionInfo() function. As your skills get more sophisticated, you will need more packages to help you tackle your problems in hand. To do so, you need to install a package using the\ninstall.package() function and load a package using the\nlibrary() function. Once you’ve installed a package, you do not have to install it again. But every time you start a new R session, you need to load the packages you intend to use.\n# Example package installation ## Foreign allows you to read Stata .dta data files (NOT V12+), among others install.packages(""foreign"") ## plyr allows advanced data manipulation install.packages(""plyr"") ## ggplot2 facilitates the creation of excellent graphics install.packages(""ggplot2"") # Load libraries to use the packages we just installed library(foreign) library(plyr) library(ggplot2)\nFor more detailed introduction on packages, see here. In addition, while R allows you to install multiple packages, you have to load libraries one by one. A useful function is to install and load multiple packages at once, which is shown here. You don’t have to worry about them for now.\n2.7 Codes to Create Directories\nBefore you begin writing an R script, you need to set up a clear file structure where you have:\n- Main project directory\n- code subdirectory\n- tables subdirectory\n- figures subdirectory\n- .tex file subdirectory\nYou can do so by the following code\n# Clear all existing values/models/etc. rm(list=ls()) # Identify the current working directory getwd() # Set the working directory ## setting your working directory on a PC - you must include ""C:/"" setwd(""/Users/timothypeterson/Documents/Teaching/Fall 2017/502/Week 1"") # Create folders for tables and figures dir.create(""./tables"") dir.create(""./figures"")\n2.8 A Working Example\nThis is an example for coding, summarizing and visualizing data written by Tim.\n# First, remove all we have done so far rm(list = ls()) # Load the diamonds data (requires ggplot2, which we loaded earlier) data(diamonds) names(diamonds) head(diamonds) str(diamonds) summary(diamonds) # R histogram including labels hist(diamonds$carat, main = ""Carat Histogram"", xlab = ""Carat"") # ggplot2 version of same histogram ggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_histogram(aes(x = carat)) # ggplot2 allows for a lot of adjustments to fine-tune the graph, which are added with ""+"" ggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), fill = ""grey50"") + # note the option to change bar color ylab(""Frequency"") + xlab(""Carots"") + ggtitle(""Count of diamonds by size"") + theme_bw() # This changes the background color # Save the plot to the figures folder we created ggsave(file=""./figures/figure1.pdf"", width=6.5, height=5) ggsave(file=""./figures/figure1a.png"", width=6.5, height=5, device = ""png"") # Let\'s save a summary stats table to the tables folder we created library(stargazer) # Keep three variables for which to produce summary stats diamonds <- subset(diamonds, select = c(""carat"", ""depth"", ""price"")) ## Some R example data is not stored as a normal data frame, in which case the following command is necessary diamonds <- as.data.frame(diamonds) sum.table1 <- stargazer(diamonds, covariate.labels=c(""Size (carats)"", ""Cut"", ""Color"", ""Clarity""), title = ""Summary stats for diamond data"", label = ""table:summary1"") write(x=sum.table1, file=""./tables/Summary1.tex"")\n2.9 Additional Resouces\nThis introduction is heavily lifted from the introduction offered by DataCamp and Tim Peterson’s website. In addition to what I have mentioned, the course (free!) by DataCamp also talks about factors, lists, and many other functions. I highly recommend taking this course to both strengthen what you have learned today and to pick up these new stuffs. If you alreay have some experience with R and today’s intro is a bit easy for you, try out the two basics courses offered by RStudio. To access them, you need to sign in to RStudio Cloud and click Primers. Choose The Basics and you’ll see the two courses. Today’s materal is highly related to the Programming Basics course.\nLooking into the future, there are many free courses online that can help you learn more about using R. One set of courses that I worked through and would highly recommend is the Data Science Specialization offered by Coursera. It consists of nine courses (you do not need to take the capstone project or pay for all these courses if you do not want a certificate). I spent around half a year on these courses in my first year. In hindsight, the specialization could be an overkill. But it does help a lot and shows me how powerful R can be. If you intend to take them you might want to plan accordingly given how time consuming it could be.']"	['<urn:uuid:d14dddf9-1227-42c6-827f-68f6ba54e107>', '<urn:uuid:9209df7e-cff9-42d8-a1a6-dcfa331f9dad>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	22	102	2959
43	business fire inspection frequency rules north carolina ohio difference	In North Carolina, inspection frequency varies by business type: Assembly occupancies, hazardous materials facilities, hospitals, residential buildings, and high-rise buildings require annual inspections; factory-industrial and educational facilities need biennial inspections; and businesses, mercantile, storage facilities, and churches require inspections every three years. In contrast, in Northwood, Ohio, commercial business inspections are conducted annually.	['A person working within the Fire Marshal’s Office is no longer someone who just attempts to prevent fires. What was once made up of former firefighters who provided only fire prevention inspections in the city’s business areas has now become a complex division, which provides many aspects of emergency and non-emergency services. To meet today’s standards, our personnel must be trained in many fields and must be proficient in many areas of technical expertise and customer service.\nOver the years we have become responsible for providing more diverse services. These different levels of service were dictated by the rapid growth in our business community and the cost-effective use of limited city resources.\nA few of the public safety services provided are:\n- Fire Prevention Periodic Inspections\n- Fire Code Enforcement\n- Fire/Arson Investigations\n- Hazardous Materials Management\n- Public Fire & Life Safety Education\n- New Construction Inspections\n- Site Development and Public Fire Safety Planning\n- Training for Pre-incident Response\n- Fire Suppression/Rescue Operational Fill-in\nThese duties are provided within three sub-sections. These include Administration, Fire Inspections, and Fire/Arson Investigations.\nDivision Chief Joe Meadows provides the day to day supervision of the division’s personnel. He is responsible for administering the programs assigned to this division, including the implementation, administration and enforcement of the provisions of the NC State Fire Prevention Code. Requirements that are essential for the public safety of an existing or proposed activity, building or structure, or for the safety of the occupants, which are not specifically provided for by the fire code are determined by the fire marshal or his designee. He is also delegated with the authority to render interpretations of the city fire protection ordinance, and to adopt policies, procedures, rules and regulations in order to clarify the application of its provisions and the State Fire Code as well. His office is located at 100 Court Plaza in the Headquarters Station 1.\nFire Prevention Inspections\nThis section is supervised by Deputy Fire Marshals (DFM), geographically assigned into Battalion areas, with a staff of Assistant Fire Marshals working under them.\nTheir Assistant Fire Marshals (AFM) are responsible for conducting periodic fire prevention inspections, as established by the NC Office of State Fire Marshal for existing premises, as well as new construction permit inspections. Asheville City Council adopted a fee schedule for periodic fire inspections. These fees are based on a cost recovery basis. Each assistant fire marshal conducts fire inspections of every commercial premise located within the City of Asheville. Inspections are also conducted for Certificates of Compliance for altered existing structures, new construction, or those buildings with new occupants. Confidence or acceptance testing of fire protection and life safety systems is also managed under this section. Operational fire prevention permits for various regulated activities are inspected by the section.\nInspection compliance is achieved through the utilization of adopted codes, standards, and ordinances of the City of Asheville, NFPA National Fire Codes, and the NC State Fire Prevention Code. As a part of our local ordinance, each structure is inspected and the hazards found are listed for the owner / occupant. Also, their enforcement of the fire code allows for identification of unsafe property such as open, vacant structures, which are a danger to the community and firefighters. Several items, which are of primary importance to life safety, are fire alarm systems, sprinkler systems, means of egress, and other fire extinguishing systems.

44	muscle shoals fame studios famous artists	Both studios attracted numerous legendary artists. FAME Studios hosted Etta James, Wilson Pickett, Clarence Carter, and the Osmonds, while Muscle Shoals Sound Studios recorded with notable artists including the Rolling Stones, Cher, Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, and the Staple Singers, making the region a major recording destination.	"['MUSCLE SHOALS, Ala. – The world lost a music pioneer on Tuesday. Legendary music writer, producer, and publisher Rick Hall passed away in Colbert County. Hall created FAME Studios which put the “Muscle Shoals Sound” on the international stage.\nThe studio stands out just as much as the music he produced. Rick Hall’s dreams were realized inside the four walls of FAME Studio’s. He made Muscle Shoals “The Hit Recording Capital of the World”.\n“To this day, that sound. Everybody still talks about that sound and wants to be a part of that,” stated Dixie Griffin with the Alabama Music Hall of Fame.\nRick Hall was 85-years-old. Hall was raised in Franklin County the son of a share-cropper. He got his first taste of music when he moved to Illinois as a teen and got hooked.\nAfter serving in the Korean War, hall returned to the Shoals and a factory job.\nBut after some the loss of his father and new bride within weeks, Hall turned to music. His first songwriting success came in the late 50’s with a hit by George Jones.\n“Music comes from the soul, and it came from Rick’s soul,” explained Debbie Wilson with Muscle Shoals Sound Studios. “He had the ear and the heart for what would make something successful and he was very driven to do that, and to do that with others to help them be successful.”\nAfter a failed music studio partnership, Hall founded Florence Alabama Music Enterprises.\nRecording artists from around the world started hearing Hall’s soul and wanted a piece of it.\nEtta James, Wilson Pickett, Clarence Carter, and the Osmond’s all recorded in Studio “A” at Fame. That’s just a tasting of the big names who wanted Rick Hall behind their music.\nAnd his legacy has been passed down to today’s generation of recording artists.\nMusicians from around the world passed on their condolences Tuesday as word spread of Hall’s passing. Names such as Mac McAnally, Jason Isbell, and John Paul White; Shoals artists who learned from the “Godfather of Muscle Shoals Music”.\nEarly in his music career, Hall didn’t mind breaking down barriers. Churning out hit after hit in the 60’s, he didn’t shy away from integrating his studio. He saw the potential in people, not the color of their skin.\nFAME Studios, according to its website, has been involved in the recording or publishing of records that have sold more than 350 million copies over the past 50 years.\n“The songs that they created are classics. They have lasted over the years and they are the best music ever, and all ages listen to that music,” said Dixie Griffin.\nHis friends said Hall always remained humble about his music success.\nHe also leaves behind a huge legacy filled with determination and pride in his work.\n“He had a rough time. He had a lot of adversity in his life, and he really was an inspiration for turning that adversity around into something positive. And he was really an integrating force in the music industry,” Debbie Wilson said.\n“It’s that Muscle Shoals sound,” said Griffin. “It’s just a very humble man that did more than he ever really realized he did I think, yeah he was a great guy.”\nFAME Recording Studios posted a social media note early Tuesday saying “We hope the band in heaven is ready!!! If not, there’s going to be a problem!”\nThe funeral will be held Friday at Highland Park Baptist Church on South Wilson Dam Road. Visitation will begin at noon with services starting at 2:00 p.m.', 'From its establishment in 1969 by the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (MSRS) until the mid-1980s, the Muscle Shoals Sound Studios (MSSS) in Sheffield, Colbert County, was one of the most sought after recording studios in the nation. The musical legacy of the recordings made at the studio rivals the ""sounds"" of Detroit, Memphis, and Philadelphia.\nIn March 1969, members of the MSRS—Barry Beckett (keyboards), Roger Hawkins (drums), David Hood (bass), and Jimmy Johnson (guitar)—severed their ties with FAME Studios (Florence Alabama Music Enterprises) in Muscle Shoals and organized their own music production facility, Muscle Shoals Sound Studios, Inc. Hawkins and Johnson had envisioned opening a studio for some time and were interested in purchasing a building at 3614 Jackson Highway in Sheffield, which already housed a studio. The four musicians combined their resources and purchased the building and installed an eight-track recording machine compatible with Atlantic Records\' recording equipment, with important financial assistance from Atlantic Records\' vice president Jerry Wexler, who wanted the quartet available for his projects.\nThe studio maintained its own staff of writers and engineers. Although recording artists frequently brought their own producers, much of the production work was done by the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section\'s members themselves (often garnering co-production credits), as was the case in their work with Bob Seger and Paul Simon. The quartet was also joined by a host of songwriters such as George Jackson, Randy McCormick, and Phillip Mitchell (signed to Muscle Shoals Sound Publishing Company); producers Al Bell, Chris Blackwell, Don Davis, Ahmet Ertegun, Glenn Frey, Tamiko Jones, Arif Mardin, Johnny Sandlin, Brad Shapiro, Jerry Wexler, and Bobby Womack; assistant producer Dick Cooper; and engineers that included Tom Dowd, Larry Hamby, Gregg Hamm, Jerry Masters, Steve Melton, and Phil Ramone.\nThe musicians of the MSSS wanted a name that would distinguish their studio from FAME and that would promote their all-important ""sound."" In the late 1960s, independent regional recording was at its zenith. Detroit, Philadelphia, Nashville, and Memphis were all home to studios with distinct identities like the ""Motown Sound,"" ""TSOP, the sound of Philadelphia,"" and Memphis\'s ""Stax sound."" Humbly, members of the former FAME rhythm section renamed themselves the Muscle Shoals Sound Rhythm Section. In a stroke, the rhythm section laid claim to a regional identity, eclipsing FAME\'s indirect local association with Florence. Moreover, the name Muscle Shoals Sound acted as a double entendre; a ""sound"" that refers to an acoustical property, but also a ""Sound"" that identifies a uniquely identifiable musical style. Such a regional identifier signified to the world the intellectual property of the collaborating entrepreneurs of the Jackson Highway studio, and has largely remained so, even beyond its era of operation.\nThe studio opened in early April 1969 recording Cher\'s Atco album aptly titled 3614 Jackson Highway. Although it was housed in an undistinguished gray stone building, the façade is immediately recognizable to music fans of that era. The cover of Cher\'s album portrayed the artists standing confidently before the studio, and dozens of similar photographs would be shot of session participants at Muscle Shoals Sound, whether for album art, such as Paul Simon\'s 1973 There Goes Rhymin\' Simon and Donnie Fritts\'s 1974 Prone to Lean, or for the music press. The photographs surprised many listeners, who assumed MSRS members were African American. The ""Sound"" associated with Muscle Shoals, because of its rhythm and blues roots, is racially ambiguous and the MSRS often collaborated with black artists and producers in ways that defied typical assumptions about race relations in the South.\nAfter a rocky start-up year, when projects trickled in and performed poorly in the charts, activity virtually exploded at the studio. Early sessions with Lulu, Solomon Burke, John Hammond Jr., Ronnie Hawkins, and The Duck and The Bear, though in some instances unremarkable, enabled the studio to solidify its sound. Coinciding with the commercial success of R. B. Greaves\' hit ""Take a Letter, Maria,"" recorded at MSSS in August of 1969, in early December 1969, the Rolling Stones recorded three songs at Muscle Shoals Sound Studios, ""Brown Sugar,"" ""Wild Horses,"" and ""You Gotta Move,"" before performing at their infamous concert at Altamont, California. Another notable early recording session that features the studio as a prominent physical presence in terms of its identity and sound is the collection titled Skynyrd\'s First: The Complete Muscle Shoals Sessions. Johnson produced those seminal recordings of southern-rock icons Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1971 and 1972; tracks collected on that album were later reissued in 1998.\nThe studio embarked on a decade-long encounter with some of the era\'s top popular musicians. Performers who recorded at the studio represent some of the most notable and popular recording artists of the 1970s: J. J. Cale, Leon Russell, Jimmy Cliff, Linda Ronstadt, Rod Stewart, Wilson Pickett, James Brown, Millie Jackson, Willie Nelson, Boz Scaggs, Bobby Womack, Bonnie Bramlett, Wendy Waldman, Mary McGregor, Art Garfunkel, Peter Yarrow, Ronee Blakely, and many others.\nThe studio also held a unique place in the narrative of soul music in the early 1970s. After the house band at Memphis\'s Stax Records, Booker T. and the MGs, split up, Stax producers Johnny Baylor, Al Bell, William Bell, and Don Davis began cutting rhythm section tracks at Muscle Shoals Sound in the fall of 1970. During the subsequent five years, a number of Stax artists, including Luther Ingram, Johnnie Taylor, William Bell, Carla Thomas, the Soul Children, and Margie Joseph, recorded their most important hits at MSSS. Highlights from this period included the Staple Singers\' ""Respect Yourself"" and ""I\'ll Take You There,"" as well as the Beckett and Hawkins production of Mel and Tim\'s 1974 ""Starting All Over Again.""\nDuring the mid-1970s, MSSS collaborated memorably with numerous artists, such as Bob Seger and Delbert McClinton, which helped the studio expand to include a music publishing arm and a record label, Muscle Shoals Sound Records. In 1978, the studio moved to a state-of-the-art riverfront facility at 1000 Alabama Avenue in Sheffield. The new building boasted 24-track recording equipment and two studios, where numerous artists, including Levon Helm, Billy Burnette, Bob Dylan, Dr. Hook, Julian Lennon, Stevie Winwood, Etta James, the Oak Ridge Boys, Eddie Rabbitt, Bobby Bland, and Dan Penn recorded. The new studio was sold to Malaco Records in 1985, which in turn sold the building to Cypress Moon Productions Inc., a film studio, in 2005. The original Muscle Shoals Sound Studio at 3614 Jackson Highway was purchased by sound engineer Noel Webster in 1999 and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 2, 2006. The refurbished studio hosted blues-rock band The Black Keys for the recording of their Grammy-winning Brothers album in 2010. In June 2013, Webster sold the studio to the Muscle Shoals Music Foundation, which is chaired by Rodney Hall, son of FAME Studio founder Rick Hall.\nMuscle Shoals Sound played a prominent role in American popular music both as a production facility and as a stylistic embodiment\nof southern regional music. The remarkable consistency of the music created by the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section can be explained\nby the synergy of its players and their dedication to the art of recording. Sheffield, a working-class town, fostered a country-soul\nstyle and work ethic that was reflected in the studio\'s recordings. The appeal of that sound, which is internationally recognized,\ncan be understood as a unique blending of local musical sensibilities with a cosmopolitan mix of styles that reached well\nbeyond its geographic boundaries. The studio\'s legacy testifies to music\'s ability to defy stereotypes and bring disparate\nErtegun, Ahmet M., Susan Steinberg, and Bette Midler. Atlantic Records: The House that Ahmet Built. DVD.

45	harmful diseases that could come from bringing crayfish from australia risks to local wildlife	Four disease-causing agents have been identified as hazards: Cherax quadricarinatus Bacilloform Virus (CqBV), White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), the oomycete Aphanomyces astaci, and the fungus Batrachochytrium dedrobatidis (BD). The risks of introducing WSSV and spreading crayfish plague (caused by Aphanomyces astaci) are considered high. BD, which causes severe decline in amphibian populations globally, also presents a high risk of introduction if the crayfish comes from an endemic area. The risk from CqBV is considered extremely low.	['Animal Health and Welfare | Alien Organisms and trade in Endangered Species (CITES)\nAssessment of risks to animal health and biodiversity from import and farming of Australian red claw crayfish\nReport no: 2016: 64\nIt seems unlikely that the Australian red claw clayfish will establish reproductive populations under Norwegian climate conditions, but hitchhiker organisms and infectious agents could potentially follow the import, and unless managed, may pose risks to biodiversity and aquatic animal health. This is the conclusion in a risk assessment from the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VKM).\nThe Norwegian Food Safety Agency (NFSA) and the Norwegian Environment Agency requested the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VKM) for an opinion of risks, with regards to aquatic animal health and biodiversity in Norwegian fauna, associated with import of Australian redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) to Norway for aquaculture.\nThe Australian red claw crayfish is a relatively large freshwater crayfish, originating in tropical Australia and Papua New Guinea. Redclaw is considered an invasive alien species, but has a limited tolerance for low temperatures. It seems unlikely that redclaw can establish reproductive populations under Norwegian climate conditions.\nHowever, there are concerns of negative impacts on native fauna if redclaw should manage to escape in high numbers. Hitchhiker organisms and infectious agents could potentially follow the import, and unless managed, may pose risks to biodiversity and aquatic animal health.\nFour disease-causing agents\nFour disease-causing agents were identified as hazards: Cherax quadricarinatus Bacilloform Virus (CqBV), White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), the oomycete Aphanomyces astaci and the fungus Batrachochytrium dedrobatidis (BD). Redclaw or related crayfish species can be infected or act as carriers of these pathogens.\nThe risk associated with the introduction of WSSV is considered as high, with some uncertainty related to the effect of WSSV on Norwegian crustaceans under natural water temperature conditions.\nCrayfish plague is already established in Norway in a few areas. Since Aphanomyces astaci, the agent that causes crayfish plague, may be transferred to areas that are plague-free, the risk of spreading crayfish plague through import of redclaw is considered as high in the absence of specific measures.\nBD occurs all over Australia and Asia, and has also reached Africa, America and parts of Europe, but is still not reported in Norway. Amphibian species are declining at an alarming rate globally due to BD. The risk of introducing BD with redclaw from an endemic area is considered as high in the absence of specific measures.\nThe risk associated with the introduction of CqBV with imported redclaw is considered as extremely low, with some uncertainty related mainly to the unknown, although unlikely, susceptibility of Norwegian crustaceans to the disease.\nThere are very few ecological studies of tropical species under temperate environments available, making predictions on consequences of reproductive ability and establishment of redclaw in Norwegian conditions difficult. VKM also recognizes a number of uncertainties and data gaps related to health risks.\nThe risk assessment is conducted by a working group comprising members from the Panel on Animal Health and Welfare, the Panel on Alien Organisms and trade in endangered species (CITES) and the Panel on Microbial Ecology and external experts from the Norwegian Veterinary Institute.']	['<urn:uuid:ba1890dd-78dd-407c-b596-4cdaafafe1ec>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	14	76	526
46	beginner cook safety tips raw meat handling	To handle raw meat safely, you should keep it in a separate area of your refrigerator and tightly wrapped to prevent juice leakage. Use a separate cutting board for raw meats (plastic is recommended) and another for vegetables. Always wash your hands before handling foods and after handling raw meat, and clean countertops and cutting boards with hot, soapy water afterward. Additionally, to prevent cross-contamination, keep raw meat separate from other foods in your grocery cart and never place cooked food on a plate that previously held raw meat. Raw meat should never sit at room temperature for more than two hours (one hour when temperature is above 90ºF) before refrigeration.	"['Cooking can be a relaxing and enjoyable pastime. Unfortunately, the kitchen is also the most common room in the home where accidents occur. These kitchen safety tips will help keep you and others safe while you’re cooking and eating.\nHot pots and appliances, boiling water, splattering grease and oil, sharp knives; all these things are common in a kitchen. They can also be the things that make working in a kitchen a dangerous place. Keeping your kitchen clean to avoid contaminating the food is also important.\nFirst of all, make sure that your kitchen is clean from top to bottom, inside and out, this will prevent cross-contamination of dirt, bacteria and germs.\n- Get in the habit of washing your hands before handling foods and after handling raw meat.\n- Keep raw meat in a separate area of your refrigerator. Keep it tightly wrapped or place it in a leak proof container so juices can’t contaminate other foods.\n- Wash the counter top or cutting board with hot, soapy water after you’ve finished handling raw meat.\n- It’s best to use separate cutting boards, one for raw meats and another for vegetables. Tip: color code your cutting boards or use a plastic one for meat and a wooden one for other foods, this way you won’t forget which to use.\nMeats should be cooked to recommended internal temperatures as determined by the United States Dietary Association:\n- Steaks and Roasts – 145 degrees F\n- Egg dishes – 160 degrees F\n- Fish – 145 degrees F\n- Chicken breasts – 165 degrees F\n- Pork – 160 degrees F\n- Whole poultry – 165 degrees F\n- Ground beef – 160 degrees F\nTo keep food fresh longer, keep your refrigerator temperature set below 41 degrees F and your freezer should be kept at 0 degrees F. Date each item before it is placed in your freezer so that you can use it before it gets too old.\nThaw frozen foods in the refrigerator overnight, in the microwave oven, or submerged in a bowl of cold water. Place the package in a watertight plastic bag, submerge in cold water, then change the water every 30 minutes until item is thawed. Don’t just leave the meat on the counter or in the sink to thaw as bacteria in the food can multiply and cause someone to get sick.\n- Teach your child which items might be hot and not to touch them with out your permission.\n- Invest in good quality, heat resistant pot holders and oven mitts. Don’t use a tea towel or dish cloth for this purpose, especially damp ones as the moisture can create a steam burn.\n- Keep pot handles turned so they are over the stove or counter top so someone walking by can’t accidentally knock them and their hot contents over.\n- Cover pans that contain hot grease or oil with a lid or splatter screen.\n- Keep your knives sharp, believe it or not cuts happen less often and are less damaging with sharp knives.\n- Always cut away from yourself, never toward yourself.\n- Always use a cutting board, don’t place the food in your hand to cut it.\n- Don’t leave knives in the sink, especially in dish water where they can’t be seen.\n- Store knives point down in a butcher’s block or in some other special holder. This keeps them sharp longer and prevents cuts.\nLast but not least, if you sample food as you cook use a clean spoon or fork each time. Taste testing just once can transfer germs from your mouth to the food.\nCooking can be hazardous, but it certainly doesn’t have to be. Simply follow the precautions mentioned above, then you will be cooking with confidence and the knowledge that you’re doing it in a safe, healthy manner.', ""Wash hands and surfaces often\nSeparate your foods to prevent cross-contamination, in your cart and at home.\nUse separate cutting boards for meats and produce\nCook foods to the proper temperatures\nRefrigerate foods promptly - don't leave them at room temperature.\nFood Safety & Storage\nFood safety education offered by Cornell Cooperative Extension targets both consumers and food service professionals. Our outreach to consumers, who are concerned primarily with food safety in the home, includes newspaper and newsletter articles, answering consumers questions by phone, public presentations, and distribution of information at public events and gatherings.\nFour Simple Steps to Food Safety\nFoodborne illness can strike anyone. Some people are at a higher risk for developing foodborne illness, including pregnant women, young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. For these people the following four simple steps are critically important:\n1. CLEAN: Wash hands and surfaces often\nBacteria can be spread throughout the kitchen and get onto hands, cutting boards, utensils, counter tops and food. To prevent foodborne illness, always:\n- Wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before and after handling food and after using the bathroom, changing diapers and handling pets.\n- Wash your cutting boards, dishes, utensils and counter tops with hot soapy water after preparing each food item and before you go on to the next food.\n- Consider using paper towels to clean up kitchen surfaces. If you use cloth towels wash them often in the hot cycle of your washing machine.\n- Rinse fresh fruits and vegetables under running tap water, including those with skins and rinds that are not eaten.\n- Rub firm-skin fruits and vegetables under running tap water or scrub with a clean vegetable brush while rinsing with running tap water.\n2. SEPARATE: Don’t cross-contaminate\nCross-contamination is how bacteria can be spread. When handling raw meat, poultry, seafood and eggs, keep these foods and their juices away from ready-to-eat foods. Always start with a clean scene— wash hands with warm water and soap. Wash cutting boards, dishes, countertops and utensils with hot soapy water.\n- Separate raw meat, poultry, seafood and eggs from other foods in your grocery shopping cart, grocery bags and in your refrigerator.\n- Use one cutting board for fresh produce and a separate one for raw meat, poultry and seafood.\n- Never place cooked food on a plate that previously held raw meat, poultry, seafood or eggs.\n3. COOK: Cook to proper temperatures\nFood is safely cooked when it reaches a high enough internal temperature to kill the harmful bacteria that cause illness. Refer to the chart for the proper internal temperatures.\n- Use a food thermometer to measure the internal temperature of cooked foods. Make sure that meat, poultry, egg dishes, casseroles and other foods are cooked to the right internal temperature. Color is not a reliable indicator of doneness.\n- Cook eggs until the yolk and white are firm. Only use recipes in which eggs are cooked or heated thoroughly.\n- When cooking in a microwave oven, cover food, stir and rotate for even cooking. Food is done when it reaches the correct internal temperature.\n- Bring sauces, soups and gravy to a boil when reheating.\n4. CHILL: Refrigerate promptly\nRefrigerate foods quickly because cold temperatures slow the growth of harmful bacteria. Do not over-stuff the refrigerator. Cold air must circulate to help keep food safe. Keeping a constant refrigerator temperature of 40ºF or below is one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of foodborne illness.

47	com trua peak hours vietnam	Com trua restaurants in Vietnam have peak hours from 11:30am to 1:30pm and from 5:30pm to 7:00pm.	['Top 5 Com Trua dishes in Ho Chi Minh City\nOne of our favourite spots to eat in Vietnam are com trua restaurants. Literally translated as “rice day”, these are canteen-like spots that serve homestyle dishes, perfect for the fast paced Saigonite..\nMost canteens serve at least 10 different dishes during peak hours which usually run from 11:30am to 1:30pm and from 5:30pm to 7:00pm. Between these times, the dishes will depend on what was left over from the lunch or dinner rush. So it’s best to get there early for lunch or on time for dinner to get the freshest food.\nOrdering is very simple. Just walk up, point to the dish that you want and take a seat. The portion will have a plate of rice with the item that you chose on top. There will also be vegetable on the side of the plate as well. Options can be sautéed green beans, pickled cabbage, and steamed morning glory. Also, depending on what you order, you will get a dipping sauce in a small ramekin on the side. Most likely it’ll be nuoc cham but it will always compliment the flavour of themain item. You might also get a small bowl of soup as well.\nPrices are ridiculously cheap as well as they can run from 15,000VND to 25,000VND per plate.\nThe amount of dishes can be intimidating so we’ve put together a list of our top 5 com trua dishes in Vietnam.\nCa Kho To – Braised catfish in a clay pot\nThis staple has origins in the Mekong where catfish is abundantly available. The rich brown colour comes from a caramel sauce that coats the fish at the beginning of the cooking process. Fish sauce, coconut juice and garlic round out the dish. Some places add a liberal dose of pepper as well just to round out the flavours. Make sure to spoon the sauce onto some rice. You won’t regret it.\nRecommendation: Com Tam Di Nam in District 4. Not only do they make a fine Ca Kho To, they elevate it by throwing in some chopped chicharrones on top for good measure.\nDau Hu Nhoi Thit Chien Sot Ca Chua – Fried tofu stuffed with pork served with a tomato sauce\nYes, it seems wrong to order this dish but once you taste it, you will keep ordering it and not feel guilty about it. The minced pork inside is flavoured with fish sauce, copious amounts of garlic, some chilis and probably some MSG. Once stuffed, the tofu is fried and topped with a tomato sauce made from the drippings.\nRecommendation: Com Tam Thu Tram in Thao Dien Ward in District 2 on 16A Quoc Huong.\nGa Chien Nuoc Mam Ot – Fried chicken with a chili and fish sauce glaze\nTake some chicken, marinate it with fish sauce, shallots, garlic and chopped chilis.\nThen take the remainder of the marinade and toss it in some of the hot oil. Toss the chicken back in and serve. Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, this is the dish that was instrumental for elevating Pok Pok to the culinary powerhouse it is today.\nRecommendation: The best of the bunch is served on the corner of Vo Van Tan and Truong Dinh in District 3. Affectionately known as “crack fried chicken lady”, she ups the game by crusting her chicken with flour to help absorb the sauce.\nThit Kho Tau Trung – Braised pork with egg\nVietnamese comfort food at it’s finest. While growing up, we had this dish at least once a week and never got sick of it. Anything with the word “kho” in it means it has been braised in a caramel sauce for hours which means the pork is fork tender and the boiled eggs will take a brown tinge to them. Also, the sauce is another one of those you need to spread onto your plate of rice.\nRecommendation: Anywhere you can get it.\nDau Hu Chien Xa Ot – Fried tofu with lemongrass and chili\nAs unrepentant meat eaters, one would find it surprising that one of our favourite com trua dishes is vegetarian friendly. Take a bite and you will see why we picked this dish. Copious amounts of chopped fried lemongrass and chili top crispy chunks of tofu. The aromatic topping is the star of the show with the tofu taking a second fiddle.\nRecommendation: Head to Chua Vinh Nghiem on 339 Nam Ky Khoi Nghia in District 3. Make sure to head to the side restaurant with the benches.']	['<urn:uuid:d16a0309-6d84-433d-8647-a39446735554>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	5	17	764
48	medical tort system compare criminal justice system differences penalties evidence standards	The medical tort system and criminal justice system differ in several key ways. Medical tort cases are civil suits initiated by injured parties requiring only a preponderance of evidence, while criminal cases are initiated by the state and require proof beyond reasonable doubt. Additionally, medical tort cases typically result in financial penalties and compensation rather than jail time, except in extraordinary circumstances. The tort system focuses primarily on compensating injured parties, with punishment being secondary, while the criminal system's main focus is punishment through incarceration. Medical torts deal with civil wrongs like malpractice, while criminal cases handle offenses like drug possession or murder.

It generally evokes a perception of being ‘burdensome’ ‘bothersome’ and arguably, a ‘nuisance.’ As a result, any cause for liability is to be avoided, at all costs. This is a disposition that benefits both consumer and industry. In theory, the consumer does not want to have a reason to sue and the industry does not want to give them, leading to increased standards of quality for whatever good or service is rendered – indicating the practical function of liability.\nIf and when a claim does arise, the judgment of liability will be handed down within the tort system, the area of the justice system dealing exclusively with issues of liability and breaches of duty. The tort system has long courted controversy; lawmakers, constituents and commentators alike are eager to chime in with their two-cents. Many call it a broken system, citing exorbitant costs the effects of which ripple to a number of other social areas, compensating the few at the cost of the many. Detractors offer some valid points, but the fact remains that a tort system is necessary for the protection of consumer rights (which includes ‘consumers’ of medical services) and public safety at large. If there is no punishment in place for considerable mistakes, what’s to deter them? Medical liability for tortuous acts serves a particularly important function in maintaining the integrity of medical standards. It is nearly impossible to have a discussion of tort law without discussing one of its most vital manifestations – medical tort law. More than any other industry, room for error in medicine is slight, and a strict adherence to standard is critical.\nThe United States Civil Court System\nTo explore the place and importance of medical tort law, let us begin with the basis of the greater tort system. ‘Tort’ is a word from the French language; in legal terminology is means a civil wrong. A person who commits a civil wrong is called a tortfeasor. If sued they become the defendant in the suit. To be liable for tort, the alleged tortfeasor must have had a legal duty to the plaintiff. Duty is defined as ‘an obligation, to which the law will give recognition and effect, to conform to a particular standard of conduct toward another.’ A special legal relationship between plaintiff and defendant is not present in all tort cases, but for medical malpractice cases it is almost uniformly present. A tortuous act can either be classified as misfeasance or nonfeasance. Misfeasance indicates that the individual took incorrect action (such as prescribing the wrong medicine for an illness). Nonfeasance indicates that the individual failed to take any action (prescribing no medicine at all). Unlike criminal cases which are initiated by the state, tort cases are civil suits initiated by the wronged party. Medical malpractice, in most cases, is a civil wrong.\n‘Civil wrong’ is distinguishable from offenses we would classify as ‘crime.’ An individual will be liable for failing to meet their reasonable legal duty not to harm another party, but the action is not necessarily ‘criminal.’ For example, sloppy medical care that proximately injures a patient is a punishable civil wrong, but it is not a criminal feat and usually will not constitute jail time (except in extraordinary cases). Given the elevated stakes and penalties of criminal cases, there is a higher burden of proof levied on the prosecution. Tort cases only require a preponderance of evidence, while criminal cases require the standard of evidence be ‘beyond a reasonable doubt.’ The greater tort system encompasses a vast array of civil wrongs, some of which do amount to crimes.\nRules of Civil Procedure\nBalancing the interests of injured parties and accused tortfeasors has been a complicated legislative endeavor. Each state writes its own tort law, often seesawing back and forth in their legal disposition. Efforts to legislate evenhandedly are usually tainted. Most states’ laws exhibit a degree of favoritism toward patient or provider, ironically in an effort to offset previous legal favoritism to the other party, whether it was an intended or unintended consequence. Tort is not limited to physical, emotional and economic injury/loss. Its reach includes auto accidents, false imprisonment, defamation, product liability, copyright infringement, and environmental pollution (toxic torts.) Torts may be the result of negligence, or could have been intentionally carried out to deprive another person of safety, privacy, property etc. Prior to the Federal Tort Claims Act, sovereign immunity shielded the federal government from tort suits, even if a blatant tort occurred (i.e. a postal worker hitting a pedestrian). The FTCA opened up government employees acting within the scope of employment to be susceptible to tort suits.\nTort law is the mediator between wrong and remedy. However, not every wrong is the domain of tort law. Drug possession or murder, for example, are not torts. Tort constitutes an evidential departure from an individual’s explicit or implicit duty. In medical malpractice cases, a doctor is guilty of malpractice if the plaintiff satisfactorily proves that they deviated from the “duty of care” which they owed to the patient by nature of their profession and proximately harmed the patient by deviating from that standard. That is to say, there was an expectation, legal or implied, of best conduct not to injure (injure here having broad meaning) which the tortfeasor failed to meet.\nTort suits can be broken down into a few general categories. Negligent torts, intentional torts, and strict liability. Strict liability is at the heart of class action suits, usually imposed on manufacturers to maintain the integrity of products on the marketplace and ensure no product is harmful to a consumer when used. Unlike negligent torts, which are best described as harmful acts of carelessness, intentional torts occur when the tortfeasor was aware of the consequence of their action and knowingly proceeded with the goal of obtaining that result.\nMedical Tort Law and The Standard Of Care\nThe primary function of tort suits is to secure compensation for the injured party. Punishing the tortfeasor is secondary by comparison, which is accomplished by imposing financial strain since jail time is usually off the table for acts of negligence, except in especially reckless cases. However, tort law was not conceptualized purely for the purpose of providing monetary damages – it is also an essential tool for enforcing industry standards. Liability for medical torts is especially critical to public safety, ensuring medical personnel is aware of the consequence of providing a poor quality of service, thereby deterring careless mistakes.\nMedical care is a service purchased by consumers, as it has not yet reached the status of a universal right, but with human life involved, the stakes of medical care are much higher, and there should be very little room for error. In other professions, there is room for error and the results of error are hardly detrimental. If a cashier forgets to include your receipt, doesn’t bag an item you paid for, or a store associate doesn’t lead you to the proper aisle, or a barista uses whole milk when you asked for skim – these are all common workplace errors for which none of these hypothetical workers could be held legally liable. If some law were in place that would make workers legally and financially liable for these mistakes, you can almost be assured that their incidence would drop dramatically.\nThey would still occur, undoubtedly but instances would be far rarer. This is why medical malpractice liability is in place. Not only as means for injured patients to secure compensation for their injuries and suffering but to maintain the integrity of fairly airtight medical standards. Human life is far too precious to have an overly condoning legal system that does not adequately police potentially injurious or fatal medical error. Every field within medicine has an explicit and accepted standard of care which, even if not laid out in legal doctrine, is known and uniformly practiced by all professionals in that practice area. This is why expert testimony became an essential facet of medical malpractice law and a facet of tort reform in states that had no legal requirement for expert testimony on the books. It is up to the testimony of a medical expert in the same field as the defendant to determine whether or not a breach of the standard of care occurred.\nHowever, this creates a unique and perhaps ethically questionable situation whereby medical professionals, by virtue of the relative enigma of their profession are subject to a sort of self-policing. Physicians of a given field do not convene to think of ways to cheat the patient by creating faulty standards of care and then universally accepting them in their field, however, regulations are self-guided and there is no objective third party laying down the guidelines for the standard of care in a given medical practice field.\nThe Drawbacks of The Medical Tort System\nDecades of medical malpractice court decisions have yielded millions in damage awards to injured plaintiffs, but in this very sensitive and interwoven system, there have been many unintended consequences. Defensive medicine is a term for doctors who practice with the fear of liability in mind, ordering an excess of tests, scans and sometimes procedures and treatments so as to be overly certain that they have not failed to notice or treat the patient’s malady, thereby eschewing liability. This leads to an elevation in healthcare costs.\nAlthough inflation is at fault for increasing damage amounts, at least in part, the increasing scale and frequency of damages awarded in malpractice cases have led healthcare providers to obtain malpractice liability insurance for which premiums keep going up. Increased expenses for physicians means increased costs for the services they provide. This proximately contributes to rising healthcare costs. States have attempted to combat this liability insurance issue by establishing injured claimant funds which will pay out damages to a winning plaintiff for amounts exceeding $1,000,000 (in Wisconsin), thus physicians are only required to keep liability insurance up to 1 million dollars. They also must make annual contributions to the fund, but the overall cost is less than what it would be with exclusive liability insurance for amounts greater than $1 million. Still, these efforts have not entirely curbed the effect of heightened health care costs. California‘s Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act has been heralded as an excellent model for tort reform.\nMany issues and general conundrums face the tort system, which serves its purpose too well at times and at others falls entirely short. States that have imposed damage caps for plaintiff awards in tort cases battle the question of if this is a form of deprivation of rightful compensation. Elsewhere, damage awards are extravagant even if subject to a cap, given the nature of the suit that engendered them. Defendants found guilty in tort cases could also be liable for punitive damages, which do not function to compensate the plaintiff but to punish the guilty party. There is discord among experts and tort scholars as to whether or not recent years have really seen a “litigation explosion,” with each side presenting conflicting statistics.\nNot to say tort was an area of law that was freeform or poorly regulated, but after observing the effects of a tort system that was feebly constructed with regard to how tort suit decisions would affect other aspects of society, the need for reform was elucidated. Detractors of the tort system allege that it is frightfully inconsistent, with great variation in treatment from state to state, county to county, and even court to court; they allege that frivolous suits clog the court docket, and that tort cases exact an exorbitant cost which has come to undermine the integrity of many industries. Tort law has a unique relationship with healthcare and medical malpractice has been cited as one of the reasons.', 'Burden of Proof or Risk of Non-Persuasion\nthe duty of a party to present evidence on the facts in issue\nnecessary to establish his claim or defense by the amount of\nevidence required by law.\nthe establishment of a requisite degree of belief in the mind of\nthe trier of fact as to the fact in issue.\nTwo separate burdens in burden of proof:\n1.

Harbert International, LLC\n- Chinese General Contractor China Huashi Enterprises LTD\n- Site 7.4 acres\n- Office Space 18,000 gross square meters\n- Total Project Cost $267 million ($11M Design; $256M Construction)\n- The new Consulate General is located on a 7.4 -acre urban site in Guangzhou’s booming new Central Business District adjacent to the Pearl River.\n- Situated in a garden setting, the seven-building complex includes a consular building, an office building, a residence for U.S. Marines, a warehouse with service shops, and three entrance pavilions to welcome employees, visitors, and consular customers.\n- The new Consulate General will create a secure and pleasant workplace for nearly 400\nemployees, and a friendly and comfortable place for visitors.\n- The new Consulate General is America's second purpose-built facility in China, following the completion of the Beijing Embassy in 2008.\n- The centerpiece of the complex is a four-story Consulate office building featuring an interior “Great Hall” and 67 service windows for visa applicants and U.S. citizens. The stone-clad building is flooded with natural light, and the Great Hall features natural wood wall and ceiling finishes as well as local stone flooring.\n- Teak wood was chosen as a finish material for its ability to naturally withstand exterior climatic conditions; monsoon rains and extreme tropical heat, without reducing in strength, cracking, warping, or becoming brittle. Raw Teak wood was imported and finished in local mills in southern China.\n- The stone-clad exterior concrete shell of the Consulate office building is an organic structural and environmental form. The curved shape maximizes the efficiency of these qualities while the inward cant along the east façade catches the prevailing easterly breeze, focusing it on the consular plaza. This shape also gives the building a directional stance, emphasizing the civic quality of the more public eastern face. Its north and south ends, with their deep overhangs provide welcome, open and warm gestures to the public.\n- The architectural conception of the main Consulate office building begins with the visa process itself. The need to move thousands of daily applicants through a seamless, simple, and clear spatial sequence is the primary public function of the consular plaza. The arching roof form provides shelter from the heat and rain; there is also a gathering space for those awaiting their appointments, which can accommodate over 1,000 non-immigrant visa (NIV) and immigrant visa (IV) customers daily.\n- The facilities were designed for flexibility for current and future use. With the bilateral relationship between the U.S. and China evolving so quickly and the demand for consular services growing at such unprecedented rates, the building is designed to adapt to these changes easily with minimal cost.\n- The contrasting office building is a formal cube of self-weathering steel, clad in clear glass at its upper register, and resting on a stone base.\n- The Consulate General also offers facilities for public events. The Great Hall, the state-of-the-art multipurpose room, and the Information Resource Center will be used to host presentations, exhibitions and events to foster exchanges and mutual understanding between the United States and China.\n- The construction groundbreaking took place in October 2009 and the project was completed in June 2013.\n- Over 800 Chinese and American workers were involved in construction of the new Consulate General.\n- The landscape design facilitates an intuitive understanding of movement through the buildings and site. This landscape includes a walkway modulated by a tapestry of local stones and unit pavers, interspersed with living plants in a pattern that extends from the visa windows, across the Great Hall, through the garden and entry pavilion, and out to Hua Xia Road.\n- The building façade and landscaped areas integrate local stones from Fujian province with trees and other plants from local nuseries in southern China. A variety of tree and plant species were used, including the Hong Kong Orchid, Chinese Scholar, Madagascar Almond, Camphore, Crape-Myrtle and Flame trees; as well as Iris Pseudoacorus Grass and Zebra Grass.\n- The Consulate General facility is registered with the U.S. Green Building Council with the goal of earning Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) Silver certifi cation. The design demonstrates strategies to reduce energy consumption and pollution, mitigate storm water runoff and other development impacts, and create a more livable, sustainable community.\n- Bilingual signage in public spaces highlights the green building and site features.\n- The electric lights in the buildings automatically dim when daylight can illuminate the building’s interior, saving on energy and costs. Daylight is controlled to prevent heat gain through the use of recessed exterior windows and wooden louvers.\n- The main Consulate offi ce building features a white, highly reflective roof, which reduces cooling needs by refl ecting the sun’s heat. Green roofs are featured on the smaller entrance pavilions and service buildings with hardy grasses and fl owering plants. The green roofs help insulate the buildings, capture and fi lter rainwater, and filter city air.\n- Storm water is retained on site and fi ltered through a series of “bio basins” or sunken gardens filled with indigenous grasses and plants.\n- The building has water-conserving plumbing fi xtures, including low-fl ush toilets and low-flow sinks.\n- Waste generated from construction activity was sorted on site and over 50% was diverted from landfills for recycling or reuse.\nThe permanent art collection, curated by the Offi ce of Art in Embassies (AIE), includes works by contemporary American and Chinese artists for both the interior and exterior spaces. The works include a variety of media: paint, photography, textiles, paper, and steel.\nThe Chinese photographers in the collection—An Hong, Gao Bo, Guan Ce, Hong Lei, Jiang Zhi, Jin Yongquan, Liu Anping, Liu Zheng, Qiu Zhijie, Rong Rong, San Mao, Wang Xu, Yan Lei, Zhao Liang, Zheng Guogu, and Zhuang Hui—all played a seminal role in the history of Chinese experimental photography.\nThe collection also features three site-specifi c commissions by renowned video artists Doug Aitken, Jennifer Steinkamp, and Bill Viola.\nIn addition, The Foundation for Art and Preservation in Embassies (FAPE) has graciously donated a monumental work by U.S. artist, Joel Shapiro. FAPE is a private non-profi t organization that supports the Art in Embassies' mission and the U.S. Department of State."", ""A landscape of urban solutions\nThe waterfront Marina Bay district is a testament to Singapore’s progress.

It has developed many specialised solutions for large-scale infrastructure development. These include structural green concrete made with recycled raw materials, structural lightweight concrete, and underwater concrete. In Singapore, the company’s projects include Jewel Changi Airport, and it has also supplied materials for projects in Vietnam and Malaysia.\nWoh Hup served as the contractor for Gardens by the Bay, which comprises two dome conservatory complexes and a Supertree Grove. Both domes are feats of complex construction, with composite steel grid-shell structures supported by a radial web of steel ribs, and covered entirely in glass.\nWoh Hup was founded in 1927 by Mr Yong Yit Lin. From a one-man construction company, it has become Singapore's largest privately-owned construction and civil engineering specialist with a 2,500-strong workforce, and is responsible for iconic projects such as Jewel Changi Airport.\nTo build the 300m Marina Bayfront Bridge, structural engineering and post-tensioning specialist Utracon supplied and installed post-tensioning works, as well as precast T-shaped wing slabs. The bridge’s main deck was designed as a triple-cell box girder, and was constructed by the company using the form traveller method.\nUtracon is experienced in the building and civil engineering sectors, and well-versed in various bridge construction methods. The company has worked on projects across Asia and Africa, including the Permata Hijau Flyover in Indonesia and Jinja Bridge in Uganda.\nThe Marina Barrage dam across the Marina Channel created Singapore’s first urban freshwater reservoir and the island’s largest and most urbanised catchment area. To construct this dam, the Koh Brothers company designed nine steel crest gates, and seven drainage pumps capable of displacing a combined total of 280 cubic m of water per second.\nFounded in 1966, Koh Brothers has a strong track record in specialist engineering solutions. Its subsidiary, Koh Brothers Eco Engineering Limited, is a sustainable engineering solutions group that provides engineering, procurement and construction services for water and wastewater treatment, hydroengineering, bio-refinery and bio-energy projects.\nDistrict cooling is an innovative urban utility service, where the centralised production of chilled water is piped to commercial buildings for air-conditioning. Singapore District Cooling (SDC) is the world’s largest fully underground district cooling system, and it is located deep under Marina Bay.\nIt was created with engineering know-how from SP Group, which operates Singapore’s electrical grid and gas grid. SDC’s first district cooling plan supplied chilled water to office development One Raffles Quay, and its second plant at Marina Bay Sands increased its total cooling capacity to 60,000RT. It also provides district cooling and heating services to developments in China.\nSolarGy was responsible for the 52 kWp solar photovoltaic project at the Gardens by the Bay Office and its Family Forest, installing solar photovoltaic panels on the Family Forest’s metal roof that formed a curve to follow the roof profile.\nSolarGy was founded by a team of practising professionals in the building construction industry. Well-equipped with over 20 years of experience in electrical installations and building architecture, the team specialises in providing solutions to suit the specific energy requirements and creative architectural design of different projects.\nGardens by the Bay has an Energy Resource Centre, which uses horticultural and other wood waste as biomass fuel to generate electrical power, and heating and cooling services for the gardens’ daily operations. By-products from its highly efficient biomass furnace and boiler system, such as fly ashes and bottom ashes, are also repurposed as soil amendments and fertilisers.\nThe centre is the brainchild of EcoWise, an integrated sustainable environment solutions partner. A major player in the environmental arena since 1979, the company provides cost-effective waste management and treatment strategies through innovative R&D, and the incorporation of applicable technologies.\nMarina Bay Sands has a roof that measures 12,400 sq m, and only nine stacks of 150mm pipe. How can water be drained from this roof efficiently? Enter the Fast Flow Siphonic System, which is able to work with other services and structures within the tight cladding space without a need to enlarge or lower any structural or architectural elements.\nThe system was designed by rainwater drainage solution provider Fast Flow. This company has created siphonic, pressurised and hybrid draining solutions spanning 20 million sq m of roof area across the Asia Pacific. Other iconic projects include the Beijing National Stadium (also known as Bird’s Nest) in China, and the Hilton Hotel Empire in Queensland, Australia.\nFor the construction of Marina Barrage, Pan Asian supplied high-density polyethylene stoplogs, which are hydraulic engineering control elements.\nFounded in 1979, the company is a leading provider of high-quality integrated piping solutions for water and wastewater infrastructure projects. Working with strategic partners, it offers customised and cost-effective products and solutions for turnkey projects in the water, wastewater, environmental, marine and oil and gas industries. Its projects span the Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East.\nBesides their location in Marina Bay, the precinct's Helix Bridge, and Gardens by the Bay’s Supertrees and OCBC Skyway share another commonality – they were made possible by the comprehensive fabrication capabilities and structural steel solutions of the T T J Group.\nEstablished in 1981, the company designs, supplies, fabricates and erects a wide spectrum of structural steelworks. These are used in many industries, including factories, infrastructure and shiplift platforms for offshore oil and gas. The company also manufactures other construction products, such as two-rail and three-rail aluminium parapets for flyovers and expressways, and blast doors for public bomb shelters.\nMarina Bay Sands is topped by its signature SkyPark, a structure that involved the manufacture and installation of thousands of unique curved aluminium composite claddings at great height.\nThe company that successfully delivered this structure was Prime Structures Engineering. Established in 1995, this building façade specialist provides design-and-build solutions for unique building structures, customised art structures, security façades and interior fit-outs. With a presence across Asia, its notable projects include Changi Airport Terminal 3, Singapore Sports Hub, Australian Embassy Jakarta and the Okada Manila.\nOne of Singapore’s leading precast and prefabrication manufacturers, Robin Village Development (RVD) designed and supplied precast components for the core wall, staircase flight, and external curve wall of the Supertree Grove in Gardens by the Bay.\nFounded in 1984, RVD is a wholly-owned subsidiary under Tiong Seng Contractors. Headquartered at Tiong Seng Prefab Hub, the company offers a one-stop solution service in a state-of-the-art building that incorporates both precast and prefabrication production capabilities.""]"	['<urn:uuid:32df59cb-e74d-4b9e-95cf-ab416072565b>', '<urn:uuid:34cf2490-525d-4b7d-a661-c81219085636>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	13	76	2344
50	Besides taking medicine, what are some natural ways people can try to get fewer headaches in their daily life?	Several non-drug options can help prevent headaches, including: maintaining proper posture (especially while using computers), getting massage therapy to relieve muscle tension, practicing relaxation exercises like meditation or gentle yoga, using biofeedback to learn how to relax neck and head muscles, and identifying and avoiding personal headache triggers.	['Headache prevention may include prescription medications, or lifestyle adjustments like massage, biofeedback, changing posture, or avoiding triggers.\nWhile treating a headache helps to relieve the pain and tension and allow you to function, most people would prefer to prevent themselves from getting headaches rather than having to deal with one once it does occur. In many cases, headache prevention is possible. Preventive measures won’t necessarily eliminate your headaches completely, but can reduce the frequency and severity of their occurrence.\nWhich preventive measures work for you will depend on what type of headaches you have. Some headache prevention measures are:\n• Postural adjustments\n• Biofeedback or relaxation exercises\n• Avoiding headache triggers\nThere are certain medications that can be used to reduce the frequency of headaches. A class of antidepressants called the tricyclic antidepressants can reduce the frequency of both migraine and tension headaches. Certain other medications can also be used to reduce the frequency of migraines. A type of blood pressure medication known as beta-blockers is sometimes effective, although researchers aren’t precisely sure why these work. Certain antiseizure medications can also be effective.\nAll of the preventive medications can have side effects, so it’s important to weigh both the risks and the benefits before deciding whether to take preventive medication for headaches. Patients must decide for themselves, in consultation with their doctors, whether the medication is worth it.\nThere are also other, non-drug options that can be effective in preventing headaches. Tension in the muscles of the neck and head can be caused by posture. For instance, when the head is held forward of the body, this causes a lot of tension in the muscles of the neck, which may lead to headaches. This is a common position for many people to hold while working at the computer. Many people with tension headaches may benefit from learning about posture, possibly with the help of a physical therapist or other movement professional, to help them achieve better alignment and reduce the frequency of their headaches.\nSimilarly, for some people, tension in the muscles of the neck and head may lead to frequent tension headaches. Massage may be effective at relieving this tension and therefore reducing the frequency of tension headaches. Massage may also be effective for reducing the frequency of migraine headaches. Research into this modality is ongoing, but because it has no side effects, it may be worth trying to see if it works for your headaches.\nSimilarly, relaxation exercises and biofeedback may be effective in helping people reduce tension in the neck and head muscles and reduce headache frequency. Relaxation exercises may include such exercises as progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, or gentle yoga. Biofeedback uses monitors of muscle tension to help you learn how to consciously relax the muscles of your neck and head; for some patients, this can be helpful for tension headaches or migraine.\nMany people have headache triggers. These may be certain foods or beverages, lack of sleep or too much sleep, bright fluorescent lighting, or many other types of triggers. Keeping a headache diary may help you to identify your triggers. Once you know what they are, avoiding your triggers as much as possible may help to prevent headaches from occurring.\nThere are several herbal therapies that claim to be effective at preventing migraines. Most have shown mixed results in scientific studies. If you choose to use an herb for migraine prevention, please be aware that many herbal remedies work in much the same way that prescription remedies do, so you should consider it to be a medicine that may have side effects or interact with your other medications. Tell your doctor about the herb you’re using, so he or she can check to make sure it’s safe for you.\nNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). “NINDS Headache Information Page.” NINDS website (2015). http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/headache/headache.htm\nMayo Clinic Staff. “Migraine: Prevention.” Mayo Clinic website (2013). http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/migraine-headache/basics/prevention/con-20026358\nMayo Clinic Staff. “Tension headache: Prevention.” Mayo Clinic website (2013). http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tension-headache/basics/prevention/con-20014295']	['<urn:uuid:878c3be1-2448-41b9-a6bd-60141a34bb32>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	19	48	662
51	looking historical accounts women resistance fighters communist regime imprisonment torture methods	Elisabeta Rizea was a notable anti-communist activist and political prisoner who supported the anti-communist resistance by providing food, clothes, and information to resistance members hiding in the mountains. She was arrested twice - first receiving a 6-year sentence, and later a 25-year sentence with property confiscation. During investigations in prison, she endured brutal torture methods - in one instance, her hair was hooked to the ceiling and a table pulled from under her feet, tearing her hair out. Despite offers of freedom and money, she remained devoted to her cause and later publicly testified about the communist regime's repression at the Communist Memorial from Sighet.	['The idea of writing about the Remarkable Romanian Women came to me after reading Rachel Ignotofsky’s book: “Women in Science: 50 Fearless Pioneers Who Changed the World”. I discovered how hard it was for women to succeed in science and other domains despite their talent and competence, only because they were…well, women.\n“Nothing causes more headaches than a woman in pants”. This is how the book starts. I knew that it was always difficult for women to have access to education and to be seen more than just wives and good mothers. But I never realized that change for women actually occurred so late. Marie Curie, Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, Barbara McClintock, Hypathia, Ada Lovelace, Elizabeth Blackwell, Mary Agnes Chase and many, so many others, had to fight with prejudice, they had to work to finance their own education and research, publish under pen names and in the end, their remarkable results were appreciated or taken into consideration moreover under public pressure.\nNo matter how fascinating the book seemed to me, I was sad to notice that no Romanian names were mentioned. This leads us to the motivation for this article dedicated to Remarkable Romanian women. Brave, courageous, perseverant, talented, they contributed to the enrichment of culture, science, and life. Though not all of them were scientists, they broke prejudices, they stubbornly did not comply with the discriminatory rules of society and believed in their strength.\nThe list I made became longer and longer, so I decided to break the article into two parts and dedicate the proper space and time for these Remarkable Romanian women and their inspirational stories.\n1. Sarmiza Bilcescu (1867 – 1935)\nEurope’s first female lawyer and world’s first woman with a doctorate in Law\nIn the late 19th century, Sarmiza Bilcescu managed to break prejudice and became Europe’s first female lawyer and the world’s first female Doctor in Law. This happened during a time when the law was considered a career reserved exclusively to men.\nShe dedicated her life to helping disadvantaged social groups but she also campaigned intensely for women’s right to education, civil, social, or political rights equal to those of men.\nSarmiza Bilcescu was born in Bucharest in a family with great connections among noblemen.\nShe studied at home with a private teacher until she turned 7, then she continued her education at Saint Sava College in Bucharest. After obtaining her high-school diploma in 1884, she decided to study Literature at the Sorbonne University from Paris. Her family supported her unconditionally. However, she changed her plans and signed up to study at the Sorbonne School of Law, applying as a foreigner for a scholarship.\nAccording to Radio Romania Cultural, being the first girl to attend law courses was unprecedented and Sarmiza attracted the admiration of her fellow male colleagues. However, the attitude of her professors was different. In fact, during one of the first courses, Sarmiza was simply kicked out by Professor Paul Sonday, who shouted: “No women!… Science is studied by men only!”.\nAfter a few months, even the doorman denied her access to the college building. Despite all these obstacles, the Romanian woman did not give up being determined to break this taboo, and she constantly stated that a woman’s right to education could not be restricted. She declared: “In a country where even on the prison doors is written: “liberté, égalité, fraternité”, you cannot prevent a woman from being educated, just because she is a woman! “.\nStrongly supported by her mother, who stood by her throughout her five years of college, she passed all her exams with excellent grades, obtaining, in 1887, a bachelor’s degree in law.\nThree years later, in 1890, she entered history, becoming the world’s first woman Doctor of Laws from the Sorbonne University with her thesis “The legal condition of mother in Romanian and French law”, a document that promoted the idea of equality between women and men in marriage and in the rights of women over their children.\nAt 23 years old, she returned to Romania and applied to enter the bar. Considering her academic success, she was accepted and she became the first European female lawyer. However, she never practiced because she was shunned by clients still influenced by the patriarchal mentality.\nShe dedicated her life to the emancipation of women and disadvantaged social groups, charity and she founded many organizations to support the Romanian culture, the students and also the peasants.\n2. Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu (1887 – 1973)\nOne of the world’s first female engineers\nElisa Leonida was born in Romania in an intellectual family with 11 children. All of them received the proper education and achieved professional performances in different fields.\nElisa went to school in her hometown and then in Bucharest. After graduating high school, she signed up to study at Polytechnic University in Bucharest but her application was rejected because she was a woman. She considered other technical universities in Romania, but she received the same answer everywhere.\nIn 1909, she traveled to Germany and she applied to the Royal Technical Academy from Berlin.\nIn Germany, too, there were prejudices about the role of women in society. The dean was hardly convinced to accept the application of Elisa, invoking as an argument the essential calling of women in life, namely the three K’s: Kirche, Kinder, Kuche, that is: Church, Children, Kitchen.\nShe also had to face discrimination and a hostile attitude of her professors. She finished her studies in 1912 when she got her engineering diploma in chemistry. She refused a job offered by BASF in Germany and decided to return to Romania. With difficulty, she got a position as an engineer at the Laboratory of the Geological Institute from Bucharest. During WWI, she went to the battlefront and participated in the humanitarian activities of the Red Cross. She even successfully administrated some war hospitals.\nWhen the war ended, she resumed her work at the Geological Institute where she ran many study laboratories and elaborated original methods of chemical analysis and processes for the preparation of ores, analysis for drinking water, oil, gas, coal.\nShe also studied mineral waters in Romania and the composition of water for industrial consumption. Another study looked at the use of bentonite in wine filtration – bentonite is still used to clarify wine today.\nHer studies were very important in the exploration and efficient use of the underground resources of Romania.\nBesides her research works, Elisa Leonida carried out an important teaching activity, giving lectures and courses, and inspiring young chemists and workers from all over the country.\nElisa Leonida Zamfirescu was the first female member of the General Association of Romanian Engineers (AGIR) as well as a member of the International Association of University Women.\nAn award for women working in science and technology was established in her name, the Elisa Leonida-Zamfirescu Award.\n3. Sofia Ionescu-Ogrezeanu (1920 – 2008)\nOne of the first female neurosurgeons in the world\nSofia Ionescu-Ogrezeanu was born in a small town in Northern Romania but studied in Bucharest. After graduation, she decided that she wanted to be a doctor so she applied in 1939 to the Medical School in Bucharest.\nThe year 1944 brought a decisive moment in Sofia Ionescu’s career who was working as a resident at a hospital in Bucharest. It happened that, as a result of the frequent bombing of Bucharest during the war, too many wounded people were brought at the same time and there were too few doctors who could save their lives.\nIn this context, an injured child, for whom surgery was of utmost urgency, was brought in at a time when no doctor was available. To everyone’s surprise, the young student offered to operate on him, an intervention that proved to be a lifesaver. Since then, she specialized in neurosurgery.\nIn the years that followed, she performed thousands of surgeries on the brain and spine, becoming at the same time the first female neurosurgeon in Romania and the first in South-Eastern Europe. It is also worth mentioning that at that point, neurosurgery was still at the beginning and not even men dared to perform brain surgeries.\nSofia Ionescu – Ogrezeanu dedicated her life to rescuing patients and performing scientific research in the field of neurosurgery.\nA 2008 profile in Neurosurgery credits Diane Beck as the world’s first female neurosurgeon. But the claim has also been made for the Romanian Sofia Ionescu, although the author notes that Ionescu only finished medical school in 1945 when Beck was already working as a consultant in neurosurgery.\nAs a curiosity, in Sofia Ionescu’s 47 years of activity, she had only a few days off, and those caused by two pregnancies. Moreover, she operated the day before her first child was born.\nThroughout her life, she received several distinctions from the most important medical organizations, including the “Red Cross” and the “World Health Organization”.\n4. Queen Marie of Romania (1875 – 1938)\nIndeed, Queen Marie of Romania was not Romanian by birth but she acted and lived like a real one.\nDescended from both British and Russian royal families, she became in 1914 Queen of Romania.\nPassionate and beautiful woman, talented diplomat, dedicated mother, a kind, sensitive, and gifted artist, Marie was ahead of her time and much loved by her subjects.\nShe was named the last romantic and the first modern woman in Europe.\nAnd now, we talk about her as one of the Remarkable Romanian Women.\nWe have written a whole article about her life and achievements on our travel blog here: “Queen Marie of Romania. The story of a royal heart”.\n5. Elisabeta Rizea (1912 – 2003)\nThe story of Elisabeta Rizea from Nucsoara village became known to the public only recently. Political prisoner and anti-communist activist, she was the embodiment of the courage not to kneel in face of oppression.\nDaughter of a former member of the Peasant Party killed by the communists, Elisabeta, together with her husband, dedicated her life to supporting, no matter the sacrifices, the so-called anti-communist resistance.\nThey provided them food, clothes, and information to survive in the mountains and to stay hidden from the communist authorities.\nUnfortunately, her husband was imprisoned and convicted to 15 years of forced labor.\nElisabeta Rizea was also arrested, investigated, and convicted to 6 years in prison. After she was released, though the risks were even higher, Elisabeta kept on helping the members of the anti-communist resistance. She was arrested for the second time and convicted to 25 years of forced labor and confiscation of property. After another 6 years, she was set free by pardon decree.\nAfter the fall of the Communist Regime, Elisabeta Rizea spoke publicly at the Communist Memorial from Sighet and in different interviews about the resistance from Nucsoara and the repression imposed by the communist regime through security, militia and the new hierarchy in the village. Her speech was simple and full of verve and it made us realize that we were in the presence of the last descendant coming from a world which today it exists only in novels.\nElisabeta suffered a lot during the communist investigations and she described the brutal methods used by the militia to make her confess valuable information about the anti-communist resistance group.\nIn an interview, she described how during the investigation in prison, she was put on the table and her hair was caught by a hook on the ceiling. The table was pulled from under her feet, her hair remained on the hook and she fell to the ground. That’s how her hair was torn from her head.\nShe was offered freedom, money. It did not work. She remained devoted to her cause.\nWomen like Elisabeta Rizea were many, of course, most of all during those awful years. But her testimony will always remain a proof of individual dignity, all the more admired as anyone who imagined himself in her place would have a dilemma: What would I have done?\nWe end here the first part of Remarkable Romanian women and we promise to get back with more examples and interesting stories in a future article.']	['<urn:uuid:dde1635e-7c70-4e0b-b662-65828f72ed90>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	11	105	2016
52	How does continuing education relate to professional counseling practice, and what are the ethical considerations around confidentiality when dealing with suicidal clients?	Continuing education is an integral part of professional counseling practice, with various qualifying activities including graduate-level courses, home study programs, formal consultation/supervision, and leadership positions in counseling organizations. All activities must fall within approved content areas and require proper documentation. For ethical considerations around confidentiality with suicidal clients, while confidentiality is a foundational ethical standard, it does not apply when disclosure is required to prevent clear and imminent danger to the client. Counselors have a duty to protect clients from harm, which supersedes potential harm from breaching confidentiality. They must be able to assess suicide risk accurately and take necessary preventive steps while documenting all assessments and interventions thoroughly. Courts generally rule in favor of practitioners who can demonstrate prudent and responsible care through proper assessment and intervention planning.

Of course, “harm” can be defined in a variety of ways.\nFor counselors, confidentiality is a foundational ethical standard. Confidentiality is the ethical duty to fulfill the promise that client information received during therapy will not be disclosed without authorization. As such, it follows that breaching confidentiality can result in “harm” to the counseling relationship and subsequently the client. Confidentiality is addressed in Section B of the Ethical Standards of the American Counseling Association Section B.1.a speaks to respect for client privacy. “Confidentiality becomes a legal as well as an ethical concern if it is broken, whether intentionally or not” (Gladding, 2004).\nBecause confidentiality is such a critical issue within counseling, exceptions to confidentiality must also be heavily considered. What if not breaking confidentiality leads to “harm”?\nSection B.1.c. outlines the exceptions to confidentiality including the fact that confidentiality does not apply “when disclosure is required to prevent clear and imminent danger to the client….” This exemption was written with the suicidal client in mind, clarifying that counselors have a duty to protect client from harm and that this supersedes the harm that may happen due to a breach of confidentiality.\nThe complexities surrounding confidentiality are brought to the forefront when dealing with a suicidal – or potentially suicidal – client. Any decision to breach confidentiality should be made with careful consideration. The difficulty in making a decision, even in cases of suicide risk, lays in assessing “clear and imminent danger.”\n“Determining that a client is at risk of committing suicide leads to actions that can be exceptionally disruptive to the client’s life. Just as counselors can be accused of malpractice for neglecting to take action to prevent harm when a client is determined to be suicidal, counselors also can be accused of wrongdoing if they overreact and precipitously take actions that violate a client’s privacy or freedom when there is no basis for doing so” (Remley & Herlihy, 2001).\nNegligence results from some type of wrongful action committed by one person, which results in “injury” to another person. As a general legal principle, a court must find the following four to be true:\n1) A duty was owed by the counselor to the client\n2) The duty owed was breached\n3) There is sufficient legal causal connection between the breach of duty and the client’s injury\n4) Some injury or damages were suffered by the client\nWith regard to the first issue, counselors have a duty to take steps to prevent client suicide. “Counselors have established themselves as mental health professionals, and the law imposes on counselors practicing in all settings the responsibility of knowing how to accurately determine a client’s risk for suicide” (Remley & Herlihy, 2001). It is not required that counselors always be correct in making their assessments of suicide risk, but they need to operate from an informed position and “fulfill their professional obligations to a client in a manner comparable to what other reasonable counselors operating in a similar situation would have done” (Remley & Herlihy, 2001).\nThe following are considered reasonable duty for counselors in terms of suicide prevention (Remley & Herlihy, 2001):\n- Counselors must know how to make assessments of a client’s risk for suicide and must be able to defend their decisions\n- When a decision is made that the client is a danger to self, counselors must take whatever steps are necessary to prevent the harm\n- Actions to prevent harm must be the least intrusive to accomplish that result\nBrems (2000) summarized the following questions related to negligence:\n1) Was the counselor aware or should have been aware of the risk?\n2) Was the counselor thorough in assessment of the client’s suicide risk?\n3) Did the counselor make “reasonable and prudent efforts” to collect sufficient and necessary data to assess risk?\n4) Were the assessment data misused, thus leading to a misdiagnosis where the same data would have resulted in appropriate diagnosis by another mental health professional?\n5) Did the counselor mismanage the case, being either “unavailable or unresponsive to the client’s emergency situation?”\n6) Was the counselor negligent in the way she or he designed her or his intervention with the client after assessing risk?\n7) Did the counselor make adequate attempts to keep the client safe (i.e., set up a plan of contingencies with appropriate resources, phone numbers, etc)?\n8) Did the counselor remove the means to be used by the client in the suicide attempt?\n9) In cases of minors, were parents or caretakers informed of the client’s potential risk?\nWhat can counselors do to protect themselves and subsequently their clients?\n- Counselors should inform clients of the limitations of confidentiality through standard “informed consent” procedures.\n- Counselors should begin their study of suicide assessment prevention early and continue to stay current through professional development activities regarding suicide and crisis intervention and ethical/legal issues in counseling (Laux, 2002)\n- Counselors should be familiar with suicide risk factors , procedures for suicide assessment, and guidelines for intervention (Brem, 2000)\n- Counselors should abide by the standard of practice to consult with other mental health professionals to aid in assessing for suicide risk and interventions. It is important to look for consensus and follow the advice in making decisions (Remley & Herlihy, 2001)\n- Counselors must properly document the process of suicide assessment and intervention through case notes and reports (Brem, 2000)\nAs reported by Brems (2000), “as long as mental health and health professionals have been able to show prudent and responsible care (through assessment of risk and tailored intervention planning), the courts have tended to rule in favor of the practitioner” (p. 166).\nFreemouw, Perczel, & Ellis (1990) note, “Any therapist, regardless of how competent, successful, and skilled, may lose a client through suicide. What will distinguish this therapist from another who was clearly negligent, careless, and indifferent to her or his client’s suicidal state is the presence of a well-documented, thorough client record” (P. 10).\nSpecial Considerations for Minor Clients\nThe issue of confidentiality for minor clients is complex. While counselors are encouraged to maintain the confidentiality of minors in the same way as adults, legally, parent’s rights to information about their children override the counselor ethical obligation of confidentiality in most cases. This is due, in part, to the fact that minors are not seen as competent to give “informed consent” and therefore this power belongs to parents.\nFor counselors working with minor clients (including, but not limited to, school counselors), it is recommended that you become familiar with ethical and legal issues related to counseling children and adolescents.\nWith regard to suicide prevention and intervention, it is typically best practice to make parents/guardians aware of suicide risk for their children. Technically, the professional counselor’s legal liability ends when parents have been notified that their child is at risk for suicide and prevention actions have been recommended (Remley & Sparkman, 1993).\nHowever, considerations as to whether this is in the ultimate best interest of the child remain fundamental (for instance, if the child sites his/her relationship with parents as a factor in the decision to attempt suicide).\nIn addition, counselors have an obligation to follow up with a child, if parents or other significant others fail to act on prevention recommendations.\nIn the vast majority of cases, it will be necessary to inform parents of the child’s risk for suicide. How effectively this is done takes forethought and intention.\nProactively taking similar steps with minor clients that you would take with adults (informed consent, involving them in as much decision-making as possible, following up and supporting parents/guardians) are important steps in this process.']"	['<urn:uuid:0c2fa361-7a5f-47c1-bd64-3eb78c92d40d>', '<urn:uuid:26d343d4-40a1-4dd2-bfc2-b4efbdf1e09c>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	22	129	3418
53	hazard ratio dementia risk shift work vs day work population based cohorts	The hazard ratio for dementia risk comparing shift work versus day work was 1.40, according to analysis of population-based cohorts from the Swedish Twin Registry.	['BOSTON—Midlife shift work is associated with an increased risk of incident dementia in later life, according to research presented at the 31st Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies. The\nassociation is stronger with longer duration of shift\nwork, said Kathleen Bokenberger, a doctoral student in\nthe Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatis-tics at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm.\n“To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study\nto find a connection between shift work and greater\ndementia incidence,” said Ms. Bokenberger. “As such,\nwe will need confirmation from other studies, especially\nif they have more nuanced measures of shift work, and\nperhaps repeated measures of shift work.”\nAn Analysis of Two Population-Based Cohorts\nShift work interferes with the circadian and homeostatic\nregulation of sleep and can lead to insomnia and excessive sleepiness. A prospective Danish study found that\nrotating and evening shift work were associated with\nincreased dementia mortality, but the link between shift\nwork and dementia is still relatively unexplored, said\nShe and her colleagues followed two population-based cohorts from the Swedish Twin Registry. The\nfirst cohort, which the researchers called STR-1973,\nincluded 13,283 people who were age 30 or older\nwhen they received a mailed questionnaire in 1973\nthat elicited information about shift work status and\nduration. The Screening Across the Lifespan Twin\n(SALT) sample included 41,199 participants who participated in a telephone interview between 1998 and\n2002 that asked about status and duration of night\nThe primary outcome was all-cause dementia, and\ndementia diagnoses were obtained from Swedish national health registers. Investigators followed participants until the date of dementia diagnosis, death, or\nthe end of follow-up in 2015.\nA Dose-Response Relationship\nThe mean age at baseline was 38 in the STR-1973 cohort\nand 58 in the SALT cohort. Median follow-up time was\n41 years in the STR-73 cohort and 14 years in the SALT\ncohort. The proportion of participants with shift work\nhistory was 17% in the STR-1973 cohort. The proportion of people who worked nights was 30% in the SALT\ncohort. Dementia incidence was 7.4% in the STR-1973\ncohort and 5.0% in the SALT cohort.\nThe researchers used Cox proportional hazard models to analyze the data and adjust for age, sex, education,\ncardiovascular disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Having shift work versus day work was associated with an\nincreased hazard of dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40),\nas was having night work versus day work (HR, 1. 13).\nSpline models indicated modest dose-response relationships in which longer duration of shift work and night\nwork predicted greater dementia risk.\nInformation about APOE e4 genotype was available for\nsubsamples of both cohorts. APOE e4 seemed to be an effect\nmodifier for the association of night work and dementia, but\nnot for that of shift work and dementia. APOE e4 carriers\nwith 20 or more years of shift work had a fourfold increased\nrisk of dementia. APOE e4 carriers with 20 or more years of\nnight work had a twofold increased risk of dementia. The\nsample sizes were small, however, and “it is possible that\nthese findings are spurious,” said Ms. Bokenberger.\n“Individuals in the labor force might consider minimizing shift work exposure or managing work scheduling practices, but this is dependent on individual differences and tolerances to certain types of shift work,”\nshe concluded.

54	How long does the Rothwell fair last?	According to the Proclamation, the fair begins on Monday after the feast of the Holy Trinity and continues for five days. During this time, people are allowed to buy and sell cattle, merchandise, and other saleable wares.	['If you want quaint, weird, or just downright crazy customs, look no further than England. From Cheese Rolling to Worm Charming to Bog Snorkelling (okay, technically bog snorkelling is in Wales). And although I’m not a local, the town where I live has its own: The Proclamation.\nI won’t go into the history of it all, other than to say in 1204, the Charter of King John confirmed the town now known as Rothwell (or Rowell, to locals) the right to host a market and fair. Yes, that’s right, a little over 800 years ago.\nSo, what’s the Proclamation? Well, basically it’s a pub crawl and organised street wrestling – that all kicks off at 6:00am!\nHere’s how the Rowell Fair Society describe it:\nThe Proclamation Ceremony begins at the stroke of six o’clock in the morning outside the west door of the Church on the Monday after the Feast of the Holy Trinity (known locally as Rowell Fair Monday). After this reading, the Bailiff rides on horseback accompanied by a bodyguard of halberdiers and the Rowell Fair Society Band and the Charter is read at all the public houses, or sites of those now closed, in the town.\nAfter each reading, a hearty cheer is given for “God save the Queen and the Lord of the Manor” and the National Anthem is played. The party is then presented with drinks from the landlords which include the traditional Rowell Fair rum and milk for the Bailiff, a drink designed to keep the early morning chill away, with beers for the halberdiers and the band.\nAfter some good humoured horseplay, where the local youths try to disarm the halberdiers, the procession moves onto the next hostelry where the ceremony is repeated.\nSo here’s the Proclamation being read by Alan Mills, Bailiff to the Lord of the Manor.\nThat was outside the Blue Bell pub, so about the sixth reading (and sixth rum and milk). Oh, and the ‘good humoured horseplay’ that happens after each reading? Here it is:\nThe police actually just observe to make sure everything is good natured and doesn’t get out of hand. They also hang around all day, as the pubs, which all open at 6:00am, stay open until 11:00pm.\nHundreds of people get out of bed early to watch the ceremony (and join in if they’re feeling boisterous). Here are a few photos, the first two historic photos courtesy of the Rowell Fair Society, and the remaining from this year’s Proclamation.\nAnd if you didn’t catch all of the words, here’s the Proclamation, as read today:\nWhereas heretofore, his late Majesty King James the first and his progenitors, Lords of the Manor of Rowell had, and used to have, one fair in the year, to be holden within the said Manor, which said fair is now by good and lawful means come to Zandra Maunsell Powell.\nShe, the said Zandra Maunsell Powell, doth by these presents notify and declare, that the said fair shall begin this Monday after the feast of the Holy Trinity, and so to continue for the space of five days next, after the holding and keeping of it, and no longer, during which time it shall be lawful for all Her Majesty’s subjects to come , to go, to buy and to sell all manner of cattle, merchandise and other stuff being saleable ware and allowed to be bought and sold by the laws of this Kingdom.\nNo toll for cattle, stakes for horses, sheep-pens, shows and stalls are charged for as heretofore. And she further chargeth and commandeth all manner of persons within the liberties of the said fair to keep the Queen’s peace in all things upon such penalties as the laws and statutes of this Kingdom are provided.\nGod Save the Queen and the Lord of the Manor!']	['<urn:uuid:3dbf869f-2bbb-4c05-88c3-d5a142f0e53c>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	7	37	639
55	indoor vs outdoor play activities which better physical development preschool children compare benefits	Based on comparing indoor and outdoor play, outdoor play provides better physical development benefits for preschool children. While indoor play can promote creativity, outdoor activities lead to superior physical growth, better motor coordination, and enhanced gross motor skills like skipping and throwing balls. The recommended guideline is 120 minutes of physical activity daily, including running, jumping, and hopping for bone and muscle strengthening. However, studies show only 3 in 10 children in full-day child care get adequate outdoor time.	['Is there anything more fun in the world than playing? Pure, child-like freedom, where anything is possible and anything goes.\nFresh air and exercise may be going by the wayside for little ones, suggests a new study that found preschoolers in child care centers often don’t get enough outdoor play time. Recent studies also tell us why only indoor play is detrimental to children’s growth.\nResearchers who studied more than 380 children, ages 3 to 6, who were enrolled at 30 different child care centers published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, showed that only 3 in 10 children in full-day child care programs got at least 60 minutes of outdoor recess. This implies that nearly two thirds had either very less or no time outdoors at all.\nBetter learners: Outdoors, a child learns on multiple levels with each new adventure. With all of the imaginary castles, lands, creatures, the brain develops at a much faster rate than for those who play indoors. There are numerous effects.\nMore social: Not only do they become better learners, and do well in school, but they are more fun to be around (i.e. they make more friends)–and play have active imagination! Consequently, children will be much happier because, hey, they’re smart and they have a lot of friends.\nPhysical growth: Not only are there mental advantages to playing outside, there are even more physical advantages. Obviously, if a child is playing outside he/she will be way more active than the child that stays indoors. The great thing about this is that it can have long-lasting effects. If you think about this, it makes perfect sense; teach a child when they’re young to love the outdoors and they will love it forever.\nNow here’s what the experts say about the disadvantages of indoor play. Researchers have found a disorder called “Nature Deficit Disorder”. Basically, this means that not playing outdoors and with nature (e.g. hiking or camping) is really detrimental for kids. They found that children who lived closer to nature and had more opportunities to be in the natural world were less stressed out with.\nThey also found that children who had a more natural day-care setting had better motor coordination and could better concentrate/pay attention, back to what we were talking about up top.\nIndoor Vs Outdoor: Now right about here some people may argue for indoor play. Doesn’t indoor play promote creativity, lesser risk of injuries, lower risks of exposure to dust etc? Well, yes. But children are missing connecting to nature, the freedom to invent games themselves and interact freely with others.\nSome parents may feel that outdoor time takes away from “learning.” But children learn through physical activity, too. Based on previous research, we know that gross motor skills are so important. Kids this age are learning to skip, throw a ball. Those gross motor skills are a really important part of growing up, of their development — just as important as learning their letters and learning about math.\nNow some people may be wondering why parents let their kids stay indoors if playing outside is so much better. Some parents are worried about picking up germs outside. Oddly enough, research shows that the air indoors is actually more likely to promote asthma than being outside (Epstein, 2001). For families who live in big cities, it does not seem like there is a choice because parents fear for their kids’ safety. This has become such an issue that the current generation is used to being watched constantly, unlike prior generations.\nOutdoor activities are fun and very helpful for children’s development. Indoor activities, though they may be fun, can be detrimental because they do not promote adequate physical and mental growth.\nWhat happens in child care centers has important and lasting effects for children’s total daily levels of activity. The recommended guideline for preschoolers is 120 minutes of physical activity daily.\nMajority of preschoolers spend time in day care centers. Playing outside is especially important for children who don’t have active-time at home.', 'Skills for Children Entering Kindergarten\nPlay is an important part of learning.\nYour child learns best when he or she is spending time with you and doing activities that are interesting and fun.\nPractice these skills at home with your child. If an activity is difficult, provide opportunities to practice in many short sessions to decrease frustration. Every child learns at his or her own rate. Providing multiple opportunities to learn and practice these skills is important.\nThe Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend a minimum of 60-120 minutes total each day of exercise for children. Exercise time should include some activities that are a moderate to vigorous intensity level including running, jumping, hopping, etc. for bone and muscle strengthening.\nGross Motor Skills\nUnstructured activities are child directed and may include:\n- exploring play with balls\n- riding a tricycle and scooter and using hippity-hop\n- chasing and popping bubbles\n- exploring play with a large box\n- using toys that encourage independent movement\nStructured activities are planned and guided by an adult and may include:\n- activities with songs such as Ring Around the Rosy, Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes\n- chase games or freeze dance to music\n- obstacle courses that include movement in different positions for example belly or army crawl, crawling, knee walking\n- create a parade with different movements including marching, jumping, hopping, galloping, jumping in/out/over objects low to the ground such as a hula hoop or yardstick\n- animal walks including frog jumps, bear walk (hands and feet on the floor with stomach towards floor), crab walk (hands and feet on floor with stomach toward ceiling), pretend to be a dog or cat, scurry like a mouse (walk on tiptoes), hold child’s legs and have them wheelbarrow walk on their hands\n- balance activities such as stand on 1 foot and count seeing who can stand the longest, stand on 1 foot with arms in different positions, hold animal positions for as long as possible, walk on a line or beam\n- ball activities can include throwing rolled socks (fit a child’s hand size), throwing and catching small foam balls, bean bags, and playground balls, kicking balls of various sizes\n- play games such as red light/green light or Simon Says\n- practice put on, take off, and zip coat independently\n- expose to tying shoes\n- carry heavy objects or bags of groceries\n- yoga poses (google “yoga poses for children” for examples of poses and pictures/videos)\n- See list of Community Resources for other activities\nFine Motor Skills\n- practice writing/drawing with a variety of utensils including chalk, markers, crayons, paint brushes on flat and vertical surfaces.

PowerGen-ABM integrates three approaches: techno-economic analysis (TEA), linear programming (LP), and input-output analysis (IOA) and environmental analysis. TEA is based on the revenue requirement (RR) formula by UCDavis (2016), and the environmental analysis accounts for resource consumption (i.e., steel, concrete, aluminium, and energy) and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions during the construction and operational stages of power plants.\nReconstruction of the original code M. Cohen, J. March, and J. Olsen garbage can model, realized by means of Microsoft Office Excel 2010\nThe purpose of the simulation was to explore and better understand the process of bridging between an analysis of qualitative data and the specification of a simulation. This may be developed for more serious processes later but at the moment it is merely an illustration.\nThis exercise was done by Stephanie Dornschneider (School of Politics and International Relations, University College Dublin) and Bruce Edmonds to inform the discussion at the Lorentz workshop on “Integrating Qualitative and Quantitative Data using Social Simulation” at Leiden in April 2019. The qualitative data was collected and analysed by SD. The model specification was developed as the result of discussion by BE & SD. The model was programmed by BE. This is described in a paper submitted to Social Simulation 2019 and (to some extent) in the slides presented at the workshop.\nThis agent-based model investigates group longevity in a population in a foundational way, using theory on social relations and culture. It is the first application of the GRASP meta-model for social agents, containing elements of Groups, Rituals, Affiliation, Status, and Power. It can be considered an exercise in artificial sociality: a culture-general, content-free base-line trust model from which to engage in more specific studies. Depending on cultural settings for individualism and power distance, as well as settings for xenophobia and for the increase of trust over group life, the GRASP world model generates a variety of patters. Number of groups ranges from one to many, composition from random to segregated, and pattern genesis from rapid to many hundreds of time steps. This makes GRASP world an instrument that plausibly models some basic elements of social structure in different societies.\nThe computer model simulates the development of a social network (i.e. formation of friendships and cliques), the (dyadic) interactions between pupils and the development of similarities and differences in their behavioral profiles.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first agent-based simulation of continuous-time PGGs (where participants can change contributions at any time) which are much harder to realise within both laboratory and simulation environments.\nWork related to this simulation has been published in the following journal article:\nVu, Tuong Manh, Wagner, Christian and Siebers, Peer-Olaf (2019) ‘ABOOMS: Overcoming the Hurdles of Continuous-Time Public Goods Games with a Simulation-Based Approach’ Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation 22 (2) 7 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/22/2/7.html. doi: 10.18564/jasss.3995\nRHEA aims to provide a methodological platform to simulate the aggregated impact of households’ residential location choice and dynamic risk perceptions in response to flooding on urban land markets. It integrates adaptive behaviour into the spatial landscape using behavioural theories and empirical data sources. The platform can be used to assess: how changes in households’ preferences or risk perceptions capitalize in property values, how price dynamics in the housing market affect spatial demographics in hazard-prone urban areas, how structural non-marginal shifts in land markets emerge from the bottom up, and how economic land use systems react to climate change. RHEA allows direct modelling of interactions of many heterogeneous agents in a land market over a heterogeneous spatial landscape. As other ABMs of markets it helps to understand how aggregated patterns and economic indices result from many individual interactions of economic agents.\nThe model could be used by scientists to explore the impact of climate change and increased flood risk on urban resilience, and the effect of various behavioural assumptions on the choices that people make in response to flood risk. It can be used by policy-makers to explore the aggregated impact of climate adaptation policies aimed at minimizing flood damages and the social costs of flood risk.\nThis Bicycle encounter model builds on the Salzburg Bicycle model (Wallentin & Loidl, 2015). It simulates cyclist flows and encounters, which are locations of potential accidents between cyclists.\nThe model simulates flood damages and its propagation through a cooperative, productive, farming system, characterized as a star-type network, where all elements in the system are connected one to each other through a central element.']	['<urn:uuid:96def5bf-8588-4e31-a430-6fa38743e823>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	6	76	981
57	I enjoy exercising outdoors but with this heat wave coming, I'm worried about safety. What precautions should I take and what's the best time to exercise outside?	For safe outdoor exercise during a heat wave, you should schedule your activities during the coolest part of the day, which is early morning before 7 a.m. Avoid strenuous activities during peak sunlight hours, especially between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. When exercising outdoors, wear loose-fitting, lightweight, and light-colored clothing, and cover as much skin as possible with sunscreen of at least SPF 15. It's crucial to drink at least two to four glasses of water per hour during extreme heat, even if you don't feel thirsty, but avoid beverages containing alcohol or caffeine. Watch for signs of heat exhaustion, including headache, light-headedness, muscle cramps, nausea, and vomiting. If you experience these symptoms, call 911 immediately. Remember that heat is the number one weather-related killer in the United States, so it's essential to take these precautions seriously.	"['The Advance Warning System (AWS) disseminates information to people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs through their service providers. Please share the important information below with your clients and other agencies or individuals to empower them to make informed decisions.\nJune 21, 2021 — To mark the first day of summer, the New York City Emergency Management Department and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene encourage New Yorkers to beat the heat by knowing the hazards they may face, having a plan to stay safe, and keeping informed.\nThe City is prioritizing the most heat-burdened communities ― including those outlined in the NYC Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) ― for new public cooling elements and refining existing programs to serve more residents during extreme heat events. Older adults are more likely than younger New Yorkers to experience adverse effects from extreme heat. In addition, as people get older, their ability to maintain a safe body temperature declines — resulting in an increased risk for heat-related illness. New York City urges residents to take steps to protect themselves and help others who may be at increased risk from the heat, including vulnerable individuals such as seniors and those with chronic health problems.\nVisit the NYC Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) to understand how health risks during and immediately after extreme heat events compare across NYC neighborhoods, and how the HVI helps the City identify and direct resources to neighborhoods at higher risk during extreme heat.\n“Extreme heat is dangerous, especially for vulnerable populations like older adults or people with chronic medical conditions. New York City is taking a number of steps to provide heat relief to New Yorkers including, but not limited to the opening of cooling centers during heat activations,” said New York City Emergency Management Commissioner John Scrivani. “We want to remind New Yorkers of the dangers associated with hot temperatures and inform them of the steps they can take to beat the heat.”\n“While we all enjoy warm weather, the risk of heat-related illness and death increases, especially for those who don’t have air conditioning in the home or a place to go to cool down,” said Health Commissioner Dr. Dave A. Chokshi. “As more New Yorkers become fully vaccinated, we can once again remind our neighbors, friends, and family members to ‘Be a Buddy’ and check in on those who might be vulnerable and without air conditioning.”\nFor those who do not have an air conditioner, call the Human Resources Administration at 1-800-692-0557 or 311 to find out whether they qualify for a free air conditioner through the New York State Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP). Since last year, New Yorkers living in public housing or receiving housing benefits may qualify.\nIn addition, during periods of extreme heat, the City opens cooling centers. NYC Emergency Management activates the Cooling Center Finder when the National Weather Service issues a heat advisory, with a forecasted heat index of at least 95°F for two or more days or 100°F for any period. When the Cooling Center Finder is active, you can find your nearest cooling center by calling 311 or visiting nyc.gov/beattheheat.\nCOOLING ELEMENTS & COOL IT! NYC MAP\nTo help New Yorkers stay cool, last summer, NYC Parks added brand new cooling elements within heat-burdened communities, and highlighted the existing 950 cooling elements citywide with a new Cool It! NYC map. NYC Parks identified locations where up to 250 new outdoor cooling elements can be added to parks during extreme heat events to create ""community oases."" These elements consist of NYC Park\'s hydrants and other plumbing fixtures that can be adapted to function as spray showers and misting features. By utilizing the map, visitors will be able to find up-to-date information on the closest sprinklers and water fountains in their neighborhood, and with the Leafiest Blocks and Park Tree Canopy categories, easily find NYC Parks\' recommendations for blocks and areas with the most shade to help stay cool this summer.\nAs cooling elements go online, the Cool It! NYC map will be updated in the coming weeks and activated as necessary during extreme heat events.\nCHECK ON THOSE MOST AT-RISK DURING EXTREME HEAT\n- Encourage family, friends, and neighbors who are older or who have heart, kidney or lung disease or other health conditions, serious mental illness, or struggle with substance abuse to use air conditioning. Check on them during heat waves or extreme heat, and help them get to an air-conditioned place if they cannot stay cool at home. During extreme heat, NYC opens cooling centers throughout the five boroughs where New Yorkers can go to cool off.\n- If they do not have air conditioners, encourage family, friends, and neighbors at risk for heat-related illness to find out whether they qualify for a free air conditioner through the New York State Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) by calling the Human Resources Administration at 1-800-692-0557 or 311.\nDuring extreme heat, the Department of Social Services (DSS) issues a Code Red Alert. During Code Reds, shelter is available to anyone experiencing homelessness, where those experiencing heat-related discomfort can access designated cooling areas. DSS staff and the agency’s not-for-profit contracted outreach teams who engage with individuals experiencing homelessness 24/7/365 redouble their efforts during extreme heat, with a focus on connecting vulnerable unsheltered New Yorkers to services and shelter.\nADDITIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY TIPS FOR PROTECTION AGAINST THE HEAT\n- Go to an air-conditioned location, even if for a few hours.\n- Stay out of the sun and avoid extreme temperature changes.\n- Avoid strenuous activity, especially during the sun’s peak hours: 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. If you must do strenuous activity, do it during the coolest part of the day, which is usually in the morning between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m.\n- Remember: drink water, rest, and locate shade if you are working outdoors or if your work is strenuous. Drink water every 15 minutes even if you are not thirsty, rest in the shade, and watch out for others on your team. Your employer is required to provide water, rest, and shade when work is being done during extreme heat.\n- Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing when inside without air conditioning or outside.\n- Drink fluids, particularly water, even if you do not feel thirsty. Your body needs water to keep cool. Those on fluid-restricted diets or taking diuretics should first speak with their doctor, pharmacist, or other health care provider. Avoid beverages containing alcohol or caffeine.\n- Eat small, frequent meals.\n- Cool down with a cool bath or shower.\n- Participate in activities that will keep you cool, such as going to the movies, walking in an air-conditioned mall, or swimming at a pool or beach. The best thing anyone can do to stay safe in and around the water is to learn to swim. The NYC Parks Department has free swimming lessons for kids and adults. Visit here for more information on pool and water safety.\n- Make sure doors and windows have tight-fitting screens and, in apartments where children live, and window guards. Air conditioners in buildings more than six stories must be installed with brackets so they are secured and do not fall on someone below. Window guards can prevent children from falling out of a window and suffering serious injuries or even death. Screens keep mosquitoes that can spread West Nile Virus out of your home and keep cats from falling out of windows.\n- Never leave your children or pets in the vehicle, even for a few minutes.\nKNOW THE WARNING SIGNS OF HEAT ILLNESS\nCall 911 immediately if you or someone you know has:\n- Hot dry skin.\n- Trouble breathing.\n- Rapid heartbeat.\n- Confusion, disorientation, or dizziness.\n- Nausea and vomiting.\nIf you or someone you know feels weak or faint, go to a cool place and drink water. If there is no improvement, call a doctor or 911.\nKEEPING YOUR PETS SAFE\n- Avoid dehydration: Pets can dehydrate quickly, so give them plenty of fresh, clean water.\n- Walk your dog in the morning and evening: When the temperature is very high, do not let your dog linger on hot asphalt. Your pet’s body can heat up quickly, and sensitive paw pads can burn.\n- Know when your pet is in danger: Symptoms of overheating in pets include excessive panting or difficulty breathing, increased heart and respiratory rate, drooling, mild weakness, unresponsiveness, or even collapse.\nIMPROPER FIRE HYDRANT USE\nThe improper opening of fire hydrants wastes 1,000 gallons of water per minute, causes flooding on city streets, and lowers water pressure to dangerous levels, which hamper the ability of the Fire Department to fight fire safely and quickly.\nUse “spray caps” to reduce hydrant output to a safe 25 gallons per minute while still providing relief from the heat. To obtain a spray cap, an adult 18 years or older with proper identification can go to his or her local firehouse and request one.\nDuring periods of intense electrical usage, such as on hot, humid days, it is important to conserve energy as much as possible to avoid brownouts and other electrical disruptions. While diminishing your power usage may seem inconvenient, your cooperation will help to ensure that utility providers are able to provide uninterrupted electrical service to you and your neighbors, particularly those who use electric-powered medical equipment or are at risk of heat-related illness and death:\n- Set your air conditioner to 78°F or “low.”\n- Run appliances such as ovens, washing machines, dryers, and dishwashers in the early morning or late at night when it is cooler outside to reduce heat and moisture in your home.\n- Close doors to keep cool air in and hot air out when the air conditioner is running.\n- Keep shades, blinds, and curtains closed. About 40 percent of unwanted heat comes through windows.\n- Turn off air conditioners, lights, and other appliances when not at home, and use a timer or smart technology to turn on your air conditioner about a half-hour before arriving home. Keep air conditioner filters clean.\n- If you run a business, keep your door closed while the air conditioner is running.\n- Tell your utility provider if you or someone you know depend on medical equipment that requires electricity.\nFor more information, visit NYC.gov/beattheheat.

There is an Air Quality Health Advisory in effect for ground-level ozone today for the New York City Metro and Lower Hudson Valley regions as well. Governor Hochul encourages New Yorkers to stay safe and take precautions as this extreme heat will last through Thursday evening.\n“Dangerous heat conditions are expected to continue throughout the state today and I urge New Yorkers to prepare for hot and humid conditions with temperatures that will feel like they’re nearly 100 degrees,” Governor Hochul said. “My administration is closely monitoring the forecast and will provide support to any communities needing assistance. People across the state should take every opportunity they can to stay cool today and use extra caution if going outdoors.”\nNew York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services Commissioner Jackie Bray said, “The entire state will see extreme temperatures today and these conditions are dangerous for sensitive groups. Do what you can to stay cool today, and remember to look after your pets in this heat.”\nNew Yorkers are encouraged to monitor local weather forecasts for the most up-to-date information. For a complete listing of weather watches, warnings, advisories and latest forecasts, visit the National Weather Service website.\nSummer heat can lead to the formation of ground-level ozone. DEC and DOH issue Air Quality Health Advisories when DEC meteorologists predict levels of pollution, including ozone and fine particulate matter, are expected to exceed an Air Quality Index value of 100, when concentrations in outdoor air are expected to be unhealthy for sensitive groups. An advisory is in effect for ozone for the New York City Metro and Lower Hudson Valley regions today. More information about New York State Air Quality forecast is available here. To check current local air quality, go to www.airnow.gov.\nThe New York State Department of Health also reminds New Yorkers that heat is the number one weather-related killer in the United States. Heat-related deaths and illnesses are preventable, yet annually many people suffer from the effects of extreme heat. Some individuals are at a higher risk for heat-related illness than others. New Yorkers should learn the risk factors and symptoms of heat-related illness to protect themselves and those they love.\nSymptoms of heat stroke include:\n- Hot, dry, red skin\n- A rapid pulse\n- Rapid and shallow breathing\n- A body temperature higher than 105 degrees\n- Loss of alertness, confusion, and/or loss of consciousness\nYou can also find more information about where you can locate a Cooling Center near you and other helpful extreme heat-related advice, by visiting the New York State Department of Health\'s emergency weather webpage.\nA list of available State Parks swimming facilities is available here.\nNew York State Department of Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said, “Extreme heat can hinder the body’s ability to regulate temperature and cool itself down. The most common illnesses are heat stroke, heat exhaustion, and heat cramps. Older adults and children are especially susceptible, but we ask that everyone be on the lookout for signs and symptoms, and to take basic precautions to avoid such health issues when temperatures are dangerously high.”\nNew York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos said, “This week marked the hottest day on earth since record-keeping began, and extreme heat and other impacts of climate change like more severe storms and air pollution are negatively impacting New York’s communities to a greater degree than ever before. I applaud Governor Hochul for educating New Yorkers about how to prepare for extreme heat, protect their families, and stay safe and healthy. DEC will continue to work with our State, City, and community partners to develop strategies to address extreme heat today and into the future.”\nNew York State Department of Public Service CEO Rory M. Christian said, ""To help reduce the demand for electricity, it\'s important for the public and businesses to look for ways to lower their electricity usage. In addition, the public should look for ways to stay cool and hydrated. By taking action now, we can lower electricity usage during this heat wave while staying healthy and safe.""\nNew York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “As our state continues to endure record-setting temperatures, we must work to ensure that all New Yorkers remain safe and comfortable—particularly our underserved communities that are most vulnerable to extreme weather. With temperatures expected to exceed 100 degrees in many areas, we encourage everyone to take advantage of the State’s many resources for saving energy while staying cool.”\nNew York State Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Commissioner Erik Kulleseid said, “Pools, beaches and spraygrounds are fully open in New York\'s state parks for people looking to cool off during this extreme heat. While enjoying our various swimming areas, we urge all visitors to please keep safety in mind for yourself and your loved ones.""\nDivision of Homeland Security and Emergency Services\nThe New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services\' Emergency Operations Center is monitoring the weather forecast with a close eye on the heat index this week. DHSES is communicating with local emergency managers across the state and will coordinate any potential State agency response to aid local governments. The State\'s stockpiles are equipped to deploy resources, as needed, throughout impacted parts of the state.\nDepartment of Public Service\nThe New York State Department of Public Service (DPS) is tracking electric system conditions and overseeing utility response to any situations that may arise as a result of this week\'s extreme heat. New York\'s utilities have approximately 5,500 workers available as necessary to engage in damage assessment, response, repair, and restoration efforts across New York State for any weather-related impacts this week. Agency staff will track utilities\' work throughout the event and ensure utilities shift appropriate staffing to regions that experience the greatest impact.\nExcessive heat is the leading cause of preventable, weather-related deaths each year, particularly among the elderly. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heat causes more than 600 preventable deaths in the United States every year. To help New Yorkers stay safe during excessive heat, follow the below guidance and visit the DHSES Heat Safety Tips webpage.\nTaking precautions to avoid heat exhaustion is important, and this includes adjusting your schedule to avoid the outdoors during the hottest hours of the day and modifying your diet and water intake when possible.\n- Reduce strenuous activities and exercises, especially during peak sunlight hours.\n- Exercise should be conducted early in the morning, before 7 a.m.\n- Eat less protein and more fruits and vegetables. Protein produces and increases metabolic heat, which causes water loss. Eat small meals but eat more often. Do not eat salty foods.\n- Drink at least two to four glasses of water per hour during extreme heat, even if you do not feel thirsty. Avoid beverages containing alcohol or caffeine.\n- If possible, stay out of the sun and stay in air conditioning. The sun heats the inner core of your body, resulting in dehydration. If air conditioning is not available, stay on the lowest floor, out of the sunshine, or go to a public building with air conditioning\n- If you must go outdoors, wear sunscreen with a high sun protector factor rating (at least SPF 15) and a hat to protect your face and head.\n- When outdoors, wear loose-fitting, lightweight, and light-colored clothing. Cover as much skin as possible to avoid sunburn and over-warming effects of sunlight on your body.\n- Never leave children, pets or those who require special care in a parked vehicle, especially during periods of intense summer heat. Temperatures inside a closed vehicle can reach over 140 degrees Fahrenheit quickly. Exposure to such high temperatures can kill within a matter of minutes.\n- Try to check on your neighbors during a heat wave, especially if they are elderly, have young children or have individual needs. Make sure there is enough food and water for your pets.\n- Prolonged exposure to the heat can be harmful and potentially fatal. Call 911 if you or someone you know shows signs or symptoms of heat illness, including headache, light headedness, muscle cramps, nausea, and vomiting.\nTaking smart steps to reduce energy use, particularly during periods of peak demand, not only helps to lower the state\'s peak load but also saves consumers money when electricity is the most expensive. To reduce energy use, particularly during peak periods, the public is encouraged to take some of the following low- or no-cost energy saving measures:\n- Close drapes, windows, and doors on your home\'s sunny side to reduce solar heat buildup.\n- Turn off air conditioners, lights, and other appliances when not at home and use a timer to turn on your air conditioner about a half-hour before arriving home. Use advanced power strips to centrally ""turn off"" all appliances and save energy.\n- Fans can make rooms feel 10 degrees cooler and use 80 percent less energy than air conditioners.\n- If purchasing an air conditioner, look for an ENERGY STAR qualified model, which uses up to 25 percent less energy than a standard model.\n- Set your air conditioner at 78 degrees or higher to save on your cooling costs.\n- Place your air conditioner in a central window, rather than a corner window, to allow for better air movement.\n- Consider placing the unit on the north, east or the best-shaded side of your home. Your air conditioner will have to work harder and use more energy if it is exposed to direct sunlight.\n- Seal spaces around the air conditioner with caulking to prevent cool air from escaping.\n- Clean the cooling and condenser fans plus the coils to keep your air conditioner operating efficiently and check the filter every month and replace as needed.\n- Use appliances such as washing machines, dryers, dishwashers and ovens early in the morning or late at night. This will also help reduce humidity and heat in the home.\n- Use energy-efficient, ENERGY STAR qualified light bulbs instead of standard incandescent light bulbs, and you can use 75 percent less energy.\n- Microwave food when possible. Microwaves use approximately 50 percent less energy than conventional ovens.\n- Dry clothes on a clothesline. If using a clothes dryer, remember to clean the dryer\'s lint trap before every load.\n- Be mindful of the different ways you\'re consuming water throughout your home. Instead of using 30 to 40 gallons of water to take a bath, install a low-flow showerhead, which uses less than 3 gallons a minute.\n- Lowering the temperature setting on your wash machine and rinsing in cold water will reduce energy use.\nAdditional tips on how to conserve energy are available on NYSERDA\'s website here.\nSafety Tips for ALL Bodies of Water\n- Adult Supervision. This is the number one way to prevent drowning. Never leave a child unattended in or near water, and always designate a Water Watcher. This person should not be reading, texting, using a smartphone, drinking alcoholic beverages, or otherwise distracted.\n- Choose bright colors. Studies show the color of one\'s bathing suit can make a difference in visibility. Consider the color of your child\'s swimsuit before heading to a pool, beach or lake. For light-bottomed pools, neon pink and neon orange tend to be the most visible. For lakes and dark-bottomed pools, neon orange, neon green and neon yellow tend to be the most visible.\n- Identify swimmers in need of help. While we tend to think that swimmers in trouble will be waving their hands and making lots of noise, this may not always be the case. Watch out for people whose heads are low in the water (mouth submerged) or tilted back with mouth open, eyes closed or unable to focus, legs vertical in the water, or who are trying to swim but not making progress.\n- Swimming Lessons. Multiple studies show swimming lessons prevent drowning. Learn how to swim and teach your child how to swim.\nOpen Water Safety Tips\n- Wear Life Jackets. Put life jackets on kids anytime they are on a boat or participating in other open water recreational activities. Personal flotation devices should always be used for children that do not know how to swim. New York state law requires that children under 12 wear a Coast Guard-approved life vest on a boat or water vessel. For more information on proper life jackets, go to the United States Coast Guard site.\n- Choose a spot on the beach close to a lifeguard and swim only when a lifeguard is on duty.\n- Watch for warning flags and know what they mean. Green flags usually mark designated swimming areas - be sure to swim between the green flags. Yellow flags may denote a surfing beach or an advisory. Red flags indicate a danger or hazard, and no one should swim when they are shown. Flag designations may vary so be sure to understand the color coding before you dive in.\n- Watch out for rip currents. Rip currents are powerful currents moving away from shore. They tend to form near a shallow point in the water, such as a sandbar, or close to jetties and piers and can happen at any beach with breaking waves, including the Great Lakes! They are the number one hazard for beachgoers and can pull even the strongest swimmers out to sea. If you are caught in a rip current, try to remain calm and don\'t fight it. Swim parallel to the shore until you are out of the current, and float or tread water if you begin to tire. More from the National Weather Service: Break the Grip of the Rip!\n- Beware of large waves and strong surf. Ocean swimming is different from swimming in a calm pool or lake. Large waves can easily knock over an adult. Be prepared for strong surf as well as sudden drop-offs near the shore.\nPool Safety Tips\n- Put Up Barriers. Install appropriate safety barriers around in-home pools and spas. This includes fences, gates, door alarms and covers.\n- Pool Alarms. Install a pool alarm to detect and provide notification of unattended pool access.\n- Small Pools. Drain and put away smaller portable pools when not in use.\n- Cover Drains. Keep children away from pool drains, pipes, and other openings to avoid them getting stuck. Children\'s hair, limbs, jewelry or bathing suits can get stuck in a drain or suction opening. Also, ensure any pool and spa you use has drain covers that comply with federal safety standards, which include drain shape, drain cover size, and rate of water flow.

58	parking violations prevention smart technology automatic license plate recognition	Smart parking technology prevents violations through multiple methods: LPR systems match tickets with license plates at entry/exit points to prevent ticket swapping, smart parking apps help drivers find legitimate vacant spots to avoid illegal parking, and smart meters track parking duration and automatically issue tickets for violations through RFID communication with a central station.	['How Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) Works\nYou may not have realized it, but Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) technology is all around us. It is used for toll collecting, to control access to parking lots and even to capture criminals. The technology has improved over the years and has become more economical.\nBesides the analytic software that converts the image to computer characters, the system requires a good IP camera. It also requires proper lighting and the correct physical placement of the camera. The analytic conversion software is similar to optical character recognition (OCR) software. ALPR is available as a standalone LPR system or included as an option with some IP camera video management systems.\nHere are the details about how the license plate recognition system works.\nIP Cameras Capture the License Plate\nThe IP camera is a very important part of the ALPR system. It is critical that the camera provides the very best image. It has to have the right resolution, and be able to capture the license plate image day or night.\nDuring daytime, when there is enough light, most IP cameras will work, but at night the requirements are more challenging. If there isn’t standard lighting available, IR illumination can be added. This can be a separate light or provided by an IP camera that has a built-in IR illuminator. Many license plates have reflective paint that enhances the number when illuminated by IR. The camera should also support wide dynamic range (WDR) to handle the extreme lighting that may be present. If you would like to capture license plates from oncoming cars, then the IP camera needs the ability to block out headlight glare. For example, the Samsung X-series of IP cameras has Highlight Compensation (HLC) that blocks the glare from the headlights. Here’s an example:\nThe faster the vehicle moves the more challenging it is to capture and process the license plate images. The IP camera must have a fast frame rate and short shutter time to prevent image smear. The faster the vehicle moves, the shorter the shutter speed required. In many cases, a shutter speed of less than 1/1000 of a second is required to prevent blurring.\nThe camera should be positioned so the license plate is not viewed at an extreme angle. In most systems, the camera captures one lane at a time. The size of the car lane can determine the required camera resolution. The wider the field of view, the higher the resolution required.\nWe need enough resolution so that the license plate reader system can see the characters clearly. Many LPR systems will define the resolution required for their specific system to work reliability. This is usually defined by pixels across the license plate, pixels across a character, or pixels/ft.\nPeople can recognize a blurry character better than a computer. The computer requires more resolution than the human eye. How much resolution is required? For this analysis, it doesn’t matter how large or small the character is. The right resolution is determined by the number of pixels across a character. The camera’s field of view can be adjusted so that the pixels across the characters are correct.\nThe chart below shows the lettering used on the tail of an aircraft, and according to FAA regulations, is 12-inches high. The chart shows lettering displayed using 100 pixels high, 50 pixels high, 25 pixels high, 12 pixels high, and 6 pixels high resolution.\nAs you can see, the characters that are 12 pixels high are identifiable to a person, but the OCR algorithm requires more resolution. The software will be more reliable with characters defined by 25 vertical pixel resolution. Since these letters are 12 inches tall, we need 25 pixels/ft to read them correctly. We can use this information to determine the right camera resolution for reading license plates.\nA typical license plate in the US is 12-inches long. Each character is 2.5 inches high. Since we need 25 vertical pixels across the character, we need a camera that will provide 25 pixels / 2.5 inches or 10 pixels/inch.\nOnce we know the resolution across the license plate, we can calculate the resolution of the IP camera. Suppose we want to view a standard US highway. The width of a standard highway lane is 12 ft. (3.7 m). To calculate the total horizontal pictures required, we multiply 10 pixels/in. X 12 ft x 12in./ft = 1440 pixels. A 2-Megapixel camera provides 1920 x 1080 resolution, so this is more than adequate to cover the highway. It actually provides a maximum field of view of 16 ft.\nWe can also calculate the lens we should use. The lens will determine the distance from the camera. We use trigonometry to calculate the angle of the lens we need. Lenses for IP cameras are defined by their “mm” or angle, so it’s easy to select the right lens. For example, a camera with a 20-degree lens can be placed about 46 ft. away from the point where the camera reads the license plate. For more about selecting the right lens, read our article, Calculating What You Can See With Your Camera.\nLicense Plate Recognition Algorithms\nThe primary technology is optical character recognition (OCR). Before using the OCR function, there are a number of preprocessing functions used to prepare the image for OCR.\nPreprocessing of LPR Image\n- To improve successful recognition, there are several processes used:\n- Plate location – This process locates the license plate in the image\n- De-skew, orientation, and sizing – The camera can capture a plate at various distances and locations within the field of view. This process corrects the skew, location, and size.\n- Filtering – This filtering process removes small spots and anomalies.\n- Normalization – License plates can be different colors, brightness, and contrast. The process normalizes the image so it can be used by the OCR function.\n- Character Isolation – The process identifies and defines each individual character.\n- Pass the processed image to the OCR function\nThere are two types of algorithms used by OCR engines. The first technique matches the images. It stores all the pixels and matches the pattern of the image against stored images. The second method extracts features such as lines, curves, and intersects to create a match.\nIn all cases, the license plate image is converted to a coded computer character. This information can be compared to a database or just recorded for later use.\nALPR systems are used all over the world. The success of implementation in individual countries depends on the standardizations of the license plates used.\n- Parking entry control – A gate controlled by an ALPR system can be used to control access to a garage. A list of allowed tenants can be used to restrict parking lot usage.\n- Automated Parking Fee collection – Systems that use ALPR can be used to automatically collect the parking fee. This also requires a database of all people who can use the parking facility.\n- Electronic Toll Collection – The ALPR system is usually used as a backup to long range transponders that are in each vehicle. The database is provided by the government so that fees can be billed.\n- Housing Area Gate Control – This is similar to parking lot control. A gate is used to control access to a gated community, and automatically opened based on license plate match.\n- Stolen Car identification – A list of stolen vehicles can be provided by law enforcement and compared to vehicles on the road.\n- Locating Vehicles against watch lists – Locating a criminal, or tracking suspicious persons can be implemented using LPR.\n- Traffic enforcement – These systems can be used to capture the license plate of vehicles that go through a red light, or that are speeding.\nAutomated or automatic license plate recognition requires a good camera that is designed for the environment. It requires the right resolution based on the size of the lane. The software requires the image to be preprocessed so it can be used by the optical character recognition software. ALPR systems have become more reliable and are now included with some video management recording systems. These systems are also called Car Plate Recognition (CPR), Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI), or just License Plate Recognition (LPR).\nTo make sure you get the right system, please contact us at 800-431-1658 in the USA, or at 914-944-3425 everywhere else, or use our contact form.', 'How Smart Parking Tech Is Influencing Parking Innovations6 min readReading Time: 5 minutes\nTraffic congestion and inadequate parking spaces (or so we thought) were the key causes of driver frustration. Most motorists spent around 30 minutes looking for a vacant parking spot. To add insult to injury, traditional parking methods were just proving to be unsustainable and unreliable. And when around 30% of the traffic congestion on the streets was caused by drivers hunting for a parking space, the need for smart solutions was dire. Read how smart parking tech is influencing parking innovations.\nEnter smart parking technology – the clever approach to parking that dealt with the root of the matter. Where earlier methods of curbing the problem primarily focused on creating more parking spaces, smart parking took a completely different approach – making it easier for motorists to get in and out of parking spots, be it through smart parking meters, smart parking apps, automated technology or LPR technology. Moreover, smart parking technology also helped in reducing parking violations.\nSmart Parking Meters\nThere was a time when motorists had to park on leftover time, feed in the standard parking meters after expiration, thereby clogging the parking spaces. Owing to the limitations of mechanical parking meters and the inconveniences motorists have to deal with, several cities are opting for what is called “smart parking meters”. These electronic meters, though similar in appearance to their mechanical counterparts, operate using a different mechanism. Where the standard meters ran on a wind-up motor, smart parking meters contain two lithium-powered computer chips and a microprocessor having an infrared sensor.\nSmart parking meters are capable of keeping track of the exact number of vehicles that are parked in the space, display the duration for which a car has been lodged in a particular parking space, track coins, and most importantly, do not allow motorists to park beyond the expiration time. Not only this, smart parking meters can even track parking patterns. Meaning, they record the vacancy and occupancy times, and the revenue generated. This stored information can then be extracted using a hand-held remote device and can be used to determine the average parking activity on a weekly or monthly basis – how many vehicles were parked in a space, the revenue generated, and how many vehicles exceeded their allocation time limit.\nWell, even motorists have a lot to benefit from smart parking meters – sponsored meter time extension. Yes, the recent innovations in smart parking meters are making it possible for motorists to extend their parking time limit with the help of smart parking meter apps. A driver can easily get himself an extension of say 15 minutes just so he does not have to deal with the hassle of a parking ticket. So, smart parking meters can be made “friendly” by allowing motorists to have a “grace period”.\nMoreover, these meters even contain RFID tags having information such as vehicle identification. These tags also contain a central control station communication feature using which contact with a network of meters can be established. The RF reader will scan the RF tag of a vehicle and send this information to the central station where it can be determined whether or not the vehicle has been legally parked. And in case of a violation, the station will relay the same to the parking meter which will then automatically issue a parking ticket.\nSmart Parking Apps\nParking violations happen every now and then. But the first step towards change is always addressing the root of the issue. And in this case, as has often been found, most parking violations are simply the result of being unable to find a vacant parking spot. This tempts motorists to park along the road, at No Parking or Handicap-Only parking zones, just to end up with a parking ticket later. Smart parking apps can address the root of the issue by helping drivers locate vacant parking spots and directing them towards it.\nAnd by doing this, smart parking apps also save drivers the hassle of having to circle around the block in search of vacant parking spots. It gives them clear details of whether or not a parking spot is vacant, the tariff, the distance, and directs them towards it as well. And with saved time for individual motorists also comes the benefit of reduced traffic congestion and reduced environmental pollution. We can say that this smart parking tech is influencing parking innovations.\nMuch like the sci-fi movies, robotic valet parking facilities are here and they are transforming the way people park one valet parking facility at a time. How this works is people simply need to drop their vehicles off at the entrance of the car park. The system will detect the vehicle, slide under it, and gently lift it by the wheels and take it to the respective storage area.\nThese robots leverage the same technology that is found in self-driving cars and hence do not need human help to park and pick the cars. Such automated valet parking lots are especially useful in airports where passengers can easily arrive in their personal vehicles, drop their vehicles off where they will remain safe for the duration of the trip, and later, simply pick them up upon landing.\nSince the passengers’ itineraries will be loaded onto the system, the robotic arms will give their vehicles back once they reach the entrance of the car park. Stanley Robotics is one such example, deploying robotic valets at one of France’s busiest airports – Lyon-Saint Exupery Airport.\nLicense Plate Recognition (LPR)\nLicense Plate Recognition (LPR), also known as Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) allows for car park management the smart way. The system of License Plate Recognition works using image-processing technology in which an image of the front and the rear of the vehicle is taken using illumination and an infrared camera. Then, image-processing software extracts the license plate number after analysis.\nThis smart parking technology can be effectively used to prevent ticket swapping and cars from being stolen. As tickets and license plates need to match at the points of entry and exit, it becomes nearly impossible to commit fraudulent acts. Moreover, even in case of lost tickets, the license plate number can be used to determine the entry time and issue a new ticket.\nThe LPR technology works especially well in case of contract parking where motorists can seamlessly enter and egress a car park without any titles but their license plate numbers. Moreover, using LPR, motorists can even enter a parking space with a pre-paid ticket. Meaning, drivers can book a parking space in advance by entering their license plate number on the smart parking app and make cashless payments. Upon reaching the parking spot, the license plate number can be scanned and identified to grant access.\nSmart parking technology is a hard nut to crack, but inside lies the sweet kernel of hassle-free driver experience, reduced traffic congestion and parking violations, and enhanced environment conservation. So by now, you must have understood how the smart parking tech is influencing parking innovations.']	['<urn:uuid:3414906f-773c-4964-8b6e-2f9ca041f703>', '<urn:uuid:95ed35fc-f608-4b07-a2ab-998a1cfe94d0>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	9	54	2598
59	laptop cpu performance vs temperature risks	CPU performance and temperature are closely related. Modern CPUs can operate at maximum performance using Intel Turbo Boost Technology, which allows cores to temporarily run at higher clock frequencies. However, this can lead to heating issues, especially in laptops. While Clear Linux OS prioritizes maximum CPU performance by default, excessive heat can cause internal damage to components like motherboard sockets and hard drives. To prevent overheating, laptops typically use thermal management tools like thermald, which can force CPU sleep cycles and adjust cooling methods. Additionally, proper ventilation and cabinet spacing are crucial, as is regular cleaning of fans and vents to maintain airflow.	['CPU Power and Performance¶\nThis guide explains the CPU power and performance mechanisms in Clear Linux* OS.\nModern x86 CPUs employ a number of features to balance performance, energy, and thermal efficiency.\nBy default, Clear Linux OS prioritizes maximum CPU performance, assuming that the faster the program finishes execution, the faster the CPU can return to a low energy idle state. It is important to understand and evaluate the impact of each feature when troubleshooting or considering changing the defaults.\nC-states and P-states are both CPU power saving mechanisms that are entered under different operating conditions. The tradeoff is a slightly longer time to exit these states when the CPU is needed.\nC-states (idle states)¶\nHardware enters a C-state when the CPU is idle and not executing instructions. C-states decrease power utilization by reducing clock frequency, voltages, and features in each state. Although C-states can typically be limited or disabled in a system’s UEFI or BIOS configuration, these settings are overridden when the intel_idle driver is in use.\nTo view the current\ncpuidle driver run this command in a terminal:\nFor troubleshooting, C-states can be limited with a kernel command line boot parameter by adding processor.max_cstate=N intel_idle.max_cstate=N or completely disabled with idle=poll.\nprocessor.max_cstate=0 is changed to a valid value by the kernel: processor.max_cstate=1.\nintel_idle.max_cstate=0 disables the Intel Idle driver rather than set it to C-state 0.\nP-states (performance states)¶\nThe CPU can enter a P-state, also known as Intel SpeedStep® technology on Intel processors or AMD* Cool’n’Quiet* technology, while it is active and executing instructions. P-states reduce power utilization by adjusting CPU clock frequency and voltages based on CPU demand. P-states can typically be limited or disabled in a system’s firmware (UEFI/BIOS).\nIntel® Turbo Boost Technology, found on some modern Intel CPUs, allows cores on a processor to temporarily operate at a higher than rated CPU clock frequency to accommodate demanding workloads if the CPU is under defined power and thermal thresholds. Intel Turbo Boost Technology is an extension of P-states, so it can be impacted by limiting C-states or P-states.\nIntel Turbo Boost Technology can be disabled in a system’s UEFI/BIOS or in Clear Linux OS:\necho 1 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo\nLinux uses the Intel P-state driver, intel_pstate, for modern Intel processors from the Sandy Bridge generation or newer. Other processors may default to the acpi-cpufreq driver which reads values from the systems UEFI or BIOS.\nTo view the current CPU frequency scaling driver, run this command in a terminal:\nClear Linux OS sets the CPU governor to\nperformance which calls for the CPU to\noperate at maximum clock frequency. In other words, P-state P0. While this may\nsound wasteful at first, it is important to remember that power utilization\ndoes not increase significantly simply because of a locked clock frequency\nwithout a workload.\nTo view the current CPU frequency scaling governor, run this command in a terminal:\nEach core will report its own status. Your output should look similar to this example with four cores:\nperformance performance performance performance\nThe list of all governors can be found in the Linux kernel documentation on CPUFreq Governors.\nThe intel_pstate driver only supports performance and powersave governors.\nThere are 2 ways to change the CPU frequency scaling governor:\nDisable Clear Linux OS enforcement of certain power and performance settings:\nsudo systemctl mask clr-power.timer\nChange the governor value in\n/sys/devices. In the example below, the governor is set to performance:\necho performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor\nthermald is a Linux thermal management daemon used to prevent platforms from overheating. thermald forces a C-state by inserting CPU sleep cycles and adjusting any available cooling methods. This can be especially desirable for laptops.\nthermald is disabled by default in Clear Linux OS and starts automatically if it detects battery power. Enable thermald manually by using the systemd service by running the command:\nsudo systemctl enable --now thermald\nFor more information, see the thermald man page:\nThermalMonitor is a GUI application that can visually graph and log temperatures from thermald. To use ThermalMonitor, add the desktop-apps-extras bundle and add your user account to the power group:\nsudo swupd bundle-add desktop-apps-extras sudo usermod -a -G power <USER> ThermalMonitor\nAfter adding a new group, you must log out and log back in for the new group to take effect.\nEnhanced thermal configuration¶\nBetter thermal control and performance can be achieved by providing platform specific configuration to thermald.\nLinux DPTF Extract Utility is a companion tool to thermald,\nThis tool uses Intel® Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework (Intel® DPTF)\ntechnology and can convert to the\nthermal_conf.xml configuration format\nused by thermald. Closed-source projects, like this one, cannot be\npackaged as a bundle in Clear Linux OS, so you must install it manually:\nMake sure your machine’s BIOS has DPTF feature and is enabled. It will usually be in the Advanced or Advanced>Power section of the BIOS.\nIntel DPTF requires BIOS support and is typically only available on laptops.\nGenerate thermal configuration. thermald configuration files will be generated and saved to\nsudo swupd bundle-add acpica-unix2 # install acpi tools git clone https://github.com/intel/dptfxtract.git cd dptfxtract sudo acpidump > acpi.out acpixtract -a acpi.out sudo ./dptfxtract *.dat\nRestart thermald service to take effect.\nsudo systemctl restart thermald.service\nCheck whether the configuration is in use.\nsudo systemctl status thermald.service\nThe following output means the configuration has already been applied:\nthermald[*]: [WARN]Using generated /etc/thermald/thermal-conf.xml.auto\nIntel® Turbo Boost Technology requires a PC with a processor with Intel Turbo Boost Technology capability. Intel Turbo Boost Technology performance varies depending on hardware, software and overall system configuration. Check with your PC manufacturer on whether your system delivers Intel Turbo Boost Technology.

It has led to the processor becoming smaller in size and higher in performance. But the only downfall to the increasing performance in the hardware is the increased heating issue. No matter what kind of processor or system you use, it will always generate heat and it will increase as the performance and pressure on the processor increases.\nThe same can also be observed on smartphones as well, which does get heated up when used for gaming or heavy work. That is the time when users normally use a GPU temp monitor, to check the current temperature and make sure that the temperature is within range. The main reason for increased temperature in a system is due to high performance and multiple tasks running at once.\nEspecially if you have a gaming system, you will have a heating issue, which is normally controlled using a thermal paste, heat sink, or fans and liquid cooling in high-end PC’s. When a PC is built for video editing, gaming, and other heavy work, it causes overheating in the processors. The issue is now controlled in a much better way in the latest processors but was a major issue a decade ago.\nAs a gamer or someone who uses a PC for the heavier tasks, it is very important for the user to keep a constant eye on the temperature to make sure that the PC does not suffer any kind of internal damage. If you allow overheating the GPU and CPU, it could also lead to damage in motherboard sockets and even crash the harddrive. It is why we have prepared a list of best tools that one can use to monitor the temperature of the GPU and make sure that the PC/Laptop is running without any hiccups.\nBelow are the Methods to Check the Temperature of Your GPU & CPU\nUsing the Bios\nWhen you want to check GPU temp and are looking for tools to download from the internet, the first option for you should be to check the temperature in BIOS. BIOS is the main program on the computer which helps to boot the computer properly using the harddrive. That is not the only thing it does but it also helps one to monitor the temperature of the GPU. Since the GPU is connected to the motherboard using a dedicated slot. It is used to monitor the health of the graphic card, measure its fan speed, and also the temperature.\nOne simply has to restart the computer and has to press the Delete or any other dedicated button immediately to open the BIOS settings. BIOS setting is very straightforward and will help you to access all the basic functions on the motherboard and processor. There you can get the accurate temperature reading for both the GPU and CPU as well with the fan speeds. The only major disadvantage to the tool is that it needs a regular restart of the PC, which might not be a feasible option to try.\nUtility Software for Graphic Card\nNo matter which graphic card you buy and install on your PC, you are sure to get the graphic card utility software with it. Be it a graphic card from Nvidia or AMD Radeon, you will have to install their software, which comes in a CD or can be downloaded online. The utility software does multiple things at once.\nIt allows you to check the fan speed and temperature of the GPU, helps you to customize the screen setting connected to the GPU, provides constant upgrades and updates for the graphic card, and lets you know about any kind of issue that is automatically detected.\nHowever, make sure to go through online tutorials of the utility program to make sure that you are using it properly. Tutorials for the same are easily available on the company website.\nGPU and CPU Monitoring Software\nApart from the utilities that you might find with your graphic card, there are many third-party apps on the internet that you can download and install on your PC. This software will not only tell you about how to check GPU temp but will provide you with details like real-time fan speed and all the information about the entire hardware setup of your system.\nSoftwares like OpenHardwareMonitor and CPU are some of the most popular and dependable software for the same. This software can easily provide the details about the motherboard and processor configuration, along with the details about CPU and GPU temperature.\nyou can also get the information about the voltage, the number of processes currently running, and how multiple cores on the CPU are reacting individually. You can also see the RPM speed for every fan that is running in the system.\nTemperature Monitoring Tool on Windows\nIf you are not comfortable with downloading software from the internet which acts as a GPU temperature monitor, then you can also use the Windows own tool that they added to Windows operating system in Windows 10 May 2020 Update.\nThe tool to monitor GPU temp has been added by Microsoft to give you accurate data about what the current temperature of the GPU is. You simply have to visit the Task Manager by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc, by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Delete and selecting “Task Manager”, or by right-clicking on the Windows Start menu icon and selecting “Task Manager”.\nOnce there, simply go to the Performance tab and look for GPU temperature in the GPU section. The feature is fairly new in Windows and does not require the users to download the software for the same from the internet.\nMain Reasons behind Rising GPU Temperature\nWhen the temperature of the GPU, it is basically controlled using the Fans that are inbuilt with it, and with the use of fans on the cabinet which allows hot air to pass out and cool air to come in. With the constant airflow, it becomes easier for the user to maintain the temperature while working on the system. It is not rocket science to understand when the temperature of the GPU will increase, one just need to keep a constant eye on things whenever the GPU does not work properly\nOne of the major reasons for the GPU to get overheated is constantly heavy gaming. We all know that the games that are developed now are heavy graphic-heavy and require a lot of resources to run. Due to long hours of gaming, it is very obvious that the temperature of the GPU will increase over time. The best thing about GPUs is that they are mostly equipped with strong fans that help them to control the temperature.\nAnother major factor that often leads to an increase in temperature is the lack of ventilation in the PC. If you have a gaming system then you need to have a bigger cabinet that can hold the big graphic card but still has a lot of space around it. Also, there should be enough vents and fans in the cabinet to make sure that the intake of cold air and the exit of hold air happens properly.\nMake sure that the cabinet is placed in an open place and has enough place to let the air pass properly. It would avoid trapping the hot air inside the cabinet and will keep the GPU much cooler and within the appropriate temperature range.\nDefective hardware is one of the most common reasons for increasing the temperature of GPU. If the fans on the graphic card are not working properly, it could lead to an increase in temperature, and finally, GPU crashing down. You can simply get it checked with a technician and before then use the GPU temperature tool to check the fan speed. Also if you face the same issue with the CPU fan, then simply replace it with a better CPU fan.\nConclusion: How To Check GPU Temperature\nSo here are a few tools that can help you on how to see GPU temp. These tools are the best way to make sure that your hardware components are working properly. Also, keep in mind the reasons due to which the issue can happen and make sure to avoid them.\nThe three major things that you always need to keep in mind is that the cabinet should be spacious, there should be enough ventilation, and do not keep your cabinet in a place where there is less space for the air to escape. Also, make sure to regularly clean the dust off the fans and vents to keep them clear.']	['<urn:uuid:e5a8c556-28d0-4660-a403-12ed63740752>', '<urn:uuid:0a6603ef-4b12-4674-a412-33762b3b2640>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	6	103	2418
60	As a researcher studying different methodologies, I'm curious about the key differences between theoretical research and qualitative research when it comes to data collection and evidence gathering - could you compare their approaches?	Theoretical research relies on hypothetical examples without using empirical data like interviews, focusing on logical exploration of beliefs and assumptions. In contrast, qualitative research involves direct fieldwork and data collection through methods like in-depth interviews, direct observation, and document analysis, with the researcher being the primary instrument for gathering data. While theoretical research is based on playing out implications of defined systems, qualitative research studies phenomena in their natural settings and interprets them based on the meanings people bring to them.	['What is a theoretical research?\nTheoretical research is a logical exploration of a system of beliefs and assumptions. This type of research includes theorizing or defining how a cyber system and its environment behave and then exploring or playing out the implications of how it is defined.\nWhat is a theoretical review in research?\nThe theoretical literature review help establish what theories already exist, the relationships between them, to what degree the existing theories have been investigated, and to develop new hypotheses to be tested. The unit of analysis can focus on a theoretical concept or a whole theory or framework.\nWhat is theoretical evidence?\nA theoretical research is the one which is hypothetical. In this type of research, the researcher does not use empirical data, for example interviews to build the theory, instead uses hypothetical examples.\nWhat is theoretical method?\nTheoretical Methods may be a generalization a few developments, a proof of however or why one thing happens. Indeed, any statements that specify what’s measured or described-any general statements concerning cause or effect-area theory based mostly, a minimum of implicitly.\nWhat is the difference between empirical and theoretical research?\nBy “empiricists” we mean researchers that do empirical work: fieldwork, lab work, or any other gathering of data from phenomena observed in the real world. By “theorists” we mean researchers that do theoretical work: mathematical models, numerical simulations, and other such work.\nWhat is the difference between theoretical and empirical?\nThe empirical (or experimental) probability of an event is an “estimate” that an event will occur based upon how often the event occurred after collecting data from an experiment in a large number of trials. With theoretical probability, you do not actually conduct an experiment.\nWhat is theoretical probability example?\nTheoretical probability is a probability that is expected, for example when I flip a coin 100 times I expect tails to come up 50 times and heads to come up 50 times. The theoretical probability is 0.5 for a head. In that case, the experimental probability is 0.56 for heads.\nHow do you write theoretical probability?\nThe Theoretical Probability of an event is the number of ways the event can occur (favorable outcomes) divided by the number of total outcomes.\nWhich comes first theory or experiment?\nTheory and experiment in science make a closed circle. Some times, experiment first while at others, theory is done first. Theory and experiment go on hand to hand.\nWhat is theoretical probability used for?\nTheoretical probability is the theory behind probability. To find the probability of an event using theoretical probability, it is not required to conduct an experiment. Instead of that, we should know about the situation to find the probability of an event occurring.\nIs theoretical or experimental probability more accurate?\nThat’s why predictions based on experimental probability are always less reliable than those based on theoretical probability. In general, the greater the number of outcomes you have, the closer a prediction based on probability is likely to be.\nWhat is the theoretical probability of rolling a 4?\nWe call the outcomes in an event its “favorable outcomes”. If a die is rolled once, determine the probability of rolling a 4: Rolling a 4 is an event with 1 favorable outcome (a roll of 4) and the total number of possible outcomes is 6 (a roll of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). Thus, the probability of rolling a 4 is .\nWhy do theoretical and experimental results differ?\nWhy is there a difference in theoretical and experimental probability? The relationship between the two is that you’ll find if you do the experiment enough times, the experimental probability will get closer and closer to the theoretical probability’s answer.\nHow do you find theoretical and experimental percent error?\nPercent error (percentage error) is the difference between an experimental and theoretical value, divided by the theoretical value, multiplied by 100 to give a percent. In some fields, percent error is always expressed as a positive number. In others, it is correct to have either a positive or negative value.\nWhat does theoretical mean?\n1 : existing only in theory : hypothetical gave as an example a theoretical situation. 2a : relating to or having the character of theory : abstract. b : confined to theory or speculation often in contrast to practical applications : speculative theoretical physics.\nHow do you find theoretical value?\nThis value is calculated by determining the difference between the subscription price the investor paid and the theoretical ex-right price. Considering the example used above, the calculation for a theoretical nil paid price looks like this: $40 – $38 = $2.\nWhat is the theoretical value?\nThe experimental value is your calculated value, and the theoretical value is your known value.\nIs accepted value the same as theoretical value?\nThis is different from experimental value, which is the value that results from an individual’s laboratory experiment or an individual’s calculation. Accepted value is often referred to as theoretical value.', 'Module 14 Overview Qualitative Research Broad view of features Many traditions Contrasts with quantitative research Qualtitative method roadmap Data collection methods Standards of evaluation Mixed Methods • Approaches to mixing • Examples Research Methods In the social sciences, there are 3 generic types of research methods Quantitative methods Qualitative methods ‘Mixed methods’ blending quantitative and qualitative Qualitative Research Focus on making sense of or interpreting social or human phenomena: experiences, behaviors, organizational functioning, social movements, interactional relationships, descriptions of culture Phenomena are studied in their natural settings Investigators interpret phenomena in terms of the meanings people bring to them Denzin and Lincoln, 2000.

However, the rubber board dulls knives approximately 3 times faster than wood blocks.	"['My Rubber Cutting Board Experience (Sani-tuff)\n- Chemicalkinetics Aug 7, 2010 12:18 PM\nEarlier, I posted a NY Times article on rubber cutting board.\nI kept seeing these rubber cutting boards in restaurant supply stores, but not in regular departmental stores. I wanted a new cutting board. Although my large round chopping block is fine, it is more than 4.5 inch thick and when I use a wide blade knife like a Chinese chef’s knife, my hand will be above my elbow and that is non-ergonomic.\nIn short, I bought a Sani-tuff rubbter cutting board and just tried it. I bought the thinnest and cheapest one ($27) as a testing board. It is 12” x 18” X ½”. If I really like it, I may get a more expensive one in the future. There was one which costs >$110; very thick (maybe 5 inches thick), and very heavy (more than my wooden chopping block).\nIt does not feel soft, but the moment I started cutting on it I knew it is soft because the surface tightly grabs my knife blades. I tried my CCK Chinese chef’s knife and my Tojiro usuba bocho. After I am done cutting, I can see many knife marks on the board. Most of them have sealed themselves closed, so that is very much like an end grain cutting block. The label on the board and the NY Times article suggest that these rubber boards can be resurfaced by sanding and that sound very attractive.\nI will update.\n""tactile feedback of rubber""\nAbsolutely agree. It grabs the knife more tightly than my wood chopping block does. Is that what you mean? When I first sharpened my CCK (陳枝記) knife to a sharper bevel I also felt the knife was being grabbed by my wooden chopping block. Read this last entry:\nThe knife got sharper and I were using the same force, so I cut the knife deeper into the wood block, resulting that ""braking"" or ""jerking"" feedback. In time, I learnt to adjust my force. I believe this is the same thing happening just in a reversed manner. The knife is just as sharp, but the board surface got softer. Maybe I will able to adjust in a few weeks. I will see. Thanks for pointing this out.\nMore than a month and a half since I bought and used.\nThin, stury, dense, (mine is thin, but there very thin ones)\nHas self-healing property against knife cut\nDoes not wrap\nDoes not require oiling or waxing\nCan be sanded (I tried it)\nDulls knives faster (~X3 times faster) than my wood chopping block.\nAs mentioned, I switch to this rubber board mostly because my wood block is too tall (5 inch) and make my hand parallel to my elbow -- not ergonomic. I can live with it being easily stain and gouge, but it dulls my knives too fast. I tried Tojiro gyuto, CCK KF1303, Tanaka nakiri. I am disappointed because I read rubber boards are gentle to knife blades. Maybe it is better than a glass cutting board, but it is not on par with my end grain wood chopping block.\nSo I am still on the market for shopping a thin board which does not dull my knives.\nGood report and interesting results. Do you have any ideas on why it is dulling your knives faster?\nI was worried about hand cutting height too, so I placed books on my counter to see what my max height for a board should be and ended up getting a 2-inch end grain (brand new just last week). It doesn\'t have rubber feet to reduce the height even more, and I just put a damp paper towel underneath to prevent slipping when in use. I\'ve even heard that boards 1 3/4 inches thick are pretty stable.\nUnlike glass or granite cutting boards, the rubber boards are soft, softer than my wood block. I can feel the friction from the knives digging into my rubber board on every strike. It did not dull my knives all the way from very sharp to very dull, but it dulled them from very sharp to semi-sharp and stopped there. The knives went from very sharp cutting into the board to semi-sharp and cutting into the board.\nBecause the rubber boards are both soft and dense, the knife easily digs into the board and rubber holds on the edge very tightly, which is why I feel fricition. I think the smallest side-to-side movement breaks the knife edge. Just a guess.\nI think a 1-2 inch board will be great for me. This height of this rubber board is actually very good.\nI use a dish drying mat for my cutting board. It is nice. It is about $5-7 depending on the size. It grabs the board better than a normal cloth towel. It can absorb more water and it can go into washer. I have washed it 10 times or more now and there is no wear thus far. The only thing is that it is made of microfiber and not natural fiber, so some people may not like it', ""Grains & Woods\nEND GRAIN BUTCHER BLOCK\nEnd grain construction is made from edge grain block that has been cut standing up, exposing the end grains of the wood on the product surface. This produces a beautiful checkerboard pattern with distinct color variations. End grain wood is ideal for cutting and chopping as the wood will open on impact for less wear and tear on knives.\nEDGE GRAIN CONTINUOUS RAIL\nEdge grain products are made with continuous rails for the full length of the piece. This type of construction is not only durable, but it makes for a beautiful solid wood surface to use as a premium top. These products are made with select, high-quality woods for uniform color, grain appearance, and superior strength. Edge grain construction is also used on cutting boards, though it is not as easy on knives as end grain because edge grain surfaces will not open as much on impact.\nBLENDED GRAIN BUTCHER BLOCK\nBlended grain construction uses wood that is cut and turned up on the edge for strength and durability, though it is not made with full-length rails. Blended grain construction produces random color variations and will have seams and joints made up of various length rails throughout the piece. This method can utilize more cuts of wood for maximum yield, is less expensive than continuous rail solid surfaces, and can be used for longer surfaces or for a more industrial look.\nMICHIGAN HARD ROCK MAPLE White with a reddish-brown tinge , maple has a uniform texture and is cut-resistant.

63	I've noticed my baby plants have started growing some leaves, and I'm wondering if I should move them to separate containers now. When is the right time to do this?	You should wait until the 'true leaves' appear before moving seedlings into separate pots. True leaves are the ones that grow after the very first set of leaves and are usually bigger. When moving them, hold them gently by a leaf rather than the stem, as damaging the stem could kill the plant.	['How do I start growing plants from seeds?\nIn this video\nHow to start planting from seed\nPlanting from seed takes a lot more time and patience than starting with young seedlings or grown up plants, but all the care that you put in can reap great rewards./\nThe first thing to do is decide what you’d like to grow, but remember to think about the conditions provided by your space just like you would with other plants. As always, choosing a plant that likes the conditions you can provide will result in more success.\nEach plant comes with its own growing requirements, so keep in mind that these are just general suggestions for getting started. Once you’ve decided on your seeds, you’ll need to sow them in a small pot or a seed tray. Fill it most of the way up with compost, place your seeds onto the soil, and cover with another sprinkling of compost.\nYou can often figure out how much space the seeds need by their size; small seeds can be scattered over the surface of the compost, but larger ones will need a couple of centimeters between them. If in doubt, the seed packet will guide you. Seeds need quite light compost to allow the delicate young sprouts to be able to push through, so look for a special seed compost for this.\nLabel your containers (you don’t want to forget what you’re growing!), water your seeds well and leave in a warm space. Some plants are happy on a sunny windowsill, but others like a warmer space, such as an airing cupboard or a makeshift greenhouse. You can create this with a tray and plastic lid, or alternatively just pop them in a closed ziplock bag.\nKeep the soil moist and check your seeds daily so that you spot them breaking through the soil. Once seedlings start to grow you can remove them from their mini-greenhouse or cupboard, if they’re in one. Make sure they now get some sunlight and the soil is still kept moist.\nAt first your seedlings will produce a little set of leaves, but don’t move them until the first ‘true leaves’ appear. These are the ones that grow after the very first set, and they’ll usually be a bit bigger.\nWhen you see these true leaves you can move the seedlings into their own pots. If you’ve got all of the kit then you might have a dibber to do this with, but otherwise a pencil works just fine.\nHold the plant gently by a leaf, and use the pencil to dig into the soil and loosen the roots. It’s ok if a leaf gets damaged, but bruising the stem could kill the plant. Once you’ve freed the roots you can replant in a separate pot. Water the seedling well, and start using a liquid dose of fertiliser every couple of weeks to make sure it’s getting all the nutrients it needs to grow.\nFor an all-in-one package take a look at Patch’s Miracle-Gro Pods. These are a great way to get started with seed planting, as they contain everything needed to give your seeds the best start, including the seeds themselves! Just push them into the soil until level with the surface, water well, and continue to keep moist.']	['<urn:uuid:f4c0c57a-1d35-411f-bd95-6e4664039781>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	30	53	551
64	metal ceramic electronics conductive materials compare gold copper	In ceramic-based electronics like spark plugs and capacitors, both gold and copper are used as metal electrodes to propagate electrical signals. Comparing their conductivity, copper has a conductivity of 5.98x107 S/m at 20°C, while gold has a slightly lower conductivity of 4.52x107 S/m. However, both metals present manufacturing challenges when combined with ceramics due to differences in synthesis temperatures and thermal expansion properties between the metals and oxide bases.	"['Scientists in Japan are finding that perovskites have the potential to improve the fabrication of electrodes and wiring in ceramic-based electronics such as spark plugs.\nMany ceramic-based electronics, such as spark plugs and multilayer ceramic capacitors (found in consumer electronics, mobile phones, DVDs and video cameras, for example), are composed of a combination of oxides and metals.\nThe oxides are used as a base to provide the product’s electric, optical or magnetic properties, while the metals are used in electrodes, which propagate the electrical signals. Fabricating these products is difficult because the physical properties of the oxides and metals are very different.\nTo achieve a high quality product, the manufacturing process needs to account for differences in synthesis temperatures and atmospheres, and for differences in expansion and shrinkage. A fabrication process that is optimized for the conducting metal electrodes can suppress the performance of the base oxides.\nIn a review paper published in the journal Science and Technology of Advanced Materials, a group of scientists in Japan investigated the potential of replacing metal electrodes in ceramic-based electronics with conductive oxides. Doing so could allow for more innovations in the ceramics industry.\nOxide electrodes in these ceramic-based products would need to be highly conductive (above 1000 Siemens/cm) and stable in air at temperatures ranging between room temperature and 1173 Kelvin (almost 900° Celsius).\nThe team of researchers, from NGK Spark Plug Company and Nagoya University, fabricated oxides that have the potential to replace metal electrodes and investigated their physical properties above room temperature. Lanthanum-based perovskite-type oxides were chosen as having a potential for industrial use because they do not contain expensive rare metals, they are not environmentally hazardous, and they are stable in air up to 1173 Kelvin.\nBased on their investigations, the team found that the lanthanum-based perovskite-type oxide LaCo0.5Ni 0.5O3 showed high electronic conduction at high temperatures in air and was suitable for the fabrication of oxide electrodes and wiring in ceramic-based products.\nFor further information contact:\nDr. Hisashi Kozuka\nNGK Spark Plug Co., Ltd.\n2808, Iwasaki, Komaki-shi\nAichi 485-8510, Japan\nScience and Technology of Advanced Materials (STAM) is the leading open access, international journal for outstanding research articles across all aspects of materials science.

The atoms of metal elements are characterized by the presence of valence electrons, which are electrons in the outer shell of an atom that are free to move about. It is these ""free electrons"" that allow metals to conduct an electric current. Because valence electrons are free to move, they can travel through the lattice that forms the physical structure of a metal. Under an electric field, free electrons move through the metal much like billiard balls knocking against each other, passing an electric charge as they move. Transfer of Energy The transfer of energy is strongest when there is little resistance. On a billiard table, this occurs when a ball strikes against another single ball, passing most of its energy onto the next ball. If a single ball strikes multiple other balls, each of those will carry only a fraction of the energy. By the same token, the most effective conductors of electricity are metals that have a single valence electron that is free to move and causes a strong repelling reaction in other electrons. This is the case in the most conductive metals, such as silver, gold, and copper. Each has a single valence electron that moves with little resistance and causes a strong repelling reaction. Semiconductor metals (or metalloids) have a higher number of valence electrons (usually four or more). So, although they can conduct electricity, they are inefficient at the task. However, when heated or doped with other elements, semiconductors like silicon and germanium can become extremely efficient conductors of electricity. Metal Conductivity Conduction in metals must follow Ohm\'s Law, which states that the current is directly proportional to the electric field applied to the metal. The law, named after German physicist Georg Ohm, appeared in 1827 in a published paper laying out how current and voltage are measured via electrical circuits. The key variable in applying Ohm\'s Law is a metal\'s resistivity. Resistivity is the opposite of electrical conductivity, evaluating how strongly a metal opposes the flow of electric current. This is commonly measured across the opposite faces of a one-meter cube of material and described as an ohm meter (Ω⋅m). Resistivity is often represented by the Greek letter rho (ρ). Electrical conductivity, on the other hand, is commonly measured by siemens per meter (S⋅m−1) and represented by the Greek letter sigma (σ). One siemens is equal to the reciprocal of one ohm.

65	As a financial analyst comparing different mortgage offers, how do interest rate reductions from mortgage points vary between different lenders, and what factors should I watch out for?	The rate-reducing power of mortgage points varies at each lender's discretion. One lender might reduce the interest rate by 0.22% per point, while another might offer 0.26%. Points aren't regulated by federal law, except that lenders must provide some interest rate discount in exchange. Even for borrowers with identical loan qualifications and credit scores, different lenders may offer different percentage reductions. When comparing loans, it's important to verify you're not being offered an attractive interest rate discount in exchange for higher fees elsewhere. Additionally, be aware that some lenders label upfront fees based on loan percentage as 'points,' even when they're actually origination fees that don't affect your interest rate.	"['Mortgage points are money you pay up front at the time of closing in exchange for a lower interest rate on your home loan. They’re also referred to as “discount points,"" and the process has been called “buying down the rate.” Buying mortgage points at the time of closing can save some significant money on monthly mortgage payments over the years. Plus, you may find the points tax deductible.\nHow Do Mortgage Points Work?\nMortgage discount points are something like prepaid interest. Each point you purchase as an upfront cost when you close on a mortgage to buy down the interest rate on your loan by a certain percentage. Your home mortgage interest rate will be lower if you buy one point instead of no points, and even lower if you buy two points rather than one. You can even buy just a fraction of a point. They’re a one-time cash-out-of-pocket expense made to cover the cost of the points, in exchange for reduced mortgage payments for as long as you carry the loan.\nMortgage payments can be comprised of numerous factors: principal toward paying off your loan, homeowners insurance, property taxes and interest on the amount you borrowed. The percentage of interest each point will save you depends on your lender, and these percentages can differ between types of mortgage loans as well. The market at the time you take out your mortgage can have an effect, too.\nRead More: How to Calculate Mortgage Interest\nHow Are Points Calculated?\nThe cost of points is universal among lenders. Each mortgage point equals 1 percent of the amount you’re borrowing. For example, a single point would cost you $1,750 if you’re taking out a $175,000 mortgage. That $1,750 would typically reduce your interest rate by about 0.25 percent, so you\'d pay only 4.25 percent over the life of your loan if you were initially quoted a rate of 4.5 percent.\nYou might pay $1,750 now, but that will slash each and every one of your mortgage payments by $35 or so. Now assume that yours is a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. That works out to a savings of $12,600 over the term of your loan: $35 times 360 months (12 months a year for 30 years).\nWhen Do You Pay Points?\nAny points you buy are payable at closing, and the money goes to your lender. It’s added to your closing costs, so you have to add them to the check you’re writing on that day. But you’re not prohibited from negotiating a deal with the home seller to pay some or all of your points. This might be an option for you as a homebuyer in a strong buyer’s market with a seller who’s desperate to get their home sold.\nThe points you and your lender have agreed on, as well as the corresponding interest rate reduction, should appear on the loan estimate you receive at the time you apply for the mortgage, as well as on the closing disclosure, on page 2 in Section A. The closing disclosure should be provided to you a few days before settlement.\nComparing Mortgage Loans\nThe rate-reducing power of a point is at a lender’s discretion. One lender might cut your interest rate by 0.22 percent for each point, while another will give you 0.26 percent off. Points aren’t regulated by federal law, except to the extent that you must receive some discount on your interest rate in exchange. It’s also possible that a lender will offer a certain percentage to one borrower, and a different percentage to another, or that two separate lenders will offer different percentages to two individuals with the exact same loan qualifications and credit scores.\nThat said, points are definitely something to inquire about when you’re comparing loans. You also want to make sure that you’re not being offered a really nice interest discount in exchange for higher other fees. Make sure the equation works out in your favor.\nWhen Points Aren’t Really Points\nNot all points are points in the true sense of the word. Other loan terms can include the word “points” when, in fact, they’re something else entirely.\nOrigination points are a prime example. These points are fees you pay to your lender in exchange for processing your home loan. Origination fees are payable at settlement as part of your closing costs, too, and they’re also generally equal to 1 percent of your mortgage amount, but they’re not going to have any effect on your interest rate.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) indicates that some lenders have been known to tag any upfront fee that’s based on a percentage of your loan amount as ""points."" Again, check your loan estimate and closing disclosure so you’re sure you understand what you’re paying, even if you have to take the paperwork to an attorney for further review.\nAre Points Right for You?\nYou might be thinking that paying to get a low rate with tax benefits all sounds like a pretty good deal, particularly if you have the cash on hand to pay a little more at closing. It can be, but as with any transaction, there are pros and cons.\nComing up with that extra cash out of pocket at settlement is probably a solid choice if you’re reasonably sure that you’re going to remain in that home – with that mortgage – for decades. You’ll obviously save much less if you move out or refinance in five years rather than run out the entire 30-year mortgage term. Otherwise, you might want to go ahead and pay a higher interest rate in exchange for some other lender concession or credit at closing.\nThe CFPB suggests comparing three scenarios: how much you’ll save if you were to sell or refinance in a few years, your savings if you were to remain in place with the same mortgage and monthly payment for the life of the loan, then again based on how long you honestly expect to live there.\nAnother option is to divide the dollar amount of the points you’re considering paying by the monthly savings in interest. The answer will tell you how long you must stay in the home, with that mortgage, to reach the breakeven point where paying for points begins to make sense. It’s expressed in months, so you’d have to remain in the home without refinancing for almost eight years if the number you arrive at is 95. It works out to 7.91 when divided by 12 months in a year.\nAnd here’s something else to consider: Points are tax deductible if you itemize, and mortgage interest is as well. So when is this tax break going to do you the most good? Will it be more helpful in the year you purchase, or taking a larger deduction annually over a period of time? You’ll want to factor this into your math calculations as well. Keep in mind that a good many rules apply to claiming this tax deduction. For example, the home must be your primary residence, and the points must be clearly noted on your closing disclosure and any disclaimer statements. There are limits to the amount of mortgage debt that qualifies as well.\nRead More: Can You Claim Mortgage Interest on Taxes?\nThe ultimate goal is making your money work for you to the greatest extent possible by negotiating the best mortgage for your circumstances. You can often reduce your interest rate by making a larger down payment, too, and that money buys you more home equity.

66	prevent blockage dehydration ostomy diet	To prevent blockages in ostomy patients, foods should be chewed thoroughly, and intake of fibrous foods should be monitored as they can block stool flow. Signs of blockage include crampy belly pain, swelling, watery stool, nausea, and vomiting. To prevent dehydration, patients should drink plenty of water before feeling thirsty, eat more soups, fruits, and vegetables (which contain up to 95% water), and avoid caffeine and tea as they increase water loss. Children should drink enough for urine to remain pale straw-colored.	"['Ostomy Diet Guidelines | Overview\nMost children with ostomies can return to a normal diet soon after the operation. You can start to give your child most foods slowly (unless there is an allergy). Talk with your child’s doctor or nurse about specific foods. This Family Education Sheet can help you decide which foods may be best for your child.\nHow should my child eat after surgery?\n- Your child may be more comfortable eating many small meals and snacks for the first few weeks after surgery instead of larger meals.\n- Add new foods to your child’s diet one at a time. After she gets used to that food, add another.\n- Be sure that your child chews her food very well. Some foods can change the smell and thickness of the stool (poop) and cause gas (you’ll find a list of foods in this handout). If a food seems to cause a bad smell or gas, you do not need to stop giving your child the food. You can try giving it to your child several times.\n- If your child has an ileostomy (a type of ostomy that connects the small intestine to the belly), it’s very important for her to drink lots of fluids. Your child needs extra fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated.\n- Children can also get dehydrated from being in the sun or in hot temperatures, lots of exercise (like playing sports) and taking some medications. It’s important for your child to drink extra fluids in these situations.\n- Talk with your doctor or nurse about exactly how much your child needs to drink.\nWhat are the signs of dehydration?\n- Extremely thirsty\n- Dry mouth and dry skin\n- Less urine (pee) or urinethat is darker in color\n- Nausea or belly cramping\n- General feeling of achiness\n- Lightheadedness or feeling dizzy\nWhat is a food blockage?\n- Your child may develop a food blockage, especially if your child has an ileostomy. Undigested fibrous foods can build up and block the flow of stool through the bowel.\n- Your child should chew foods well to avoid blockages.\n- Call your doctor or nurse if your child has belly pain, very little or no stool for more than 4 hours, a large increase in the amount of stool or if she is vomiting (throwing up).\nWhat foods can cause blockages?\nHow can I tell if there is a blockage?\nYour child may have:\n- Crampy belly pain\n- Belly swelling\n- Stomach swelling\n- Large amount of watery stool (usually with a bad smell)\n- The inability to eat or drink\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Irritability and crankiness\n- Very little or no stool for more than four hours\nWhat foods can cause a bad odor?\nWhat foods help with bad odor?\n- Cranberry juice\nWhat foods might cause gas?\nNote: Chewing gum, or drinking straws, causes you to swallow more air and increase gas (“air in the pouch”). This may create a noisy stomach.\nWhat foods thicken stool?\n- Peanut butter (creamy)\n- Starchy foods (rice, pasta, potatoes, tapioca)\nWhat foods thin stool?\n- Apple juice\n- Fresh fruits\n- Fried foods\n- Grape juice\n- Green beans\n- Foods with lots of seasoning\n- Prune juice\nWhat foods change the color of stool?\n- Red Jell-O', 'Dehydration is the loss of water and salts that are essential for normal body function.\nDehydration occurs when the body loses more fluid than it takes in. Dehydration can upset the delicate fluid-salt balance needed to maintain healthy cells and tissues. The human body is generally over 60 percent water. The body works to maintain water balance through mechanisms such as the thirst sensation. When the body requires more water, the brain stimulates nerve centers to encourage a person to drink in order to replenish the water stores. Water intake can vary widely on a daily basis, influenced by such factors as access to water, thirst, habit, and cultural factors.\nThe kidneys are responsible for maintaining water balance through the elimination of waste products and excess water. Water is primarily absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and excreted by the kidneys as urine. The variation in water volume ingested is dependent on the ability of kidneys to dilute and concentrate the urine as needed.\nChildren need more water than adults because they expend more energy, and most children who drink when they are thirsty get as much water as their systems require. Dehydration in children usually results from losing large amounts of fluid and not drinking enough water to replace the loss. This condition generally occurs in children who have a stomach flu characterized by vomiting and diarrhea or who cannot or will not take enough fluids to compensate for excessive losses associated with fever and sweating of acute illness. Dehydration can result from illness; a hot, dry climate; prolonged exposure to sun or high temperatures; not drinking enough water; and overuse of diuretics or other medications that increase urination.\nTypes of dehydration\nDehydration is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on how much of the body fluid is lost, estimated by loss in bodyweight. Mild dehydration is the loss of no more than 5 to 6 percent loss of body weight. Loss of 7 to 10 percent is considered moderate dehydration. Severe dehydration (loss of over 10 percent of body weight) is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical care.\nComplications of dehydration\nWhen the body\'s fluid supply is severely depleted, hypovolemic shock is likely to occur. This condition, which is also called physical collapse, is characterized by pale, cool, clammy skin; rapid heartbeat; and shallow breathing.\nBlood pressure sometimes drops so low it cannot be measured, and skin at the knees and elbows may become blotchy. Anxiety , restlessness, and thirst increase. After a child\'s temperature reaches 107°F (41.7°C) damage to the brain and other vital organs occurs quickly.\nDehydration is a major cause of infant illness and death throughout the world. Dehydration is often a result of gastrointestinal disease and diarrhea in children. Among children in the United States, short-term diarrhea results in approximately 200,000 hospitalizations and 300 deaths per year. In developing countries, dehydration from illness is a common cause of death in children under five years of age, accounting for about 2 million deaths per year.\nCauses and symptoms\nDehydration is a deficit of body water that results when the output of water exceeds intake. Dehydration stimulates a child\'s thirst mechanism. Causes of dehydration may include the following:\n- decreased water or fluid intake\n- excessive heat\n- excessive sweating\n- excessive urination (polyuria)\n- diuretics or other medication that increase fluid loss\n- caffeine or alcohol consumption\nSweating and the output of urine both decrease during dehydration. If water intake continues to fall short of water loss, dehydration worsens and a child may become critically ill.\nReduced fluid intake may be a result of the following:\n- appetite loss associated with acute illness\n- bacterial or viral infection or inflammation of the pharynx (pharyngitis)\n- inflammation of the mouth caused by illness, infection, irritation, canker sores , or vitamin deficiency\nOther conditions that can lead to dehydration include the following:\n- disease of the adrenal glands, which regulate the body\'s water and salt balance and the function of many organ systems\n- diabetes mellitus\n- eating disorders\n- kidney disease\n- chronic lung disease\nWith mild dehydration, increased thirst and restlessness are usually the only apparent symptoms. In moderately dehydrated children, eyes are somewhat sunken, and the mouth and tongue are dry. Thirst is increased: an older child asks for water, and a younger child drinks eagerly when offered a cup or spoon of water. The skin is less elastic than it should be and is slow to return to its normal position after being pinched. The radial pulse (wrist area) is detectable, but rapid. The soft spot on a baby\'s head (fontanelle) is somewhat sunken. Two of the following symptoms usually indicate some degree of dehydration: drinks eagerly, thirsty, restless, irritable, sunken eyes, or skin pinch goes back slowly.\nChildren with severe dehydration are usually lethargic, in a stupor, or even in a coma. Symptoms are even more apparent (deeply sunken eyes without tears, very dry mouth and tongue, rapid and deep breathing). A skin pinch retracts very slowly (over two seconds). Children who are awake are very thirsty, although a child may drink poorly if in a stupor. A child may not have urinated for six hours or longer. When in hypovolemic shock, systolic blood pressure taken in the arm is low or not detectable, the arms and legs are cool, and the nail beds may have a bluish or purplish discoloration. Two of the following symptoms indicate severe dehydration: lethargic or unconscious, very slow skin pinch, sunken eyes, and not able to drink or drinking poorly.\nDehydration can cause confusion, constipation , discomfort, drowsiness, and fever. The skin turns pale and cold, the mucous membranes lining the mouth and nose lose their natural moisture. The pulse sometimes races and breathing becomes rapid. Significant fluid loss can cause serious neurological problems or death.\nWhen to call the doctor\nA doctor should be notified whenever an infant or child exhibits signs of dehydration or a parent is concerned that a stomach virus or other acute illness may lead to dehydration.\nA doctor should also be notified if any of the following is the case:\n- Symptoms of dehydration worsen.\n- A breast-fed or bottle-fed infant is unable to feed or feeds poorly.\n- An infant or child urinates very sparingly or does not urinate at all during a eight-hour period.\n- An infant younger than two months of age has diarrhea or is vomiting.\n- Dizziness, listlessness, or excessive thirst occurs.\n- The child\'s heart is beating fast.\n- The child has dry eyes, sunken eyes, a dry mouth, or is not producing tears.\n- There is blood in the stool or vomit.\nAn infant can become dehydrated within hours after the onset of illness. In general, the smaller the child, the lower the threshold should be for healthcare intervention if dehydration is suspected.\nA child\'s symptoms and medical history alone usually suggest dehydration. Physical symptoms are usually all that is necessary for diagnosing dehydration, although laboratory tests may be ordered by the physician. Physical examination may reveal shock, rapid heart rate, and/or low blood pressure. Laboratory tests, including blood tests (to check electrolyte levels) and urine tests (e.g. urine specific gravity and creatinine), may be used to evaluate the severity of the problem.\nIncreased fluid intake and replacement of lost electrolytes are extremely important for restoring fluid balances in infants and children who are dehydrated. Treatment is given based on severity of dehydration. Treatment should include two phases: a rehydration phase and a maintenance phase. In the rehydration phase, fluid losses are replaced quickly, within three to four hours until normal hydration is achieved. In the maintenance phase, calories and fluids are given. Rapid refeeding should follow rapid rehydration with the goal of returning the child to an unrestricted, age-appropriate diet including solids. Withholding foods to rest the gut is not recommended. Breastfeeding should be continued at all times through both stages of treatment. Full-strength formula is usually tolerated. Changing formula or diluting to half strength are common practices but are usually unnecessary and may even prolong symptoms and delay nutritional recovery.\nTo replace calories quickly during acute illness, food should be given as soon as the child will tolerate it. During both rehydration and maintenance phases, fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhea should be replaced continuously. Restricting lactose (milk and milk products) is usually not necessary but may be helpful in a child with a severe intestinal disease or diarrhea in a malnourished child.\nChildren with minimal dehydration weighing less than 10 kilograms (22 pounds) should be given 60 to 120 mL (2–4 ounces) of an oral rehydration solution (ORS) for each episode of vomiting or diarrheal stool. Those weighing more than 10 kg (22 lbs) should be given 120 to 240 mL (4–8 ounces). Food should not be restricted. Children with mild to moderate dehydration should be given 50 to 100 mL (roughly 2–3.5 ounces) of an ORS per kilogram body weight during two to four hours to replace fluid losses. Additional ORS should be administered to replace ongoing losses from vomiting and diarrhea. In a sick child, a teaspoon, syringe, or medicine dropper can be used to offer a small amount at first with amounts increasing as tolerated. If the child appears to want more, more can be given. Severe dehydration is a medical emergency requiring intravenous fluids immediately.\nFor moderate or severe dehydration, a child should be treated in a medical facility. Moderate dehydration can be treated orally, but severe dehydration requires the child to take fluids intravenously (IV). When treating dehydration, the underlying cause must also be addressed. For example, if dehydration is caused by vomiting, medications may be prescribed to resolve these symptoms. However, anti-diarrheal medications are not recommended in children. A child who is dehydrated due to diabetes, kidney disease, or adrenal gland disorders must receive treatment for these conditions as well as for the resulting dehydration.\nFor older children who are mildly dehydrated, just drinking plain water may be all the treatment that is needed. For infants and younger children, especially when ill, drinking a commercial ORS should be encouraged. Parents should follow label instructions when giving children Pedialyte or other commercial products recommended for relieving dehydration. Sports drinks are not recommended as they contain a lot of sugar and may worsen diarrhea.\nIn order to accurately calculate fluid loss, it is important to chart weight changes every day and keep a record of how many times a child vomits or has diarrhea. Parents should note how many times a baby\'s diaper must be changed.\nGelatin water may be substituted for electrolyte-replacement solutions if an ORS is unavailable. It is made by diluting a 3-oz package in a quart of water or by adding one-fourth teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar to a pint of water. Receiving the right amount of electrolytes is very important, and thus homemade remedies such as gelatin (or adding salt or sugar to water) are not recommended because of the potential for quantity errors when mixing. However, these may be useful if ORS cannot be obtained in an emergency. Parents should keep a can of ORS on hand for emergencies.\nFormulas containing soy fiber have been reported to reduce liquid stools.\nMild dehydration rarely results in complications. If the cause is eliminated and lost fluid is replaced, mild dehydration can usually be cured quickly.\nVomiting and diarrhea that continue for several days without adequate fluid replacement can be fatal. However, dehydration that is rapidly recognized and treated has a good outcome.\nEnsuring that children always drink adequate fluids during an illness helps to prevent dehydration. Parents can prevent dehydration in infants and children who are vomiting or who have diarrhea by increasing fluids to compensate for losses. Infants and children with diarrhea and vomiting should be given ORS such as Pedialyte immediately to help prevent dehydration.\nChildren who are not ill can maintain proper fluid balance by drinking water or fluids even before they are thirsty. Children should drink fluids before going outside to exercise or play (especially on a hot day). Dehydration can usually be prevented by drinking enough fluid for urine to remain the color of pale straw. Water in foods, especially fruits and vegetables, is a great source of fluid. Fruits and vegetables can contain up to 95 percent water, so a well-balanced diet is a good way to stay hydrated.\nParents should know whether any medication their child is taking can cause dehydration and should get prompt medical care to correct any underlying condition that increases the risk of dehydration.\nOther methods of preventing dehydration and ensuring adequate fluid intake are as follows:\n- eating more soup at mealtime\n- drinking plenty of water and juice at mealtime and between meals\n- keeping a glass of water nearby\nChildren should not be given coffee or tea, because they increase body temperature and water loss. Avoiding caffeinated soft drinks may also reduce the risk of dehydration. These beverages are all diuretics (substances that increase fluid loss).\nDiuretic —A group of drugs that helps remove excess water from the body by increasing the amount lost by urination.\nElectrolytes —Salts and minerals that produce electrically charged particles (ions) in body fluids. Common human electrolytes are sodium chloride, potassium, calcium, and sodium bicarbonate. Electrolytes control the fluid balance of the body and are important in muscle contraction, energy generation, and almost all major biochemical reactions in the body.\nBatmanghelidj, F.

67	ancient cave art climate modern activism compare	Cave art from 40,000 years ago in Borneo represents one of humanity's earliest artistic expressions, with figurative depictions including animals and hand stencils. This ancient artistic tradition reflects early human responses to their environment. In modern times, artists continue to engage with environmental issues through various mediums - from performances about climate displacement to installations about marine life death due to warming waters. While ancient cave artists documented their natural world, contemporary artists like those in New Haven actively collaborate with scientists and activists to raise awareness about climate change through murals, dance performances, and gallery exhibitions.	"['Griffith University researchers have dated cave paintings in Borneo to as early as 40,000 years ago, showing that these enigmatic artworks are among the world’s oldest examples of figurative depiction.\nThis finding adds to the mounting view that cave art – one of the most important innovations in human cultural history – did not arise in Europe as long believed, and that ‘ice age’ artists in Southeast Asia played a key role in its development.\nSince the 1990s, caves in remote and rugged mountains of East Kalimantan, an Indonesian province of Borneo, have been known to contain prehistoric paintings, drawings, and other imagery, including thousands of depictions of human hands (“stencils”), animals, abstract signs and symbols, and related motifs.\nThese near-inaccessible artworks are now known to be far older than previously thought, according to a study led by Griffith’s Associate Professor Maxime Aubert, along with Indonesia’s National Research Centre for Archaeology (ARKENAS), and the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), published in Nature.\nAssociate Professor Aubert’s team reports Uranium-series dates obtained from calcium carbonate samples collected from the Kalimantan cave art, providing the first reliable estimates for the approximate time of rock art production.\n“The oldest cave art image we dated is a large painting of an unidentified animal, probably a species of wild cattle still found in the jungles of Borneo – this has a minimum age of around 40,000 years and is now the earliest known figurative artwork,” Associate Professor Aubert said.\nThe Kalimantan stencil art was shown to be similar in age, suggesting that a Palaeolithic rock art tradition first appeared on Borneo between about 52,000 and 40,000 years ago.\nDating also indicated that a major change occurred within this culture around 20,000 years ago, giving rise to a new rock art style (including rare portrayals of humans) at a time when the global ice age climate was at its most extreme.\n“Who the ice age artists of Borneo were and what happened to them is a mystery,” said team co-leader Dr Pindi Setiawan, an Indonesian archaeologist and lecturer at ITB. Setiawan has studied the art since its discovery, and, along with ARKENAS rock art expert Adhi Agus Oktaviana, leads expeditions to the Kalimantan caves.\n“The new findings illustrate that the story of how cave art emerged is complex,” Oktaviana said.\nEurope has long been seen as the centre for cave art development. But although Borneo is the Earth’s third largest island, throughout most of the ice age it actually formed the easternmost tip of the vast continental region of Eurasia – at the western extremity of this 13,000 km-wide landmass was Europe.\n“It now seems that two early cave art provinces arose at a similar time in remote corners of Palaeolithic Eurasia: one in Europe, and one in Indonesia at the opposite end of this ice age world,” said Associate Professor Adam Brumm, a Griffith archaeologist also involved in the study.\nA 2014 Nature paper published by Associate Professors Aubert and Brumm (with ARKENAS) revealed that similar cave art appeared in the island of Sulawesi about 40,000 years ago.\nSulawesi lies off the edge of Eurasia and is a vital stepping-stone between Asia and Australia.\n“Our research suggests that rock art spread from Borneo into Sulawesi and other new worlds beyond Eurasia, perhaps arriving with the first people to colonise Australia,” Associate Professor Aubert said.\nRead The Conversation article', ""|Madeline Charne in a performance of WASTE//LAND at the Yale Cabaret in September 2019. Yale Cabaret Photo.|\nA man stands in front of a giant skeleton, outlining how climate change has displaced immigrants around the world. A woman grips the mic in full costume, describing the effects of petroleum byproducts on her own body. A magnified, painted plankton hangs in a gallery, dying in the warm water that surrounds it.\nIn 2019, New Haven saw a number of visual, dramatic, and public artists show up ready to discuss the climate crisis through their work. Often they came quietly, with monologues, music, and exhibitions that popped up in galleries and arts incubators, churches, and occasionally the streets. Now as they enter 2020, many of them are asking what they need to do next.\nFor many of them, it’s part of a national trend that is not particularly new. For decades, the National Science Foundation has offered funding through the Antarctic Artists and Writers Program (AAW), with projects that have been increasingly dedicated to climate change. Artists including Michel Comte and Helen Mayer and Newton Harrison have used photography, installation, and performance to communicate atmospheric carbon and a warming earth since the 1970s.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, select artists were some of the first to respond to the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown, to changing systems of food production and scarcity, to unprecedented levels of melting ice in the arctic. The past five years have seen the formation of the New York-based group Climate Change Theatre Action (CCTA), the use of large-scale public art in climate actions, and the decision of French choreographer Jérôme Bel to cease touring to reduce his carbon footprint among hundreds of other examples.\n|Members of Elm City Dance Collective at the National Water Dance, held at Lighthouse Point Park in April 2018. Lucy Gellman File Photo.|\nReached by email, environmentalist and 350.org founder Bill McKibben suggested that artists can play a vital role in communicating the severity of the climate crisis, particularly through collaboration with scientists, environmentalists, and activists. He pointed to a huge, 14-part mural that climate activists painted during the Global Climate Strike in San Francisco, after they had successfully shut down a street.\n“Artists are playing an increasing role in raising awareness—but increasingly they're also joining with activists in large-scale campaigns,” he wrote. “That really really helps.”\nIn New Haven, artists and arts collectives have increasingly answered that call. In April 2018, the Elm City Dance Collective brought the National Water Dance to the city for the first time, starting a discussion on water sovereignty and watershed protection. That fall, Westville artist Gar Waterman placed it front and center with Canaries in a Blue Coal Mine at Kehler Liddell Gallery, exploring the death of delicate, bottom-dwelling marine life in warming waters. In between, Artspace New Haven centered food systems and land reclamation in a string of summer 2018 exhibitions, then held an environmental summit that fall.\nIn early 2019, Kehler Liddell Gallery opened its doors to Rod and Penrhyn Cook’s Vanishing, tracing the real-time impact of climate change on the migration of 1.5 million wildebeest across Northern Tanzania and into Kenya. Weeks later, artist Scott Schuldt opened The Re-Education of Smedley Butler and Other Stories at City Lights Gallery in Bridgeport, bringing viewers to their knees with a portrait of the earth and its destruction.\n|Gar Waterman's Canaries in a Blue Coal Mine brought attention to how rising ocean temperatures, chemical pollution, and ocean acidification are putting Nudibranch ecosystems at risk, as the coral reefs on which they settle and flourish are destroyed. Lucy Gellman File Photo.|\nWith curator Debbie Hesse at its helm, the Ely Center of Contemporary Art took on sea level rise and a rapidly warming world in two different exhibitions last year, urging viewers to action. Throughout the year, organizations including Lots of Fish, Solar Youth, and the Mud Is Gold Earth Building Collective fused artmaking, activism, and youth voices that have been fundamental to the current climate movement.\nSometimes, it seemed, there was a disconnect between the art and the maker or makers. One day after Artspace’s environmental summit in 2018, representatives of the organization and attendees from the summit were absent from a rally for the environment on the New Haven Green. Vanishing presented itself as a show about conservation and environmental stewardship, but came with a massive carbon footprint. Exhibitions have often amplified white voices, despite a city where Black and Brown youth have been at the forefront of action.\nBut in the final half of last year, it seemed to hit its stride. From the summer through the end of the year, Lots of Fish spread its message of eco-conservation with painted rain barrels, storm drain murals, and handheld signs that it completed with community members. In advance of a Global Climate Strike last September, choral director Marika Kuzma worked with Mary Evelyn Tucker, co-founder and co-director of the Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology, on the climate-focused concert Simple Gifts For Mother Earth at the United Church on the Green. Over almost three hours, artists and activists brought the climate crisis sharply into focus as they read Anton Chekov, struck up Aaron Copland, and bound poetry and song to environmental conservation.\n|A Lots of Fish sign at New Haven's September climate strike. Lucy Gellman Photo.|\nJust a week later—on the same day that hundreds marched for the climate on the New Haven Green—the Yale Cabaret and Yale affinity group Beyond Borders hosted back-to-back performances of WASTE//LAND, a show featuring four CCTA plays as well as two adapted works. In one, Yale School of Drama student Madeline Charne (pictured at top) appeared in deep yellow plumage, mascara spread like wet coal around her eyes. She issued a warning that spanned petroleum byproducts in hand lotion to microplastics in clothing.\n“Because we were never told that our indoor use of personal care products and household cleaning supplies/Produces half of all outdoor city air pollution/More than cars,” she read. “The little canary breaks out of the cage and yells:/Fuck you capitalist coal-junkies!/And flies off into the sky.”\nIn another vignette, actors watched as water rose around them, creeping up well past waist level. They reached for their flashlights and realized they didn’t have batteries. The message, delivered in a blackbox that was far too warm for late September, felt prophetic.\n“I think theater has the capacity to put the world on stage in the way that we want it to be and open people’s imaginations,” said Julia Levine, artistic producer with CCTA and its partner organization The Arctic Cycle. “It can unlock empathy. Without a cultural change, I don't think that a political change will happen. This is part of the cultural change.”\n|Pedro López and Silvana Deigan’s Mother Earth, which was made for the city's Día de Muertos parade and was later on view at Artspace New Haven. Lucy Gellman Photo.|\nThe approach could not come at a more critical point. Cities in the U.S. and across the globe are sinking as sea levels rise, just one of the factors prompting mass shifts in global migration amid governments unready and unwilling to absorb those shifts. Since 2007, the U.S. Department of Defense has listed climate change as a national security issue, citing rising sea levels as a direct and imminent threat to naval bases across the country and the globe.\nLast spring, surging rivers upended rural communities in the Midwest, crippling farm and ranching economies in a preview of food and water shortages that have already hit other parts of the globe. Just weeks later, climate scientists reported the hottest June and July on record, with heat levels that were not predicted to arrive until closer to 2050. There have been unprecedented and devastating forest fires in California, in Europe, in the Amazon Rainforest and most recently in Australia.\nIndia, already subject to an unpredictable monsoon season, saw some of its most severe flooding in 100 years last year. In September 2019, Hurricane Dorian ravaged the Bahamas in a pattern of extreme weather than has become increasingly common (in the near future, climate scientists have predicted a worsening pattern, including up to six climate disasters taking place at the same time).\nSo what will artists do locally in 2020? Will they document their own environmental practices, as New Haven artist Kathryn Frund has done in chronicling the build and decomposition of her own compost piles? Will they compel viewers to see themselves in dying microscopic organisms, as artist Cynthia Beth Rubin has done in her solo Do Plankton Have Feelings, up at Artspace through Feb. 29 of this year? Can they push themselves and those around them to do more?\n|An installation shot from Do Plankton Have Feelings, up at Artspace New Haven through Feb. 29. Lucy Gellman Photo.|\nFor Joann Moran, co-founder of the enviro-arts nonprofit Lots of Fish, the answer is yes. Reached by phone, Moran suggested that it falls to artists to translate impersonal, sometimes daunting scientific data into visual material that viewers can understand and interpret for themselves. She recalled working on a project several years ago that turned carbon sequestration data into speech bubbles that she affixed to trees. Now, she applies that same approach to voter recruitment and watershed conservation with rain barrel and storm drain art, often completed with New Haven Public Schools students and teens in the city's Youth @ Work program.\n“I think every individual has to take what moves them, and apply it to the bigger picture,” she said. “I try to go to practical problem solving through art. I try to employ projects that have a direct impact through art, so it can be seen as a tool of habitat restoration.”\n“Even if we got rid of all the fossil fuels, the planet would still be crashing,” she continued. “We have to implement easy and sustainable practices. How does caring about the local watershed translate to understanding the greater climate problem? A project like the rain barrel connects people with the fact that they are part of their habitat, instead of using whatever resources are convenient to their lifestyle.”\n|A marine-themed storm drain mural that came out of a collaboration between Lots Of Fish, Connecticut Fund for the Environment/Save the Sound, Cold Spring School, and John Martinez Sea & Sky STEM Magnet. Lucy Gellman Photo.|\nSo too Martha Wilette Lewis, curator at the Institute Library and host of “The Flux Capacitor” at the Bridgeport radio station WPKN. At the beginning of 2019, Lewis made a commitment not to buy new clothing, because the fashion industry is one of the planet’s biggest polluters. If she can’t mend an existing item, she looks to thrift and vintage stores until she’s found it.\nShe has been vocal about climate change in her work for years, including the cataclysmic and bizarre aftermath of the Mount Tambora eruption over two centuries ago. After that eruption, she explained, there were global crop shortages, unexpected months of darkness, air pollution, drenching rain and freak blizzards in the middle of New York’s summer months. But there was also an explosion of creativity, including among other works Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. In getting viewers to look at the installation, she said, she also urged them to think about the weather more than they had before.\n“I try and make these measures on an individual basis, but until larger corporations take it on, it's a gesture,” she said in an interview last November, noting the consequences warm water had on the 2019 scallop harvest in New York. “Until medical offices, dental offices, airlines, fast food restaurants start taking this whole thing seriously, it’s a small drop in the ocean.”\nBut it’s a meaningful drop, she added. In her artistic practice, she has moved away from toxic solvents in her work and turned more often to reuse. She praised artists for their ability to imagine new and different worlds, in which hope and humor can live beside gloomy warnings that are often drenched in fear. During a pledge drive and Joni Mitchell birthday celebration at WPKN, she expanded that approach to the radio station, sourcing used t-shirts from a local Goodwill before they were screen printed by a local artist. As a result, no one shirt was identical.\n“Art can inform, but artists also perform the really important function of imagining other possibilities, presenting other worlds, realities outcomes, visions,” she noted. “That can really be helpful in terms of providing focus and hope, rather than say just parroting narratives of fear and doom or scolding.”\n“Me as an artist, do I make an impact?” she added. “Yes, I do. We all have a responsibility to be talking about it.”""]"	['<urn:uuid:871a6bfd-561c-4d95-a428-862241ee00c7>', '<urn:uuid:7bd10b45-700d-483c-b656-bc9ae43c36c3>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	7	97	2682

Such clamshell packaging is problematic for perishable items such as produce that require a certain range of moisture, as the packaging fails to provide precise control of internal moisture, which often accelerates spoilage of the contents.\n Clamshell packaging (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,845,878 to Hayes) can also be problematic in that consumers increasingly see plastic as ecologically irresponsible and often unwilling to purchase contents in such packaging.\n While plastic baskets are also used such as those used for various types of berries, such packaging is generally not biodegradable and increases the waste in the landfills.\n It is known to have paper produce containers, and exemplary containers are discussed in U.S. Patent Appl. No. 2008/0302808 to Maxwell, Japanese Patent No. 6156469 filed on Nov. 26, 1992, U.S. Pat. No. 4982872 to Avery; and WIPO Patent Appl. No. 2008/076075 to Lim, et al. Although biodegradable for the most part, the paper containers known to Applicant suffer from similar disadvantages as the plastic clamshell packaging.\n Thus, there is still a need for a biodegradable container that allow consumers to view the container\'s contents from multiple sides at the point of sale, while also precisely controlling the container\'s internal moisture.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The inventive subject matter provides apparatus, systems and methods in which an enclosure for housing produce or other perishable items comprises a mesh basket having a rigid lattice structure that includes at least a side and a bottom. As used herein, the term ""produce"" means fruit, vegetables, and other agricultural goods. Other items (e.g., non-edible items) are also contemplated.\n The structure includes a plurality of lattice elements that collectively define a plurality of visually non-occluded lattice holes. As used herein, the term ""lattice"" includes both regular and irregular patterns. As used herein, the term ""non-occluded"" means at least 70% of visible light passes through the lattice hole at normal room intensity, and therefore includes slightly opaque, or at least as much light as passes through a non-tinted glass window. For example, the lattice could have a structure comprising squiggle-shaped lattice elements or a structure having a higher density of lattice elements in one area compared with the surrounding area. Alternatively, the lattice could have a regular structure including, for example, a pattern of diamond-shaped or square-shaped lattice elements.\n In preferred embodiments, the apparent collective area of the lattice holes is at least 40%, more preferably, at least 50%, and most preferably, at least 60% of the apparent collective area of the lattice structure. As used herein, the ""apparent surface area"" of the basket is the outside surface area of the basket\'s sides, walls, and optional top. Thus, for example, even if the basket had a concave bottom, the entire concave outer surface of the bottom would be included in the basket\'s apparent surface area. However, the side wall of each lattice hole, as compared to the outside surface of the lattice elements, is not included in the basket\'s apparent surface area. In addition, the apparent surface area would not include an open top, such as if the basket lacked a lid or other closure.\n Unless the context dictates the contrary, all ranges set forth herein should be interpreted as being inclusive of their endpoints and open-ended ranges should be interpreted to include only commercially practical values. Similarly, all lists of values should be considered as inclusive of intermediate values unless the context indicates the contrary.\n Optionally, the basket can have one or more film layers that preferably cover at least 100 cm2 of the apparent collective area of the lattice holes. Preferably, the film layers are essentially transparent, although translucent film is also contemplated.\n Various objects, features, aspects and advantages of the inventive subject matter will become more apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, along with the accompanying drawing figures in which like numerals represent like components.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING\n FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an embodiment of a basket.\n FIGS. 2-4 are top views of alternative embodiments of a basket.\n FIG. 5 is a side view of another embodiment of a basket having a top.\n In FIG. 1, a mesh basket 100 is shown for housing produce. The basket 100 can include a rigid lattice structure 102 forming at least a side 104 and a bottom 106, however, it is contemplated that the side wall 104 can have a different lattice structure than the bottom 106. Optionally, the structure 102 can also comprise a top (not shown).\n Preferred baskets 100 have a structure 102 sufficiently rigid to protect the internal contents of the basket 100 from being crushed, and include a closed bottom 106, an open top 108, and a fibrous side wall 104. It is desirable for the basket 100 to withstand a weight of up to 50 lbs without significant deformation. Preferably, the basket can withstand at least 5 lbs, at least 10 lbs, at least 15 lbs, at least 20 lbs, and more preferably at least 30 lbs of force without significant deformation. As used herein, ""fibrous side wall"" means a wall comprising a fibrous material as a significant structural constituent. The fibrous wall contemplated herein preferably has at least 2, 5, 10, 20 or even 30 dry weight percent of fibers. Preferably, the fibrous wall has at least 80 or 90 dry weight percent of fibers.\n As used herein ""fibrous material"" means materials characterized by a plurality of discrete fibers. The filaments can be plant or animal derived, synthetic, or some combination of these. In ""plant-derived fibrous materials"" the filaments are at least predominantly of plant origin, examples of which include wood, papyrus, rice, ficus, mulberry, fibers, cotton, yucca, sisal, bowstring hemp and New Zealand flax. Paper is generally a fibrous material that is usually made by pressing and de-watering moist fibers, typically cellulose pulp derived from wood rags, or grasses.\n The basket 100 is advantageously composed of one or more biodegradable materials including, for example, die cut paper, chipboard that has been glued, molded fiber, and other fibrous materials. As used herein, a ""biodegradable material"" means a material that will break down to at least 90% H2O, CO2, and biomass within a period of six months from the action of naturally occurring micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi, algae etc. under favorable conditions. For example, meat, plants, wood, cotton, animal protein, and paper are all deemed herein to be biodegradable.\n The basket 100 has a rectangular cross-section, but it is contemplated that the basket could have a circular, elliptical, or any other commercially suitable horizontal cross-section.\n The lattice structure 102 preferably includes a plurality of lattice elements 110 that compose the structure 102. Each of the lattice elements 110 define at least a portion of a lattice hole 112, and collectively define a plurality of lattice holes 112. Preferred lattice holes 112 are visually non-occlusive. The non-occluded lattice holes advantageously allow the contents of the baskets to be viewed from the top and the bottom without requiring removal of the contents from the basket and without requiring opening of the container when a lid is present.\n In preferred embodiments, the apparent collective area of the lattice holes is at least 20%, more preferably at least 40%, and most preferably at least 50%, of the apparent collective area of the lattice structure.\n As shown in FIG. 1, the lattice elements define a regular pattern comprising a plurality of lattice holes having a rectangular shape. However, it is contemplated that the lattice elements could define other regular patterns including, for example, diamond-shaped holes, circular or ovular holes, or other sized and dimensioned holes, as well as irregular patterns including, for example, those shown in FIGS. 3-4.\n It is contemplated that the lattices structure could vary in number, size and dimension depending on the basket\'s use and the desired strength and rigidity of the basket. Thus, for example, a basket for strawberries might have lattice holes with smaller dimensions than a basket for apples. In addition, the lattice holes can be of any commercially-suitable size and shape including, for example, circles, squares, and rectangles.\n As shown in FIG. 1, the basket 100 can include a film layer 120 that covers at least a portion, and preferably, at least 100 cm2 of the apparent collective area of the lattice holes, and more preferably, at least the top portion of the basket 100. The film layer 120 is preferably transparent, or at least translucent, such that a consumer can view the contents of the basket 100 through the film layer 120. This is beneficial as the film layer(s) helps prevent insects and other pests from reaching the contents while maintaining a desired level of moisture within the basket 100. The film layer 120 is preferably attached to the basket 100 using an adhesive, although any commercially suitable fastener could be used.\n The film layer 120 preferably comprises a water permeability sufficient to resist water for the expected useful life of the basket 100, and preferably at least 14 days, and more preferably up to 28 days. Further, the film layer 120 may have perforations or holes to allow sufficient air flow to ensure maximal freshness of the intended contents of the basket 100.\n Although film layer 120 could be used to cover the open spaces of the basket 100, the basket 100 could alternatively have additional film layers such that the open spaces of the basket 100 are covered by the film layers. For example, a first film layer could be used to cover a bottom 106 and side 104 of the basket 100. Then once the contents are placed in the basket 100, a second film layer can be provided to enclose the contents within the basket 100. Such additional film layer can be fastened to the basket by an adhesive or other commercially suitable fastener(s). Alternatively or additionally, a rubber band could be used to retain the film layer(s) 120. In this instance, and where other upper limits are not expressly stated, the reader should infer a reasonable upper limit. In this instance, for example, a commercially reasonable upper limit is about ten.\n Preferred film layer(s) are composed of one or more biodegradable materials such that the layer(s) provide for a semi permeable, and at least partially transparent, moisture barrier. This advantageously allows for precise moisture control of the basket\'s contents. The film layers will depend on the contents of the basket and the external environment to which the basket is subjected. Preferred films include those manufactured by, for example, Maverick®, Bloomer Plastics®, Natural Flexible®, Evlon®, and EarthFirst® PLA.\n At least a portion of the inner surfaces of the basket 100 can advantageously include a permeation barrier material to reduce the transfer rate of the surfaces and thereby retain the rigidity of the basket. As used herein, a statement that a surface ""includes a permeation barrier material"" means that the surface is treated with an additive that has a transfer rate of less than or equal to 50 μl of water and/or sunflower oil per cm2 per six-month period of time at room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure (STP).\n Preferred permeation barriers comprise vegetable or petroleum wax, vulcanized latex, plant resins, and cellophane. Other suitable permeation barrier materials include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,344,784 to Hodson or US20050130261 to Wils.\n FIG. 2 illustrates another embodiment of a mesh basket 200 having a rigid lattice structure 202 forming at least four sides 204 and a bottom 206. With respect to the remaining numerals in FIG. 2, the same considerations for like components with like numerals of FIG. 1 apply.\n In FIG. 3, an alternative embodiment of a mesh basket 300 is shown having an irregular lattice structure 302. With respect to the remaining numerals in FIG. 3, the same considerations for like components with like numerals of FIG. 1 apply.\n FIG. 4 illustrates yet another embodiment of a mesh basket 400 having an irregular lattice structure 402 composed of strings 410, which form a plurality of lattice holes 412. With respect to the remaining numerals in FIG. 4, the same considerations for like components with like numerals of FIG. 1 apply.\n FIG. 5 illustrates yet another embodiment of a mesh basket 500 having a top 530 with a second lattice structure 532 having a plurality of lattice holes 534. Although the lattice structure 502 of the mesh basket 500 is the same as the lattice structure 532 of the top 530, it is also contemplated that the lattice structures 502 and 532 could be different. The top can have a clamshell configuration or other commercially suitable configurations. With respect to the remaining numerals in FIG. 5, the same considerations for like components with like numerals of FIG. 1 apply.\n It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that many more modifications besides those already described are possible without departing from the inventive concepts herein. The inventive subject matter, therefore, is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the appended claims. Moreover, in interpreting both the specification and the claims, all terms should be interpreted in the broadest possible manner consistent with the context. In particular, the terms ""comprises"" and ""comprising"" should be interpreted as referring to elements, components, or steps in a non-exclusive manner, indicating that the referenced elements, components, or steps may be present, or utilized, or combined with other elements, components, or steps that are not expressly referenced. Where the specification claims refers to at least one of something selected from the group consisting of A, B, C . . . and N, the text should be interpreted as requiring only one element from the group, not A plus N, or B plus N, etc.\nPatent applications by Ellery West, Crescent City, CA US\nPatent applications by Gail West, Crescent City, CA US\nPatent applications in class Apertured sidewall (e.g., hole, slot, etc.)\nPatent applications in all subclasses Apertured sidewall (e.g., hole, slot, etc.)']"	['<urn:uuid:fb043b4e-d278-4fec-8438-f306f8e9ec09>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	8	81	2919
69	warming techniques keeping temperature pancakes versus hollandaise sauce serving time	The warming techniques for pancakes and hollandaise sauce during serving differ significantly. Pancakes can be kept warm by wrapping them in foil or placing them in a Dutch oven at 200°F lined with foil. In contrast, hollandaise sauce requires more delicate temperature control - it must be held in a bain inside a hot water bath, kept away from direct burner heat, and changed regularly during service to prevent breaking. If the hollandaise starts to thin, it can be fixed with lukewarm water and vigorous whisking, or re-emulsified with lemon juice.	['Camping and pancakes just seem to go together. Sitting at the picnic table with a stack of fluffy round pillows, drizzled in maple syrup. If you serve them with a couple strips of bacon and a cup of coffee, it’s breakfast heaven.\nWhenever our troop goes camping, there is always at least one patrol that serves pancakes for breakfast. And, while pancakes are relatively simple to make, there are a few tricks to attaining those light, fluffy pillows we all dream about. Come on, admit it. I know you dream about pancakes, too.\nOn my Outdoor Cooking Skill Progression Chart, I put pancakes a couple steps up for the following reasons: You have to measure your ingredients because, technically, you’re baking and there is some chemistry involved. It is hard not to over mix them. Skillet and griddle work is a little more challenging because you have to manage your heat better. And, then there is the whole flipping the pancake that takes a bit of skill and coordination, and practice.\nSo, let’s dive into the principles of pancakes and I’ll share best practices and common mistakes.\nWhen prepping the pancakes, you want to divide the ingredients into two categories: dry and wet.\nDry ingredients include flour (AP, whole wheat, rice, almond, etc.), sugar (granulated or brown), baking powder (to make them light and fluffy), and salt (balances and enhances the flavors). Your dry ingredients can be prepped at home and loaded into a container or resealable bag. Just be sure you are making enough because you won’t be able to prep more in camp.\nWet ingredients include milk (buttermilk, milk or non-dairy milk), fat (butter or vegetable oil), eggs (for structure and adds to the light and fluffiness), and extract (vanilla, almond, etc.). Your wet ingredients can also be prepped at home and poured into a tightly sealed plastic bottle for the ride to camp in your cooler.\nPrepping and Mixing\nIn two separate bowls mix together all your dry ingredients and all your wet ingredients. When you are ready to combine, make a little well in your dry ingredients and pour in the wet ingredients. Gently stir together just until combined. DO NOT OVERMIX. Resist the urge to stir out every single lump until it’s totally smooth. Trust me, a few lumps are okay.\nIf you over mix the batter you will end up with stacks of tough and chewy pancakes instead of the light and fluffy ones you were probably dreaming about. Tough and chewy pancakes are only good for one thing: Frisbee.\nSo, mix the batter just until the wet and dry ingredients are combined, and there are no more visible wisps of flour. The batter will be lumpy and, again, that’s okay.\nResting the Batter\nI usually mix my pancake batter and then turn my stove, which allows my batter to rest while the griddle heats. Resting the batter anywhere from 5-15 minutes allows the glutens that were activated during mixing to rest and relax. Also, the starch molecules in the flour have a chance to fully absorb the liquid. This will give the batter a thicker consistency.\nIt’s important to allow time for the griddle to get good and hot evenly. You want medium heat or about 375°F. Too low and your pancakes just won’t cook. Too high and they will be burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. We’re going for the Goldilocks heat: Just right. And, you may need to adjust along the way so don’t be afraid to do that.\nA good way to test your griddle is to wet your fingers with water and flick it onto the surface of the griddle. The griddle is ready if the water droplets sizzle and dance before they eventually evaporate. Medium heat will give us pancakes that are golden-brown on the outside with slightly crispy edges, and soft but cooked through on the inside. Pancake perfection!\nGreasing the Griddle\nI can’t count how often my young chefs don’t do this and it always leads to disaster and pancake tragedy. Always pack extra vegetable oil when you plan to make pancakes.\nWhen the griddle is up to temp, add a light coating of oil. We prefer vegetable oil, which tends to have a higher smoke point than butter and won’t add any flavor to the pancakes like olive oil.\nAfter your oil has a moment to warm, you can begin adding batter to the griddle. Try to control your excitement. We’re not out of the woods just yet.\nI prefer to use a ¼-cup measuring cup. It makes for a nice-sized pancake that is easy to flip. Depending on the size of your griddle, you could also get 6-8 pancakes per batch. This is important because once the pancakes start going down, the vultures will start circling.\nIf you have the griddle real estate and you are a more experienced pancake flipper, you could bump up to a ½-cup to 1-cup measuring cup for bigger pancakes. You can also use a smaller measuring scoop to make little silver dollar pancakes. Those are always fun.\nLightly coat the griddle with vegetable oil about every other batch of pancakes. Keep it light! Don’t let oil accumulate on your griddle or let your griddle run dry. If you see oil accumulating on the griddle, just use your spatula to redistribute it around the griddle. Remember to adjust the heat if you need to.\nPancakes should be flipped once, and only once, during cooking. And as long as you didn’t flip them too soon, you won’t need to flip them any more than that. Flipping pancakes too many times causes them to deflate, losing some of that wonderful fluffy texture.\nAs the pancake cooks, bubbles will start to form on the surface. Do not be tempted to pop them. I know, it’s fun, but when you pop the bubbles, you are releasing air from the neighboring chambers, essentially “flattening” the finished cake by vacating the air that was giving it some of its rise and fluff.\nThe pancake is ready to flip when the bubbles start to pop on their own and your edges are lightly browned and a little crispy, and the pancake is looking dry around the outer edges. If you’re still a little unsure, it’s okay to gently lift an edge and sneak a peek underneath. Generally, it will take about 2 minutes for the first side and 1-2 minutes for the second side. The most important thing is for the middle to be cooked.\nIf you are adding extras like fruit to the pancakes, add after you pour the batter onto the griddle. Blueberries are a classic add on, but you could also add sliced bananas, chocolate chips, nuts, or whatever you like.\nWhen you’re ready to serve the pancakes, you can serve with butter and maple syrup; however, you can also add flavored syrups, chocolate sauce, caramel sauce, peanut butter, cream cheese, fruits, nuts, whipping cream, and sprinkles. Just to name a few.\nServe your pancakes immediately or keep them warm by wrapping them in foil. If I’m making pancakes for a crowd and I want us to all eat together, I’ll warm up one of my large Dutch ovens to about 200°F and line it with foil. As I off load each batch, I add them to the Dutch oven to keep them warm.\nIt’s no fun to put stone-cold syrup on warm pancakes. If it’s a cold morning, you should warm your syrup. Your campers will love you for it.\nHere are a few of our favorite pancake recipes (and we’re always adding more) because pancakes are something we dream about:\nSnoqualmie Falls Oatmeal Pancakes\nPumpkin Spice Pancakes\nCinnamon Roll Pancakes\nIf you like this blog and don’t want to miss a single post, subscribe to Chuck Wagoneer by clicking on the Follow Us button in the upper right corner and follow us on Facebook and Pinterest for the latest updates and more stuff!', '2 quarts water\n1 Tablespoon white vinegar\n4-well toasted Thomas’s English muffins, generously buttered\n8 slices Canadian bacon\nFor Hollandaise Sauce\n½ pound butter, melted just before use\n3 egg yolks\n2 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n¼ cayenne pepper\n1. Bring water to a boil in wide, high-sided sauteuse.\n2. Add white vinegar; reduce heat to a healthy simmer.\n3. Crack each egg into a ramekin, then tip the ramekin into the simmering wter. Swirl the water gently with your spoon to create motion. For grade A, large eggs right out of the refrigerator, poach for 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Arrange the English muffins in matched pairs (one top, one bottom) on the plate.\n4. Warm the Canadian bacon on the griddle and set on each English muffin.\n5. Retrieve the eggs with a slotted spoon, rest your spoon brieftly on a folded dish towel to drain, then set the eggs on the muffins.\n6. Drape each egg with a generous spoonful of the hollandaise sauce.\nIf you are working the egg station, take care with your poaching water throughout the shift. Clean it frequently and go easy on the vinegar-it makes the whites chalky and sour and the eggs have a pockmarked appearance if you put too much acid in the water. Snip the long white tails of cooked egg white so your eggs don’t look like pollywogs/sperm. And please use the ramekin for tipping each egg into the water bath –there is no episode more crushing during the middle of insane brunch than to crack an egg directly into the water only to discover the yolk is already broken, making egg drop soup of your poaching bath.\nFor the Hollandaise Sauce\n1. Put the yolks in stainless steel bowl. Whisk in the lemon juice. Secure the bowl on a damp kitchen towel, and pour the hot melted butter into the yolk mixture in a steady stream, whisking constantly, always keeping the emulsion.\n2. As it thickens up, it will feel thick and heading toward pasty, but at the very end, whisk in all the watery and separated milk solids from the bottom of the melted butter and it will think out to a ribbony and silken sauce. Please don’t deviate from this method by clarifying the butter or by whisking it over a double boiler or by melting the butter in a microwave-this is really how I want it and also I have never broken a batch of hollandaise in 15 years of Prune brunch.\n3. Hold your hollandaise warm in a bain inside a hot water bain, but change it out regularly during service and keep it as far away from the heat of your burners in your station as you can. This is a pretty sturdy version, but still. Hollandaise is a fragile sauce and that blasting heat in the sauté station can break it. If you need to think during service, use 1 Tablespoon of lukewarm water and whisk vigorously. If you need to re-emulsify during service, add a squeeze of lemon juice and whisk briskly. But then taste if it needs a little reseasoning.\n4. When seasoning, please keep in mind that the sauce will be dulled significantly by the runny egg yolks of the poached eggs as well as the buttered English muffin in the finish fish, so be sure to season high and bright with lemon and salt and cayenne. The cayenne, however, should only provide “warmth,” not heat- we are not a southwest restaurant.']	['<urn:uuid:ffb6b834-a627-472d-aba2-3972d734788d>', '<urn:uuid:e6517ac8-bb35-40e7-b16d-c72b793e85e5>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	10	91	1923

For home office deductions, expenses can be calculated through either actual costs (direct and indirect costs based on square footage) or the simplified method ($5 per square foot up to 300 square feet). The deduction cannot exceed the business's gross income.	['The Best Tax Software To Use If You’re Self\nSupporting Identification Documents must be original or copies certified by the issuing agency. Original supporting documentation for dependents must be included in the application. For tax years beginning after 2017, applicants claimed as dependents must also prove U.S. residency unless the applicant is a dependent of U.S. military personnel stationed overseas. A passport that doesn’t have a date of entry won’t be accepted as a stand-alone identification document for dependents. If H&R Block makes an error on your return, we’ll pay resulting penalties and interest. The audit risk assessment is not a guarantee you will not be audited. However, if you use other bookkeeping programs then TurboTax Self-Employed may NOT be the most budget-friendly option.\n- If it finds any errors, it helps you correct them by taking you directly to the problematic fields, allowing you to change them, and taking you back to Complete Check.\n- They also make it easy to fill out your state return after going through your federal return.\n- One standout feature for H&R Block is its physical locations.\n- Luckily, TurboTax has this detailed blog post on Ride-Sharing Income Taxes that walks you through how to file your income taxes if you fall into this category in 5 easy steps.\n- If this is the case and you’ve paid more taxes than you owe after filing your taxes, you’ll receive a tax refund.\n- If you have very basic tax needs and are able to file a simple tax return, you may actually be able to file utilizing the TurboTax Free Edition.\nBoth services allow you to import your previous returns no matter which tax service you used . They also make it easy to fill out your state return after going through your federal return. Your information quickly transfers so you don’t waste time retyping everything. H&R Block and TurboTax both offer a free option for filers with simple returns. You can often use those options if you don’t own a home, you have no investment income other than simple dividends or interest and you don’t have rental properties or business expenses. Self-employed men and women often have more complicated tax returns. There are a host of 1099 forms to compile and enter and self-employment taxes to pay.\nPerhaps one of the biggest benefits of using TurboTax Self-Employed is that you have access to general customer support, tax experts, or self-employment specialists depending on which plan you choose. This is super beneficial if you’re a new business owner or have a more complex return than you’ve had in the past. TurboTax Self-Employed is a tax software for freelancers, contract workers, and small business owners.\nIntuit Turbotax 2022 Tax Year Specs\nPeople say the program is well thought out and painless to navigate.

FreeTaxUSA also allowed me to deduct my freelance expenses for no extra cost, which helped reduce my tax bill. The questions don’t come with as many cool graphics, but they’re still clear and easy to answer. When we get to the state tax section, I learn that TurboTax will charge me an additional fee for each state I need to file in.\nWhile it costs a little more than the competition, its features make it super easy to file your return quickly and accurately. From the beginning, turbotax self-employed makes it easy to determine which plan is right for you. TurboTax Self-Employed options include the TurboTax Free plan, which is only suitable for simple tax returns. The dark side, if there is one, of these multiple offerings from TurboTax is that you never know if you are paying more than you need to for these helpful services. The object of doing tax returns, is, of course, to save money, not just to reduce anxiety. You end up paying a lot of money if you purchase peace of mind in every way that TurboTax recommends you do.\nWhat Is Turbotax Self\nFor example, self-employed workers who were suddenly working entirely from home may have made the den or the unused bedroom exclusively a place of business. However, be sure to read ZDNet’s home office deductions checklist. None of the software packages do a really good job of spelling out just what is, and what is not, allowable as workspace deductions, so your best bet is to understand the situation before starting the process. The web-only online forms completion task guides users through a narrative set of questions about their business, such as “Do you need to enter information for another business?” when filling out business income. TurboTax Self-Employed products are powered by proven technology from the #1 best-selling tax software provider, TurboTax.\nWe gather data from the best available sources, including vendor and retailer listings as well as other relevant and independent reviews sites. And we pore over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the products and services we’re assessing. Accurately organizing and reporting your business expenses is a good way to reduce your overall tax burden and increase the size of your tax refund.\nThe difference is not in the amount of income that is taxed, but in that when you are working for yourself, there is no employer who will automatically be withholding this tax with each paycheck. As a self-employed individual, the onus of setting aside the money will fall on you.\nThe last step is to pay for the product and e-file your taxes. QuickBooks Self-Employed allows you to classify income and expenses using categories that align with the IRS Schedule C, such as utilities, legal fees, and commissions. Once this information is entered, you can view and print a summary of your taxable income and expenses, which can take some of the guesswork out of filing your taxes. If your plan doesn’t include the Tax Bundle, you can use this summary to input your Schedule C information into a tax program of your choice manually.\nHow Much Should You Pay For Tax Software?\nFreeTaxUSA emphasizes the value provided for free federal filings, including Schedule C and 1099 income and deductions, which it contrasts to the need to purchase upgrades from TurboTax and others.

Whether people have left an office job because of downsizing or retirement, or have chosen to start a sideline activity for extra income, working from home reduces startup costs and may provide personal benefits (e.g., managing child care or parental care responsibilities). Technology enables an entrepreneur working in a home office to connect with customers, clients, and other business associates around the world. The Small Business Association’s Office of Advocacy reported in March 2014 that 52% of all businesses in the United States are home based (“Frequently Asked Questions,” http://bit.ly/2q14K9O). The ease of starting a home business does not, however, detract from the various legal, tax, and financial concerns that must be addressed.\nWhile zoning laws can be behind the times, they do not necessarily preclude operating a business from home. Issues arise when—\n- there are multiple employees or a constant stream of customers, which may disturb the neighbors, create parking problems, or raise other concerns;\n- there are noises or odors connected to the business; or\n- the business is a type restricted from a residential area.\nThere may be restrictions on the amount of space that can be dedicated to business use. For example, Miami–Dade County restricts home office space to 200 square feet.\nEven when a business can operate from a home, there usually are restrictions on signage. It is therefore essential to check with the city or town about zoning restrictions and related rules.\nEven if local zoning rules do not bar a home office, the terms of a homeowners association (HOA) may restrict having certain businesses, or any at all, within the community. Again, a review of covenants, conditions, and restrictions in the HOA agreement will show what is or is not permissible. For example, there may be a bar on commercial vehicles, which would preclude a limousine or moving business, but not necessarily an insurance or interior decorating business. Similar restrictions may be imposed on owners of cooperative apartments.\nEven if businesses are permitted to operate from the home, there may be other building or commercial codes that come into play. For example, Massachusetts’s Department of Public Health restricts the types of food that can and cannot be prepared in a residential kitchen for sale outside the home (e.g., in a catering business).\nA person operating a business from home should not assume that his homeowners policy covers business-related liability. If, for example, a business client is injured in the home office, this incident may be excluded from a basic homeowners policy. Similarly, if a fire destroys a home, office equipment may not be covered. It is essential for a home-based business to have a separate business owner’s policy (BOP) to cover liability to third parties, as well as damage or destruction to equipment or inventory in the home. Alternatively, it may be possible to adjust an existing homeowners policy to cover these concerns.\nSome localities require businesses, even if home based, to obtain a license to operate. For example, Chicago has a regulated business license requirement for home occupations. There may be fees for such a business license (e.g., $250 for two years in Chicago).\nThe costs of a home office can be deductible, effectively converting personal expenses into a business write-off [Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 280A]. The following two tests must be satisfied to be eligible for a home office deduction.\nCondition 1: qualified use.\nThe home office must be used for one of the following:\n- The principal place of business. Essentially, this means where business revenue is earned, as well as the place where substantial administrative tasks are performed, such as ordering supplies, scheduling appointments, and keeping the books, as long as there is no other location for the business. For example, a plumber who does work at customer locations can take a home office deduction if the space is used for administration of the business.\n- A place to meet or deal with customers, clients, or patients in the ordinary course of business. Thus, an accountant with an office in town who uses her home office to physically meet with clients meets this test. Using a home office solely to make phone calls or send email does not satisfy this requirement.\n- A separate structure (e.g., greenhouse, freestanding garage) used in connection with the business.\nCondition 2: regular and exclusive use.\nThe space in the home must be used regularly and exclusively for business. The home office space cannot serve a dual purpose, such as a den used for business during working hours and for watching television with the family after business hours (with the exception of day care businesses). In one case [Bulas v. Comm’r, T.C. Memo. 2011-201 (2011)], the costs related to a bathroom built for an accountant’s clients could not be deducted because his children and personal guests used the bathroom occasionally. Such incidental use, however, may not necessarily violate the second condition. In another case [Miller v. Comm’r,T.C. Summary Opinion 2014-74 (2014)], a taxpayer who used part of a studio apartment as a home office was allowed a deduction even though she had to pass through the office space to get to the bedroom area.\nTypically, a home office is a spare bedroom or converted attic created as a workspace. A home office can, however, be any part of a residence, including a garage, a freestanding greenhouse, or a barn. The space does not have to be a full room or even a partitioned area to qualify. It may be helpful to take a photo of the space to show that it is, indeed, used only for business.\nDeducting actual costs.\nThe costs of a home office can be figured in two ways: actual costs or an IRS-set simplified method. Under the actual cost method, expenses related to a home office are either indirect costs or direct costs. Indirect costs are those applicable to the whole residence (e.g., home mortgage interest and property taxes, rent, utilities, homeowners/renters insurance, monthly security alarm charges). The portion of these costs taken into account is based on the square footage of the business space; for example, if 10% of the home is used for business, then 10% of the rent is taken into account in calculating the home office deduction.\nFor personal expenses that are deductible as itemized deductions (e.g., mortgage interest), the portion related to the home office is part of the business write-off; the balance is taken into account on Schedule A of Form 1040 as a personal write-off.\nIf the home is owned (not rented), the home office deduction includes an allowance for depreciation. The amount of depreciation is based on the lower of the adjusted basis of the home or its fair market value at the time the space is converted to business use (exclusive of the land).\nDirect costs are those exclusively related to the business space. For example, repairs to a spare bedroom used as a home office are direct costs that become fully deductible as part of the home office deduction.\nInstead of tracking all home-related expenses and categorizing direct and indirect costs, the home office deduction can be figured using a simplified method (Revenue Procedure 2013-13). The deduction under the simplified method is figured by multiplying the square footage of the home office (up to a maximum of 300 square feet) by $5. This method allows a homeowner to fully deduct home mortgage interest and real estate taxes as personal itemized deductions, even though these expenses are essentially factored into the home office deduction.\nThe election to use the safe harbor deduction can be made on an annual basis. Once it is used for a particular year, however, the election is irrevocable.\nGross income requirement.\nWhichever method is used to figure the home office deduction, the amount of the deduction cannot exceed the gross income earned by the business. Thus, for startups, the home office deduction may be limited or barred entirely due to this gross income requirement. Any deduction calculated under the simplified method that is limited by the gross income requirement cannot be carried over and is lost forever. The amount limited under the actual expense method can be carried over and claimed in a future year to the extent of gross income from the business, whether or not in the same residence.\nSpecial issues for owner-employees.\nIf a business is incorporated, how should home office costs be handled? There are three ways to do this:\n- Claim a home office deduction. Use of the home office must be for the convenience of the employer, but an owner-employee of the business obviously satisfies this test when there is no other location. Despite qualifying for the deduction, however, there may be little or no tax advantage to it. The deduction is claimed by the owner-employee as an unreimbursed employee business expense, so only miscellaneous itemized deductions in excess of 2% of adjusted gross income are actually allowed. What’s more, the deductions are also subject to the phase-out of itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers.\n- Rent the home office to the corporation. If an owner-employee rents part of the home to the corporation, the corporation deducts the rent; the same rent is, however, taxable to the owner-employee, and no home office deduction is allowed [IRC section 280A(c)(6)]. While this may not be optimal, the rental payment is preferable to a salary increase to cover home office deduction costs because no employment taxes are due on the rental payment.\n- Use a reimbursement arrangement. An owner-employee can obtain reimbursement for the costs of a home office under an accountable plan; the costs of the home office become deductible by the corporation, while the owner-employee is not taxed on the reimbursement. If the reimbursement covers mortgage interest and property taxes on the home, the owner-employee cannot take deductions for these amounts. Requirements for an accountable plan are found in IRS Publication 463, Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses (http://bit.ly/2rwHTof).\nSome businesses operate from mobile homes or recreational vehicles (RV), and owners may try to claim a depreciation for them as well as other business expenses for operating them. This may be difficult to do, as the following cases illustrate:\n- Cartwright v. Comm’r, T.C. Memo 2015-212. An orthopedic surgeon used an RV as a place from which to respond to “stat” pages within five minutes when he was on call from the hospital. The Tax Court limited depreciation and an IRC section 179 deduction to modest business use, rather than the amount that the doctor had claimed. The RV was used primarily for recreational purposes.\n- Jackson v. Comm’r, T.C. Memo 2014-160. An insurance agent used an RV to meet clients and sell insurance, and it was agreed that about 2/3 of the mileage was for business driving. Nonetheless, the Tax Court disallowed a home office deduction because the RV was also used for personal purposes (i.e., no space within the RV was exclusively used for business). While use of the RV was “appropriate and helpful” to the business, a home office deduction for its costs was barred (although some RV costs were deductible).\n- Dunford v. Comm’r, T.C. Memo 2013-189. A consultant who used an RV to travel around the United States could deduct interest on the loan to buy the vehicle, but not other business deductions. The Tax Court ruled that he had blended purposes—personal and business—for the travel, but that the dominant motive was personal (to be near his children and to winter in a warmer climate).\nHOME BUSINESS CHECKLIST\n- ___ Do zoning laws permit running a business from home?\n- ___ Do city/town ordinances restrict signage?\n- ___ Does the HOA bar or limit a home-based business?\n- ___ Has the requisite insurance been acquired?\n- ___ Does the office qualify for the home office deduction?\n- ___ Has the impact of the home office deduction on a future sale of the residence been considered?\nAudit risk for the home office deduction.\nThere continues to be a prevailing belief that claiming a home office deduction is an audit red flag, even though there are no IRS audit statistics or IRS warnings on this point. Individuals using a home office who meet eligibility requirements and can substantiate their costs should probably take the deduction.\nWhile a home-based business owner may deduct office costs annually, there can be a financial impact when the home is sold. Gain on the sale of a principal residence is usually tax free up to $250,000 ($500,000 on a joint return) if certain conditions are met (IRC section 121). If the homeowner has been deducting the actual costs for a home office, however (including depreciation), gain on the sale is taxable at 28% to the extent of depreciation claimed after May 6, 1997 (IRC section 1250). This is referred to as “unrecaptured depreciation.” There is no unrecaptured depreciation if the home office deduction is based on the IRS’s simplified option.\nStarting a business from home can create income and tax savings; however, many legal, tax, and financial issues come into play. All of these issues should be addressed before business operations begin, and CPAs should advise interested individuals of them.']	['<urn:uuid:b71400e3-7410-482c-b99c-781253612126>', '<urn:uuid:b80fa710-b27a-459c-9ab3-935c4fe01ca4>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	10	55	4547
71	What role does the cosmic tree Yggdrasil play in Norse mythology, and how does it connect to the events of the final battle?	Yggdrasil is the central ash tree that holds the Nine Worlds in Norse mythology, growing out of the Well of Urd. These Nine Worlds are home to various beings including gods in Asgard, humans in Midgard, and giants in Jotunheim. During Ragnarok, the final battle, Yggdrasil will tremble as the gods gather for their doom, and nothing in heaven or earth will be free from fear.	['In the world of Norse mythology, we find gods and goddesses, giants, strange and powerful creatures, elves, dwarves and land spirits. It is difficult for a 21st century person to conceive of the worldview of the Vikings, brimming as it was with such a variety of spiritual beings.\nYggdrasil and the Nine Worlds\nThe center of the Vikings’ cosmos is the ash tree Yggdrasil, growing out of the Well of Urd. Yggdrasil holds the Nine Worlds, home of gods, man and all spiritual beings. The gods live in Asgard and Vanaheim and humans inhabit Midgard. Giants live in Jotunheim, elves in Alfheim and dwarves in Svartalfheim. Another is the primordial world of ice, Niflheim, while Muspelheim is the world of fire. The last world comprises Hel, the land of the dead, ruled by the goddess Hel.\nGods and Goddesses\nThe gods and goddesses venerated by the Vikings are Odin, Thor, Loki, Baldur, Frigg, Freya, Freyr and Njoror. There are many other gods and goddesses in the Norse pantheon but these received the primary attention in the sagas and eddas.\nOdin, the allfather, the one-eyed seeker of wisdom, god of magic, war and runes, hung himself on Yggdrasil for nine days and nights to find wisdom, brought the runes to mankind\nThor, with his magic hammer Mjolnir, protects mankind and his realm of Midgard, god of warriors\nLoki, a dangerous half-god, half-giant trickster always wreaking havoc among the gods\nBaldur, son of Odin and Frigg, a beautiful and gracious god, beloved of all, killed by Loki’s trickery\nFrigg, wife of Odin, practitioner of magic, goddess of the home, mother of Baldur\nFreya, feather-cloaked goddess of love and fertility but also of war and death\nFreyr, her brother, god of farming, agriculture, fertility and prosperity\nNjoror, powerful god of the sea\nGiants, Elves, Dwarves and Land Spirits\nGiant is not a good name for these spiritual beings; think of them as devourers, out to destroy order and return the world to primeval chaos. They are the enemies of gods, but also their relatives. Giants are dangerous to mankind, which is why Thor often hunts them. Elves and dwarves appear in the sagas, but are different from what we might picture them to be. Dwarves are miners and smiths and live underground. They are invisible, powerful spiritual beings, not short humans. Elves are also spiritual beings, demi-gods who can mate with mankind and have children with them.\nLand spirits inhabit everything on the land—trees, herbs, stones and bodies of water. The land spirits (landvaettir in Old Norse) hold considerable power over the well being of the land and those who live on it. People took care to honor and placate the landvaettir. In the first law of Iceland, Vikings were told to remove the dragon heads from their ships when approaching land so they wouldn’t frighten the land spirits.\nNorse mythology is intricate and complex and we’ve presented just the barest bones here. See the resources page for further information on this fascinating aspect of the Vikings’ belief system.', 'Thor’s Day Alert #29: Ragnarok, part one\nHappy Thor’s Day, everybody!\nIf it’s true that all good things come to an end, it’s especially true in Norse mythology. The good news? While some things end with a whimper, Norse myth ends with a bang. A bang called Ragnarok.\nIn Norse mythology, Ragnarok is a prophecied time in which the Norse gods meet their doom in a cataclysmic battle against their age-old foes, the giants. If you’ve ever heard the term “Twilight of the Gods”, it refers to the age of Ragnarok. In popular culture, Ragnarok is often casually (some might say mistakenly) used as a name for the final battle itself. But Ragnarok is an age or era — a myth cycle marking the end of the world.\nIn Thor’s Day Alert #14 I wrote about the Fimbulvetr age, literally the terrible winter which presages Ragnarok. For your enjoyment, here’s what follows that passage and brings us to the meat of the Ragnarok story as told in the Prose Edda and translated by Jean I. Young:\n‘Then will occur what will seem a great piece of news, the wolf will swallow the sun and that will seem a great disaster to men. Then another wolf will seize the moon and that one too will do great harm. The stars will disappear from heaven. Then this will come to pass, the whole surface of the earth will tremble so [violently] that trees will be uprooted from the ground, mountains will crash down, and all fetters and bonds will be snapped and severed. The wolf Fenrir will get loose then. The sea will lash against the land because the Midgard Serpent is writhing in giant fury trying to come ashore.\n‘At that time, too, the ship known as Naglfar will become free. It is made of dead men’s nails, so it is worth warning you that, if anyone dies with his nails uncut, he will greatly increase the material for that ship which both gods and men devoutly hope will take a long time building. In this tidal wave, however, Naglfar will be launched. The name of the giant steering Naglfar is Hrym. The wolf Fenrir will advance with wide open mouth, his upper jaw against the sky, his lower on the earth (he would gape more widely still if there were room) and his eyes and nostrils will blaze with fire. The Midgard Serpent will blow so much poison that the whole sky and sea will be spattered with it; he is most terrible and will be on the other side of the wolf.\n‘In this din the sky will be rent asunder and the sons of Muspell ride forth from it. Surt will ride first and with him fire blazing both before and behind. He has a very good sword and it shines more brightly than the sun. When they ride over Bifrost, however — as has been said before — that bridge will break. The sons of Muspell will push forward to the plain called Vigrid and the wolf Fenrir and the Midgard Serpent will go there too. Loki and Hrym with all the frost giants will also be there by then, and all the family of Hel will accompany Loki. The sons of Muspell, however, will form a host in themselves and that a very bright one. The plain Vigrid is a hundred and twenty leagues in every direction.\n‘When these things are happening, Heimdall will stand up and blow a great blast on the horn Gjoll and awaken all the gods and they will hold an assembly. Then Odin will ride to Mimir’s spring and ask Mimir’s advice for himself and his company. The ash Yggdrasil will tremble and nothing in heaven or earth will be free from fear. The Aesir and all the Einherjar will arm themselves and press forward on to the plain. Odin will ride first in a helmet of gold and a beautiful coat of mail and with his spear Gungnir, and he will make for the wolf Fenrir. Thor will advance at his side but will be unable to help him, because he will have his hands full fighting the Midgard Serpent. Frey will fight against Surt and it will be a hard conflict before Frey falls; the loss of the good sword that he gave to Skirnir will bring about his death. Then the hound Garm, which was bound in front of Gnipahellir, will also get free; he is the worst sort of monster. He will batlle with Tyr and each will kill the other.\n‘Thor will slay the Midgard Serpent but stagger back only nine paces before he falls down dead, on account of the poison blown on him by the serpent. The wolf will swallow Odin and that will be his death. Immediately afterwards, however, Vidar will stride forward and place one foot on the lower jaw of the wolf. On this foot he will be wearing the shoe which has been in the making since the beginning of time; it consists of the strips of leather men pare off at the toes and heels of their shoes, and for this reason people who want to help the Aesir must throw away these strips. Vidar will take the wolf’s upper jaw in one hand and tear his throat asunder and that will be the wolf’s death. Loki will battle with Heimdall and each will kill the other. Thereupon Surt will fling fire over the earth and burn up the whole world.\nThat’s all for today. I’ll continue the Ragnarok tale in my next Thor’s Day post on July 30. (Don’t forget to stop by for the next Tuesday Althing on July 28.)

72	I'm confused - why do courts use cash bail if studies show it doesn't work?	Despite studies showing that cash bail has little to no effect on court appearance rates or public safety, the system remains widely used as a way to secure defendants' agreement to return to court. For instance, a University of Pennsylvania study of Philadelphia data showed that failure-to-appear rates and arrests didn't increase when cash bail wasn't assigned. Nevertheless, courts continue to set bail based on factors like the severity of the alleged offense, likelihood of additional crimes, and flight risk. While the Eighth Amendment prohibits 'excessive bail,' it doesn't require courts to eliminate it. Some alternatives exist, such as release on own recognizance or using reminder systems for court dates, but the cash bail system persists in most jurisdictions.	"['MAN-E, who is part of the BUKIT Bail Fund, a local collective of volunteers who raise money ""for supporting the release of incarcerated individuals and the campaign to end cash bail,” according to its website, has been charged three other times since, and each time was given a cash bail. Even though he was never found guilty of these charges, and some were dropped by prosecutors, he says he still had incurred more than $100,000 in total bail. That means he either has to hold large sums of cash to provide to courts, which will then be refunded once he appears for his hearing and/or trial, or he has to provide a percentage or that to a bail bondsman, who will then make the bail payment.\n“In one case, my mother had to put our house up to a bail bondsman, and if I didn\'t show up to the court, then they could take her house,” says MAN-E.\nThis system of cash bail is common in Allegheny County, and in most of the United States. The justification of assigning large sums of money bail to the accused is to encourage them to return to trial and hearings. If they don’t show up, they forfeit the money and an arrest warrant is issued. If bail is not met, the accused are incarcerated in the Allegheny County Jail, which, like many jails, has documentation of unsafe conditions. This happens even if a person is eventually deemed not guilty or charges are dropped. MAN-E says he has spent a total of a few weeks in jail, even though he has never been convicted of any crime.\nCash bail is not just assigned to people accused of serious crimes. This summer, cash bail was often assigned to Black Lives Matter protesters, who were largely charged with misdemeanors like disorderly conduct or failure to disperse. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 32 protesters were ordered to pay 10% of a cash amount between $1,000 and $5,000, and eight were required to pay 10% of $10,000, in connection to arrests in summer 2020.\nCriminal justice advocates have been trying to end the use of cash bail for years, and efforts have been successful in some states and jurisdictions. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, those held for pretrial are four times more likely to be sentenced to prison than defendants released prior to trial, due in part to defendants making hurried decisions to plea to lower charges just to get out of jail.\nThose who can’t make the cash payment risk being exposed to the negative mental effects incarceration can have on individuals, and the subpar mental health care provided at jails.\nOn top of that, some studies show that cash bail has little to no effect on court appearance rates or public safety. Academics at the University of Pennsylvania analyzed Philadelphia data in 2018, and showed that failure-to-appear rates and arrests didn’t increase after cash bail was not assigned.\nAdvocates in Pennsylvania have tried to get county District Attorneys on board, tried to get the state legislature to pass laws, and other noble, yet difficult, efforts. But there are other, arguably, more direct levels of advocacy here in Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania’s second largest county.\nIn Allegheny County, bail is set by a Magisterial District Judge at a preliminary arraignment, often before prosecutors are involved. That means Magisterial District Judges have discretion in how they set bail, and this relatively obscure public office can actually have the power to end the use of cash bail entirely. With about 20 magisterial district judges races on the ballot this year, a lot can change in districts across Allegheny County.\nLate last year, Allegheny County had an opportunity to see what kind of effect wide-scale prohibition on cash bail would have, but many district judges failed to participate. According to Allegheny County Councilor Bethany Hallam (D-Ross), who also sits on the county’s Jail Oversight Board, Allegheny County President Judge Kim Clark stated that she had recently asked magistrates to stop using cash bail at a Jail Oversight Board meeting in December 2020.\nThe criminal-justice advocacy group Abolitionist Law Center tracked how much cash bail was assigned across districts after Clark’s request. Eleven judges complied and eliminated using cash bail in the aftermath of the meeting, but most didn’t. Some lowered their average amounts of cash bail issued, but 13 judges actually increased how much they used cashing bail, on average.\n“The left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing,” says Autumn Redcross of ALC. “We get to see the randomness of bail hearings from judge to judge. There are some that just charge higher bails than others, that is part of the arbitrariness of this and part of the problem.”\nThis arbitrary nature has disproportionate effects on Black people in Allegheny County.\nAccording to an ALC report that tracked court reports from May 11 through June 8, 2020, just nine zip codes with a disproportionate Black population accounted for 38% of the dollar value of all monetary bail bail issued in Allegheny County over that period. Only about 13% of Allegheny County residents are Black.\nAccording to 2015 statistics from the Bureau of Justice, an estimated 450,000 people are sitting in jail awaiting trial on an average day, mostly because they can’t afford bail. In Allegheny County, a large plurality of inmates in the jail are held because of parole/probation violations, another issue advocates want to reform.\nA much smaller percentage of Allegheny County inmates are held solely because they can’t pay cash bail, says Redcross, but she believes the practice is still overly punitive.\n“If they want to take responsibility for those in jail, then the cash bail system makes no sense,” says Redcross. “What are we protecting?”\nRedcross says many local judges have been using “unsecured cash bail,” which means defendants don’t have to provide money upfront, and only have to pay if they fail to show up to their court dates. She says unsecured cash bail is a stepping stone and a good thing, but it is not the ultimate goal.\nShe says a more effective, and fair, method to get defendants to meet their court dates is just providing resources to remind them. Redcross says ALC and other advocacy groups have been dedicating efforts to do just that, providing text and mail reminders of court dates, but she says the county or the courts could be doing this, too.\n“There is no system to remind people about their hearings. A lot of people that there are warrants for them, had no idea,” says Redcross. “They might be housing insecure, don’t receive mail, or they just forget.”\n“This is just a formality, you are going to get released today, just be quiet and listen,” said the Allegheny County judge on Jan. 6.\nOne Allegheny County magistrate judge who says he has eliminated cash bail in his district is Mik Pappas. He has served since 2018 in District 05-02-31, which comprises several East End neighborhoods in the city of Pittsburgh. Pappas says there are some fixes that Magisterial District Judges can do to eliminate cash bail, and still assign conditions that defendants must meet to address any public safety concerns.\n“There are a variety of options out there,” says Pappas. “Because of the unsecured bail option, do we really need professional bail bondsmen at all? … They want to know that a community is going to be safe. I think if there were more options in place, than they would be willing to listen.”\nDuring his 2017 campaign, he openly ran on eliminating cash bail, and he believes other candidates can too. He says large foundations, like MacArther and Heinz, have become increasingly involved in trying to eliminate cash bail. Pappas says large majorities of Americans back criminal justice reforms and believe that rich Americans get better outcomes in courts than the poor.\n“We have a responsibility to report to the public,” says Pappas. “When I think of how much we rely on incarceration and arrest, and I see how much it impacts people’s lives, we need to think of opportunities of diversion.”\nPappas says he has relied on several different strategies to divert defendants from cash bail in his courtroom, including community-sponsored release, which provides services like helping to find housing, employment, and rides to court for defendants whose judges determine they might not show up to their court date. The Community Release Project created by advocacy group Silicon Valley De-Bug has been practicing this in Santa Clara County, Calif. and says community-sponsored release has resulted in a non-monetary release or significant bail reduction in 76% of all the cases it reviewed.\nHe says he can also deny cash bail, so that the bail decision is automatically pushed up to the higher Common Pleas Court Judge, who has more discretion to assign electronic monitoring and other policies that avoid cash bail. Pappas says he will really only assign unsecure cash bail or assign a non-contact condition to a defendant if there are certain risks he assesses, like in domestic violence cases.\n“A lot of people get lost in the wind. A lot of inmates say they are ‘out of sight, out of mind.’ A lot of people really feel abandoned,” says MAN-E.\nOne big issue Pappas says that advocacy groups and foundations could initially fund is getting family members, social workers, lawyers, and/or members of advocacy groups at every preliminary arraignment.\nBasically, Pappas uses several different rules afforded to him as a judge to avoid assigning cash bail. This is why he is bullish on judges and candidates following suit. He acknowledges that Magisterial District Judges can often be a mysterious elected office, but he is confident that, with the right advocacy and approach, all can be amenable to eliminating cash bail. It’s just that many are used to the system risk assessment followed by assigning cash bail.\n“It is rare for a human being who would see someone in a vulnerable position, and not give that person that chance,” says Pappas.', 'Once a person is in police custody and is charged with an alleged offense, he or she may be able to get out of jail by posting bail or obtaining a bond. A judge determines the amount of bail based on factors like the severity of the alleged offense, the likelihood that the defendant will commit additional crimes after being released, and the chances that the defendant will flee the jurisdiction before trial. A judge may set bail at any amount that is not objectively unreasonable or deny bail altogether. The Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits “excessive bail” but does not state that courts are required to allow bail.\nBail vs. Bond\nThe words “bail” and “bond” are often used almost interchangeably when discussing jail release, and while they are closely related to each other, they are not the same thing. Bail is the money a defendant must pay in order to get out of jail. A bond is posted on a defendant’s behalf, usually by a bail bond company, to secure his or her release.\nDefendants with pending warrants are usually not eligible for bail.\nBail is not intended as a punishment in itself. It is rather a way of securing a defendant’s agreement to abide by certain conditions and return to court. In that sense, bail is like collateral left with the court to ensure that, after the defendant’s release from jail, he or she will return for the remaining parts of the criminal case. If the defendant fails to appear or violates the conditions of the release, he or she might forfeit the amount paid. If the defendant posted a bond, the bail bond company forfeits the money, as discussed below.\nAfter a person’s arrest, a judge or other court officer will set the amount of bail, along with any other conditions for his or her release from jail. Factors to consider that could weigh against bail include flight risk and risk to the public of further criminal activity. Factors that might be favorable to granting bail include a lack of prior criminal history and ties to the community. Possible rulings in a bail hearing include:\nRelease on Own Recognizance: The defendant is released from jail in exchange for signing an agreement promising to return to court and abide by other conditions.\nPersonal Bond: The defendant is released upon signing a bond, which states that he or she will be liable for criminal, and in some cases civil, penalties if he or she fails to appear in court.\nBail Set with Terms of Release: The defendant may go free by posting bail in the amount set by the court, either by paying it directly or obtaining a surety bond through a bail bond company.\nDenial of Bail: The defendant is deemed too much of a flight risk or a risk to the public.\nBail jumping is a crime in and of itself, so a defendant who does not return to court not only forfeits their bail but also can be charged with another crime.\nBail Bond Companies\nBail is often set in amounts that are beyond the financial capabilities of most people. Bail bond companies are, in most states, for-profit businesses that charge a nonrefundable fee, usually 10 to 20 percent of the bail amount, to post bail for a defendant.\nThe bail bond company signs a contract, known as a surety bond, in which it agrees to be liable for the full bail amount if the defendant fails to appear in court or otherwise forfeits his or her bail. Since the bail bond company is potentially on the hook for a large sum of money, it may require the defendant to check in on a regular basis, or even consent to be monitored by the company. The next step for a bail bond company, if the defendant fails to appear in court, might be to retain the services of a bail recovery agent, sometimes known as a bounty hunter.']"	['<urn:uuid:2a67e33a-55ec-410f-bd28-b3c029e0c60d>', '<urn:uuid:cf6367d8-c11e-49b5-ad10-f1f8568854e1>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	15	119	2343
73	engine knock causes prevention solutions	Engine knock occurs when air-fuel mixture explodes outside normal combustion area. It can be prevented by using high octane fuel, enriching air-fuel ratio, and reducing peak cylinder pressure. Solutions include adding fuel detergent, replacing worn spark plugs, and ensuring proper engine timing. Clean engine technology like EGR systems and common rail injection also help reduce knock by controlling combustion temperatures.	['…and your conscience will definitely be cleaner when you realise that having a forklift truck with a clean engine is good for the environment. plus, it’s better for your total cost of ownership too!\nDemand for lower vehicle emissions and higher fuel efficiency in the automotive industry has drifted over other motive industries. And, industrial lift trucks are no exception. Besides market demand also (European) regulations influenced the development of the modern industrial engines. But having a clean engine could not only help the environment but could also save you money!\nTo meet these requirements, many diesel engine manufacturers are using Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems, an emission after-treatment technology that converts (NOx) in the diesel engine exhaust stream into nitrogen and water vapor – two natural components and certainly more friendly for the environment.\nHow do emission systems work? And, how do they play a role in lowering emissions and improving fuel efficiency?\nThe Combustion Process\nOxides of Nitrogen (NOx) gases are created during the combustion process by high cylinder temperatures in the engine. To reduce NOx emissions before they develop, the cylinder temperature must be decreased during the combustion process.\nTo meet the emissions regulations, several new air systems and technologies have been developed, such as:\n- Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system\n- Common rail\n1. Exhaust Gas Recirculation\nThe Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system, which is also known as a NOx Reduction System (NRS) system, captures a portion of the engine’s exhaust, cools it, and routes it back into the intake manifold. The EGR is effective because the total percentage of oxygen available in the combustion chamber is reduced due to the recirculated exhaust gas containing very little oxygen in contrast to the boosted air. This reduced amount of oxygen in the combustion chamber allows for fuel injection timing to be more advanced, which aids in reducing cylinder temperatures. Thus leading to reduced NOx output.\nIt does not stop here. Whilst the EGR reduces the NOx levels during engine combustion after treatment reduces Particulate Matter (PM), Hydrocarbons (HC) and Carbon Monoxide CO in the exhaust.\n2. Common rail\nCommon rail is a fuel injection system found in modern diesel engines. This system provides a level of flexibility leading to class-leading emission control, power and fuel consumption. An increasing number of modern diesel engines employ common rail direct injection (CRDi) fuel systems for the flexibility they provide whilst meeting the most stringent emission control standards.\nIn a common rail system, the fuel is stored at a variable pressure in a cylinder or ‘rail’ connected to the engine’s fuel injectors via individual pipes, making it a ‘common rail’ to all the injectors. The pressure is controlled by a fuel pump but it is the fuel injectors, working in parallel with the fuel pump, that controls the timing and amount of the injected fuel. The fuel is injected under pressure with electronically controlled precision. When compared to older fuel systems, the common rail system is able to supply fuel at a higher pressure, ensuring a more efficient use of fuel. Fuel consumption drops due to a finer spray of fuel which burns more efficiently.\nAnd there’s more\nThe common rail system also provides fuel in more steps, through timing flexibility, instead of only providing it once. This improves noise levels, vibration, and harshness, making the engine quieter and run smoother.\nA further advantage of the CRDi system is that it injects the fuel directly into the combustion chamber. This means that less fuel is wasted as soot or particulates in the exhaust and deposits in the engine.\nThe Welfaux Conclusion\nModern techniques bring high torque, great power at low revolutions and trouble-free operations. But companies are also seeking to minimize their Carbon Footprint by reducing their energy consumption. By utilizing vehicles that have cleaner emissions and lower consumptions rates, they can also expect lower operating costs.', 'You might be driving down the road and then all of a sudden hear a certain knocking sound coming from underneath the hood. More often than not, this relates directly to your engine. As we all know, the engine is one of the most important components of your vehicle – it is what keeps your car running smoothly and safely, and can require extremely heavy duty and expensive repairs or replacements if you let a problem with the engine go on for too long.\nA combustion engine is supposed to run smoothly from the moment you turn your key in the ignition until you stop the car later in the day. However, sometimes an engine will churn out some noises that are a bit difficult to diagnose what exactly the root cause is. Sometimes, when you hear this strange noise coming from underneath your hood, you might not know what to do. We can help you.\nHere we are going to figure out what the engine knocking sound is, the causes of engine knocking, the solutions of engine knocking, and how much you might expect to pay to fix the cause of the knocking sound.\nWhat is engine knocking?\nKnocking, also known as detonation, spark knock, or pinging, in spark ignition internal combustion engines occur when combustion of some of the air and fuel mixture does not create the necessary flame from the spark plug, but instead, one or more of these air and fuel pockets explodes outside of the normal area of combustion. The way it is supposed to happen is that the air and fuel mixture charge is meant to be ignited by just the spark plug at a certain point during the piston’s stroke. Knock occurs when the peak of the combustion process does not occur at the right moment in the four-stroke cycle, which is when an internal combustion engine completes four separate strokes while turning the crankshaft.\nWhy does this engine knocking sound occur?\nThe engine knocking sound occurs when there is abnormal combustion within the internal combustion engine. When unburned fuel and air mixture is exposed to heat and pressure for a longer time than normal, detonation may occur. This means that there will be an explosion of at least one pocket of air and fuel mixture outside of the flame front.\nIf this continues over several cycles within your engine, other parts of your engine can be severely damaged or even completely destroyed. The most common negative effect of continuous engine knocking is particle wear, causing erosion or abrasion in the engine. It can also cause failure by melting holes in the piston or cylinder head.\nHow to fix the engine knocking sound\nSince we now know how serious engine knocking sound is in your car, it is nothing to ignore. Generally caused by a poor mixture of fuel and air that is required to power the engine, this causes the gas to burn unevenly and potential detonations to occur. If you run your car for too long and drive it for extended periods of time with this problem, serious damage could occur to the inner components of your vehicle.\nIn some cases, however, it is relatively easy to fix the engine knocking sound. Try these three things before bringing your car immediately to a mechanic.\n- Only fill your car with premium unleaded fuel. The low-grade and cheap gasoline that you may be using every time you fill up your tank could be the real culprit. If you normally use this kind of unleaded gas, fill up with premium next time, since higher octane fuel can help fix your engine.\n- Add fuel detergent. Although most gasolines and fuel mixtures contain some kind of fuel detergent, you might need something more pungent if you find that your engine is making a knocking sound. Adding the right kind of fuel detergent can help clean out the carbon that might be building up within the fuel lines, reducing the engine knocking sound.\n- Replace worn out spark plugs. If your car has been serviced recently, there is a slim chance that the original spark plugs were actually replaced with the incorrect kind. They might still fire, but they don’t fire at the correct time. Make sure the right spark plugs are installed for your car to prevent the engine knocking sound.\nOther reasons for the engine knocking sound\nIf you are hearing the loud knocking sound coming from underneath the hood, there are a few other problems that can cause what most people would describe as a knocking noise.\nFirst, and the most common, is the engine knock. If you hear a rapid tapping sound coming from the engine as you drive your car, your engine is most likely suffering from knock. Paying attention to how you drive, you will notice that the issue gets worse when you accelerate. The engine knocking sound is a result of multiple detonations due to incorrect ignition timing, an incorrect air to fuel ratio, or a malfunctioning sensor.\nSecond, another reason for the engine knocking sound is rattling accessory pulleys. As the engine turns over, it runs a belt that rotates pulleys on various accessories under the hood to give them power. These accessories include the water pump, A/C compressor, power steering pump, and even more. If the pulleys become damaged, they might start to rattle while rotating. The higher the speed an engine spins at, the louder the noise will become.\nThird, another reason for the engine knocking sound is a squeaking accessory belt. We already know that pulleys could be an issue for the noise, but the belt itself might have become stretched out or slipped out of place over time. This is especially prevalent when the engine is cold and you start the ignition after it sits for a long time.\nLastly, rod knock could cause the loud engine knocking sound. This is the loud clacking noise that you will hear as the driver if rod bearings become damaged over time. The piston rod is connected to the bearings, allowing the crankshaft to spin and the piston to travel smoothly. Damage to these bearings lets the rod knock against the crankshaft, since there is a small gap between the piston rod and crankshaft.\nCauses of Fuel-Related Engine Knocking Sound\nFuel Has a Low Octane Rating\n- If you put in fuel that has an octane rating that is too low for your specific vehicle, this can lead to the engine knocking sound. The octane rating relates to the fuel type’s ability to resist detonation before it is supposed to in relation to the air and fuel mixture within the engine. The combustion therefore causes a knocking sound. To keep this from happening, use gasoline with an octane fuel rating that is above what the manufacturer for your specific kind of car recommends. You can also try using an octane booster. This product helps to improve fuel compression in your engine before detonation, increasing the fuel efficiency and horsepower.\n- Fuels that are given to your vehicles are supposed to have a detergent that helps clean out carbon and prevent it from getting stuck inside of your engine and fuel lines – but some may not. As fuel mixes with oxygen, it burns, and the residual carbon can form on valves, spark plugs, and other components that are directly involved in the ignition process of the fuel and air mixture. This reduces the volume inside of the cylinder and increases the pressure and compression.\nWrong Spark Plug Gap\n- If you recently had your spark plugs replaced or you replaced them yourself and have realized they might not be the exact right ones for your vehicle, it can cause the engine knocking sound. The spark plugs have certain heat ranges, meaning that it can withdraw a certain amount of heat from the combustion chamber. With the wrong type of spark plugs, it won’t withdraw the right amount of heat and compression. In addition, the spark plug gap is the key place where the spark plug ignites the air and fuel mixture that powers the car. If the gap is too narrow, the spark might be too weak and too wide might prevent a spark from firing at all.\nHow to prevent Engine Knock\nDetonation that occurs at the wrong point or too early in an engine is what spurs the engine knocking sound. Detonation can be prevented by following these specific techniques:\n- Using a fuel with high octane rating, increasing the combustion temperature of the fuel and reducing the chances that it could detonate prematurely\n- Enriching the air to fuel ratio, which reduces the combustion temperature and increases the chances of less of a chance of detonation at the wrong temperature\n- Reducing peak cylinder pressure\n- Decreasing the manifold pressure – the difference in air pressure between the engine’s intake manifold and that of Earth, which can be done by reducing the throttle opening\n- Reducing engine load\n- Slowing down ignition timing\nIf you employ one or more of these techniques, it could slow down premature detonation and prevent the engine knocking sound from occurring.\nSince temperature and pressure are one and the same, knock can also be remedied by controlling the peak combustion chamber temperatures by reducing the compression ratio, employing emissions reduction techniques in petrol/gasoline and diesel engines, calibration of the engine’s ignition timing (the timing that is the release of the spark in the combustion chamber near the end of the compression stroke), and ensuring careful design of the combustion chambers and cooling systems.\nFurther, adding certain materials could also prevent the detonation from occurring and causing the engine knocking sound. Thallium is a chemical element that could prevent premature detonation, along with tetraethyllead, a soluble organic compound that can be added to gasoline to prevent detonation.\nIn addition, where you live can affect the prevalence of knocks in your vehicle. Knock is less common in cold climates, due to the lower peak temperatures and the lower combustion temperatures. Steam can suppress knock in hot temperatures to prevent higher than normal temperatures.\nAlong with temperature, the types of roads you drive on can impact the prevalence of engine knocking sound in your car. Turbulence has a huge effect on knock. Engines with good turbulence can knock less than other engines, with turbulence occurring when the mixture is compressed and burned.\nUnfortunately, if you have a diesel engine, you are in a bit more of a predicament than if you have an engine that uses another fuel type. Since diesel engines have a fuel injected into highly compressed air towards the end of the compression stroke, there is only a short gap between the fuel being injected and combustion starting. The rapid increase in pressure and temperature can cause the engine knocking sound.\nLastly, the specific design of the injector pump, fuel injector, combustion chamber, and the pistons and cylinders can reduce the chances of knocking. Engines that use direct injection engines have higher instances of knock than an indirect injection, due to the lack of oxygen dispersal within the chamber and the higher injection pressures of fuel and air.\nEngine Knock Fix Cost\nIf you have determined that using the strategies to fix the engine knocking sound and evaluating your car that the engine knocking sound is coming from a rod knock, you can expect this to actually be a hefty price tag in terms of repairs. An average job usually runs at between $2,000-$3,000, with more expensive and high performance vehicles costing almost double the repair cost.']	['<urn:uuid:fa7e3429-920d-41f0-8f8f-2ad9ac246a3b>', '<urn:uuid:d7d8abad-688e-45ee-9b0b-683d04a85d91>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	5	60	2585
74	who was albert kgb illegal officer	ALBERT (earlier covername MER) was Iskhak Abdulovich Akhmerov, a veteran KGB officer who served two tours in the U.S. as an 'illegal' - an officer using a false identity without diplomatic cover. He used aliases including William Greinke, Michael Green, and Michael Adamec. He worked with his wife EL'ZA (Helen Lowry) and left the U.S. in 1946.	"['VENONA Historical Monograph #3: The 1944-45 New York and Washington-Moscow KGB Messages\nNSA Home Page\nThe release of VENONA translations involved careful consideration of the privacy interests of individuals mentioned, referenced, or identified in the translations. Some names have not been released when to do so would constitute an invasion of privacy.\nOn 1 February 1943, the U.S. Army\'s Signal Intelligence organization, usually called ""Arlington Hall"" after the location of its headquarters in Virginia, began a program to examine encrypted Soviet diplomatic telegrams sent between Moscow and Soviet missions abroad. Not until 1946, however, after very difficult analytic work, did Arlington Hall began to recognize that these so-called diplomatic communications contained thousands of messages of the KGB and GRU, the Soviet secret intelligence services.\nThis monograph accompanies the third set of VENONA translations being released to the public. The first release, in July 1995, was of a number of Soviet espionage messages concerning Soviet intelligence operations against the U.S. atomic bomb program (the Manhattan Project). The second release was of KGB messages between the New York KGB Residency and Moscow Center during 1942-1943.\nThis third release comprises many more documents than either the first or\nsecond release--more than 500 translations--and includes all the decrypted\nand translated messages between the New York and Washington KGB Residencies\nand Moscow Center (minus the atomic bomb-related messages previously released\nin July 1995).\nKGB AGENTS AND OFFICERS\nDuring the VENONA period the KGB used the coverterm PROBATIONERS to refer to\ntheir agents. A KGB officer, whether under official diplomatic cover or\noperating as an ""Illegal,"" was a Soviet citizen and a sworn officer of the\nKGB (usually holding police rank). In VENONA messages, KGB officers are often\nreferred to as ""workers"" or ""cadre."" Illegals were Soviet citizens,\nKGB or GRU officers, operating under cover in foreign countries with no visible\nconnections to legal Soviet establishments. These persons had entered the\ncountry other than in an official capacity such as a staff member of an\nembassy or consulate. An agent was a private citizen recruited by the\nKGB to carry out espionage or other clandestine activities on behalf of the\nKGB. In VENONA we also see some persons who appear to fall somewhere in\nbetween agent and officer. American Communists Jacob Golos,\nElizabeth Bentley, and Greg\nSilvermaster, veteran controllers of agent networks, could be placed in\nthis category. In fact, Silvermaster was, at one time, the only\nAmerican citizen in the KGB Hall of Fame in Moscow.\nTHE WASHINGTON KGB RESIDENCY\nExcept for its agents working against high tech targets such as the atomic\nbomb project, the most important KGB sources were in Washington, D.C.\nNonetheless, VENONA shows that these Washington-based espionage nets were\napparently run by the New York Residency, that is, the New York Residency\nwrote and sent VENONA messages to Moscow even when these messages clearly\nconcerned activities in Washington. KGB Washington sent no messages until\nvery late 1943. In 1944 Washington\'s message volume was still only half\nthat of New York. Finally, in 1945, Washington KGB took charge, it seems,\nsending twice as many messages as New York.\nVassili Zubilin, a KGB general officer who had been the Resident in\nNew York in 1942-43, moved to Washington during 1943 as Resident there. The\nWashington KGB thereafter began sending messages in ever increasing volume.\nWhen Zubilin was recalled to Moscow in 1944, Anatolij Gromov, covername\nVADIM, replaced him in Washington. Gromov\n(actual last name Gorsky) was also a senior officer, in his late 30\'s, who had\nserved for the preceeding four years as the KGB Resident in London. American\nspymaster and courier for the KGB, Elizabeth Bentley, knew him only\nNEW YORK ESPIONAGE OPERATIONS--THE NEW KGB\nIn 1944, covername MAJ,\nbelieved to have been Stepan Apresyan, became the KGB Resident (chief) in New York. According to\na complaint to Moscow Center by his co-Resident or subordinate, covername\nSERGEJ, MAJ was a young, inexperienced officer who had not previously been\nposted abroad. Apresyan was about 28 years old. He operated in New York\nunder the cover of vice-consul (see NY messages of 9-11\nOct 1944). While we\ndo not know why MAJ was elevated so early to the senior KGB ranks, there were\nalso other major changes in KGB espionage operations, as we can see in the\nVENONA messages. Moscow Center and the New York Residency intended to take more\ndirect control of some existing espionage nets that had been run for the KGB\nby American Communists such as Jacob Golos (covername ZVUK) and Greg\nSilvermaster (covernames PEL and ROBERT). And, as MAJ reported to Moscow,\nthe time might come when the KGB would need to have espionage agents not\nrecruited from within the Communist Party. All of this relates to the\ndissolution of the COMINTERN as discussed in in the previous VENONA release\nand its accompanying monograph. The transition was resisted by American\nspies, Greg Silvermaster and Elizabeth Bentley, as well as by some of their\nagents. They complained that Moscow did not trust them, and that as a\npractical matter, the KGB would be less successful in running espionage\noperations if they put their officers in direct contact with the agents,\nbypassing the old guard Communist Party controllers. Perhaps mindful of this,\nthe KGB introduced the ""illegal"" ALBERT\ninto their espionage operations. Silvermaster, Elizabeth Bentley, some of\ntheir individual agents, and members of the ""new network,"" would all fall\nunder ALBERT\'s control.\nThese translations frequently show KGB tradecraft--the techniques of secret espionage and counterespionage--in great detail. The KGB term Konspiratoria, sometimes seen in VENONA, refers to tradecraft and operational security. A few examples for quick reference (all New York to Moscow):\nAlso, VENONA has excellent examples of the work of a KGB agent and Communist\nParty functionary, covernames ECHO & DICK (Bernard Schuster), in carrying out\ninvestigations on behalf of the KGB, as part of the vetting process of agent\ncandidates (New York to Moscow, Nos.\n1512, all from 1944).\nKGB SPECIAL OPERATIONS\nIn addition to espionage, the KGB carried out other secret activities in the\nU.S. In VENONA we can follow the KGB using its agents in the hunt for Viktor\nKravchenko, covername KOMAR, who defected in Washington in 1944 from the\nSoviet Government Purchasing Commission. (See especially New York to Moscow\nAugust 1944, nos.\nIn the latter message, sent from MAJ to PETROV [who\nwas either L.P. Beria, head of Soviet State Security, or V.N. Merkulov, his\nprincipal deputy who functioned as the day to day head of the KGB], New York\nannounces that KOMAR/Kravchenko had been located by their veteran agent Mark\nZbrowski, covername TULIP. Additional related messages of 1944 are nos.\n1202; also no.\n87 of 19 Jan 1945, the last VENONA reference to the case,\nwhich reports that KOMAR is ""in a great panic"" about his saftety and that KGB\nagents KANT [the new covername for Mark Zbrowski] and ZhANNA are carrying\nout ""the work on KOMAR."" The KOMAR messages contain references to\nanti-Communist emigre community involvement in the defection, including\nreferences to David Dallin, Isaac Don Levine, and even Aleksander Kerenskij,\nhead of the post-revolutionary Menshevik Government before it was overthrown\nin the Bolshevik coup. KGB New York also makes the mysterious remark\n26 May 1944) that ""KOMAR is well informed about the\nKRIVITsKIJ case."" KRIVITsKIJ was a famous KGB defector who supposedly\ncommitted suicide in Washington in 1941.\nIn 1945, Elizabeth Bentley, a KGB agent who also ran a network of spies and\nserved as a sometime courier, went to the FBI to describe Soviet espionage\nin the United States and her part in it as courier and agent handler. She\ngave a 90 page statement, in which she named many names--persons in positions\nof trust who, she told the FBI, were secretly supplying information to the KGB.\nHowever, she brought no documentary proof. No prosecutions resulted directly\nfrom her accusations. Over the years she testified before Congress and in\ncourt and also published a book about her espionage career. Elizabeth Bentley\nwas a controversial figure and there were many who discounted her confession.\nMiss Bentley appears in these VENONA translations (as covernames UMNITsA [GOOD\nGIRL] and MYRNA) as do dozens of KGB agents and officers whom she named to the\nFBI. VENONA confirms much of the information Miss Bentley provided the FBI.\nBorris Morros was, like Ms. Bentley, another controversial figure of the Cold\nWar. In 1959, he wrote an often criticized book, My Ten Years as a\nCounterspy, in which he described his long association with the KGB, and\nhis decision to go to the FBI with the story of KGB operations in the U.S.\nIn the book he wrote about various personalities who are seen in VENONA,\nincluding Vassili Zubilin and Jack Soble. Morros appears in VENONA as\ncovername FROST (the Russian word for frost is moroz). In his book\nMorros described how KGB agent Alfred Stern provided his own money to fund a\nmusical record company run by Morros as a KGB front and a cover for\ninternational intelligence operations. This operation is confirmed in\nVENONA: Stern (covername LUI) is quoted as saying his ""130,000 dollar\ninvestment is exhausted"" but, also, ""I want to reaffirm my desire to be\nhelpful. My resources are sufficient for any solid constructive purpose. ...""\n(See New York to Moscow, nos.\nof 3 and 4 January 1945.)\nLongtime KGB agent Donald Maclean, covername HOMER, a senior British diplomat posted to Washington during the 1940s, is found in eleven, possibly twelve, VENONA messages, six from New York and six from Washington (nos. 915, 1105-1110, 1146, 1263, 1271-74, and possibly 1352, all sent during 1944). He was neutralized because of information from VENONA. Since only 1.5% (36) of all Washington to Moscow KGB messages of 1945 were able to be decrypted, it was fortunate that seven of these were HOMER messages (nos. 1788, 1791, 1793, 1808-1809, 1815 and 1826). Note that the small body of Washington messages that could be broken were from small windows of cryptanalytic opportunity found by the Arlington Hall analysts in messages of March and June 1945 only. Thererfore, we have but a glimpse of Maclean\'s treachery, but ample opportunity to see the the type of important information he was providing to the Soviets.\nHOMER is the English rendition of the Russian covername spelling, GOMER.\n(The Cyrillic alphabet used in Russian has no letter representing the sound\n""h"" of the Roman alphabet and foreign words beginning with the ""h"" sound are\nregularly spelled with the Cyrillic equivalent of ""g."")\nArlington Hall\'s principal VENONA analyst in the early days, began to break\nHOMER messages as early as 1947/48, but the story did not come together\nimmediately as the covername was variously represented in the messages as\n""GOMMER"" (a KGB misspelling), ""GOMER,"" ""G."" and ""Material G."" Initially, it\nwas not apparent that these were all references to the same person,\nparticularly as both New York and Washington traffic was involved and Gardner\nworked the NYC traffic first (thus the early successes against the atomic bomb\nspies in the first VENONA release).\nCOVERNAME ALBERT: PRINCIPAL KGB ILLEGAL IN THE U.S.\nCovername ALBERT (earlier covername MER), is found in VENONA more than 50 times, sometimes as signatory to messages sent by the New York Residency. ALBERT was Iskhak Abdulovich Akhmerov, a veteran KGB officer who had two tours of duty in the U.S. as an ""illegal,"" that is, an officer using a false identity and background (Legenda in KGB parlance) and without diplomatic cover or immunity. ALBERT\'s career, ascertained from VENONA and other sources, gives an excellent example of the bewildering plethora of names by which a KGB personality might be known:\nCommunications Covername (the covername in Venona): MER in 1943-44; ALBERT, 1944-45.\nAliases (1937-45): William Greinke, Michael Green, Michael Adamec, and more.\nStreet names: Michael, Bill. For example, Elizabeth Bentley knew him only as ""Bill""--no last name, not even the alias, much less his truename. She knew his wife, also an ""illegal,"" as ""Catherine."" Catherine actually was VENONA covername EL\'ZA, truename Helen Lowry, a niece of KGB agent and Communist Party leader Earl Browder (VENONA covername RULEVOJ).\nTrue name: Iskhak Abdulovich Akhmerov. (In some cases so-called true names of KGB officers, the names that appeared on their passports and the diplomatic lists, were false. For example, Vassili Zubilin, the sometimes KGB Resident in New York and Washington, was actually named Zarubin.) To add to the difficulty in understanding the names, other KGB officers used truenames that were not names at all, Russian words, but not traditional Russian names. Some of these nommes de guerre included senior KGB officers Vladimir Pravdin and Jacob Golos, whose last names mean, respectively, ""truth"" and ""voice.""\nIn one message ALBERT refers to his earlier work in the U.S. as an Illegal, and mentions his old agents, covernames LEONA, JULIA, TONYa, and REDHEAD. None of these have been identified, nor do we know if ALBERT reactivated them in 1944-45 (No. 975, 11 July 1944). See also the important message, Washington to Moscow, No. 1822, 30 March 1945, which reports covername ""A.""s interview of the well-placed veteran GRU agent ALES, probably Alger Hiss. It appears that ""A."" was ALBERT.\nIn 1946, ALBERT reportedly moved to Baltimore. Actually, he and EL\'ZA\nsecretly left the U.S., probably because the KGB had learned about Elizabeth\nBentley\'s statements to the FBI. KGB veterans consider him to have been one\nof their service\'s most successful officers.\nThe majority of the translations in this release represent telegrams from the New York KGB Residency to Moscow Center in 1944. Most of these messages were between KGB officers--covername MAJ (Stepan Apresyan) and covername VIKTOR (General Pavel Fitin). Approximately 50% of all the 1944 New York KGB to Moscow Center messages were successfully decrypted sufficiently to be translated. In contrast, only 1.5% of the Washington-Moscow KGB messages sent in 1945 were able to be broken and read. No other Washington-Moscow KGB messages from any other year were ever successfully deciphered. While relatively few messages from the Center to the Residencies were broken, those that were broken are very important to our understanding of KGB operations and doctrine.\nThe translations included in the current release are relatively easy to read and understand compared to those in the two earlier releases due to cryptographic circumstances discussed in the monographs which accompanied those releases. The codebook and cipher procedures used by the KGB during 1944 and 1945 made it possible, after great effort, for the analysts to produce fairly complete translations. Nevertheless, translations often contain significant gaps--codegroups that could not be broken. The New York translations in this set were the earliest of all the VENONA materials decrypted. All of the New York to Moscow messages (but not Moscow to New York) which were successfully solved were at least partially solved during 1947-1952 and disseminated to the FBI (on a regular basis starting in 1948). Many of the Washington KGB messages were also first decrypted during this period, but not quite so early as the New York material.\nThe 1944 and 1945 messages mainly involve U.S. individuals and organizations caught up in a massive Soviet espionage effort--over 100 Americans, most of them Communists, are mentioned in the translations of this release. Some of the organizations infilitrated by these include the following:\nThe translations disclose agents with access to the White House, Congress,\nand political parties, as well as agents in the media and in high tech\ndefense industries. New York messages no. 1635, 21 Nov 1944 and no.\n4 Jan 1945 reveal assets and in-fighting relating to ROBERT\'s (Greg\nSilvermaster) large KGB net in government departments and agencies in\nKLAUS FUCHS / ATOMIC BOMB MESSAGES\nThis third release also includes a few important messages concern Klaus Fuchs, the atomic bomb spy (see especially New York KGB messages 1606, 16 Nov 1944, and Moscow Center\'s messages to New York, nos. 183, 27 Feb 1945 and 349, 10 April 1945. The last message, only partially recovered, will be of great interest with respect to the controversy about the pace of Soviet atomic bomb development. In it Moscow tells NY that ChARL\'Z\'s [Fuchs\' covername] information on the atomic bomb ""is of great value"" and his recent report ""contains information received for the first time from you about the electro-magnetic method of separation of ENORMOZ.""\nOne translation, NY no. 1507, Oct. 1944, footnoted covername BUMBLE-BEE (Russian ShMEL\') as equating to David Greenglass; however, the translation shows a handwritten emendation of ""David Greenglass"" to ""Walter Lippman,"" which is the correct equation.\nThe KGB successor organization has recently provided historians some\ninformation about Lona and Morris Cohen,\ntheir agents the U.S. in the 1940s and later infamous ""illegals"" operating in\nthe UK as Helen and Peter Kroger. Reportedly, Lona Cohen had the covername\nLESLIE while she was involved in atomic bomb espionage courier duties for the\nKGB (see New York\'s No.\n50, 11 Jan 1945, the only VENONA reference to this\ncovername. This message suggests that LESLIE/ LESLEY had not been active for\nthe previous six months.)\nMORE TO COME IN 1996\nThe remaining releases of VENONA will include more than 1000 message translations: the KGB in San Francisco and Mexico; the GRU in New York and Washington; and the Naval GRU in Washington. Finally, KGB and/or GRU messages from Montevideo, London, Stockholm and elsewhere will be released.']"	['<urn:uuid:c52f2596-d429-4d7b-8841-18531233fb46>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	6	57	2876
75	What defines sovereign states and how do executives lead them?	A sovereign state is characterized by a permanent population, defined territory, government and capacity to enter relations with other sovereign states. The executive branch leads by implementing laws, maintaining foreign relations, formulating policies, preparing budgets, and appointing cabinet members, with their powers having grown significantly in recent years in both parliamentary and presidential systems.	"['|Part of a series on|\n|Part of the Politics series|\n|Basic forms of government|\nA political system is a system of politics and government. It is usually compared to the legal system, economic system, cultural system, and other social systems. However, this is a very simplified view of a much more complex system of categories involving the questions of who should have authority and what the government\'s influence on its people and economy should be.\nAnthropological forms of political systems\nAnthropologists generally recognize four kinds of political systems, two of which are uncentralized and two of which are centralized.\n- Uncentralized systems\n- Band society\n- Small family group, no larger than an extended family or clan; it has been defined as consisting of no more than 30 to 50 individuals.\n- A band can cease to exist if only a small group walks out.\n- Generally larger, consisting of many families. Tribes have more social institutions, such as a chief or elders.\n- More permanent than bands. Many tribes are sub-divided into bands.\n- Band society\n- Centralized governments\n- More complex than a tribe or a band society, and less complex than a state or a civilization\n- Characterized by pervasive inequality and centralization of authority.\n- A single lineage/family of the elite class becomes the ruling elite of the chiefdom\n- Complex chiefdoms have two or even three tiers of political hierarchy.\n- ""An autonomous political unit comprising a number of villages or communities under the permanent control of a paramount chief""\n- Sovereign state\n- A sovereign state is a state with a permanent population, a defined territory, a government and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states.\n- Supranational Political Systems\nSupranational political systems are created by independent nations to reach a common goal or form an alliance.\n- Empires are widespread states or communities under a single rule. They are characterized by the rulers desire for unanimous religious affiliation or posing as threat for other empires in times of war.* Empires often made considerable progress in ways of democratic structures, creating and building city infrastructures, and maintaining civility within the diverse communities. Because of the intricate organization of the empires, they were often able to hold a large majority of power on a universal level.*\n- Leagues are international organizations composed of states coming together for a single common purpose.* In this way leagues are different from empires, as they only seek to fulfill a single goal. Often leagues are formed on the brink of a military or economic downfall. Meetings and hearings are conducted in a neutral location with representatives of all involved nations present.\nPolitical parties in political systems\nPolitical systems do not inherently require the institution of political parties to advance the politics of the political system. Political parties are formed after political systems are put in place.\nAmerican Clash of clans parties (democracy/republic)\nIn the case of American politics, Article Two of the United States Constitution, specifically Section I, gives no mention to political parties when describing the presidential election process. It was only after the establishment of the government that the first political parties formed.\nRussian, the first U.S. president was against the establishment of political parties in most circumstances and therefore belonged to no party. In his Farewell Address Washington gives reason for his distrust in political parties, specifically in the newly formed United States. Washington does endorse political parties in some political systems however, specifically monarchies.\nWashington was the only President not to be elected through a party oriented election process. Because of this, it is difficult to comment on an America without political party institutions. Washington’s case does point to the original path of the American political system however, one lacking political parties.\nBoth the U.S. Constitution and Washington provide support for the American political system, a Democracy and Republic, to be founded without political parties. The past has shown this type of system to work well with parties, but nonetheless, these two systems do not require political parties in their institutions.\nOver the years the American political system has seen a sharp decline in voter turnout. In 1960, over 63% of the American population cast their presidential votes, whereas by 1996, there were less than 50% of Americans showing up to the polls.* Not only are the domestic voting numbers low, but the United States has one of the lowest voter turnout rates among other democratic nations.*Analysts say many factors play into these low numbers. For example, in many states felons are banned from poll booths. Also, if a citizen is abroad during the time of an election they are banned from voting as well. In the American political system, it is mandatory voters register weeks before the actual Election Day, so many citizens forget to register and are unable to cast their ballots.*\nSociology of political systems\nThe sociological interest in political systems is figuring out who holds the power in the relationship of the government and its people and how the government’s power is used. There are three types of political systems that sociologists consider.\n- In authoritarian governments, the people have no power or representation and it is characterized by absolute or blind obedience to [formal] authority, as against individual freedom and related to the expectation of unquestioning obedience. The elite leaders handle all economic, military, and foreign relations. Dictatorships are examples of authoritarianism.\n- Totalitarianism is the most extreme form of authoritarianism because it controls all aspects of life including communication between citizens, censors the media, and threatens by means of terror.\n- A monarchy is a government controlled by a king or queen determined by a predisposed line of sovereignty.* In the modern world there are two types of monarchies, absolute monarchies and constitutional monarchies. An absolute monarchy works like a dictatorship in that the king has complete rule over his country.* A constitutional monarchy gives the royal family limited powers and usually works in accordance with an elected body of officials.* Social revolutions of the 18th, 19th, and 20th century overthrew the majority of existing monarchies in favor of a more democratic governments and the rise of the lower-class.\n- A democracy is a form of government in which the citizens create and vote for laws directly or indirectly via representatives.* The idea of democracy stems back from ancient Greece and the profound works of ancient academics. However, the presence of democracy does not always mean citizen’s wishes will be equally represented. For example, in many democratic countries immigrants, and racial and ethnic minorities do not receive the same rights as the majority citizens.\n- Political structure\n- Voting system\n- Ming Dynasty\n- Tractatus Politicus\n- Haviland, W.A.

The Legislature\nThe legislature is the arm or organ of government that makes laws and acts as a check on the executive amongst other functions. It is a body of elected representatives of the people. Another name for the legislature is the parliament.\nIn Nigeria, it is called the National Assembly; it is made up of the senate and House of Representatives.\nTypes Of Legislature\n- Unicameral legislature\n- Bicameral legislature\nUnicameral legislature refers to the type of legislature where there is only one house or body that makes laws for the country with members elected directly by the electorates. Countries like China, Sierra-Leone, Israel, Turkey, Denmark, New Zealand, Spain, Gambia, Kenya etc. have unicameral legislature.\nBicameral legislature is a type of legislature with two (2) chambers or houses, one is called the lower house and the other is called the upper house. In Nigeria, the lower house is called the House of Representatives and the upper house is called the senate.\nFunctions of The Legislature\nLaw Making: The primary function of the legislature is to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the nation.\nAmendment of the Constitution: It is the duty of the legislature to amend the constitution whenever it is deemed necessary.\nApproval of Executive Nominees: The senate which is the upper chamber of the national assembly has the executive powers of confirming presidential appointment in top offices such as Ministers, Ambassadors or Special Advisers, Chief Justice of the Federation, etc.\nControl of Public Expenditure: The legislature control and approves the proposed financial expenditure of the executive arm.\nImpeachment of the Chief Executives: In a presidential system of government, the president or vice president can be impeached by legislature for gross- misconduct in the performance of their functions. While in a parliamentary system, the prime minister and his cabinet can be removed through a vote of no confidence by parliamentary.\n2. The Executive Arm of Government\nIn a general sense, the executive is that branch of government which gives effect to the will of state by carrying out or executing the law of the land. A chief executive is invested with the executive powers and assisted by subordinate departments or ministries responsible to him that carry out specific areas of law and policy.\nWe must recognize that in the modern states, those officials generally called “Executives” perform two distinct principal roles. The first is that of “chief of state”, acting as the nation’s official ceremonial head and spokesman for its whole people. The second is that of “Head of Government”, acting as the leader of the office holders who propose, direct and enforce the nation’s public policies. In a parliamentary system of government, each role is performed by a distinctly different official or groups of officials, whereas in the presidential system both are performed by the same official.\nGrowth of Executive Powers\nIn recent years, the powers and functions of the executives world-wide have continued to grow. This is true in the parliamentary as well as in presidential system. Thus, because of the enormous growth in the executive power, the American President has been described as “the great engine probably the most important of democracy and governmental institutions in the world. Also, Richard Crossman, a political scientist, claims that Britain no longer has cabinet government at all but is really under “prime ministerial government. He argues that the powers of the legislature have not only declined vis-a-vis the cabinet but also that the powers of the latter have sharply declined vis-a-vis the prime minister, who is no longer primus inter pares as thes theory would have it, but actually the boss.\nThe executive is the organ of government responsible for implementation, execution or enforcement of law, policies and directives made by the legislature. The executive arm in Nigeria is composed of the President, Ministers, Special Assistants and the Civil Service, likewise the state and local government levels.\nFunctions of the Executive\nThe main functions of the executive are trychotomously classified as fallows.\n- The administrative factions.\n- The legislative functions.\n- The judicial functions.\n- The executive maintains foreign relations and signs treaties with foreign countries.\n- The executive initiate, control and coordinate the administration of the state, i.e recruitment and discipline of the civil servants, creation of employment etc.\n- It appoints and removes cabinet members including chief Justice of the federation.\n- The executive prepares the budget of the country every financial year.\n- The executive formulate policies that guide the administration of the state.\n- The executive initiates and submit bills to the legislature for consideration and passage into law\n- The chief executive gives assent to bills before they can become law\n- In a presidential system, the president can veto any bill brought before him for his assent, which he does not support.\nThe executive through the powers granted to it by the constitution performs judicial function of pardoning people convicted of criminal offence. It may also reduce the sentence passed against a convict.\nReasons for the Growing Concentration of Powers in the Executive\n- The growth of disciplined party system. The chief executive is normally the party leader and exercises considerable influence over the legislature. Political parties spell out the basic policy lines a government will follow and assume a particular policy line by putting their people or trusted allies into cabinet and important administrative positions.\n- The growing number and complexity of governmental policies and problems.\n- National emergencies, real or imagined, that bring quick extensive increases in executive powers.\n- The nature of modern government is such that leadership, continuous, concentrated and coordinating, adequately informed and equipped, is virtually necessary.\n3. The Judiciary\nThe judiciary is the third arm of government that is responsible for the interpretation and application of laws and citizens, the trial of cases involving individuals, organizations and the state. The judiciary acts as the watchdog of the law by making sure the laws made are obeyed and those who refuse to obey the laws are severely punished.\nFunctions of the Judiciary\n- The overall function of the judiciary is to interpret laws made by the legislature.\n- Settlement of disputes between citizens and citizens, and between citizens and the government\n- The judiciary interprets the constitution and protects it against violation. It can declare as null and void or unconstitutional any law passed by the legislature which does not conform to the constitution\n- Determination of election petition. This is done in order to ascertain the offenders.\n- Ensures that other organs do not exceed their powers and interfere in the work of one another.\nThe Doctrine of Separation of Power\nThe principle of separation of power was popularized by a French political thinker and Jurist Baron de Montesquieu in his book titled: “Espirit des Lois” which means the spirit of law published in 1748. Montesquieu said that political liberty can only be preserved if there is abuse of power.\nEvery man invested with power is liable to abuse it, and to carry his authority as far as he will go. He argued that if the rights, liberty and freedom of the citizens are to be maintained and guaranteed, then the three organs or arms of government must be separated and entrusted to different people to administer. His concern arose from the experience that, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\nThat there will be chaos, violence, dictatorship, tyranny and victimization if there is no separation of powers.\nThe Doctrine of Check and Balances\nThe theory of checks and balance states that there should be mutual checks on the activities and excesses of the various organs. The aim of this is to avoid a too powerful and domination of the other organs. In this regard, members of the legislature act as a check on the activities of the executives and judiciary. The judiciary also acts as a check so that the constitutional provisions are not violated by the executive or legislative organs of government. The executive and legislative organs both check the Judiciary to avoid abuse.\nChecks and balances therefore represent the process whereby each organ of government acts as a check or watchdog on the other. This prevents government from becoming autocratic and helps to protect and promote the enjoyment of fundamental human rights by the citizens.']"	['<urn:uuid:957f0b65-a77b-4132-9958-14e64af2cd2f>', '<urn:uuid:858e16f0-753b-42d7-8ca0-76596226f100>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	10	54	2622
76	Being interested in the Russian Revolution's early stages, I'd like to know what exactly happened when the Bolsheviks seized power in Petrograd?	On November 7 (October 25 in the old-style calendar), Bolshevik Red Guards led by Leon Trotsky mounted an armed insurrection in Petrograd, capturing several government buildings and seizing the Winter Palace, which was the seat of Alexander Kerensky's Provisional Government. The Bolsheviks then declared a new government called the Council of People's Commissars, with Vladimir Lenin as its head.	"[""The Fall of the Ottoman Empire\nSouthern Asia 1917.1107\nMiddle Eastern Theatre of World War I, Russian Revolution, end of the Ottoman Empire (7 November 1917)\nHistorical Map of South & Southwest Asia\nUnfortunately for the Allies, the new Russian Republic which had arisen after the February Revolution was weak and unstable. On November 7 (October 25 in the old-style calendar), Vladimir Lenin's revolutionary Bolshevik party seized power in Petrograd, the capital, and overthrew the government. Further armed insurrections took place across Russia.\nChanges to the map 06 July 1917 - 07 November 1917\nIn Mesopotamia, the British have advanced up the Tigris, destroying Ottoman positions at Tikrit although not permanently occupying that town. In the east, they have begun securing the border with Persia.\nIn Persia, the Russians are continuing to withdraw. The British are still fighting tribes around Shiraz.\nIn Palestine, the British have resumed their advance with Arab support in the Jordan valley.\nIn the Arabian peninsula, the Arab rebels have almost completely expelled the Ottomans. Medina still holds out, supported at the cost of sending supplies down the long and vulnerable Hejaz Railway.\nSometime between 1916 and 1917, the Aidids of Upper Asir begin to assert their independence. However Ottoman forces remain in Abha, their capital, until after the end of the War.\nIn Ethiopia, Lij Iyasu's revolt has been defeated although Iyasu himself has escaped. In British East Africa, British forces have brought an end to the revolt of Juba tribes.\nBritish Protectorates in the Persian Gulf\nThe British Residency of the Persian Gulf maintains British India influence in a number of Gulf states. These states are nominally independent - and shown as such in most atlases from the period - but have all signed treaties guaranteeing British control over their foreign affairs.\nThe Sultanate of Muscat and Oman is the only one of these states with significant international relations, having obtained trade agreements with the US and France before it signed its treaty with Britain. Maps of the time often show Trucial Oman and even Qatar as regions of Oman.\nTrucial Oman is the region to the west of Oman which collectively signed treaties with Britain. The sheikhdoms of this region are often called the Trucial States, and will become the United Arab Emirates. However at this time they have little unity, with no regional council until 1952.\nThe British Indian Empire, also known as the British Raj, is comprised of a complex of presidencies, provinces, protectorates, and agencies. Only the top level subdivisions are shown here.\nThe area under direct British rule is known as British India and made up of presidencies and provinces - a presidency simply being the name for an older province.\nOutside British India, but often included within the sphere of the presidencies/provinces, are the hundreds of protectorates or 'princely states'. These are indirectly ruled states, the largest being Hyderabad, Kashmir, and Mysore. The others are either collected into agencies - which may in turn contain other smaller agencies - or fall under the sway of the provinces.\nEntry of China into World War I\nThe Republic of China, under Premier Duan Qirui, declares war on Germany, entering World War I on the side of the Allies.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour sends a letter confirming British support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine to Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. The letter, published on 9 November, is in contrast to British promises to the Arab independence movement.\nOn October 25 (Old Style), Bolshevik Red Guards, led by Leon Trotsky, mount an armed insurrection in Petrograd, capital of the Russian Republic, capturing several government buildings. The following day, they seize the Winter Palace, the seat of Alexander Kerensky's Provisional Government. The Bolsheviks declare a new government, the Council of People's Commissars, with Vladimir Lenin as its head. Simultaneously and over the following days, other Bolshevik uprisings take place in towns and cities across Russia.""]"	['<urn:uuid:db4f9447-8ee7-4c7c-ae41-d0ccf55b8c7b>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	22	59	669
77	what are dangers hypothermia prevention treatment canoe camping	There are two main dangers related to hypothermia in canoe camping. First, mountain rivers can be as cold as 40° in summer, and staying wet without drying off can gradually lead to hypothermia. Signs include lack of sensory perception and awareness. Second, for treatment, get the person dry, provide warm liquids or food/drinks with sugar (no caffeine unless cold water immersion), warm them in a sleeping bag, and stay with them to prevent sleep. Keep the person motivated and don't let them give up, as fear can worsen the situation.	"[""Your Canoe Equipment Checklist is one part of your camping trip. It also can be used by those planning a Kayak Camping trip, with just a few edits. The checklist at the bottom of this page can be used as a starting point. Make changes to fit your needs, time of year and area you will be camping in.\nWhen review the list, think about how much room you will have, and how long you will be gone. Think small, compact and is it necessary. There is not one person who has gone camping that has over or under packed. As you review the list, start with the basics and go from there.\nMake sure you adjust your Canoe Equipment Checklist to consider seasonal temperatures and type of waterways traveled. If the campsite is one on a lake that you will be returning to every evening, then add some items from our tent camping checklist.\nOn the other hand, if your trip is headed down river, then a single tent or no tent (just a tarp) may be needed. A camping hammock would be ideal for this type of camping. The backpacking checklist can help here with some items that may not appear on this list.\nAbove all, make sure you have emergency rations of food, clean drinking water, and First Aid Kit. One mishap with a poorly packed canoe and you'll find yourself without the basic necessities to stay alive.\nOne of the hidden dangers of canoeing or kayaking is not the possibility of drowning. The danger comes from the body beginning to shut down due to hypothermia.\nMany mountain rivers can be as cold as 40° in the summertime. Staying wet for most of the day without pulling off, and getting a chance to dry off, and warm up can bring on hypothermia and it can happen very gradually.\nIf a person has begun to show signs of lack of sensory perception and lack of awareness of surroundings, then there is a good chance that the body temperature has begun to drop and the body is shutting down.\nRead up on what emergency actions need to be started to bring someone out of this dangerous state. There are many websites and medical journals that can offer simple to follow steps on both preventing hypothermia and what to do to for someone with hypothermia.\nCamping Equipment Checklist\nCooking Equipment (cont'd)\n|Aluminum Foil (Heavy Duty)||Mitts, Oven||Bungi cords/straps|\n|Bottle opener/corkscrew||Mugs/cups||Duct tape/electrical tape|\n|Water bottles||Paper Plates, Bowls, Cups||Dust pan / Whisk broom|\n|Mixing bowls||Paper Towels / Napkins||Glue/super glue|\n|Can Opener||Pot Grabber||Hatchet|\n|canister, Food-storage||Pot Holders||Knife or Multi-Tool|\n|Charcoal and Lighter Fluid||roasting sticks||Knife sharpener|\n|chimney, charcoal||Plastic Silverware||Machete|\n|Coffee Pot||Camp Stove||Mallet or Hammer|\n|container(s), Collapsible water||thermos||Pliers, wrench|\n|Cook Set (pots & pans)||Trash bags; resalable bags||Saw|\n|cooler||Utensils (spoons, spatula, etc)||Small shovel / Trowel|\n|cups, plastic||Ziploc bags||\n|Dish Soap & Dish Rags||\n|Dish towels||Door mat||Flashlight|\n|Egg holder(s)||Multi-tool or knife||Lantern with fuel/mantles|\n|Extension sticks/roasting items||Seam sealant||Maglight|\n|Fuel (propane, white gas, etc.)||Stakes|\n|Funnel||Sun shade, tarp or screen house|\n|Grill||Tent (with stakes and guy lines)||\n|Grill rack||Tent repair kit||\n|Hot-cold vacuum bottle||Tent-pole repair sleeve||Blankets|\n|Water Jug||Utility bags for storage||Fleece sleeping bag liner|\n|Lighter fluid||Sleeping Bag|\n|Measuring cups & spoons||Pillows|"", '-by Jay Murdock, SDKC Safety Editor\nWhile I compiled this condensed list of treating the most common first aid issues in the mountains, most of it also applies to situations on the water. This info can be put on a 8×11 sheet of paper, and carried with your first aid kit.\nSHOCK – Rapid & shallow breathing, disorientation, sweating, pale/grey/clammy skin, nausea, vomiting, thirst. Maintain body temperature, elevate arms & feet, make comfortable, reassure with positive talk, and stay with person. Treat underlying cause of the shock (stop bleeding, etc). No food or liquids.\nCPR – Check for alertness, check for breath, check for pulse. Look for cause and make person safe. Maintain body temperature, and insulate from cold ground if possible, or shade person if in hot sunlight. Send for help. Open airway, but don’t move person if there are signs of trauma (broken bones, internal injuries). Give 2 quick breaths, followed by 30 fast compressions (1 per second). Place heel of hand 1 inch up from the apex of lower rib cage. Continue for up to 60 minutes if needed. Hypothermic revived to 3.5 hours of CPR. Make sure there is no pulse & no breathing before you begin CPR in all cases. Use eye glasses under nose.\nSEVERE HEAD INJURY – Life threatening. Bleeding may not be present. Person may be unconscious, delirious, confused. Look for nausea, vomiting, slurred speech, deformity, unequal pupils, headache, dizziness, convulsions, staggered walk, breathing problems, sleepiness, loss of memory, blue lips or nails. If unconscious, suspect spinal cord injury also, and do not move except to protect life (to stop bleeding, choking on blood, or move from rock fall area, etc). Treat for shock and monitor breathing, keeping airway open. Keep head higher than the body if conscious. Avoid over-pressure when stopping bleeding. If open wound and brain protrusion, cover with dressing without applying pressure. Even if person states/acts/looks ok, suspect brain injury. Have person sit, and do not give aspirin, food or water. Send for help fast, with all observed info and location. Person must be air lifted out if possible, even if they act/look ok.\nHEADACHE – When there is a headache only, take acetaminophen with 1 liter of water. If headache is gone quickly, it is not mountain sickness (AMS).\nHEART ATTACK – Shortness of breath, pressure in the chest, pain in upper abdomen/neck/left shoulder and arm, nausea, dizziness, sweating. Have person sit and give aspirin or Excedrin Extra Strength. Loosen clothing, make comfortable. If unconscious, give CPR. Send for help fast.\nBLEEDING – Profuse bleeding can cause death. Internal bleeding will cause shock. External bleeding must be stopped before CPR is started, if you are the only person giving aid. Send for help. Treat for shock. Do not give aspirin. Use direct pressure. Apply your hand, cloth, etc and keep the pressure applied. Use a loose tourniquet if needed. Check on the under-side of the person, even if you suspect severe trauma. You must stop the bleeding, or death will result.\nBEE / WASP STING – Anaphylactic shock if a reaction, and is life threatening. Difficult breathing, swelling of the face, eyes, tongue. Treat with an antihistamine spay, and/or Benadryl tablet (crush and dissolve in a few drops of water and immediately put under the tongue). Apply endotracheal tube if breathing stops. **\nBROKEN BONES – Person will “guard” the broken area. A “compound fracture” will have bleeding and bone protrusion. Treat for bleeding and shock. Stabilize the area, and do not allow it to move. Cover open wound with clean cloth/bandage. A broken rib can penetrate the lung. Listen for air escaping, and tape a plastic bag over the hole. Do not give aspirin.\nBURNS – First Degree top layer only. Apply cool water. Take Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen for pain. Second Degree two skin layers with blisters. Do same as First and apply triple antibiotic, then loose gauze. Third Degree is an emergency with no pain. Keep area clean, away from clothing, raise area above heart. Evacuate.\nDEHYDRATION – Nausea, headache, confusion, dizziness, thirst, weakness. Altitude and low humidity will contribute. Seek shade, sit down, drink plenty of water or Gatorade, and rest for a while. No salt or food, except for high-energy foods in moderation. After recovery, stay away from spicy foods that day. Diarrhea, burns, or vomiting caused dehydration causes low blood sodium levels. Water and salt is then needed. A low salt level can lead to unconsciousness and death.\nHEAT EXHAUSTION – Caused by high humidity and high temperatures. Humidity will not allow for sweating to be effective. Not life threatening. Cool person down, drink water/Gatorade, get plenty of rest. Don’t eat, except snacks.\nHEAT STROKE – Life threatening. Person cannot cool down. Red face, lack of sweating, breathing difficulty. Severe vomiting, headache and diarrhea, leading to convulsions and unconsciousness. Cool person down and give plenty of water or Gatorade. If near water, immerse 2 limbs in water to aid cooling. Treat for shock and send for help.\nHYPOTHERMIA – Disorientation, sluggishness, dizziness, weakness, uncontrolled shivering, desire to lie down and sleep. Often brought on by dehydration and exhaustion. Get person dry, give warm liquids, or food/drink with sugar, but NO caffeine (unless cold water immersion). Warm in sleeping bag, and get in with person if going unconscious. Don’t let person go to sleep, and stay upbeat. Do not let person “give up”. Overt fear will cause the situation to become worse.\nACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS – Nausea, dizziness, severe headache, disorientation, weakness, thirst, coughing, breathing difficulty and gurgling sound, difficulty sleeping. Can be life threatening. Give plenty of water, and get person to lower altitude. Do not leave unattended. You must get person down the hill. If headache or breathing difficulty persists, get medical help FAST, as this could be cerebral or pulmonary edema. Give aspirin or Ibuprofen. HAPE & HACE. Test for HACE: “Walk the Line”. Three “Golden Rules”: 1. If sick at altitude, it is AMS until proven otherwise. 2. Never ascend with AMS. 3. If you are getting worse, go down at once. Any delay can result in death. If person has HACE (high altitude cerebral edema), get medical help, even if feeling better.\nLIGHTNING STRIKE – Can kill within 30 ft on land, 300 ft on water. Divide number of seconds by 5 to get distance. Get off exposed areas and get low by squatting. Stay away from tall trees. If in your tent, sit up, and place all your clothes under you, including your feet. Drink lots of water. First Aid: treat for trauma, broken bones, and burns. Treat for shock.\nHANTAVIRUS – Deer mice droppings breathed in from dust or transferred by contaminated kitchen gear or food. Pick up your feet as you walk. Protect all kitchen gear and utensils. Check food for signs of mice. Wash hands after contact with those items if you see droppings, or holes in food wrappings.\nINFECTION / POISONING – Caused by air-borne or water-borne protozoa or virus. Can contaminate eating and drinking items. Protect and clean those items, especially after a rain. Dig down 3 inches from surface when using snow for water. Treat all drinking water, wiping the opening of the container after treatment. Be careful when washing face or swimming.\nIMPALED OBJECTS – Leave in place, unless obstructing the airway. Treat for bleeding and immobilize the object. Hold on & walk person out, or send for help.\nGOING FOR HELP – After assessing situation, send 2 walking out, with your location on a map, staying on a trail, not cross-country. They need to carry map, compass, rain gear, warm clothes, two headlamps, food and water. Make sure they have all pertinent information about victim’s condition.\n**- Applying an endotracheal tube requires training. If you are serious about leading a group in remote areas, you should do that. I took EMT training at the Balboa Naval Hospital, first aid training as a volunteer fire fighter, and Red Cross Instructor classes. I also taught wilderness first aid at the college level, and took part in a rescue of a fallen climber on the face of Mt Whitney, who had severe injuries and hypothermia.\nNote: Before each trip you should go over the above info to refresh your memory, then go over it with the group at the start of each trip. You can never over-prepare for this.']"	['<urn:uuid:672a4220-d453-4b20-a21e-b191f239d758>', '<urn:uuid:4c41afe9-9fb9-441c-98e0-69fb1bee8419>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	8	90	1925
78	help my basement heater not working fan never turns on what controls fans in furnace	In forced-air heating equipment, fan motors are controlled by fan switches. There are three types of fan switches used in industry: Temperature Controlled, Time and Temperature Controlled, and Time Controlled. The temperature-controlled fan switch is essentially a thermostat that closes when temperature rises to start the fan motor when the furnace can supply warm air to the structure.

During this pre-purge cycle, the combustion blower runs to clear the heat exchanger of any unburned gas. This cycle usually lasts 30 to 45 seconds.On a call for heat, the ignition module does a self-check, and if a failure is shown, the ignition won’t start. If the checks are good, the module begins a safety lockout timing, powers the spark igniter, and opens the solenoid valve so gas can flow to the pilot. The pilot must light within a certain period of time or the module closes the valve.When the pilot lights, current flows from the ignition sensor through the pilot flame to the burner head and then to ground; the ionized pilot flame provides a current path between the rod and burner head, rectifying the current. Because of the difference in size of the sensor and burner, current flows in only one direction. The current is a pulsating direct or rectified current, and it tells the module that a flame has been established. Ignition stops and the second main gas valve opens, allowing gas to flow to the main burner.As long as this rectified flame current remains above the minimum, the module keeps the main gas valves open. If the current drops below\n18 Direct Ignition Burner Control System The direct ignition systems use a spark igniter (direct spark ignition) or a silicon carbide igniter (hot surface ignition) to light the main gas burner directly.Ignition stops after a designated time or when the main burner flame ignition has been properly proved.The typical components of a direct ignition burner control system are the ignition module, igniter, sensor, gas control, and other common controls used on any type of gas furnace.\n19 The Operational Sequence of the Direct Ignition Burner Control System On a call for heat, most modules have a pre-purge cycle that occurs before ignition. During this pre-purge cycle, the combustion blower runs to clear the heat exchanger of unburned gas. The cycle usually lasts 30 to 45 seconds.On a call for heat, the ignition module does a self-check, and if a failure is shown, the ignition will not start. If the checks are good, the module begins a safety lockout, powers the igniter, and opens the gas valve.Once ignition starts, the burner must light and ignition must be proved within the safety lockout timing. If the burner does not light, then the ignition stops and the gas valve closes. On a lockout, the system must be manually reset. Many modules allow for several attempts at ignition before locking out.\n20 The Operational Sequence of the Direct Ignition Burner Control System When the flame lights, current flows from the sensor through the ionized pilot flame to the burner head and then to ground. The current is a pulsating, direct, or rectified current, and it tells the module that flame has been established. Ignition stops and the burner continues to run.As long as this rectified flame current remains above the minimum, the module keeps the gas valve open. If the current drops below the minimum or becomes unsteady, the module interrupts power to the gas valve, closing the valve and stopping gas flow. The module then performs the start safety check and, if it’s safe, the module attempts ignition again. Figure shows a flowchart of the operation of a direct ignition system.\n21 Typical Diagram of Gas Furnace with Direct Ignition Controller\n22 Oil Heating ControlsThe function of an oil burner control system is to turn the heating system on and off in response to the needs of the conditioned space.The control must also safeguard the operation of the heating appliance and oil burner.The primary control is the heart of an oil burner control system and supervises the operation of the oil burner.The primary control must control the oil burner motor, ignition transformer, and oil solenoid valve, if used, upon a call for heat.The primary control must safely control the operation of the oil burner.The primary control must ensure that the burner has lit and that the flame has been proved.Most primary controls will have to be manually reset once a flame failure has occurred in the oil burner.\n23 Cad Cell Oil Burner Primary Controls This primary control device cad cell mounted so that it its resistance according to cad cell decreases as the consists of a primary control and a light-sensitive views the oil burner flame.The cad cell changes the intensity of the light. The resistance of the intensity of the light increases\n26 Stack Switch Oil Burner Primary Controls The stack switch is a heat-actuated control that uses the stack temperature to indicate that the oil burner has or has not established a flame.A bimetal element inserted into the stack actuates a push rod when the bimetal senses heat, signaling that the flame has been established and breaking the circuit to the safety switch.The correct location and mounting of the stack switch is in the center of the stack or vent in the direct path of the hot flue gases.The stack switch primary control starts the burner and supervises burner operation. When the thermostat calls for heat, the stack switch closes a relay, which starts the burner motor and ignition transformer and opens the oil solenoid, if used.At the same time, the safety switch heater starts to heat. If the oil burner establishes a flame and heat is felt in the stack, the bimetal in the stack switch will open a set of contacts, thus dc-energizing the safety switch heater.Stack switches are available with intermittent ignition, which stops the ignition transformer when the flame has been proven.\n27 Typical Diagram of an Oil-Fired Furnace with Cad Cell Primary Control\n28 Typical Diagram of Oil-Fired Furnace with Stack Switch']"	['<urn:uuid:b3c5fb2a-3c33-431e-9682-dc729271170c>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	15	58	1583
79	What were the dimensions of the ancient walls at Koilyk?	The earth walls were about 12 feet high, 16 feet thick at the bottom and nine feet at the top, forming a parallelogram approximately 700 yards in length and 300 yards in breadth.	['Wherever he travelled in Central Asia and Siberia, Thomas Atkinson always took an interest in archaeological remains. He was not a historian, but would often try to find out about the various impressive ruins and strange earthworks he came across on his travels. For example, in Oriental and Western Siberia he describes a copper knife he had been given by Cossacks, who had found it near the Bouchtarma River in what is now northern Kazakhstan. They cut it in half, he says, believing it to be gold.\nOn 30th November 1859 Thomas also delivered a paper at the Geological Society in London “On some bronze relics found in an auriferous sand in Siberia”, at which he exhibited the said fragments. He told his audience that the decorated bronze pieces, which appeared to be either from a horse harness or a bracelet, were found in August 1851 on the River Shargan in southern Siberia (lat. 59֯ 30’ N and long. 96֯ 10’ E) and that he was given them only hours later by the director of the goldmine in which they were found. The miners were excavating a bank of gravel and sand and the objects were found at a depth of around 14 feet. “As I have no theory to establish, I give them without any speculations as to the period when these relics were deposited in the sandy gold-bearing bed”, he remarked.\nOriental and Western Siberia also gives a brief description of Thomas’ visit in 1847 to Ablaikit, near Oskemen, (Ust-Kamenogorsk) in north-eastern Kazakhstan. This is the site of a ruined Buddhist monastery compound that dates back to the seventeenth century and which had also been visited and drawn (see below) by Peter Simon Pallas, the German-born scientist who spent the years 1768-74 travelling in Siberia and Central Asia. The site is of great interest to modern-day archaeologists and this summer a major investigation into the site was begun.\nThomas, who was seemingly unaware of Pallas’ writings, writes: “We now turned to the south, riding along about a verst from the foot of the high rocks and had not gone far when we came upon a large enclosure surrounded by a thick wall build of very large blocks, with smaller stones fitted in between them. This wall encloses a space of almost a verst in length and half a verst in width, extending up to the foot of some perpendicular rocks. It has been a work of great labour and must have been built by a different race from the present, who look upon it with wonder. In some parts it is six feet high, in others a little less and seven feet thick. None of the blocks have been cut.” Clearly as a former mason, he was particularly interested in the stone work.\nHe spent some time at the ruins, entering the enclosure, much to the surprise of his Kazakh guides, who declined to follow due to their superstitious beliefs.\nFurther south, during his journey to Kapal with Lucy in the summer of 1848, as he approached the Djungar Alatau mountains, Thomas came across further examples of earthworks and buildings from prehistory. He remarks in his second book, Travels in the Regions of the Upper and Lower Amoor, on the profusion of kurgans (tumuli) they saw, describing some places where there were literally hundreds of mounds, of all shapes and sizes, dotted across the landscape.\nOne particular description has always interested me, but until now I have not been able to identify its location. He writes: “The ancient inhabitants of this region rendered it extremely productive. The numerous canals which still exist show their engineering skill and the extent of the irrigation it produced. In some of the channels the water yet runs and where it overflows, the sterile soil is covered with a luxuriant carpet of vegetation, adorned with flowers of singular beauty…The vast number of tumuli scattered over the plain, the extensive earthworks which have been either cities or strongholds, afford convincing evidence that a great people were once located here.”\nHe describes one such ancient group of buildings in the valley of the Lepsy River, describing it as “a parallelogram about 700 yards in length and 300 in breadth. The earth walls are now about 12 feet high and have been considerably higher. Their thickness is about 16 feet at the bottom and nine feet at the top. This enclosure was entered by four gates, one being in the centre of each side; but the eastern end has been partly destroyed by the river, which is gradually cutting down the bank.\n“Half a mile to the north and south are numerous mounds and at about a mile from the western end there is a large tumulus, about 150 feet in diameter and 50 feet high. The people who produced them were a very different race to the present occupiers of the country and had made an extraordinary advance in agriculture and mining.”\nLast year, as I travelled south-west from Lake Alakool towards Lepsinsk, Sarcand and Kapal, I had tried to locate this place, but could find no-one who knew anything about it. However, this week, after a determined online search I think I have found the exact spot, which is in the modern-day village of Koilyk (previously called Kayalyk or, more recently, Antonovka), not far from Sarcand. Read this recent description: “Kayalyk territory was surrounded by a fortified wall, having the form of an irregular quadrilateral with sides of 750 to 1,200 meters. Nowadays, it has been preserved well in the eastern part of the unoccupied area of modern buildings and the height reaches 4 m. Elsewhere it can be observed only fragmentary. Certain significant buildings, such as the Buddhist temple, are located at a distance of a few hundred meters from the city walls. This means that agricultural land, farms, centers of spiritual missions were at a considerable distance from the city, enclosed by the city wall, built from mud brick.” You can read more about this site here.\nFrom this description I have no doubt that it is the same place described by Thomas as an irregular parallelogram. Recent archaeological investigation has revealed that the site is archaeologically extremely rich, with the remains of a large mosque dating back to the early Islamic period, as well as Buddhist and Manichaean temples. This was once an important town on the Silk Road, close to the ‘Djungarian Gates’ that lead through the mountains eastwards into what is now Xinjiang in Western China.\nI am now working on an Atkinson Trail for the Zhetysu region of Eastern Kazakhstan and Koilyk will certainly be one of the highlights.']	['<urn:uuid:dc4bdc81-9a5e-4795-b890-9d0a5646ff61>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	10	33	1111
80	newborn baby health checks free cost	Many hospitals and local public health agencies provide free screening services for newborns, including hearing screenings before leaving the hospital, metabolic blood screenings (with 29 recommended by the March of Dimes), and early eye examinations. Additionally, local school districts and early childhood intervention agencies typically provide screening services free of charge. In Illinois, all newborns are screened for multiple disorders including biotinidase deficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, galactosemia, hypothyroidism, PKU, lysosomal storage diseases, sickle cell disease, and other metabolic disorders.	"[""Some developmental delays\nand disabilities among babies and young children are preventable. Some conditions can be treated or eliminated when early detection\nand the right treatments are provided to infants and toddlers\n. Learn ways you can recognize\n, treat, and prevent developmental delays and disabilities in babies, young children, kindergarteners, and preschoolers.\n1. Contact Your Public Health Agency for Programs for Healthy Babies and Toddlers\nMany local public health agencies provide educational programs for women who are pregnant or are considering becoming pregnant. They often provide screening services to help you determine and address any risk-factors that may affect your child's health and well-being. Many agencies also provide free programs to help you improve your health and give your child the best possible start in life. Smoking, substance abuse, and lifestyle counseling and growth programs are available. Public health agencies can also assist you with referrals to other agencies and low or no-cost health services. Early intervention agencies can help in identifying early signs of learning disabilities\n2. Talk with Your Doctor About the Importance of Folic AcidMany doctors and public health agencies recommend the use of Folic Acid to prevent Neural Tube Defects (NTDs), also called spina bifida or open spine. Approximately 70% of NTDs may be prevented by use of Folic Acid in the early pre-natal period. Some doctors recommend using Folic Acid before becoming pregnant as well.\n3. Infant Hearing Screenings Detect Early Deafness and Hearing ProblemsMany hospitals screen newborns for hearing problems before they leave the hospital. If you are not sure, ask. Early treatment and intervention for hearing problems can possibly increase the possibility of your child being able to participate in a regular education program and lessen the negative impact of hearing problems on early language development.\n4. Immunizations Can Prevent Disabling Childhood DiseasesImmunizations can be controversial because of potential side-effects, yet many states require them my law. It is important to discuss concerns you may have with your child's doctor to get the most up-to-date information on the potential risks and benefits of immunizations. Some childhood diseases can cause lasting physical and intellectual disabilities. Further, certain childhood diseases can strike adults and are much more severe when that happens. Your doctor is the best resource to weigh your legal obligations and the importance of immunization.\n5. Learn About Newborn Metabolic Blood Screening in Your State\nAll states require some metabolic blood screening for infants. The March of Dimes recommends 29 screenings and provides public information\non them. Talk with your doctor about what screenings are required and any additional screenings that could be recommended based on your unique genetic history.\n6. Early Assessment and Treatment of Eye Problems - Have Your Child's Eyes ExaminedEarly eye examinations\ncan catch visual problems\nsuch as amblyopia, which can be addressed and sometimes reversed with early treatment.\n7. Contact Your Local School District for Early Childhood Screenings\nBecause early detection is important in the prevention of specific learning disabilities (slds), screening is important. Local school districts and early childhood intervention agencies provide screening services\nand are typically free of charge. For more information on screening programs, contact your pediatrician, local school district, or Head Start Program for contact information for assessment providers available in your area."", 'Information for Parents\nWhat disorders are included in the newborn screen?\nAll babies born in Illinois should be screened for the disorders listed below. Following is a short description of the disorders included in Illinois newborn screening. If you live in Illinois, but deliver your baby in another state, your baby may not be screened for these same disorders. You may want to discuss with your baby’s doctor, how to obtain additional screening if necessary. This screening is most accurate soon after your baby is born, so it is important to make arrangements before your baby’s birth, or as soon as possible after birth.\nBiotinidase deficiency may occur in one of every 150,000 births. Babies with this problem cannot use a vitamin called biotin. Without treatment, the baby’s growth and development will not be normal. A baby with biotinidase deficiency needs medicine containing biotin and regular medical care.\nCongenital Adrenal Hyperplasia\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) may occur in one of every 15,000 births. Most babies with this problem cannot produce enough of a hormone called cortisol. Sometimes, they also cannot produce enough of a salt-retaining hormone. Babies with CAH may develop medical problems including severe fluid loss (dehydration). Without enough cortisol, a baby’s growth and development will not be normal. A baby with CAH is given medicine to replace these important hormones and needs regular medical care.\nGalactosemia may occur in one of every 60,000 newborns. A baby with galactosemia cannot digest a certain part of milk sugar called galactose. The resulting buildup of galactose in the baby’s body can cause serious medical problems, including liver and brain damage. Babies with galactosemia are treated with a special lactose-free diet and need regular medical care. Early treatment can help prevent physical and mental damage.\nCongenital hypothyroidism may occur in one of every 3,000 newborns. A baby born with this problem does not make enough thyroid hormone, which is needed to help the baby grow normally and stay healthy. Without thyroid hormone, a baby’s growth and mental development will not be normal. A baby with congenital hypothyroidism is treated with medicine to replace the missing thyroid hormone and needs regular medical care.\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) may occur in one of every 12,000 births. Babies with PKU, an amino acid disorder, cannot properly use a substance found in proteins, phenylalanine. If this problem is not found and treated early, PKU can cause developmental delays and mental retardation. A baby with PKU is given a special formula and diet, and needs regular medical care.\nLysosomal Storage Diseases\nBabies with lysosomal storage diseases cannot break down certain waste products. These waste products build up within the body and cause serious medical problems affecting the baby’s health and development. Treatment depends on the specific disorder, and can include medications, enzyme replacement therapy, or may require stem cell or cord blood transplant very early in life. A baby with a lysosomal storage disease needs immediate and on-going medical care. Statewide screening of newborns for lysosomal storage disorders is scheduled to begin in 2014.\nSickle Cell Disease, Trait and Related Conditions\nEach year it is estimated that more than 80 babies in the state will be diagnosed with sickle cell disease, and 40 more babies will be diagnosed with another kind of sickling disorder. Sickling disorders can cause pain, damage vital organs and lead to serious infections. Babies with these disorders are treated with antibiotics, and need immunizations and regular medical care to help prevent some of these medical problems. The newborn screen for sickle cell disease also may find other related conditions that may or may not need treatment.\nOther Metabolic Disorders\nAdditional rare disorders, including some of the amino acid, urea cycle, fatty acid oxidation, organic acid disorders and lysosomal storage diseases, are included in the Illinois newborn screening panel. Babies with these disorders cannot breakdown or remove certain chemicals from their bodies. Without treatment, these chemicals can build up in the baby’s body and cause serious health and developmental problems.\nAmino Acid and Urea Cycle Disorders\nPKU is one of the more familiar of the amino acid disorders. Babies with amino acid and urea cycle disorders cannot properly process amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Without treatment, the buildup of these chemicals can cause serious medical problems affecting the baby’s health and development, including damage to vital organs, seizures and coma. Treatment depends on the disorder the baby has, but may include special low protein diets, medical treatments and medications. A baby with an amino acid or urea cycle disorder must have regular medical care.\nFatty Acid Oxidation Disorders\nBabies with one of these disorders have trouble burning fat for energy. Without treatment, these disorders can lead to serious medical problems affecting the baby’s health and development, including seizures, liver damage and coma. Treatment depends on the disorder the baby has, but may include special diets, supplements and medications. Babies with fatty acid oxidation disorders must have regular medical care.\nOrganic Acid Disorders\nBabies with organic acid disorders cannot remove certain waste products from their blood. Without treatment, the buildup of these waste products causes serious medical problems affecting the baby’s health and development, including seizures, coma and brain damage. Treatment depends on the disorder the baby has, but may include special diets, supplements and medications. A baby with an organic acid disorder must have regular medical care.\nCystic fibrosis (CF) may occur in one of every 4,000 newborns. A baby with CF produces thick, sticky mucus that causes respiratory and digestive problems. CF affects growth and damages a baby’s lungs and other organs. A baby with CF is treated with special diet supplements and vitamins to improve growth. In addition, breathing treatments, medications and special exercises can help maintain respiratory function. A baby with CF needs regular medical care.\nMore information about each of the diseases or disorders included in the screening panel can be found on the fact sheets.\nIllinois Department of Public Health\nGenetics and Newborn Screening Program\n535 W.

81	how do marijuana dispensary displays look and what shipping documents needed	Marijuana dispensaries use sophisticated display methods including sleek display cases, touch screens, and bakery-like showcase units. For example, Columbia Care uses soft lighting and modern seating vignettes, while Paper & Leaf features brightly lit handcrafted wooden cases. For shipping, businesses must use detailed shipping manifests that include specific information about the cannabis goods being transported. These manifests are a specialized subset of traditional Bills of Lading, requiring more extensive record retention and must be generated through a track and trace system before any transport begins.	['|PROJECT NAME||5 Marijuana Dispensaries Tap Into High Design|\n|FIRM||The High Road Design Studio; Johnson Squared Architecture; SemiGood Design; Bruce Hampton; RPG; Tanagram Design; The McBride Company|\nThe merging of design sectors is nothing new—in recent years we’ve seen hospitality approach residential, healthcare increasingly resemble hospitality, and retail claw its way towards art. But as legalized marijuana begins to sweep the U.S., an emerging design niche combines healthcare, retail, and hospitality for a new strain of interiors that, if you didn’t recognize their wares, could just as easily be mistaken for a luxe hair salon or a trendy coffee shop.\nSpeaking to this convergence, the following five projects are a timely reminder of how great design continues to shape human thinking and experience. Says Megan Stone, owner of The High Road Design Studio, “Design can be a powerful tool in changing negative perceptions of cannabis and elevating the value these businesses can add to a community. As a result, a more sustainable and profitable business is possible.”\n“The industry needs to provide a sales experience that reflects the evolving perception of marijuana,” explains Pat McBride, CEO, The McBride Company. “The store design and atmosphere we created offers consumers a space that incorporates all the elements of great retail design, but addresses the unique display and service challenges faced by the cannabis retail industry.” Read on to see how designers are bringing a long stigmatized business into the design fold, often with reclaimed wood, industrial lighting, and natural stone (no pun intended).\n1. Firm: The High Road Design Studio.\nProject: Park Range Recreationals.\nLocation: Oak Creek, Colorado.\nStandout: Forging a positive connection to the community was goal one for retail designer Megan Stone, who owns the very first design firm we’ve seen to specialize in cannabis retail design. Park Range Recreationals combines polished interiors with references to Oak Creek’s history: 14-foot-high ceilings in custom plaid are a nod to the local hunting scene, while beetle kill pine and hickory floors reference the area’s forestry. The 500-square-foot space maintains a sense of openness thanks to storage carefully concealed behind wooden paneling and an arsenal of stainless-steel canisters reminiscent of old-world apothecaries. A steel library ladder adds to the inviting atmosphere worthy of its coveted Main Street location.\nProject: Paper & Leaf.\nLocation: Bainbridge Island, Washington State.\nStandout: Paper & Leaf opened its doors last summer to embody the distinct vision co-owners Brendan Hill and Steven Kessler: a high-end art gallery with a warm, inviting atmosphere. This means brightly lit, handcrafted wooden cases and a 12-foot-long sprawling oak table by Coyote Woodshop, dubbed the “discovery station.” Adding to the warming effect, bamboo lines the rafters, helping to banish any customer’s concern that their purchase might be “taboo.”\n3. Firms: Bruce Hampton; RPG.\nProject: Columbia Care.\nLocation: New York.\nStandout: New York-based design and build firm RPG created a branded experience for 10 medical marijuana dispensaries; here, the very first flagship was unveiled in New York in January. Wood, marble, bronze, and white solid surfacing are meant to appeal to patients, pharmacists, and consultants alike by creating a contemporary, comfortable environment firmly grounded in healthcare. The space creates a new face for medical marijuana thanks to soft lighting, modern seating vignettes, and large-format photography meant to educate patients on the wellness properties of various cannabis plants. Additional videos and tablets for each patient endeavor to offer the highest standards of professionalism.\n4. Firm: Tanagram Design.\nProject: Silverpeak Apothecary.\nLocation: Aspen, Colorado.\nStandout: In Colorado, legal marijuana is transforming the retail scene with pot shops popping up everywhere. In Aspen, you can expect them to look a little nicer. That’s where Tanagram Design turned Silverpeak Apothecary into a luxe environment with warm wood accents and sleek display cases that are a far cry from tie-dye and plywood.\n5. Firm: The McBride Company.\nProject: Pineapple Express.\nStandout: This national chain is biding its time until the federal legalization of marijuana—which they believe will happen in the next three years. But they’re ahead of the game with a design concept they’re planning to roll out across the U.S., inspired by the aesthetic of a refined Hawaiian resort. “We sought to address the many setbacks, inefficiencies and outdated technologies present in the current legal dispensary model,” says Pineapple Express founder Matthew Feinstein. “The McBride Company took our vision and delivered an ideal shop design that is unique, streamlined and incredibly memorable.” The design team rejects the traditional consultation counter we’re seeing at other marijuana dispensaries and instead embraces a true retail experience with touch screens, creative installations, bakery-like display cases, and plush furniture.\nFor More Information About This Blog Post, Click Here!', 'This post was prompted in part by some of the questions we have received regarding IRC Sec. 280E.1 Some in the cannabis industry appear to not realize that IRC Sec. 280E applies to the industry before the retail [Dispensary] level.\nWe begin a series of posts relating to IRC Sec. 280E with a discussion of the application of this issue to the transportation [e.g. how an item gets from “here” to “there”] of cannabis.\nThe framework for our discussion is the commercial cannabis industry in California.\nThe three principal governmental agencies involved in the promulgation of cannabis regulations relating to transportation are: the Bureau of Cannabis Control (“BCC”); the California Department of Public Health (“”CDPH”); and the California Department of Food & Agriculture (“CDFA”).\nOther California governmental agencies with a significant interest in the application of these regulations include: the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (“CDTFA”); the California Highway Patrol (“CHP”); the Division of Occupational Safety and Health (“CAOSHA”); and State of California Economic Development Department (“EDD”).\nThe principal bodies of existing California law relating to transportation are found in the California Vehicle Code and the California Uniform Commercial Code.\nThe regulations relating to cannabis transportation conflict with existing laws and regulations as well as established commercial practices relating to transportation. In those instances in which federal or California law already addresses a particular topic, or for which there are time-honored commercial practices involving the commercial movement of commodities, California’s cannabis regulations must be interpreted and applied in a manner that does not severely conflict with already established rules of law. If the conflicts are too severe, the cannabis regulations are likely to be determined to be preempted and not enforceable.\nCalifornia’s regulations relating to the transportation of commercial cannabis are founded on the utilization of a Manifest to facilitate the tracking of all commercial cannabis from source to consumer. A Manifest as the word is used in California’s cannabis regulations is specialized form of record of selected shipping information. The Manifest specified by California’s cannabis regulations is a subset of the information addressed generally in commercial shipments in a Bill of Lading. The Manifest specified in California’s cannabis regulations requires some information that would not be required by most commercial Bills of Lading. California’s cannabis regulations also specify more extensive record retention requirements than would be followed in general commercial practices. However, the Manifest specified by California’s cannabis regulations also appears to not have considered a wide-range of matters that may be addressed in Bills of Lading.\nBills of Lading are generally divided into two principal categories – negotiable and non-negotiable Bills of Lading. Notwithstanding this simple division into two categories, there are an almost infinite variety of special provisions dictated by the special requirements associated with specific materials or forms of transportation. The fundamental difference between a negotiable and a non-negotiable Bills of Lading turns on whether title to the material being transported passes on the delivery of the material to the transporter. One question which must be asked is whether the establishment of a transportation-only classification of transporter in California’s regulations considered whether such a business could utilize both negotiable and a non-negotiable Bills of Lading\nWe begin our analysis by defining a number of terms which are a prerequisite to understand the discussion which follows:\n“FOB Shipping Point”- is a contraction of the term “Free On-Board Shipping Point.” The term means that the buyer takes delivery of goods being shipped to it by a supplier once the goods leave the supplier’s shipping dock. Since the buyer takes ownership at the point of departure from the supplier’s shipping dock, the supplier should record a sale at that point. The Buyer assumes the risk of loss for goods from that point as well. The Buyer is responsible for the cost of shipping the goods.\n“FOB Destination” is a contraction of the term “Free On-Board Destination.” The term means that the buyer takes delivery of goods being shipped to it by a supplier once the goods arrive at the buyer’s receiving dock. The supplier records the sale when the goods are received by the buyer and bears the risk of loss while the goods are in transit. The supplier is usually responsible for the shipping cost.\n“Transport” means the physical movement of cannabis goods from one licensed premises to another licensed premises. Reg. Sec. 5000 (r)\n“Transportation Procedures2” – A description of the applicant’s procedure for transportation of cannabis goods, including whether or not the applicant will be transporting cannabis goods or contracting for transportation services. Reg. Sec. 5002 (c)(29)(A)(i)\n“Track and Trace System” – A licensee shall create and maintain an active and functional account within the track and trace system prior to engaging in any commercial cannabis activity, including the purchase, sale, test, packaging, transfer, transport, return, destruction, or disposal, of any cannabis goods. Reg. Sec. 5048(a)\nShipping Manifest – The document which is required to accompany any commercial cannabis shipment, with specifically enumerated information3\n“Distributor” Distributor licensees are responsible for transporting cannabis goods, arranging for testing of cannabis goods, and conducting quality assurance review of cannabis goods to ensure they comply with all the packaging and labeling requirements. Distributor transport licenses allow for the transport of cannabis goods between licensed cultivators, manufacturers, and distributors. A distributor transport licensee may not transport cannabis goods to a licensed retailer and may not engage in any other distributor activates There is a specific definition provided for a “Distributor Transport Only License4”\n“Retailer” A Retailer (storefront) sells cannabis goods to customers at its premises or by delivery. A retailer must have a licensed physical location (premises) where commercial cannabis activates are conducted. A retailer (non-storefront) licensee must have a licensed premises, but it is not open to the public.\n“Manufacturer” means any involved in any aspects of the extraction process, and/or infusion process, and packaging and labeling processes, including processing, preparing, holding, and storing, packaging, or labeling of cannabis products. Manufacturing also includes any processing, preparing, holding, or storing of components and ingredients.\n“Cultivator” means anyone involved in any activity involving the planting, growing, harvesting, drying, curing, grading, or trimming of cannabis Reg. Sec. 8000(g)\nCommercial cannabis originates with a Cultivator that is in simple terms, a farmer5. The expenditures made by a Cultivator in producing a cannabis crop are, in general, classified as “Cost of Goods Sold”. So long as the Cultivator refrains from engaging in other activities which bring them closer to the “line” with activities that cross over into Distribution, a Cultivator should have minimal exposure to falling within the ambit of IRC Sec. 280E. [We will revisit the topic of Cultivator’s engaging in other activities in a separate post.]\nConsider two minor variations in the same simple transaction – a Cultivator sells cannabis to a Distributor or Manufacturer. The focus of this scenario is on the classification of transportation costs. In the first alternative, the Cultivator sells the cannabis to a Distributor, for a set price with shipping terms, FOB Shipping Point. The Cultivator gets paid for the cannabis and the transportation costs are paid directly by the Distributor. In the second alternative, the Cultivator ships OB Destination and pays the transportation costs. The final delivered cost of the cannabis is identical under both scenarios. Some may assert Cultivator’s payment of the transportation costs in the second alternative will cause the transportation costs to be exposed to disallowance under to IRC Sec. 280E because transportation constitutes a “trafficking” expense in many instances.\nWhile there is no clear definition of trafficking, we do not believe IRC Sec. 280E should apply the transaction for two reasons:\nThe results in both alternatives are identical. We believe the party that pays in an otherwise identical transaction that does not otherwise change the substance of the transaction should alone cause a different result for income tax purposes.\nMore importantly, the Cultivator has not in our opinion engaged in sufficient activities constituting trafficking to appear to has crossed into the Distributor type activities which constitute trafficking, such as testing, packaging for retail sale, and labeling.\nWhere cannabis is transported to a Manufacturer, a similar analysis should apply. We further believe that a similar result applies to transportation costs are incurred in bringing other supplies which are used in the extraction process such as alcohol, propane, etc.\nWhere a Distributor operates as a Transport Only business, the distributor appears to be solely performing a service provider role. The operating costs of such a business should NOT fall within IRC Sec. 280E as such a business is merely functioning as a shipping company. We will consider the activities of a Distributor that does more than transport and deliver in a subsequent post.\n““No deduction or credit shall be allowed for any amount paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business if such trade or business (or the activities which comprise such trade or business) consists of trafficking in controlled substances (within the meaning of schedule I and II of the Controlled Substances Act) which is prohibited by Federal law or the law of any State in which such trade or business is conducted.””\n2 Reg. Sec. 5311 – Requirements for the Transportation of Cannabis Goods The following requirements apply when transporting cannabis goods between licensees or licensed premises:\nTransportation shall only be conducted by persons holding a distributor license under the Act, or employees of those persons.\n(b)All vehicles transporting cannabis goods for hire shall be required to have a motor carrier permit pursuant to Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 34620) of Division 14.85 of the Vehicle Code.\n(c) Transportation by means of aircraft, watercraft, drone, rail, human powered vehicle, and unmanned vehicle is prohibited.\n(d) Cannabis goods shall only be transported inside of a vehicle or trailer and shall not be visible or identifiable from outside of the vehicle or trailer.\n(e) Cannabis goods shall be locked in a box, container, or cage that is secured to the inside of the vehicle or trailer. For purposes of this section, the inside of the vehicle includes the trunk.\n(f) While left unattended, vehicles and trailers shall be locked and secured.\n(g) A distributor shall not leave a vehicle or trailer containing cannabis goods unattended in a residential area or parked overnight in a residential area.\n(h) At a minimum, a distributor shall have a vehicle alarm system on all transport vehicles and trailers. Motion detectors, pressure switches, duress, panic, and hold-up alarms may also be used.\n(i) Packages or containers holding cannabis goods shall not be tampered with, or opened, during transport.\n(j) A distributor transporting cannabis goods shall only travel between licensees shipping or receiving cannabis goods and its own licensed premises when engaged in the transportation of cannabis goods. The distributor may transport multiple shipments of cannabis goods at once in accordance with applicable laws. A distributor shall not deviate from the travel requirements described in this section, except for necessary rest, fuel, or vehicle repair stops.\n(k) Under no circumstances may non-cannabis goods, except for cannabis accessories as defined in Business and Professions Code section 26001(g), be transported with cannabis goods.\n(l) Vehicles and trailers transporting cannabis goods are subject to inspection by the Bureau at any licensed premises or during transport at any time.\n(m) Notwithstanding subsections (d) and (e) of this section, if it is not operationally feasible to transport cannabis goods inside of a vehicle or trailer because the licensed premises that the cannabis goods will be transported from and the licensed premises that will be receiving the cannabis goods are located within the same building or on the same parcel of land, the cannabis goods may be transported by foot, hand truck, fork lift, or other similar means. A shipping manifest that complies with this division is required when transporting cannabis goods pursuant to this subsection.\n§ 5314. Shipping Manifest –\nPrior to transporting cannabis goods, a distributor shall generate a shipping manifest through the track and trace system for the following activities:\n(1) Testing and sampling;\n(2) Sale of cannabis goods to a licensee;\n(3) Destruction or disposal of cannabis goods; and\n(4) Any other activity, as required pursuant to this division, or by any other licensing authority.\nThe distributor shall transmit the shipping manifest to the Bureau and the licensee that will receive the cannabis goods prior to transporting the cannabis goods.\n(c) The distributor shall ensure and verify that the cannabis goods being taken into possession for transport at the originating licensed premises are as described and accurately reflected in the shipping manifest. For purposes of this section, the distributor may verify that the cannabis goods are accurately reflected in the shipping manifest by confirming that the number of boxes of cannabis goods, type of cannabis goods, weight or units of cannabis goods matches the label on the boxes containing the cannabis goods.\n(1) The distributor shall not take into possession or transport:\n(A) Any cannabis goods that are not on the shipping manifest; or\n(B) Any cannabis goods that are less than or greater than the amount reflected on the shipping manifest.\n(2) The distributor is responsible for any discrepancies between the shipping manifest and the cannabis goods in its possession during transport, and subject to any enforcement or disciplinary action related to such discrepancy.\n(3) A distributor shall not void or change a shipping manifest after departing from the originating licensed premises.\n(d)A shipping manifest shall accompany every transport of cannabis goods.\n(e) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, if a transporting distributor has not obtained access to the track and trace system, the distributor shall complete the shipping manifest outside of the track and trace system and transmit it to the Bureau and the licensee receiving the shipment by electronic mail.\n(f) If the transporting distributor has access to the track and trace system and the licensee receiving the shipment has not obtained access to the track and trace system, the distributor shall complete the shipping manifest in the track and trace system and transmit it to the Bureau. However, the distributor shall send a copy to the licensee receiving the shipment by electronic mail.\n5315. Distributor Transport Only License\n(a) A distributor transport only licensee may transport cannabis goods between licensees; however, they shall not transport any cannabis goods except for immature plants and seeds to a retailer or to the retailer portion of a microbusiness.\n(b)A complete application for a distributor transport only license shall include all the information required in an application for a Type 11-Distributor license.\nThe licensing fee for a distributor transport only license will be based in part upon whether the licensee intends to transport only cannabis goods that the licensee has cultivated or manufactured (self-distribution), or whether the licensee intends to transport cannabis goods cultivated or manufactured by other licensees.\nA distributor transport only licensee shall comply with all of the requirements for a holder of a Type 11-Distributor license, except for those related to quality assurance and testing.\n(e) A distributor transport only licensee shall not hold title to any cannabis goods unless the licensee also holds a state-issued cultivation, manufacturing, retailer, or microbusiness license.\n(f) Holding a distributor transport only license shall not authorize a licensee to:\n(1) Engage in the delivery of cannabis goods as defined in Business and Professions Code section 26001(p);\n(2) Engage in the wholesale, destruction, packaging, labeling, or storing of cannabis goods; or\n(3) Arrange for the testing of cannabis goods by a testing laboratory.\n(g) Notwithstanding subsection (e) of this section, a distributor transport only licensee who is licensed to engage in self-distribution and whose premises will be on the same property as their licensed cultivation or manufacturing premises shall not be required to comply with the security provisions contained in Article 5 of this division.\nThe issue of where cannabis cultivation in California is an agricultural activity which qualifies a trade or business under the Internal Revenue Code is a complex analysis in itself.

82	differences between sabbath holiday washing rules	There is a notable difference between Shabbat and Yom Tov (holiday) bathing rules. On Shabbat, one may only wash in lukewarm water but not in hot water. However, on Yom Tov, bathing in hot water is permitted according to many authorities, particularly when the water is heated by pre-approved methods like solar heaters or timers.	"['If you are anything like me, the worst thing about 3-day yomtov is the shower situation.. The next worst thing is probably the food preparation - heating, reheating, cooking, leaving fires on, using timers, etc...I emailed him wondering why he doesn\'t shower over Yom Tov, something that I\'ve been doing for a few years now. Truth be told, this isn\'t a halachah blog, but I feel compelled to write about this, if only to make your Rosh Hashanah and Shabbat Shuvah bearable - at least if you live in Israel. (Yet another reason to make Aliyah!)\nThere\'s no reason for me to write a synopsis of the issues of showering on Yom Tov, as many have already done me the favor. Rabbi Howard Jachter has a great piece on the topic, in which he concludes:\nShowering and bathing on Yom Tov remains forbidden except for exceptional circumstances.Fair enough. Except that it\'s important to note that the matter is subject to significant debate, and while he is stringent, there are more lenient views - which he himself notes.\nMore importantly, in Israel there\'s a very important factor which significantly mitigates a strict ruling. Much of the debate surrounds the issue of cooking on Yom Tov, and whether one may heat up water and bathe one\'s entire body. In Israel the issue is far less pressing halachically, as we have automatic hot water from the ""dud shemesh"" - the solar panel water heater in every Israeli home. To get a bit technical for a moment, this makes the hot water ""toldat hachamah"" (heated from the heat of the sun), and not ""toldat ha\'or"" (heated from a fire), which is less significant halachically.\nThere\'s another point as well. Stringency in halachah is often laudable, but every chumrah (and yes, I mean every single one) has a price. If your stringent in one area, you\'re also being lenient in another. That price might be worth paying, but it\'s also important to be aware of. In this case, if you\'re stringent about not bathing on Yom Tov, you will, in the words of Rafi Goldmeir, hate it. In our finicky, spoiled modernity, we very, very rarely go two days without showering, much less three. You begin to feel grimy and dirty. Is that Simchat Yom Tov (a Torah commandment)? Is that the way to achieve Oneg Shabbat (also a Torah commandment)? I personally do not feel that it is.\nBut don\'t take my word for it. Take Rav Melamed\'s word for it. He\'s the author of the very popular and widely accepted set of books called Peninei Halachah. (My favorite part of Peninei Halachah is that you don\'t have to buy the books - although we just bought the whole set, because the entire work is available on the Internet. I\'ve heard they\'re now working on an English translation.) Rav Melamed writes:\nמפני חששות שונים המלווים את הרחיצה, רבים נוהגים שלא להתרחץ ביום טוב. אבל בשעת הצורך, מותר להתרחץ במים חמים שהתחממו בערב יום טוב, או במים חמים שהתחממו ביום טוב על ידי דוד שמש או שעון שבת. וזה ההבדל שבין שבת ליום טוב, שבשבת מותר לרחוץ במים פושרים אבל לא חמים, ואילו ביום טוב מותר לרחוץ במים חמים.ויש מחמירים וסוברים שדין יום טוב כדין שבת, ואסור לרחוץ ביום טוב במים חמים אלא רק בפושרים. ויש מחמירים וסוברים שאסור מדברי חכמים לרחוץ בשבת ויום טוב אף במים פושרים. וכך נוהגים חלק מיוצאי אשכנז. אולם למעשה, העיקר כדעת רוב הפוסקים, שמקילים לרחוץ ביום טוב במים חמים. וכאשר הדבר גורם צער, כגון בראש השנה שנמשך יומיים, או ביום טוב שסמוך לשבת, ראוי לנהוג כמקילים, כדי לכבד את החג ולהתענג בו.\nDue to numerous concerns associated with washing, many have the custom not to bathe on Yom Tov. But in a time of need, one is permitted to bathe in hot water that was warmed before Yom Tov, or in hot water that was heated on Yom Tov with a ""dud shemesh"" or a Shabbat timer. This is a difference between Shabbat and Yom Tov: for on Shabbat one may wash in lukewarm water, but not in hot water, but on Yom Tov one may bathe in hot water.If that\'s true for a two-day holiday (remember that Rosh Hashanah is the only two-day holiday of the year here in Israel), it\'s especially true for a three-day Yom Tov.\nSome are strict and hold that the ruling of Yom Tov also applies on Shabbat, and one is forbidden to bathe on Yom Tov in hot water, and [may only do so] in lukewarm water. Some are strict and hold that one is rabinically prohibited from bathing on Shabbat and Yom Tov in either hot or lukewarm water. This is the custom of some Ashkenazim. But in practice, the essential [halachah] follows the opinion of the majority of the poskim who are lenient and allow bathing in hot water on Yom Tov. And, when this issue [of not bathing] causes pain, like on a two day holiday like Rosh Hashanah, or on a Yom Tov adjacent to Shabbat, it is appropriate to follow those who are lenient, in order to honor the holiday and enjoy it.\nIf you live in Israel, enjoy your shower, and have an enjoyable, clean, fresh Yom Tov!']"	['<urn:uuid:66640d13-2041-4fc6-b6e8-90b94bd2b1c9>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	6	55	872
83	How do coral reefs help islands, and what happens when they die?	Healthy coral reefs protect islands from wave action and erosion, while supporting rich marine life. When corals die due to high temperatures, their skeletons are rapidly overgrown by algae and bacteria, becoming eroded and weakened, which compromises this protective function.	"['Adopt a Coral in Maldives\nInstead of a beach-bum, why not come away from a holiday to the Maldives as an eco-volunteer?\nIt\'s only when the seaplane flown by a barefoot pilot ferried us over a luminous blue expanse, that we realised what the Maldives actually means — no mountains, no rivers, just amoebic blue blips of ring-shaped coral atolls called faroes, sitting like ink drops on a blotting paper.\nWe were looking at fifty shades of blue pocked with thatched hut resorts arranged in neat symmetrical rows. This was the lowest, flattest country in the world, with a fitting name; Maldives is derived from \'mala dwips\' which means garland of islands.\nWe were fascinated by the world below the clear lagoons: psychedelic wrasse, baby sharks, lethal jelly and puffer fish and the manta rays. In fact, most hotels have glass panels fitted on the floor, allowing guests to watch a constant underwater spectacle.\nYour Robinson Crusoe days here can be deliciously simple — when you slap on the sunscreen and curl your toes in the white sand. But for those who want to do be different, Maldives offers eco-initiatives that travellers can volunteer with. What\'s a catchphrase elsewhere, is reality here, since the highest point is just 1. 5 metres above sea level and doomsayers predict that most of the country will be under water by 2070.\nYou sense a strong green conscience among locals, and every resort tries to keep its carbon footprint small by using LED lights, solar water heaters, and recycling of waste water. This makes it easy for eco-conscious travellers to turn their itinerary into a volunteerdriven one. Here\'s how:\nAdopt a coral\nHere\'s an unfortunate statistic. More than 90 per cent of shallow coral reef in the Maldives died when El Nino, a climatic phenomenon, raised sea temperatures by 4°C in 1998.\nAt the swish Anantara Dhigu Resort located on Dhigufinolhu Island in the South Male Atoll, we visited a fecund \'coral nursery\' headed by marine biologist Manuel Dominguez. Healthy coral, he said, protect a cross section of marine life, and the islands too, from wave action and erosion. But coral reefs are under threat from increasing sea temperatures that have a bleaching effect on them. Careless divers can break the coral, while overfishing damages algae growth, leaving the reefs unprotected. Dominguez\'s job is to gently tend to pieces of broken coral he collects from the ocean. He maintains a photo-documentation, clicking them every month to monitor their growth before he transplants \'healed\' coral back into the reef. ""You don\'t need to plant kilometers of coral. Even a small patch will make a big difference,"" he said. We watched entranced as he handled bits of finger coral soaking in water and sand, with a hint of reverence. Just like in a garden, these coral are grow before being transplanted into the sea.""\nWe flapped our way through the shallow waters, tackling flippers and snorkel gear, watching shoals of iridescent fish whiz past, to participate in the coral adoption programme with Dominguez.\nThe piece of coral I was carrying was fixed with a handful of cement on to a specially made concrete stand that carried my name. It was fitted into a frame under the ocean. It\'s a traveller\'s way of helping the reef grow. Dominguez said I would monitor my adopted coral\'s growth online, through images uploaded every three months. Most corals grow painstakingly slowly, only two centimetres a year. Do it at: Anantara Dhigu Resort and Spa. It will cost: USD100, 200 and 300 depending on the size of the frame.\nPitch in for a green fund\nAs we walked into the Dusit Thani in Baa Atoll near the Hanifaru Huraa, a UNESCO World Biosphere reserve known as a feeding ground for manta rays, we were greeted by a soft toy of a Spotted Eagle Ray that sat on the beds in our rooms. Each toy carried a note that said: Adopt me. Shy and wary of scuba divers, the threatened species has been adopted by the hotel as its mascot, and is at the centre of its Ray of Hope programme. Donations hotel guests make go towards the Green Fund that supports a series of environmental initiatives and community-based projects on the island. Do it at: Dusit Thani (adopt a Spotted Eagle Ray) It\'ll cost: USD 40\nTeach Islanders a skill\nTo get a feel of local life outside swanky resorts, we visited an island that housed a football field, a modernistic mosque that resembled a space ship, a boat building area and rows of spotless homes framed by breadfruit and almond trees. Each house had a joli — a rope seat in a wooden frame standing in its porch. Old men dressed in sarongs sat listening to the Quran on a public address system, while women of the house cooked up the day\'s lunch. Bright flags of various political parties hung in the streets.\nIf mingling with locals is your idea of a vacation, a volunteering holiday will allow you to spend time playing a sport with island kids, help pre-school teachers at class work, and train islanders to become certified divers, provided you have the expertise. Volunteers can also take part in conservation programmes on Baa Atoll. Musicians, artists and documentary filmmakers are encouraged to share their skills with island locals.\nFor a volunteering holiday: Visit volunteermaldives.com. It\'ll cost: Between USD 1400-1600 for a 4-week programme (including accommodation and meals).\nGetting there: Fly Sri Lankan Airlines to Colombo and connect to Male international airport from there. Every resort arranges a pick-up either by sea plane or speed boat.\nPut up at: The all-new Dusit Thani in Baa Atoll or Anantara Dhigu in the South Male Atoll offer a range of accommodation from beach villas to over-the-water villas.\nGo: Snorkelling, diving, parasailing, sunset fishing and jet skiing.

Ocean heat waves can devastate coral reefs and other ecosystems – and these too are on the increase.\nHeat extremes on the high seas are on the increase, with ocean heat waves disturbing ecosystems in two hemispheres and two great oceans, US scientists report.\nAnd these same sudden rises in sea temperatures don’t just damage coral reefs, they kill the corals and start the process of reef decay, according to a separate study by Australian researchers.\nAndrew Pershing of the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and colleagues report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that they examined data from 65 marine ecosystems over the years 1854 to 2018 to work out how frequently ocean temperatures suddenly rose to unexpected levels.\nThey found such deviations from the average in the Arctic, North Atlantic, eastern Pacific and off the Australian coasts. They expected to find evidence of occasional hot flushes. But they did not expect to find quite so many.\n“Severe marine heatwave events can have a far more severe impact than coral bleaching – the animal dies and its underlying skeleton is all that remains”\n“Across the 65 ecosystems we examined, we expected about six or seven of them would experience these ‘surprises’ each year,” Dr Pershing said. “Instead, we’ve seen an average of 12 ecosystems experiencing these warming events each year over the past seven years, including a high of 23 ‘surprises’ in 2016.”\nIntense and sudden changes in sea temperatures affect crustaceans, algae, corals, molluscs and many millions of humans who depend on the oceans for income. And a new study by researchers from Australian universities reports that even a rise of 0.5°C is reflected in deaths during an outbreak of coral bleaching.\nCorals live in symbiosis with algae: ocean warming periodically disturbs this normally beneficial relationship. The coral animals evert (turn out) the algae and once-lurid reefs will bleach, and become more vulnerable to disease.\nCorals support the world’s richest ocean ecosystems so such changes are a challenge, both to the survival of biodiversity and to local incomes from the tourism linked to the beauty of the reefs.\nVery warm water\n“What we are seeing is that severe marine heatwave events can have a far more severe impact than coral bleaching: the water temperatures are so warm that that the coral animal doesn’t bleach – in terms of a loss of its symbiosis – the animal dies and its underlying skeleton is all that remains,” said Tracy Ainsworth of the University of New South Wales.\nThe researchers report in the journal Current Biology that they used computer tomography scanning techniques to explore the marine destruction. In 2016, more than 30% of the northern part of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef experienced temperatures higher than those in which corals can survive.\n“We find that the skeleton is immediately overgrown by rapid growth of algae and bacteria,” said Bill Leggat of the University of Newcastle, a co-author.\n“We show that this process is devastating not just for the animal tissue but also for the skeleton that is left behind, which is rapidly eroded and weakened.” − Climate News Network\nAbout the Author\nTim Radford is a freelance journalist.

The modern-city model that took hold globally in the twentieth century has outlived its usefulness. It cannot solve the problems it helped to create—especially global warming. Fortunately, a new model for urban development is emerging in cities to aggressively tackle the realities of climate change. It transforms the way cities design and use physical space, generate economic wealth, consume and dispose of resources, exploit and sustain the natural ecosystems, and prepare for the future.

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us. In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes. She shows that the sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy, compelling us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human.

84	How do buildings reflect social changes and community relationships?	Buildings and architectural spaces significantly reflect evolving social dynamics and community relationships. In historical settings like Cambridge, college buildings housed complex service relationships between individuals, institutions, and society, with specific roles for bedders, porters, and other college servants. Meanwhile, in modern cities like Istanbul, building developments have led to gentrification, pushing lower classes to city margins and creating economic barriers. The replacement of old structures with modern ones has resulted in the disappearance of neighborhood culture and community belonging, fundamentally altering the social fabric and relationships within the city.	['Whilst giving talks on the history of Heffers of Cambridge, I’m reminded that many have memories of the firm. I enjoy sharing stories from the book and hearing anecdotes from members of the audience who were customers, authors, or employees.\nEarlier this year, I received a communication from Sandor P. Vaci RIBA, who worked for the architects Austin Smith: Lord, at the time they were transforming Heffers’ Trinity Street premises into the radical new ‘University and General’ bookshop, opened by Lord Butler in 1970.\nSandor is kindly sharing his memories and images from the project, and I’m looking forward to meeting him later this year to hear more. A Hungarian born British architect who has lived in London since the 1956 Revolution, Sandor has many interests including cultural connections and sharing the public space.\nHe has put together a gallery of Budapest ‘portas’ (doors and doorways), from the city’s historic centre. As he says, the individually designed portas show astonishing variety, exuberance, originality and craftsmanship rarely found in other cities. It’s a lovely collection.\nIt’s interesting to note Sandor’s observation that the doorways into residential blocks were single entries: all the residents, servants, tradesmen, deliveries and rubbish removals passed through (no back door or tradesman’s entrance for them).\nAs I start to work on my next social history project, on college service in the twentieth century, I’m prompted to wonder if the college servants used the same entrances as everyone else.\nMy aim is to explore the notion of ‘service’, in the context of college, university and town communities in Cambridge. As Alex Saunders from the Cambridge Antiquarian Society said to me recently, it’s a huge topic. My husband, Trevor, says it sounds like another doctoral research proposal (my first – and only PhD, was on the topic of community inside higher education).\nWhen opening the door to a new project, I like to begin by contemplating the broader questions and possibilities. For this topic, some of the questions are informed by my own direct experience of working in higher education and of researching the field. Here are a few:\nWhat do we mean by ‘service’, by ‘being in’ service and by ‘being of’ service?\nThe condition of being a servant; the fact of serving a master?\nThe condition, station, or occupation of being a servant?\nA particular employ; the serving of a certain master or household?\nPerformance of the duties of a servant; attendance of servants; work done in obedience to and for the benefit of a master?\nTo do, bear (one) service, to serve, attend on (a master)?\nAn act of serving; a duty or piece of work done for a master or superior?\nAn act of helping or benefiting; an instance of beneficial or friendly action; a useful office?\nWaiting at table, supply of food; hence, supply of commodities, etc?\nProvision (of labour, material appliances, etc.) for the carrying out of some work for which there is a constant public demand?\n(with thanks to the OED)\nWhat roles in this context would be classified as ‘college servants’?\nBedder; porter; gyp; butler; waiter; clerk; librarian?\nWho is ‘serving’ whom?\nIndividuals serving individuals?\nIndividuals serving institutions?\nInstitutions serving society?\nSociety serving institutions?\nInstitutions serving individuals?\nIndividuals serving individuals?\nWhat is the impact of the changing undergraduate population during the twentieth century?\nThe demographic and size of the population changed dramatically between 1900 and 2000.\nWhat is the impact of changes in the role of colleges and universities in society during the twentieth century?\nA complex and weathered terrain, the sector saw sweeping changes during this period.\nA family in service\nLike many who were raised in Cambridge, members of my family were ‘in college service’.\nMy Nanna, Ethel Lily Driver (1914-2006), lived in Christchurch Street and was a ‘bedder’ at Jesus College. Her mother, Lily Ethel Parsons (1895-1952) who lived in Ross Street, is listed on the 1939 Register as a ‘college help’.\nMy great-grandmother, Henrietta Saunders (1877-1971) who lived in the old dairy in Gold Street, was a ‘bedder’ at Queens College. Her husband, George Saunders (1873-1965) was a ‘general labourer’ who, as the story goes, once stood back to admire his own work on the roof of the Senate House.\nThankfully, he survived the fall.', 'The Destruction of A City\nA look into the urban redevelopment of Istanbul\n“Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.”\n– Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities\nAll cities are in a constant state of change. They adapt, expand and develop in an answer to their inhabitants’ ever-changing demands. Today’s cities have more responsibilities in an ever-changing environment, so there is a real need to create inviting, innovative and expressive spaces for its inhabitants. And the cities that cannot adopt this evolution are doomed to disappear.\nThese evolutions in a city are much more pronounced in developing countries, where the changes are fast-tracked and more drastic. However, such developments can pose a major threat if left uncontrolled: the destruction of a city’s identity.\nAs a city that has embraced many different cultures at its heart, Istanbul has undergone many major changes during its vast and complex history.\nThese issues are at the heart of the book Bir Şehri Yok Etmek: İstanbul’da Kazanmak ya da Kaybetmek (Destroying a City: Winning or Losing in Istanbul). Uşaklıgil lays bare a depressing picture for the painful urban developments taking place in all of Turkey, and especially Istanbul: the destruction of the city one plot at a time for personal and political gains, the marginalization of the inhabitants throughout the process, the oppressive priority of material gains, and possibly the saddest of all, the irreconcilable communication gap between the citizens and the decision-makers.\nDespite all this, Uşaklıgil also proposes difficult, but attainable solutions to these problems. The public must use its voting power to fight for more just and transparent processes in order to prevent the city losing its identity, soul and history altogether.\nSince the publication of the book in 2013, let alone approaching these solutions, Istanbul has been rendered more and more into an unidentifiable profit source. The recent 3 years I have personally spent in Istanbul unfortunately support this outcome.\nAnd in the current political climate, it seems unlikely that the citizens will be able to take back their city.\n“A city made up of people, neighborhoods, streets, markets, buildings that are the city’s historical witnesses, streams, forests, memories and stories show how it has become a profit source.”\nTHE DESTRUCTION OF A CITY\nThe main cause that should be addressed in this issue is the Istanbul-centered development. For decades, Istanbul has been the focus of economic and social growth in Turkey, attracting millions of rural citizens to its urbanized heart. There are few alternatives to the metropolis, perhaps other than Ankara, in terms of economic, cultural and social opportunities in the country.\nAs a result, the city is home to more than 15 million people at the present day. However, the city has been struggling to keep up with its exponentially growing population. The city’s urban plan has not been able to anticipate and to spearhead the urban migration efficiently. The infrastructural and the sociocultural balances in Istanbul have been neglected during the rapid growth, and hence resulted in irregular and sometimes unregulated urban sprawl. Instead of managing the migrations with an official system, setting up and enforcing settlement regulations and creating new parcels, the newcomers were free to construct as they seemed fit. The result was a cluster of unauthorized and unmonitored settlements throughout the city.\nAs the limits of the city expanded over the years due to the growing population, these areas were either left as blind spots in urban plans, absorbed by the expanding neighborhoods, or razed down to make room for newer structures, much to the chagrin to its inhabitants. Over time, unable to control or monitor the irregular urban sprawl, the government has allowed a pardon for the existing illegal settlements, legitimizing the structures and inadvertently encouraging further spread of unauthorized slums.\nInevitably, the city’s image as a whole could not be consolidated or merged into a solid identity through this patchwork of structures.\nThe city’s current identity can be best described by the locals as “chaos.”\nAnother major issue threatening to erase the city’s identity is the motivation to earn profits through the land, where the construction sector was presented as a trump card in order to promote economic growth. Uşaklıgil suggests that the legal system has been used as a tool to redevelop and reshape the city to the wishes of those in power for fast economic or political gain.\n“Istanbul has been turned into a meta to be easily marketed through the legislation, with the use of this law and that. More importantly, the laws passed to redevelop Istanbul have also turned the zoning and urban laws into a marketing tool.”\n– Emine Uşaklıgil, Bir Şehri Yok Etmek\nFor example, the natural disaster prevention and control laws have been designed to benefit the construction industry, opening the doors to the possibilities of extensive urban redevelopment. The aim is to demolish the potentially risky buildings as soon as possible, and construct a newer, more profitable structure in its place. However, the designation of a risky building is decided through a series of unclear processes and unreliable criteria, which is a harmful approach to the conversation between the inhabitants and the lawmakers.\nThe damages inflicted on the city’s plan and identity for the short-term and limited profits on a personal level are hard to ignore. A city’s development and expansion is a delicate and important subject, which must be approached through the consideration of social, cultural and economic factors. However, Istanbul is currently treated as a real-estate development opportunity.\nWHAT THE CITY HAS LOST\nThe most visible consequence of these problems is the destruction of the city’s unique texture. Istanbul, unlike fast developing and construction-driven cities like Dubai, has an intricate and complex history that cannot support drastic architectural and urban changes without sacrificing its identity. The diversity of Turkey and its culture has not reflected into the plans. On the contrary, the planners have been imposing generic, uniform structures that almost decidedly ignore the regional nuances and the cultural fabric. And when this diversity is reflected into the design, it seems to be done in the least thoughtful way: the latest trend in Turkish architecture is to combine architectural elements from different historical influences; brought together to create a mismatched patchwork of all the cultures that once inhabited the land, free of context.\nFrom the public’s point of view, one of the biggest losses from the urban fabric can be the disappearance of the neighborhood culture. Along with this, the feeling of belonging to a community and to the city has also suffered damages. For a city that loses its neighborhoods, loses an authentic and natural part of itself.\nAll of this redevelopment also has a social impact. When the fantasy of replacing the old with the new and modern is sold, the targeted audience is the middle and upper class. The lower class, who already struggle with the integration into the city, are sacrificed to the urban redevelopment and forcefully pushed to the margins of the city. The “reclaimed” land from the slums are reintroduced into the city as central living spaces encouraging spending more money by the middle class throughout their isolated lives. The gentrification creates yet another barrier for the inhabitants of the city in economic, regional and social contexts.\nThe Trump Towers in Şişli, Istanbul. Gentrification in Istanbul generally comes in the shape of tall residence towers and shopping malls.\nAs a result, the city dwellers’ lives are choreographed around a culture of consumerism, with very few public and green spaces. Either the inhabitants do not have a park to breathe in, or it is too far to be accessible. The infrastructure is not enough to support the demands of such a dense population, therefore creating a difficult and stressful commute. In general, the quality of life in Istanbul is greatly crippled by the misguided approaches to urban redevelopment and the wrong priorities during this process.\nHOW TO SAVE A CITY\nAll of these present a depressing image as to the future of Istanbul. The destruction of the city for personal and political gains, where the public cannot contribute to the conversation or the decision making process, reflects the deep communication problem in the system.\nThe solution is a tough, but achievable one: bridging this significant gap between the public and the decision-makers. The inhabitants of Istanbul have to fight for their city through the power of their vote and force the lawmakers to carefully deliberate the densification of construction regulations by even a small amount. The coefficient of the construction should be proportionate: if one unit is taken up by concrete and metal, one unit should be given back to the public in the form of parks, public spaces, institutions or widened pavements.\nThe public should be involved in the process, through committees and transparent procedures. They should be allowed to have a voice through civilian participation in administrative settings and to inspect the proceedings. The urban regeneration and redevelopment of Medellin, Colombia, is a great example to this urban cooperation. A city torn apart by violence and poverty have been revitalized through efforts of urban planners, architects, politicians, academicians, artists, activists, neighborhood representatives, social service specialists and the public, into an accessible, beautiful city.\nNortheastern Urban Integration Project in Medellín, Colombia. – image © Harvard GSD\nThe issue is about achieving an agreement over the creation of a political system, where a fair, environmentally and historically sensitive city can be realized. The potential risks and threats to the city’s future should be carefully analyzed and prioritized during the redevelopment process, rather than a race for the maximum profitability.\nThe fact that the city has become a stage for a profit battle and the opportunistic approaches to the city’s history is a cultural problem.\n– Prof. İlhan Tekeli, Bir Şehri Yok Etmek\nThe zoning and architectural regulations in place should also be consistently and thoroughly imposed. Other historically significant European cities, such as Paris, can be used as an example, where strict regulations have helped to preserve the city’s unique identity, while still allowing new developments. In addition, any form of irregular and unauthorized construction should be prevented and penalized at all costs to avoid further damage to the city’s urban fabric.\nRECLAIMING THE CITY\nIstanbul is no longer the beautiful fairytale city told in the history books. It is gradually becoming a concrete city wiped of its unique character and complex history. In a city that has habituated itself to the drastic and irregular changes to its unique fabric, the public must take a firm stand against the further damage to its roots, and its identity. For the destruction of a city’s identity is the destruction of the city itself.\nBir Şehri Yok Etmek: İstanbul’da Kazanmak ya da Kaybetmek by Emine Uşaklıgil\nFor further information about the topic:\nFor further information about the evolution of Turkish architecture:\nFor further information about the Medellin regeneration project mentioned above:']	['<urn:uuid:9d00dddd-c699-4cdc-9eab-96fb40ecb418>', '<urn:uuid:f1a4cf5f-5fac-49ca-a5fe-6bbe250d6746>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	9	89	2548
85	I'm looking into medical technologies - what is yeast biopanning used for, and how has monoclonal antibody therapy evolved over the years?	Yeast biopanning is a method where yeast-displayed single chain variable fragments are selected through successive rounds of incubation on mammalian cell monolayers, allowing for isolation of antibodies that bind to plasma membrane proteins. Regarding monoclonal antibody evolution, it has developed through four generations: first-generation mouse monoclonal antibodies (momab), second-generation human-mouse chimeric antibodies (ximab), third-generation humanized antibodies (zumab), and fourth-generation fully human antibodies (mumab). The later generations, particularly humanized and fully human antibodies, have improved characteristics including higher affinity, better specificity, and reduced side effects compared to mouse antibodies.	['Membrane proteins (MPs) tend to be appealing targets for antibody executive. technology straight with entire cells or detergent-solubilized whole-cell lysates antibody libraries could be screened against MP antigens within their near-native conformations. We also describe the way the system can be modified for using MP-containing cell lysates for antibody characterization and antigen recognition. This assortment BSF 208075 of suitable strategies acts as a basis for antibody executive against MPs which is predicted these strategies will adult in parallel with advancements in membrane proteins biochemistry and solubilization technology. . Entire cells and detergent-soluble cell lysates certainly are a immediate powerful solution to the problem so long as they could be integrated into well-known antibody finding platforms. Indeed mainly because antibody executive technology offers matured many good examples have surfaced with entire cells playing the part of antigen. XenoMouse technology and phage screen two trusted systems for antibody finding incorporate entire cells as a way of producing antibodies against membrane proteins. The study and development resulting in panitumimab (Vectibix) [16 17 has an instructional overview of the XenoMouse system where the built animals had been immunized by immediate shot of antigen-expressing cells. Extra flexibility was allowed through the introduction of HEK293 manifestation vectors with the capacity of accepting a number of membrane protein . Phage display as an system is certainly versatile to the usage of entire cells highly. Studies have been successful in determining reactive peptides and antibodies to numerous cells and cells including: mind and kidney  lung  heart  and breast tissue . Recent years have also BSF 208075 seen the 1st phage selection performed in humans . These results briefly focus on the use of whole cells in the prevailing antibody finding platforms. The technology utilized for antibody finding and production however BSF 208075 offers progressed dramatically leading to alternate cell-surface display systems . One of these yeast surface screen (YSD) has obtained in reputation among academic research workers and has Rabbit polyclonal to RABAC1. been commercialized . Right here we describe effective YSD strategies using entire cells (fungus biopanning) or detergent-solubilized cell lysates as resources of MP for antibody anatomist. Yeast-display is one of the many cell-surface screen systems for proteins anatomist so that as will end up being described within this review possesses advantages of antibody anatomist against membrane protein [24 26 Very much like phage screen yeast are constructed expressing peptides or antibody fragments on the surface area while harboring the hereditary information with a plasmid in the cell (Amount 1A). Getting eukaryotes yeast likewise have an endoplasmic reticulum built BSF 208075 with particular enzymes and chaperones that result in high fidelity folding and appearance of mammalian antibody fragments. Enhanced proteins folding when combined with capability to generate large (~1010 clones) libraries  (Amount 1A-ii) network marketing leads to a robust system for the id of book antibodies . Significantly yeast screen also allows the usage of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Amount 1C-iv) which affords an extraordinary mix of quantitative verification and throughput. Contemporary FACS equipment support rates more than 25 0 occasions per second enabling even huge libraries to become screened quickly and specifically. In the normal embodiment nevertheless YSD requires the usage of a soluble antigen (Amount 1C-ii). Two strategies have already been created to overcome this restriction recently. First our laboratory demonstrated a fungus “biopanning” technique where yeast shown single chain adjustable fragments (scFv) had been chosen by successive rounds of incubation on mammalian cell monolayers  (Amount 1A B). Fungus biopanning was afterwards utilized to isolate several exclusive scFv that bind plasma membrane (PM) protein of the rat human brain endothelial cell series (RBE4) and occasionally internalized in to the RBE4 cells . Another YSD-based technique using entire cell contacting strategies integrated lymphoid-derived cells to display a collection of T-cell receptors against indigenous peptide-MHC ligands . Enrichment of high affinity pMHC binders was aided by parting of yeast-lymphoid cell complexes by denseness gradient centrifugation. Although incorporation of entire cells overcame.', 'The Antibodies are secreted by plasma cells transformed from B cells, and each B cell line can produce only one specific antigenic determinant. The antibody, produced from a single cell line, is called the monoclonal antibody (McAb). The first generation of monoclonal antibodies came from hybridoma antibody technology developed by Koehler and Milstein in 1975. On the basis of cell fusion technology, mouse B cells capable of secreting specific antibodies and mouse myeloma cells with unlimited reproductive ability were fused into B cell hybridoma. A specific antibody against an antigenic epitope can be prepared by culturing a group of cells with a single hybridoma cell with this property, as shown in figure 1. However, the human immune system can recognize mouse monoclonal antibodies, which can cause human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response. This not only shortens the half-life and weakens the efficacy of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, but also sometimes causes serious adverse reactions, so the clinical application of the first generation of monoclonal antibodies is greatly limited.\nFigure 1. Illustration showing the production route of hybridoma technology.\nSince the advent of the first mouse monoclonal antibody Muromonab OKT3 in the world in 1986, nearly 80 monoclonal antibodies have been on the market in the world. So far, the monoclonal antibody has developed to the fourth generation: the first generation is mouse monoclonal antibody (momab), the second generation is human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (ximab), the third generation is humanized monoclonal antibody (zumab), the fourth generation is fully human monoclonal antibody (mumab). The advantage of humanized monoclonal antibody and human monoclonal antibody is that it can overcome the reaction of human anti-mouse antibody, prevent the monoclonal antibody molecule from being quickly eliminated by the immune system as heterogenous protein, and improve the biological activity of monoclonal antibody molecule. In particular, the variable and constant regions of human antibodies are human, which can further remove immunogenicity and side effects on the basis of humanized antibodies. Humanized antibodies and human antibodies have the characteristics of high affinity, high specificity and low toxicity and side effects, which greatly overcome the shortcomings of mouse antibodies and chimeric monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, it has become the inevitable trend of the development of therapeutic antibody drugs.\nMonoclonal antibodies usually target disease-related antigens or specific receptors on the cell surface, such as the PD-1 receptor on the surface of tumor cells and the PD-L1 ligand on the surface of T cells. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, which are in the limelight, belong to monoclonal antibodies and are the focus of tumor immunotherapy in recent years. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab, which are on the market, are PD-1 inhibitors and are mainly used in the treatment of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. PD-L1 inhibitors atezolizumab (trade name Tecentriq), durvalumab (trade name Imfinzi) and avelumab (trade name Bavencio) have been approved for the treatment of urethral epithelial cancer. On September 28, 2018, FDA approved the listing of Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc) jointly developed by Sanofi (Sanofi) and Regenerative. It is used to treat metastatic skin squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) or locally advanced CSCC patients who cannot receive healing surgery or radiotherapy. This is also the third anti-PD-1 antibody approved by FDA.\nFigure 2. Mechanism of PD-1 receptor and PD-L1/L2 inhibitors mediated cancer immunotherapy.\nUp to now, monoclonal antibody drugs have become an important part of biomedicine and have broad application prospects in medical treatment. It has been successfully used in the treatment of tumors, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, transplantation rejection and other diseases. However, there are many bottlenecks in the preparation of monoclonal antibodies. At present, the bottleneck of antibody drug research and development lies in the screening of target molecules, humanization of antibodies and preparation of human antibodies, high-throughput and large-scale screening of antibodies, prediction, modeling and analysis of antigenic epitopes, construction of three-dimensional configuration of antigen-antibody interaction and various techniques to increase the function of antibody effect.\n1.Target Screening of Antibody Drug\nTraditional antibody drugs are developed at the level of a single gene, a single protein, and a single antibody. First of all, it will take many years to study the function of the gene and its coding protein to confirm whether the gene and its encoded protein can be used as antibody drug targets to develop antibody drugs. The main drawback of this method is that the number of antibody drug targets obtained is extremely limited, and these targets were discovered more than a decade ago and it takes a long time, usually 10 to 20 years. With the continuous progress of genomics, transcriptome, proteomics and sequencing technology, more and more new genes and proteins have been found, which is expected to select suitable antibody drug targets.\nWhat are the criteria for screening antibody drug targets? In the case of antineoplastic drug targets, first of all, there should be differences in target expression, such as differences between normal and tumor tissues, or loss of expression in key host organs, or persistent expression in the progress of the disease. Second, the target should play a role, when the use of antibodies for treatment, the antigen cannot be easily degraded by enzymes. The production of high affinity antibodies from known therapeutic targets is not a major obstacle, but the main challenge is to screen target molecules.\nNow, scientists have used humanized antibody technology and fully human antibody technology, hoping to find some better antibody targets through the human immune system, so as to develop better antibody drugs. The fully human antibody technology is optimized by human-mouse hybridoma technology, human-human hybridoma technology, B cell immortalization and high-efficiency and high-throughput fully human antibody library technology. The selection, maturation and production of antibodies are all formed in the human body, so they are all human antibodies in the strict sense. Antibody targeting, antibody production and post-transcriptional modification are all completed by the human immune system after a series of screening. The antibodies produced by this technique have the best natural affinity and binding power, and act more effectively on the human body. High-efficiency and high-throughput fully human antibody library technology will be able to secrete antibodies of the target cell isolation, purification, enrichment and proliferation. The specificity of the antibody secreted by B cell subclone can be screened and identified by ELISPOT, ELISA or hemolytic plaque test. The gene sequence of the target antibody was obtained from the monoclonal cultured cell line, and the prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression vector was constructed and transferred into engineering bacteria or cells to reconstruct the activity of the antibody.\n2.Immunogenicity Analysis of Monoclonal Antibody Drugs\nAt present, the common adverse reactions of monoclonal antibodies are mainly caused by their immunogenicity. The anti-drug antibodies caused by immunogenicity have a great influence on the safety and efficacy of the drug. Immunogenicity is one of the decisive factors in the development of biotech drugs, so their immunogenicity should be taken into account when evaluating drug safety. To this end, scientists have taken measures to improve the immunogenicity of monoclonal antibody drugs, such as humanization of antibodies, improvement of solubility, protein modification (such as protein polyethylene glycol modification) and improvement of effector molecule function.\nFigure 3. Polyethylene glycol modification of antibodies.\nThe current methods for evaluating and analyzing the immunogenicity of monoclonal antibodies include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa), liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), surface plasma resonance (SPR), electrochemiluminescence (ECL) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). However, these methods have not yet reached a unified conclusion on the critical value of immunogenicity, and the critical value of immunogenicity is different due to different distribution laws and calculation companies, which makes it impossible to unify the acceptance criteria among different drugs. However, with the continuous progress of molecular biology technology, the humanized components of monoclonal antibodies have been improved, and even the whole human antibodies have been reached. Improving the binding and effector molecular function of these antibodies, combined with protein modification, is expected to avoid the immunogenicity of monoclonal antibodies. At the same time, improving the immunogenicity detection method, unifying and standardizing it will make the clinical trial have clear guiding principles, and finally accelerate the clinical application of monoclonal antibody drugs.\n3.High-throughput Animal Cell Expression Technique\nIn terms of protein expression system, in recent years, scientists have developed and optimized the expression system of many antibody molecules, such as bacteria, yeast, insect cells, mammal cells, plant cell expression systems and in vitro expression systems. Among them, mammalian cell expression system has many important advantages, such as high activity and good stability, and has become the most important expression system in the manufacture of antibody biotechnology products.\nFrom the point of view of the scale, speed and function of antibody preparation, the development of high-throughput antibody preparation technology is very important. Large-scale and efficient culture of mammal cells is the main mode of production and key bottleneck technology of biomedical products. At present, there are flow culture technology and perfusion culture technology in the world.\n4.Construction & Optimization of Humanized and Fully Human Antibodies.\nWith the development of immunology and molecular biology, DNA recombination technology is more and more used in antibody construction and optimization. The techniques for the construction and optimization of humanized antibodies include resurfacing antibody and reshaped antibody. Resurfacing antibody refers to the humanization of amino acid residues on the surface of heterogenous antibodies. The principle of this method is to replace only the regions which are obviously different from the surface of human antibody, and to replace amino acids similar to the surface residues of human antibody on the basis of maintaining antibody activity and reducing heterogenicity. In addition, there should not be too many segments to be replaced, and the residues that could affect the size of the side chain, charge, hydrophobicity, or may form hydrogen bonds, which influence the conformation of the complementary determining region (CDR) of antibody, should not be replaced as far as possible. The reshaped antibody refers to the antibody constructed by the splicing of the antigen-binding residues of the heterogenous antibody with the human antibody, including complementary determining region transplantation, partial complement determining region transplantation and specific determining region transplantation.\nFigure 4. Chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies.\nBoth light and heavy chains of humanized antibodies come from human beings and are the development region of therapeutic antibodies. At present, there are antibody library screening techniques for the construction and optimization of humanized antibodies, such as chain replacement and genetic engineering mice to prepare humanized antibodies. The more mature antibody library screening techniques include phage antibody library, synthetic antibody library and ribosome display technology.\nAntibodomics technology is based on genomics and proteomics, combined with hybridoma technology and genetic engineering antibody technology, after high-throughput screening of antibody targets, the establishment of large-scale antibody library, and finally applied. Compared with the traditional monoclonal antibody technology, the antibody library technology has the advantages of large library capacity, more species screening, easier to obtain highly active monoclonal antibodies against specific antigen epitopes and so on. At the same time, the antibody library technology is more timesaving, labor-saving, efficient and economical in the screening process.\nMice are still the easiest animal species for immunization and subsequent genetic engineering, but the mouse antibody V region gene is still obtained through the mouse antibody library. In order to make it safe for clinical use, follow-up humanized transformation must be carried out. The transgenic mouse technology of fully human antibody developed in the past two years enables us to prepare a human immune antibody library through transgenic mice with a complete set of human antibody genes, from which we can directly screen the V region gene of the fully human antibody with therapeutic value. There is no need for humanized transformation.\n5.Development of New Antibody Drugs\nTraditional antibody drugs inhibit tumor growth by blocking a single signal pathway, and the drug resistance of antibody drugs is easy to appear in clinic. Therefore, bispecific antibody (BsAb) came into being. By means of genetic engineering, two antibody fragments targeting different antigens are combined together, which has two antigen binding sites, which can play a synergistic role and improve the therapeutic effect. This structural design can effectively improve the pharmacokinetic process of antibody drugs in vivo and enhance the clinical therapeutic effect. However, the design of BsAb with good curative effect, high stability and conducive to production still needs to be further studied.\nThe antibody drugs on the market in recent years reflect the new trend of the development of the next generation of antibody drugs. The first direction is to make antibody drugs have a smaller molecular weight, so that they have better pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, and are easier to manufacture on a large scale, such as Fab fragment, Fab’ fragment, F(ab’)2 fragment, Single-chain variable fragment (scFv), single domain antibody (sdAb), diabody, triabody and minibody. The second direction is to connect at least two molecules with certain biological functions to form fusion proteins based on known drug molecules, such as bispecific antibody, trifunctional antibody, synthetic antibody (synbody), antibody-drug conjugate (ADC).\nAntibody-drug couplers are composed of monoclonal antibodies and small molecular drugs with therapeutic effect. These drugs realize the targeted delivery of chemical drugs to tumor tissue with the help of antibodies. The antibody-drug conjugate has high stability in the blood, and the drug molecules will not fall off, so the toxic and side effects are small, but the inhibitory effect on tumor cells is much higher than that of naked antibodies. This design strategy can not only improve the killing ability of antibody drugs, but also improve the treatment window of small molecular chemicals.\nFigure 5. Antibody-drug conjugate.\nMonoclonal antibody drugs provide a new way for the treatment of a variety of diseases. At present, monoclonal antibody drugs have been widely used in the clinical treatment of tumors and other diseases. From the perspective of anti-tumor monoclonal antibody drug development process, it is mainly divided into five parts: target discovery, target selection, antigen preparation, selection of monoclonal antibody preparation technology and antibody function identification. Through the technical characteristics of these links, we can find the risk factors that affect the R&D results, find the risk factors, and use the thinking and methods of risk management to analyze. Different technologies used in the preparation of monoclonal antibodies will encounter different challenges. For this reason, it is necessary for developers to carry out specific analysis of specific problems and constantly overcome these technical challenges in order to develop truly useful monoclonal antibodies and bring new life-saving drugs to patients.']	['<urn:uuid:e2ae95fc-c4d1-4249-922b-571ac00fe47f>', '<urn:uuid:a82fb98f-1152-40f8-b244-572b7d2a13c0>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	22	88	3049
86	hemoglobin c variant origin countries	Hemoglobin C variant has genetic origins in Africa, southern Europe, and Thailand. It is most common in regions such as Burkina Faso, Mali, Ghana, Togo, and Benin, though carriers can be found worldwide due to demographic mobility.	"['INTRODUCTION — This monograph summarizes the interpretation and possible interventions based on a genetic test result that reveals the hemoglobin C (Hb C) variant in the hemoglobin beta locus (HBB), which encodes the beta globin chain of hemoglobin.\nHb C is a structural variant; homozygosity causes chronic hemolytic anemia with small, dense red blood cells. Hb C is the third most common hemoglobin variant in the world with genetic origins in Africa, southern Europe, and Thailand. It is most common in regions such as Burkina Faso, Mali, Ghana, Togo, and Benin. However, all parts of the world have individuals who are carriers of Hb C due to demographic mobility. (See ""Hemoglobin variants including Hb C, Hb D, and Hb E"", section on \'Scope\'.)\nIn order to optimally use genetic testing results, one should be familiar with the indications for the testing and the information sought by the health care provider and/or patient family. Genetic testing for hemoglobinopathies is commonly used in at least three categories :\n●Patients suspected of having a hemoglobin disorder who have an unclear diagnosis after clinical laboratory evaluation or a presentation with atypical or discordant clinical and laboratory features.\n●Reproductive counseling, with preconception or prenatal evaluation of females at risk of being carriers. If positive, paternal testing is performed to determine the risk of fetal disease.\n●Newborn screening programs that identify unknown hemoglobin variants that may be clinically significant, rare, or novel. Optimal use of this information requires a review of the clinical and laboratory information, an understanding of the genes that were tested, and the review of the pathologic significance of the findings.\nHow to read the report\n●Accuracy – Confirm that the correct person was tested and that the test was performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory (or other nationally certified laboratory), as summarized in the table (table 1).\n●Genotype – Confirm presence of the Hb C variant, whether it is heterozygous or homozygous, and whether any other variants affecting hemoglobin are present.\nDetermine whether a complete blood count (CBC) has been done and obtain one if not available. Determine whether protein-based hemoglobinopathy testing has been performed (hemoglobin electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]). In many cases it will be helpful to have this information for confirmation, especially if the person has anemia. Hemoglobin analysis may be omitted in some cases such as a suspected Hb C carrier with a normal CBC (no anemia) and normal red blood cell (RBC) indices.\nHb C variant — The Hb C variant is a point mutation in the HBB gene that changes glutamic acid to lysine at amino acid 7 of the beta globin chain (p.Glu7Lys; c.19G>A). The point mutation affects the same amino acid codon as the sickle cell variant (figure 1). However, the consequences for the hemoglobin molecule and RBCs are very different. (See ""Hemoglobin variants including Hb C, Hb D, and Hb E"", section on \'Hb C\'.)\nHb C disease is autosomal recessive; heterozygotes are unaffected and do not need special treatment (see \'Hb C trait\' below). Homozygosity for Hb C (Hb C disease) or compound heterozygosity for Hb C and another variant such as beta thalassemia or the sickle cell variant produces a hemoglobinopathy. (See \'Hb C disease\' below and \'Other combinations with Hb C\' below.)\nThe patterns on protein-based hemoglobin analysis vary in early childhood as adult hemoglobin (Hb A) production is established and fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) production declines (table 2).\nHb C disease is a chronic hemolytic anemia without vaso-occlusive complications. If an individual with a diagnosis of Hb C disease has symptoms of vaso-occlusion (dactylitis as a child, vaso-occlusive pain, acute chest syndrome, stroke), their diagnosis should be questioned and they should be evaluated for the sickle cell variant. Hb C Harlem is a rare variant that consists of the sickle cell mutation plus another mutation that causes hemoglobin to have the same mobility as Hb C on gel electrophoresis. (See ""Overview of compound sickle cell syndromes"", section on \'HbSC disease\' and ""Hemoglobin variants including Hb C, Hb D, and Hb E"", section on \'Hb C-Harlem\'.)\nHb C DISEASE — Hb C disease refers to homozygosity for the Hb C variant. Individuals with Hb C disease can present in infancy (after six months), older childhood, or adulthood. They have mild hemolytic anemia and often splenomegaly. More severe disease can occur when Hb C is combined with a beta thalassemia variant. (See ""Pathophysiology of thalassemia"", section on \'Beta thalassemia\'.)\nLaboratory findings include anemia and Hb C crystals inside red blood cells (RBCs) (picture 1); target cells may also be seen. Markers of nonimmune hemolysis may be present, as summarized in the table (table 3).\nThe following interventions are appropriate in individuals with Hb C disease (algorithm 1):\n●Annual clinical monitoring, with attention paid to symptoms of gallstones and examination of spleen size. (See ""Splenomegaly and other splenic disorders in adults"", section on \'How to examine the spleen\'.)\n●Use of a method other than HbA1C testing to assess for diabetes and/or monitor glycemic control (chronic hemolysis falsely lowers HbA1C). (See ""Screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus"", section on \'Fasting plasma glucose\' and ""Measurements of chronic glycemia in diabetes mellitus"", section on \'Other biomarkers\'.)\n●Supplemental folic acid (typical dose, 1 mg daily; can be omitted if adequate dietary folate is ensured).\n●Notification of first-degree relatives so that they can be evaluated if appropriate. (See \'First-degree relatives\' below.)\n●For individuals who are planning childbearing, reproductive counseling and partner testing to determine the risk of a child having a hemoglobinopathy. (See \'Reproductive counseling\' below.)\nOTHER COMBINATIONS WITH Hb C — Hb C in combination with other hemoglobinopathy variants can cause clinically significant disease. The details of evaluation and management depend on the nature of the other hemoglobin variant(s). Two common examples are Hb SC disease and Hb C-beta thalassemia (algorithm 1).\n●Hb SC disease – Hb C in combination with the sickle cell variant causes Hb SC disease, a form of sickle cell disease (SCD) that is typically milder than Hb SS disease but can cause any of the SCD complications and may require various SCD interventions. (See ""Overview of compound sickle cell syndromes"", section on \'HbSC disease\'.)\n●Hb C-beta thalassemia – Hb C in combination with a beta+ thalassemia variant causes Hb C-beta+ thalassemia, a form of Hb C disease that is typically milder than Hb C disease but can cause chronic hemolytic anemia. Less common is Hb C-beta0 thalassemia, a more severe chronic hemolytic anemia.\nHb C TRAIT — Hb C trait refers to heterozygosity for the Hb C variant. (See \'Hb C variant\' above.)\nThis is a benign carrier condition that does not require any interventions (algorithm 1). However, notification of first-degree relatives and preconception counseling and partner testing are appropriate. (See \'First-degree relatives\' below and \'Reproductive counseling\' below.)\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR FIRST-DEGREE RELATIVES\nReproductive counseling — Individuals with Hb C, including Hb C trait, Hb C disease, or a compound hemoglobinopathy with Hb C, should receive reproductive counseling, ideally before conception. Partner testing should be offered to determine the risk of Hb C disease or other hemoglobinopathy in the child. (See ""Hemoglobinopathy: Screening and counseling in the reproductive setting and fetal diagnosis"".)\nThe likelihood of having an affected child, an unaffected carrier child, or a child with no hemoglobinopathy variants depends on both parental genotypes (figure 2).\nFirst-degree relatives — Individuals with Hb C, including Hb C trait, Hb C disease, or a compound hemoglobinopathy including Hb C, should inform their first-degree relatives to allow their testing and counseling, if appropriate. Such testing is especially important if they are considering childbearing.\nThe first test is typically a complete blood count (CBC) with review of the red blood cell (RBC) indices and reticulocyte count if available, followed by testing for hemolysis and a protein-based hemoglobin analysis method in most cases.

87	As someone who works in sustainable forestry certification, I'm curious about how both FSC and SFI certification systems ensure responsible forest management through their tracking mechanisms and what specific practices they require?	Both FSC and SFI implement comprehensive tracking systems to ensure responsible forest management. FSC uses a chain-of-custody (COC) paper trail that tracks certified wood from forest to consumer, following the material through certified mills and manufacturers. For SFI, their certification involves responsible sourcing practices and forest management standards that apply to over 100,000 acres of land, including properties like Philmont Scout Ranch (90,000 acres) and Summit Bechtel Reserve (13,000 acres). Both systems require practices that preserve ecosystems, protect biodiversity and water quality, ensure sustainable harvesting, and maintain long-term forest health. They also both use product labeling - FSC's logo and SFI's on-product label - to help consumers identify certified products ranging from lumber to paper goods.	"['SFI AND SCOUTS\nThe future of well-managed forests depends on developing the next generation of forest stewards.\nSince 2012, the Boy Scouts of America and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative Inc.® (SFI) have partnered through a signed memorandum of mutual support to promote sustainable forestry, environmental conservation and wise use of natural resources through education, community involvement and demonstration. The agreement recognizes certification of BSA-owned lands to the SFI Forest Management Standard and is part of SFI’s commitment to bringing youth outdoors to connect with nature, conservation and forests. Getting kids into forests and helping them learn about sustainability is good for forests and good for youth.\nProject Learning Tree (PLT), an initiative of SFI, is an award-winning environmental education program designed for teachers and other educators, parents, and community leaders working with youth from preschool through grade 12. PLT recently collaborated with BSA to correlate PLT activities to eight Cub Scout Adventures and six Scouts BSA merit badges. These correlations provide Scout leaders with ideas and hands-on, outdoor activities to help support Scouts, ages 5 to 17, with youth development goals. They also help introduce Scouts to careers in the outdoors, including jobs in forestry and natural resources conservation. To learn more, click here.\nHELPING TO KEEP OUR FORESTS HEALTHY\nKeeping our forests healthy means more than just replanting trees; it also means making sure habitats are healthy so the animals we love always have a place to call home. Certification of BSA-owned and managed forests to the SFI Forest Management Standard provides assurances of future forests and demonstrates sustainability to future leaders. Philmont Scout Ranch and the Summit Bechtel Reserve are both SFI-certified properties, and we are currently seeking interest from all BSA owned and managed properties to learn more about certification to the SFI Forest Management Standard. Overall, more than 100,000 acres of BSA land is certified to the SFI Forest Management Standard.\nSFI also works with companies to use responsible practices when collecting (or sourcing) materials.\nFUN SFI & SCOUT FACTS\nDid you know?\n- Philmont Scout Ranch – One of BSA’s four national High Adventure Bases in the U.S; BSA achieved certification of 90,000 acres in New Mexico to the SFI Forest Management Standard in 2008, and has maintained certification ever since.\n- Summit Bechtel Reserve (i.e. the “Summit”) – BSA’s newest High Adventure Base located in West Virginia, and the new permanent site for the National Jamboree which occurs every four years. The Summit successfully achieved certification to the SFI Forest Management Standard in February, 2016 on approximently 13,000 acres.\n- In 2013, BSA launched its new Sustainability merit badge highlighting Sustainable Forestry Initiative certification within the text. This merit badge was added to the list of required merit badges for Eagle rank.\n- BSA’s two magazines, Scouting (for Scout leaders) and Boy’s Life (for Scouts) both carry the SFI on-product label for the paper these publications are printed on.\n- All new BSA Merit Badge books also carry the SFI on-product label.\nWHAT TYPES OF ANIMALS LIVE IN THE FORESTS?\nForests cover about 30% of land in the world, 33% of the land in the United States and about 41% of the land in Canada. Billions of animals like wolves, elk, birds, bears and caribou call these forests home! Our forests and the animals living in them are important to our future. From the air we breathe to the water we drink, forests touch our lives every day. That’s why it’s important that we help conserve these habitats by making sure that the forest products we buy (like paper and wooden toys) come from responsibly sourced materials.The forest is home to tens of thousands of species, the boreal forest, in Canada, alone is home to over 30,000 species, and billions of animals rely on it at some point during the year. The forest is important habitat for millions of mammals, birds, and aquatic species. Forests certified to SFI help protect animals that are threatened or endangered, as well as those that are not.\nLOOK FOR THE SFI LABEL AND ASK FOR IT\nIf a product has the SFI label it means it was sourced from a certified forest and by a company that cares about how forests are managed. Look for the SFI label when you buy stuff for your home: food containers, boxes, napkins paper plates and cups, printer paper, grocery bags, lumber, envelopes, and even maple syrup and much more.\nDon’t just look for the label, ask for it too! Ask your grocery store and home office supply store to stock SFI-certified products, tell your favorite pizza restaurant to use SFI-certified pizza boxes. There are lots of ways that you can support future forests!\nWHAT CAN A TREE MAKE?\nMany things come from the forest. Some trees are used to make houses, offices, bridges and other buildings. See below for some examples of other items that come from forests.', 'FSC® Certified Wood\nWHAT IS FOREST CERTIFICATION?\nCredible forest certification involves an independent, third-party system of inspection and tracking of timber and other forest products to ensure that forests are managed in a way that preserves ecosystems, biodiversity, and water quality; that respects the rights of workers, indigenous peoples, and forest dependent communities; and that is lawful and economically viable over the long term.\nCorrectly implemented forest certification adds value to forests and provides consumers with the opportunity to make responsible choices through their purchases.\nWHAT IS FSC®?\nThe Forest Stewardship Council™ (FSC) is considered the “gold standard” in forest certification by the world’s leading environmental organizations (see here the Sierra Club’s position paper on forest certification and the FSC). The FSC was founded in 1993 by a broad coalition of indigenous groups, foresters and forest industry stakeholders, and other proponents of responsible forest management from around the world, including Greenpeace, The Nature Conservancy, the Sierra Club, the National Wildlife Federation, Friends of the Earth, Rainforest Action Network, the World Wildlife Fund, and other leading environmental organizations.\nOver the past decade, the FSC has established strict environmental and social standards for forest management, and has on-going programs to accredit and monitor certification organizations that evaluate on-the-ground compliance with these standards in forests around the world. For more information about the FSC Principles and Criteria for responsible forest management, see: http://www.fscus.org/standards_criteria/.\nFSC certifiers also perform audits to track the ""chain of custody"" of certified wood through the manufacturing process and to ensure that the rules for labeling final products with the FSC logo are followed. The FSC logo assures consumers that the products they purchase come from an industry that meets the social, economic and ecological needs of present and future generations. The purchase of products carrying the FSC logo directly supports the preservation of hundreds of millions of acres of forest around the world, and the tens of thousands of families who directly depend on them. To date, over 335 million acres of forest worldwide (roughly the area of California, Texas, and Arizona combined) have become FSC certified.\nFSC: HOW DOES IT WORK?\n- Forests are certified according to FSC’s Principles and Criteria.\n- Responsible management and harvesting practices are followed as trees are cut. A chain-of-custody (COC) paper trail is established.\n- Harvested trees are transported to an FSC-certified mill, where logs are processed into FSC-certified lumber; COC continues.\n- FSC-certified manufacturers use FSC-certified raw materials to make wood products; COC continues.\n- FSC-certified products are transported to stores worldwide; COC continues\n- Consumers purchase products with the FSC label; COC ends.\n- Support for sound forest management grows, and the demand for FSC-certified products increases, each time this cycle is completed.\nJENSEN LEISURE FURNITURE is FSC® Certified\nJensen Leisure Furniture products are made exclusively of 100% FSC-certified timbers. Jensen Leisure Furniture’s FSC chain-of-custody number is: RA-COC-003830. This number provides a means for the company to track your garden bench to the place in the forest where it originated. In 2010, Jensen Leisure Furniture was the only nationally significant brand awarded five stars (the highest rating awarded) by the National Wildlife Federation, for having carefully chosen garden furniture products for the 2010 season so that 100 percent of the tropical wood used in its products is FSC-certified and for their involvement in a program committed to FSC-certification.\nTo see the National Wildlife Federation 2010 Garden Furniture Scorecard, see:\nwww.nwf.org To learn more about the FSC, see:\nwww.fscus.org To read the Sierra Club position paper on forest certification and FSC, see:\nwww.sierraclub.org/forestcertificationreport To read a white paper on the hidden cost of wood products by the Rainforest Alliance, see:\nRainforest Alliance wood products paper\nRainforest Alliance profile on Grupo Roda - Jensen Leisure Furniture\'s manufacturing side']"	['<urn:uuid:f24557b2-57b3-4f95-9760-39203c371451>', '<urn:uuid:53120997-94ca-4479-b605-5136dd6aae2d>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	32	116	1443
88	cna lpn job duties responsibilities differences	CNAs and LPNs have distinct job responsibilities. CNAs perform basic patient care duties including bathing, dressing, exercising and feeding patients, collecting routine information about patients' conditions, and reporting to supervisors. In contrast, LPNs have more advanced responsibilities including measuring vital signs, administering medications, starting IV drips, overseeing patients, collecting blood or urine samples, maintaining patient records, and assisting doctors or RNs with procedures. LPNs can also work in specialized areas like long-term care, critical care, oncology and cardiology, while CNAs typically work in assisted living facilities, nursing homes, and hospitals.	"[""CNA stands for Certified Nursing Assistant. A CNA is regarded as the person, who directly deals with the patients. CNAs are also called as patient care technicians, orderlies or nurse aides. CNAs have a caring attitude, compassion for patients along with a desire to help people. A CNA works below a LPN (Licensed Practical Nurse) or RN (Registered Nurse). CNAs collect the routine important information about the situation of the patients and submit it to their supervisors. CNAs might find jobs in assisted living facilities, adult day care facilities, nursing homes, home health agencies, acute care facilities and hospitals. CNAs have to make sure the patients are bathed, dressed, exercised and fed on time (on a daily basis).\nWhat's CNA training?\nTraining plays an important role in becoming a good CNA. To be a CNA, you have to qualify the CNA Entrance exam conducted from the state and attend the training program that is certified from the concerned state. The CNA training program helps you in obtaining a license or certification from the worried state. The training applications allow you to have out the task duties as a CNA in an effective manner. The duration of the training time period differs according to the state. Training programs are conducted by various technical schools, community schools, private and government organizations. Some organizations also provide free or low cost CNA training programs. After finishing CNA training, you may as well go for CNA to LPN program in Illinois.\nKinds of CNA training programs:\nBoth online and on-campus CNA training programs can be found for the aspirants. Students might select any program, according to their convenience. On-line CNA training classes offer versatility. Those candidates, who've obtained the certification earlier and want to get refresher training before renewing the certification, will find the online training programs beneficial. If you are already operating in the healthcare field and need to enhance your abilities, then also you might opt for online CNA training programs.\nOn-campus CNA training programs is divided into two parts- classroom studies and practical sessions.\nIn classroom studies, the students learn about first aid essentials, medical terms and definitions, normal patient care, and so on.\nIn practical sessions, students work in clinics below the supervision of healthcare professionals. Before enrolling for the CNA training program, you need to make sure the training program is recognized from the concerned state.\nGeneral Requirements for Enrolment in CNA training programs:\nEach has particular enrollment requirements, but you need to fulfill some of the generic requirements prior to enrolling for the CNA training program. The list is of prerequisites is given below:\no The applicant should have a caring attitude, compassion towards the patients and desire to help individuals.\no The candidate should be proficient in reading, writing and speaking English.\no He must be a minimum of eighteen years old.\no He must have clean criminal file.\no The applicant should have a diploma in high school or General Education Development (GED) certificate.\no He ought to not be suffering from any contagious illness.\no He must have great communication abilities.\no He should have a valid Social Security Card along with a picture ID.\nWhat will you Study in CNA training programs?\nThe assorted subjects integrated in the classroom curriculum are first aid essentials, healthcare terms and definitions, normal patient care, and so on.\nIn the practical sessions of CNA training programs, students learn to measure temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, wound dressing, preparing patient information, inserting food tubes, inserting and removing catheters, feeding the patients, updating the doctor on the patient's regimen progress and explaining the routine to patient's family. Students also learn to deal with death and terminally ill patients and their families, judge the patient's psychological and emotional specifications, etc.\nScope after completion of CNA training program:\nAfter completion of the training program, you have to qualify a certification exam. Once you qualify the examination, you're added to the Nurse Aid Registry. After that, you may work in numerous health care centers, hospitals and rehabilitation centers."", 'How to Enroll In the Right LPN Training near Elk Grove California\nThere are principally two scholastic credentials available that provide training to become an LPN near Elk Grove CA. The one that can be finished in the shortest period of time, usually about 1 year, is the certificate or diploma program. The next choice is to earn a Practical Nursing Associate Degree. These LPN programs are broader in nature than the diploma option and typically require 2 years to complete. The advantage of Associate Degrees, aside from providing a higher credential and more comprehensive training, are that they furnish more transferable credit toward a Bachelor’s Degree in nursing. Regardless of the type of credential you pursue, it should be state approved and accredited by the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC) or another national accrediting organization. The NLNAC guarantees that the core curriculum properly prepares students to become Practical Nurses, and that the majority of graduates pass the 50 state required NCLEX-PN licensing exam.\nWhat is an LPN?\nLicensed Practical Nurses have many functions that they accomplish in the Elk Grove CA health facilities where they practice. As their titles signify, they are required to be licensed in all states, including California. While they may be accountable for managing Certified Nursing Assistants (CNA), they themselves usually work under the guidance of either an RN or a doctor. The health care facilities where they work are numerous and assorted, including hospitals, medical clinics, schools, and long-term care facilities. Anywhere that you can encounter patients requiring medical assistance is their dominion. Each state not only controls their licensing, but also what functions an LPN can and can’t perform. So based on the state, their day-to-day work functions might include:\n- Measuring vital signs\n- Administering medications\n- Starting IV drips\n- Overseeing patients\n- Collecting blood or urine samples\n- Keeping patient records\n- Assisting doctors or Registered nurses with procedures\nAlong with their occupational functions being controlled by each state, the healthcare facilities or other Elk Grove CA healthcare providers where LPNs work can additionally limit their job roles within those parameters. Also, they can work in different specialties of nursing, for instance long-term care, critical care, oncology and cardiology.\nLPN Programs Online\nAttending LPN programs online is growing into a more in demand way to obtain instruction and earn a nursing certificate or degree in Elk Grove CA. Some schools will require attendance on campus for part of the training, and virtually all programs call for a specific amount of clinical rotation hours performed in a local healthcare facility. But since the balance of the training may be accessed online, this alternative may be a more accommodating approach to finding the time to attend school for many students. Concerning tuition, a number of online degree programs are less expensive than other on campus choices. Even supplemental expenses such as for commuting and study materials may be reduced, helping to make education more easily affordable. And numerous online programs are accredited by U.S. Department of Education recognized organizations. And so if your job and family commitments have left you with limited time to work toward your academic goals, maybe an online LPN program will make it more convenient to fit a degree into your active schedule.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for Licensed Practical Nurses (LPN) was $45,030 in May 2017. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $32,970, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $61,030. Most licensed practical nurses near Elk Grove CA work full time, although about 1 in 5 worked part time in 2016. Many work nights, weekends, and holidays, because medical care takes place at all hours. They may be required to work shifts of longer than 8 hours. Employment of LPNs is projected to grow 12 percent from 2016 to 2026. Job prospects should be favorable for LPNs who are willing to work in rural and medically under served areas.\nThings to Ask LPN Schools\nNow that you have decided on obtaining your LPN certificate, as well as if you will attend classes on campus or on the web, you can utilize the following pointers to start narrowing down your choices. As you probably are aware, there are a large number of nursing schools and colleges near Elk Grove CA as well as within California and throughout the United States. So it is essential to lower the number of schools to select from in order that you will have a workable list. As we already mentioned, the location of the school and the expense of tuition are most likely going to be the primary two points that you will take into consideration. But as we also stressed, they should not be your only qualifiers. So before making your final decision, use the following questions to evaluate how your selection compares to the field.\n- Accreditation. It’s a good idea to make sure that the certificate program as well as the school are accredited by a U.S. Department of Education recognized accrediting organization. Aside from helping confirm that you obtain a premium education, it may assist in securing financial aid or student loans, which are frequently not offered for non-accredited schools near Elk Grove CA.\n- Licensing Preparation. Licensing criteria for LPNs vary from state to state. In all states, a passing score is required on the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-PN) along with graduation from an accredited school. Certain states require a specific number of clinical hours be completed, as well as the passing of additional tests. It’s important that the school you are attending not only provides a top-notch education, but also preps you to comply with the minimum licensing standards for California or the state where you will be working.\n- Reputation. Check internet rating companies to see what the reviews are for all of the LPN schools you are looking into. Ask the accrediting organizations for their reviews also. Also, get in touch with the California school licensing authority to check out if there are any complaints or compliance issues. Finally, you can speak with some nearby Elk Grove CA healthcare organizations you’re interested in working for after graduation and ask what their assessments are of the schools as well.\n- Graduation and Job Placement Rates. Find out from the LPN programs you are looking at what their graduation rates are as well as how long on average it takes students to finish their programs. A low graduation rate may be an indication that students were displeased with the program and dropped out. It’s also essential that the schools have high job placement rates. A high rate will not only verify that the school has a superb reputation within the Elk Grove CA medical community, but that it also has the network of contacts to help students gain a position.\n- Internship Programs. The most ideal way to get experience as a Licensed Practical Nurse is to work in a clinical environment. Essentially all nursing degree programs require a certain number of clinical hours be completed. Various states have minimum clinical hour prerequisites for licensing also. Ask if the schools have a working relationship with nearby Elk Grove CA community hospitals, clinics or labs and assist with the positioning of students in internships.\nEnrolling in an LPN Program near Elk Grove CA?\nIf you are considering enrolling in and attending an LPN school near Elk Grove CA, you may find the following information both interesting and useful when making your final decision.\nElk Grove, California\nElk Grove is a city in Sacramento County, California, located just south of the state capital of Sacramento.

Birds chattered in the trees and big fish darted through the pellucid depths. The air was like champagne, and (the Spaniards) drank deep of it, drank in the beauty around them.""\nElk Grove was founded in 1850 as a stage stop for travelers coming from Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area, when the Elk Grove Hotel and Stage Stop was opened by James Hall and the town was named after it.

90	how does income affect daily happiness	According to research findings, income has little impact on day-to-day happiness. Income only becomes significant for well-being to the extent that it allows for basic needs to be met.	"['Maslow 2.0: A New and Improved Recipe for HappinessComment\nWhat are the ingredients for happiness? It\'s a question that has been addressed time andagain, and now a study based on the first-ever globally representative poll on well-being has some answers about whether or not a pioneering theory is actually correct.\nThe theory in question is the psychologist Abraham Maslow\'s ""hierarchy of needs,"" a staple of Psychology 101 courses that was famously articulated in 1954. It breaks down the path to happiness in an easy-to-digest list: Earthly needs, such as food and safety, are considered essential, since they act as the groundwork that makes it possible to pursue loftier desires, such as love, respect, and self-actualization (the realization of one\'s full potential).\nThe problem is, Maslow\'s theory remained a theory. Though it gained popularity, scientific psychologists largely ignored it. ""They thought the needs were too inborn and universal,"" says Ed Diener, the author of Happiness: Unlocking the Mysteries of Psychological Wealth, ""and that the idea of self-actualization was too fuzzy. They started to believe everything is learned and due to socialization.""\nTo find proof that Maslow\'s theory translated into real life, Diener, a University of Illinois psychologist and senior scientist for the Gallup Organization, helped design the Gallup World Poll, a landmark survey on well-being with 60,865 participants from 123 countries that was conducted from 2005 to 2010. Respondents answered questions about six needs that closely resemble those in Maslow\'s model: basic needs (food, shelter); safety; social needs (love, support); respect; mastery; and autonomy. They also rated their well-being across three discrete measures: life evaluation (a person\'s view of his or her life as a whole), positive feelings (day-to-day instances of joy or pleasure), and negative feelings (everyday experiences of sorrow, anger, or stress). Finally, Diener analyzed the poll data with fellow University of Illinois psychology professor Louis Tayfor a study in the current edition of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.\nThe results are mixed. Maslow rightly saw that there are human needs that apply regardless of culture, but his ordering of these needs was not right on target. ""Although the most basic needs might get the most attention when you don\'t have them,"" Diener explains, ""you don\'t need to fulfill them in order to get benefits [from the others]."" Even when we are hungry, for instance, we can be happy with our friends. ""They\'re like vitamins,"" Diener says on how the needs work independently. ""We need them all.""\nThe study\'s methodical investigation of both day-to-day positive and negative feelings and overall life evaluation uncovered novel nuances as well. As it turns out, the needs that are most linked with everyday satisfaction are interpersonal ones, such as love and respect. Our troubles, conversely, relate most to lack of esteem, lack of freedom, and lack of nourishment. Only when we look back on the quality of our lives thus far do basic needs become significant indicators for well-being.\nFor Diener, the implications for public policymakers are clear. Since each of Maslow\'s needs correlates with certain components of happiness, he says, ""all the needs are important all the time. Our leaders need to think about them from the outset, otherwise they will have no reason to address social and community needs until food and shelter are available to all.""\nUniversity of Pennsylvania psychology professor Martin Seligman, who says the study might be a breakthrough, adds: ""Governments should take these measures seriously and hold themselves accountable for public policy changes for the well-being of their citizens."" Focus away from monetary measures should be considered, especially in light of Diener and Tay\'s finding that income has little impact on day-to-day happiness and is significant for well-being only in so far as it allows for basic needs to be met. Seligman argues in his book Flourish:\n...[G]ross domestic product should no longer be the only serious index of how well a nation is doing. It is not just the alarming divergence between quality of life and GDP that warrants this conclusion. Policy itself follows from what is measured, and if all that is measured is money, all policy will be about getting more money.\nPerhaps, as Seligman suggests, governments could take their cue from Bhutan, a nation that consistently ranks high in ""gross national happiness,"" if not GDP. University of British Columbia economist John Helliwell points to the recent riots in London, where social connections had ostensibly frayed, to illustrate the dangers of an unhappy citizenry. Such anti-social acts, he says, should prompt world leaders to adopt the recently passed UN resolution to make happiness a primary goal for global development and to consider Diener\'s model. ""It shows clearly the importance in all societies of human connections and social supports, something that\'s been ignored in recent years,"" he says.\nIndeed, Maslow\'s theory has led psychologists to focus on the self over the social for decades, what with self-actualization as the height of human motivation. Diener and Tay\'s revised model, however, aims to strike a balance between the pursuit of happiness as the end goal and the fulfillment of both personal and social goals to get there. ""Maslow got right that there are universal human needs beyond the physiological needs that everyone recognizes,"" Diener says. ""But it turns out people are inherently social. We are called the social animal now.""\nImages: STR New/Reuters and Debra Bolgla']"	['<urn:uuid:6328414d-f2a5-4903-aade-70091b657951>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	6	29	891
91	driving sign orange triangle on farm equipment what is meaning history purpose	The orange triangular sign is called a Slow-Moving Vehicle (SMV) emblem, designed to warn approaching motorists to slow down. It was developed in the early 1960s at The Ohio State University after research showed that 65% of motor vehicle accidents involving slow-moving vehicles were rear-end collisions. The emblem features a fluorescent orange center with reflective borders, making it visible both day and night from 500 feet away. Created in 1962 and dedicated to the public in 1963, this safety symbol has been used for 50 years to alert motorists when sharing roads with agricultural equipment and horse-drawn vehicles.	"['Identification of Slow Moving Vehicles\nIt sounds like a word problem straight out of a math textbook: If a car is traveling 60 mph and approaching a tractor traveling 20 mph, how long does it take for the car to travel 400-foot and reach the tractor?\nThe answer is less than 6.5 seconds; not a lot of time for the driver of the car to slow down, unless there is sufficient warning. The slow-moving vehicle (SMV) emblem, a fluorescent orange triangle with ""retroreflective"" borders, does just that. It warns approaching motorists to slow down.\nThe SMV emblem is required by the Ohio Revised Code when moving ""implements of husbandry"" and farm machinery on public roadways. Implements of husbandry are vehicles designed and adapted exclusively for agricultural, horticultural, or livestock-raising operations. Additionally, SMV emblems are required on other specific vehicles, including horse-drawn vehicles.\n-Must meet ASABE standards: Look for highest ‘dot #’ on the “ANSI/ASAE S276.#” label when purchasing an SMV emblem. For example, a S276.7 would be preferred over an S276.3\n-Visible 500-feet to the rear; readily identifiable both day and night\n-Condition of the emblem: clean, undamaged, not faded. SMV’s fade over time and need to be replaced periodically\nSMV Emblem Mounting\n• Visible to the rear\n• Triangle point facing upward\n• 10 degrees from vertical\n• 2 to 10 feet above the ground\n• In center of vehicle or as near left-center as practicable\n• Securely or rigidly attached (not required to be permanently mounted)\nRestrictions on SMV Use\nMAXIMUM vehicle speed = 25 mph\nEmblem not to be used when transporting equipment with motor vehicles such as on a truck or trailer or at speeds greater than 25 mph; the SMV should be removed or covered when being hauled.\nHigh Speed Tractors Traveling Faster Than 25 mph\nThe scope of the Speed Identification Symbol (SIS) standard is primarily to identify farm machinery traveling at ground speeds greater than 25 mph. The SIS also identifies the farm machineries’ maximum speeds. The SIS needs to be visible 300-ft-100-ft to the rear, used in conjunction with the SMV emblem and comply with ASABE standards. These emblems are reserved for machinery meeting the definition of “High Speed tractors” as declared by the manufacturer.\nWhat does the SIS law change for Ohio farmers?\n• Allows farm machinery to operate above 25 mph when displaying both SMV and SIS emblems. Requires the operator to possess documentation of manufacturer’s stated maximum speed of the vehicle. The SIS of both the vehicle and the implement in tow may not exceed this documented speed\n• Requires the operator to possess a driver’s license to operate any equipment above 25 mph\nWhere can you get an SIS?\nAll SIS emblems must be ASABE approved. For more information about obtaining an SIS, contact your implement dealer.\nHistory of the SMV Emblem\nIn 2013, the SMV celebrates 50 years as a safety symbol to alert the motoring public when sharing the roads with agricultural equipment and horse-drawn vehicles.\nIn the late 1950s a 10-year retrospective study of fatal tractor accidents was conducted by Walter McClure and Ben Lamp, both of the Department of Agricultural Engineering at The Ohio State University (AEOSU), to understand the nature and causes of highway tractor collisions. The research indicated a significant number of fatalities related to highway travel of slow-moving vehicles (SMVs). A research proposal written by Ken Harkness (AEOSU) and funded through the Automotive Safety Foundation (1961-62) further focused understanding of SMV accidents and resulted in the development of a unique SMV emblem. Early data estimated that 65 percent of the motor vehicle accidents involving SMVs were rear-end collisions. The Ohio State Highway Patrol, county sheriffs, and municipal police cooperated in the research by gathering detailed data on 708 SMV accidents.\nIn 1962, under the supervision of Ken Harkness, the design and testing of the SMV emblem was completed. A 1/16 scale highway simulator had been constructed to test human recognition rates of different shapes and colors mounted on simulated SMVs. After testing various designs, a triangular-shaped emblem with a 12-inch-high fluorescent orange center and three 1 3/4 inch wide reflective borders was determined to be the most effective design for day and night visual identification.\nThe Goodyear Rubber and Tire Company sponsored initial public exposure to the SMV emblem in 1962. An emblem mounted on the back of a farm wagon and towed by a Ford Tractor made a 3,689 mile trip from Portland, Maine to San Diego, California.\nThe first formal introduction of the SMV emblem was at a University of Iowa Invitational Safety Seminar in 1962. Carlton Zink of Deere and Company then became an avid promoter of the SMV emblem and played a major role in the adoption of the emblem by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE).\nIn 1963 Novice G. Fawcett, President of The Ohio State University, dedicated the SMV emblem to the public. Also in 1963 the Agricultural Engineering Journal printed its first article with color illustrations about the SMV emblem. The National Safety Council promoted the adoption of the emblem and awarded a Certificate of Commendation to Ken Harkness.\nIn less than two years from the emblem’s first date of availability, Nebraska, Michigan, Ohio, and Vermont adopted legislation requiring the emblem to be used on SMVs. Safety Leader Bill Stuckey, an Ohio Farm and Home Safety Committee member, spearheaded the adoption of the SMV emblem in Ohio. In 1967 the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) adopted the SMV emblem as a CSA Standard. In 1971 the SMV emblem became the first ASAE Standard to be adopted as a national standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).\nIn recognition for the research and development of the SMV emblem, Ken Harkness was selected as a Charter Member of the Ohio Safety Hall of Fame in 1992.\nIn 1992 the American Society of Agricultural Engineers designated the development of the SMV emblem as an ASAE Historic Landmark.\nIn 2013 the SMV celebrates 50 years of existence in the United States.

92	How does lime interact with carbon dioxide in both plaster applications and water treatment processes, and what are the resulting compounds?	In plaster applications, lime undergoes carbonation where it slowly absorbs CO2 from the air to transform back into calcite (CaCO3), similar to its original limestone form. In water treatment, lime (Ca(OH)2) reacts with CO2 in two contexts: initially, CO2 creates a demand for lime by reacting to form calcium carbonate and water (CO2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaCO3 + H2O), and later during recarbonation, where CO2 is pumped into the water to react with excess lime, again producing calcium carbonate while lowering pH.	['Historical Plaster and the Irreplaceable Lime\nThe Lime of Our Lives\nLime may very well be the most prized and versatile building material of the civilized world. The Mayans, Egyptians, Greeks and Romans all used lime extensively. The fact that many of their works realized in lime have survived hundreds or even thousands of years until the present day testifies to the durability of lime. The benefits of being physically durable seem obvious enough; however, beauty is an oft overlooked factor in sustainability. After all we’re often willing to go to great lengths preserve and maintain what aesthetically pleases us and are likewise eager to tear down what we find ugly.\nLeonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael are considered the three preeminent masters of the Renaissance, each producing lime plastered masterpieces delicately painted al fresco. Lime has likewise been modified to construct sublime, enduring structures such as the 2nd century Roman Pantheon as well as our own Hoover Dam of the 20th century.\nAlthough lime can be produced from a variety of natural sources such as marble and shells, lime manufactured for plaster typically comes from limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock that forms from the skeletal remains of marine creatures that have accumulated on the ocean floor. With time and pressure these remains are pressed together into beds of stone. The Garden of the Gods in the Shawnee National Forest provides one stunning example of exposed sedimentary limestone.\nChemistry & Manufacture\nMany marine organisms have the ability to metabolize calcium (and occasionally magnesium) ions present in the water to form shells or skeletons for themselves. Actually, we share this ability and use it to grow our own skeletons and teeth. Pure limestone is a carbonate of calcium or “calcite” having the formula CaCO3. Limestones that have significant percentages of magnesium are referred to as dolomitic limestones. Both are useful for building as well as manufacturing lime for plasters and mortars.\nLike gypsum rock, limestone must be baked in preparation for its use as a plaster. Unlike gypsum however, this occurs at a higher temperature that makes it a moderately energy intensive process. Limestone can be efficiently baked at temperatures starting at 1,500 degrees F. At this temperature lime “calcines” or off-gases carbon dioxide, CO2. The resulting material has the chemical formula calcium oxide or CaO, commonly known as “quicklime.” Although quicklime has and can be used as a plaster, it is extremely alkali and exothermically reactive even explosive under certain conditions. Unless engaged in very specific restoration work most plasterers will utilize lime that has undergone further processing.\nBy adding water as a fine mist or steam the reactive quicklime can be “quenched,” converted to a relatively inert dry hydrated form with the chemical formula calcium hydroxide or Ca(OH)2. This process is known as “slaking” and the resulting powdery binder is commonly called a dry hydrate or slaked lime. If excess water is added a lime putty will form. So long as the putty is protected from exposure to air it will last indefinitely.\nGenerally, the longer a putty sits the creamier and more desirable it is for plastering. Both the dry hydrate and putty forms of lime have a lower alkalinity than quicklime making them the considerably safer preference for plasterers to work with. When exposed to air under normal conditions the processed lime slowly returns to its natural state of calcite, resembling the limestone from which it was derived and recapturing from the air much of the CO2 lost in manufacturing through a process known as “carbonation.”\nProperties & Specifications\nLime has been used for just about everything: interior plaster, exterior stucco, mortar for bricks and stone, mouldings and ornament. The list of positive qualities of lime is extensive. First of all, limestone is a plentiful resource found in large quantities distributed all over the world. Although the burning of limestone requires far more energy than gypsum, limestone can still be baked at temperatures low enough to utilize renewable, natural materials that require a fraction of the production energy of modern materials, such as Portland cement or polymers. Furthermore, limes have the ability to re-absorb the CO2 lost in manufacturing through the process of carbonation, illustrated by the famous lime cycle.\nLime plasters are incombustible, breathable and maintain a low pH or alkalinity that actively suppresses mould growth and promotes healthy indoor air quality. Limes are chemically compatible with all other heritage binders; blends with clay, gypsum, hydraulic limes and natural cements have numerous practical applications. Lime is not only very white but also very bright, that is to say it has a high index of refraction of visible light so that the addition of mineral tints can achieve an extensive range of saturated colors.\nNot only do lime plasters maintain a good surface hardness and erosion resistance making them ideal as an exterior stucco, they have a high tensile strength conferring the quality of flexibility. This means they can literally bend over time with less propensity of breaking or spalling. In conjunction with this flexibility lime has the property of autogenous healing. Because there is always a percentage of “free” or uncarbonated hydroxide in the plaster, should a crack occur lime literally has the ability to crystalize or knit itself back together.\nDespite all of the deserved praise there are a few limitations and precautions to consider when working with or specifying limes for plaster. Lime is not self-binding. Careful attention has to be given to the distribution of aggregates and fibers to make a high performance lime plaster. Closely related to this attribute is that lime shrinks upon drying. This place a limit how thick lime plasters can be applied and therefore how quickly work can proceed. As all of the water eventually evaporates from the system, lime plasters must be compressed and burnished while they are drying so that they don’t end up being friable, subject to crazing (microcracks) or even delamination.\nCarbonation, the chemical cure of the plaster needs to occur for every layer and takes time, sometimes days or even weeks to complete. This often requires interim protection of the plaster surface from the sun, wind and limiting exterior work to times of year where the lime plaster will not be subject to freeze thaw cycles. In summary, lime is a true craft material that requires a good deal of mixing and application knowledge on the part of the plasterer.\nSome limestones are “contaminated” by materials that drastically affect the chemical properties of the resulting lime during the baking process. In our next essay we’ll begin taking a closer examination of another member of the lime family, the hydraulic limes.', 'Lime softening involves a relatively\nseries of chemical reactions which will be discussed in depth\nThe goal of all of these reactions is to change the calcium and\nmagnesium compounds in water into calcium carbonate and magnesium\nhydroxide. These are the least soluble calcium and magnesium\nand thus will settle out of the water at the lowest\nFor example, calcium carbonate (which is essentially the same as\nlimestone) will settle out of water at concentrations greater than 40\nIn order to produce calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide, the pH\nthe water must be raised by the addition of lime. Calcium\nwater will be removed at a pH of about 9.0 to 9.5 while magnesium\ncompounds require a pH of 10.0 to 10.5. When soda ash is used to\nremove noncarbonate hardness, an even higher pH is required - 10.0 to\n10.5 for calcium compounds and 11.0 to 11.5 for magnesium\nCarbon Dioxide Demand\nThe first step in lime softening is the addition of lime to water using\na typical dry feeder, either volumetric or gravimetric. As in the\nchlorination process, lime reacts with substances in the water before\nit can begin softening the water. Carbon dioxide is the primary\ncompound which creates the initial demand for lime. The following\nreaction occurs, using up carbon dioxide and lime and creating calcium\ncarbonate and water:\nCarbon dioxide + Lime → Calcium carbonate +\nCO2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaCO3 + H2O\nThe resulting calcium carbonate precipitates out of solution.\nWhen water, especially groundwater, has a high carbon dioxide\nconcentration, the water is often pretreated with aeration before\nbegins. Aeration removes the excess carbon dioxide and lowers the\nRemoval of Carbonate Hardness\nOnce the carbon dioxide demand has been met, the lime is free to react\nwith and remove carbonate hardness from the water. Calcium\nreact with lime in the reaction shown below.\nCalcium bicarbonate +\n→ Calcium carbonate + Water\nCa(HCO3)2 + Ca(OH)2 →\n2CaCO3 + 2H2O\nWe have focussed on calcium bicarbonate since it is the most common\ncalcium compound in water, but other calcium-based hardness compounds\nhave similar reactions. In any case, the calcium carbonate\nable to precipitate out of solution.\nMagnesium compounds have a slightly different reaction. First,\nmagnesium bicarbonate reacts with lime and produces calcium carbonate\n(which precipitates out of solution) and magnesium carbonate.\nMagnesium bicarbonate +\nLime → Calcium carbonate +\nMagnesium carbonate + Water\nMg(HCO3)2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaCO3\n+ MgCO3 + 2H2O\nThen the magnesium carbonate reacts with lime and creates more calcium\ncarbonate and magnesium hydroxide. Both of these compounds are\nprecipitate out of water.\nMagnesium carbonate +\nLime → Calcium carbonate + Magnesium\nMgCO3 + Ca(OH)2 → CaCO3 +\nRemoval of Noncarbonate Hardness\nmany cases, only the carbonate hardness needs to be removed, requiring\nonly the addition of lime. However, if noncarbonate hardness also\nneeds to be removed from water, then soda ash must be added to the\nwater along with lime.\nMagnesium sulfate + Lime\n→ Magnesium hydroxide + Calcium sulfate\nEach noncarbonate hardness compound will have a slightly different\nreaction. Here, we will consider the reactions of magnesium\nThe lime first reacts with the magnesium sulfate, as shown below:\nMgSO4 + Ca(OH)2 → Mg(OH)2\nThe resulting compounds are magnesium hydroxide, which will precipitate\nout of solution, and calcium sulfate. The calcium sulfate then\nwith soda ash:\nCalcium sulfate + Soda Ash → Calcium\ncarbonate + Sodium\nCaSO4 + Na2CO3 → CaCO3\nThe calcium carbonate resulting from this reaction will settle out of\nthe water. The sodium sulfate is not a hardness-causing compound,\nit can remain in the water without causing problems.\nThe reactions which remove carbonate and noncarbonate hardness from\nwater require a high pH and produce water with a high concentration of\ndissolved lime and calcium carbonate. If allowed to enter the\ndistribution system in this state, the high pH would cause corrosion of\npipes and the excess calcium carbonate would precipitate out, causing\nscale. So the water must be recarbonated,\nwhich is the process of stabilizing the water by lowering the pH and\nprecipitating out excess lime and calcium carbonate.\nThe goal of recarbonation is to produce stable water,\nwhich is water in chemical balance, containing the concentration of\ncalcium carbonate in which it will neither tend to precipitate out of\nthe water (causing scale) nor dissolve into the water (causing\ncorrosion.) This goal is usually achieved by pumping carbon\ninto the water. Excess lime reacts with carbon dioxide in the\nbelow, producing calcium carbonate:\nLime + Carbon dioxide\nCalcium carbonate + Water\nCa(OH)2 + CO2 → CaCO3 + H2O\nRecarbonation also lowers the pH, which encourages the\nprecipitation of calcium carbonate and\nRecarbonation may occur in one step, in which the pH is lowered to\nabout 10.4 and carbonate hardness is precipitated out. In some\na second recarbonation step is used to lower the pH to 9.8 and\nencourage yet more precipitation. In either case, the process\ncarefully controlled since carbon dioxide can react with calcium\ncarbonate and draw it back into solution as calcium bicarbonate,\nthe softening process.\nAlternatively, recarbonation can be achieved through the addition of\nacids such as\nsulfuric or hydrochloric acids or through polyphosphate addition.\nThese types of recarbonation work differently from carbon dioxide\nIn The Treatment Process\nLime softening uses the equipment\nalready found in most treatment plants for turbidity removal. An\noverview of the lime treatment process is shown below.\nLime softening produces large quantities of sludge. In fact, for\nevery pound of lime used, about two pounds of sludge are formed.\nThe softening process usually requires two sedimentation basins, each\nwith a detention time of 1.5 to 3 hours, to deal with the large\nquantities of sludge. One sedimentation basin handles the sludge\nresulting from lime and soda ash softening and the other sedimentation\nbasin deals with the sludge resulting from recarbonation.\nDisposal of lime sludge is the same as for sedimentation basin\nsludge. Landfill disposal is the most common method, although\nsludge may sometimes be sent to sanitary sewers. Lime sludge has\nhigh pH and has increasingly been disposed of by applying it to\nagricultural land to increase the pH of acidic soils.\nIf softening problems are discovered, the cause usually lies in either\nchemical feeder malfunctions or source water quality changes. A\nvariety of water characteristics can influence lime-soda ash softening:\nThese four water characteristics should be monitored carefully when\nsoftening water using lime. In addition, coagulants used to\ninfluence the alkalinity or pH of the water, thus affecting the\nsoftening process. After softening, the Langelier Index of\nthe water should be tested to ensure that the water is not\nstudy the Langelier index and corrosive water in more depth in the next\n- Water hardness\nwill determine the quantity of chemicals which must be added to soften\n- pH influences the\nchemical reactions in the softening process. A higher pH makes\nthe process more efficient.\n- Alkalinity determines whether the\nhardness in the water is carbonate or noncarbonate hardness.\ninfluences the rate of the reaction and the amount of hardness which\nthe water will hold.\nSoftening is especially well-suited to treating groundwater since\ngroundwater characteristics tend to remain relatively constant.\nChanging water conditions require a great deal of manipulating the\nsoftening process to keep it efficient. In addition, the high\nturbidity found in surface water sometimes requires presedimentation\nprior to softening.\nChemicals Used in Lime Softening\nTypes of Lime\nThe lime used for softening comes in two forms - hydrated lime and\nquicklime. Both types of lime soften water in the same way, but\nequipment required for the two types of lime is different.\nHydrated lime (Ca(OH)2)\nis also known as calcium hydroxide or slaked lime. Hydrated\nbe added to water as it is without requiring any special equipment, so\nit is a popular choice for small water treatment plants.\nIn contrast, quicklime (CaO),\nalso known as calcium oxide or unslaked lime, must be slaked before it\nis used. Slaking is the\nprocess of converting quicklime to hydrated lime by adding water, as\nCalcium oxide + Water\nCaO + H2O → Ca (OH)2\nSlaking requires specialized equipment. The cost of equipment and\nthe operator time required to run the equipment usually make quicklime\nuneconomical in small plants. However, since the chemical cost of\nquicklime is less than the cost of hydrated lime, quicklime is often\nused in large plants.\nThe slaking process can also allow a large plant to reuse a large\nquantity of the lime sludge produced in the softening process.\nthe sludge is heated, and the calcium carbonate in the sludge produces\nCalcium carbonate → Calcium oxide + Carbon\nCaCO3 → CaO + CO2\nThen the calcium oxide can be slaked and reused in the plant.\nlime sludge cuts down on both chemical purchase and sludge disposal\nLime Handling and Storage\nOperators should observe safety procedures while handling both hydrated\nlime and quicklime. Lime dust can be harmful when it comes in\nwith the eyes, nose, or mouth, and skin contact can cause burns.\nresult, operators should wear goggles and dust masks as well as\nBoth hydrated lime and quicklime can deteriorate in quality over time\nwhile in storage. In addition, storing quicklime can cause safety\nproblems. If quicklime comes in contact with water, it begins to\nslake, a process which produces a great deal of heat and can cause\nexplosions when uncontrolled. Quicklime should never be stored\nalum since the quicklime will absorb water away from the alum and cause\nSoda ash (Na2CO3) comes in only one form and does\nnot require any treatment before it is added to the water. Safety\nissues resemble those for lime handling. Soda ash dust\nirritates the eyes and mucous membranes of the nose, so the operator\nshould wear protective clothing, goggles, and a dust mask. In\nareas in which soda ash is used should be equipped with a ventilation\nsystem to deal with the dust.\nCaustic soda (NaOH), also\nas sodium hydroxide, can replace soda ash and some of the lime in the\ntreatment process. The treatment process using caustic soda\nthe same steps as that of lime-soda ash softening.\nFirst, carbon dioxide reacts with the caustic soda to make sodium\ncarbonate and water.\nCarbon dioxide +\n→ Sodium Carbonate + Water\nCO2 + 2NaOH → Na2CO3 + H2O\nThen the remaining caustic soda can react with calcium bicarbonate\nand magnesium bicarbonate.\nCalcium bicarbonate +\n→ Calcium carbonate + Soda ash + Water\nCa(HCO3)2 + 2NaOH → CaCO3\n+ Na2CO3 + 2H2O\nMagnesium bicarbonate + Caustic soda →\n+ Soda ash + Water\nMg(HCO3)2 + 4NaOH → Mg(OH)2\n+ 2Na2CO3 + 2H2O\nMagnesium sulfate + Caustic soda → Magnesium\nThe caustic soda can also react with\nmagnesium noncarbonate hardness, as shown below. Also note\nreactions between caustic soda and carbonate hardness produced soda\nash, which can react with noncarbonate hardness as well.\nMgSO4 + 2NaOH → Mg(OH)2 + Na2SO4\nCaustic soda has the advantages of stability in storage, lower sludge\nformation, and easy handling. However, safety issues still\nCaustic soda is dangerous to the operator and can cause severe\nburns to the skin. As a result, rubber gloves, dusk masks,\nand a rubber apron should be worn while handling the chemical.']	['<urn:uuid:8b424679-a10f-4307-ae17-be7686c36806>', '<urn:uuid:66ee554f-6c2a-4b98-a228-b0073115b1a2>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	21	82	2970

All workers admitted to the U.S. under the H-2A visa are guaranteed certain rights regarding wages, housing, workplace safety, and other requirements. Let’s take a closer look at employee rights under the H-2A visa program.\nWhat is the H-2A Visa program?\nThe H-2A visa program grants temporary work visas to agricultural laborers so that they can live and work in the U.S. on behalf of a U.S. company or employer. Here is a brief overview of the process employers must undergo in order to obtain an H-2A visa:\n- Submit an agricultural work order with a State Workforce Agency (SWA)\n- Initiate recruitment of U.S. agricultural workers\n- File an H-2A application with the Chicago National Processing Center (NPC)\n- Complete the Temporary Labor Certification Process\n- The U.S. Department of Labor grants a temporary labor certificate to the employer\n- The employer then completes Form I-129 with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\nUpon approval, the employer can then offer work contracts to foreign nationals, who then use that work agreement to file for an H-2A visa.\nWho qualifies for an H-2A Visa?\nTo qualify for an H-2A visa, the term of work must be less than one year. While an H-2A visa can be extended for longer than a year, the maximum period of time a worker can stay in the U.S. on an H-2A visa is three years.\nAs seen here, the H-2A visa is only open to nationals of specific eligible countries, determined by the Department of Homeland Security. The applicant must also have a work agreement from their employer, and meet the qualifications for entry as set by Customs and Border Patrol and the Department of Homeland Security.\nAn H-2A worker may also bring their spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 to live in the U.S. Note however, family members who are eligible for an H-4 visa cannot work while in the United States.\nWhat are H-2A employee rights?\nThe Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration guarantee several rights to H-2A employees. Here is an overview of employee rights and employer obligations under the H-2A visa program:\n- Rates of pay. All H-2A workers are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and must be paid the highest of one of the following rates:\n- The Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR);\n- The applicable prevailing wage;\n- The agreed-upon collective bargaining rate; or\n- The Federal or State minimum wage.\n- While rates may be hourly or “piece” rate, a piece rate must be no less than the prevailing rate, and the total amount paid each pay period must average out to at least the highest required wage above.\n- Employees must be paid at least twice a month\n- Guarantees to all workers. All H-2A workers are entitled to the “three-fourths guarantee.” This means that every employee is guaranteed to earn at least 75% of the total amount of the contract, even if the employer does not offer sufficient work days/hours to reach that amount.\n- For example, if a worker has a 10-week contract to work 6 days a week and 8 hours a day, the contract promises them 480 hours. Therefore, the employer is required to pay them for at least 75%, or 360 hours, even if the employee actually works fewer than 360 hours over the 10 weeks.\n- Housing. If H-2A employees and other agricultural workers cannot be reasonably expected to return home at night, the employer must provide housing at no cost to the employee. Housing must meet a wide range of safety and health standards, including:\n- In rooms where workers cook, live, and sleep, a minimum of 100 square feet per person is required\n- In rooms where workers sleep, each occupant must have at least 50 square feet of floor space.\n- In camps with shared cooking facilities, one stove per 10 occupants shall be provided\n- Housing will have a safe and adequate water supply for cooking, cleaning, and bathing\n- Housing will be adequately heated, lit, kept clean, maintained, etc.\n- H-2A employee housing should be inspected by the State Workforce Agency every 36 months in order for the employer to qualify for the H-2A visa program. In non-inspection years, the employer may “self-certify” that their housing meets all the necessary standards. Each state may conduct H-2A housing inspections slightly differently or on different schedules\n- Meals. Employers must provide three meals per day at the Department of Labor-approved cost, or provide free and convenient facilities for workers to store food and prepare meals (i.e a kitchen).\n- Transportation. Employers must provide daily transportation between housing and the worksite at no cost.\n- Inbound and outbound expenses. Once the worker has completed 50% of the contract, the employer must reimburse them for reasonable costs related to transportation and subsistence necessary to emigrate to the job. Upon completion of the contract, the employer must provide or pay for transportation and subsistence for the employee to return home.\n- Equipment. Any required tools, supplies, and equipment necessary to do the work will be provided to the employee at no charge.\n- Earning records. Employers must keep accurate written records that include the number of work hours offered each day, and the number of hours actually worked by the employee. On or before each payday, the worker will be given a written earnings statement that includes:\n- Hours of work offered;\n- Hours actually worked and/or units actually produced;\n- Hourly rate and/or piece rate;\n- Total earnings; and\n- Any and all deductions from earnings.\n- Written agreements. No later than the time at which the H-2A worker applies for their visa, the worker must be given a written copy of a contract or work agreement, in a language that the employee understands. At the very least, the work agreement must include the information the employer provided to the Department of Labor, which includes:\n- The beginning and end of the contract period;\n- The location(s) of work to be performed;\n- The hours per day and days per week that they will be expected to work;\n- The crop(s) to be worked and/or each job that will be performed\n- The applicable rate(s) for each job;\n- Any and all conditions of employment, including payment for the migrant’s incoming transport expenses, housing and meals that will be provided, and any specific days where work will not be required (holidays);\n- Worker’s compensation insurance will be provided to the employee at no charge; and\n- Any allowable deductions (meals at DOL-approved rates, applicable taxes, etc.).\n- Additional protections. H-2A workers also have a broad range of protections under the law. Employers may not hold passports or immigration documents or seek payment for anything related to the costs of the H-2A visa (including immigration fees, attorney costs, application fees, etc.). Employers may not discriminate or retaliate against employees who have exercised or asserted any of their rights, including by consulting with an attorney, filing a complaint, or testifying in court.\nHow can Farmer Law help with H-2A employee rights?\nThe H-2A visa process can be complicated, and both employees and employers have to comply with a variety of laws, regulations, and standards. An immigration attorney who specializes in agriculture and migrant workers can help guide employees and employers efficiently through the process. For H-2A employees who suspect that their rights are not being respected, consulting a qualified attorney is the first step toward ensuring your rights and protecting your interests.']	['<urn:uuid:21ed7c4b-c865-48b8-9e0c-25141903c66b>', '<urn:uuid:69da8cda-4322-4e61-8e5f-2a042680b15f>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	15	72	2567
95	How does Kanban help with workflow, and prevent employee burnout?	Kanban helps organize workflow by using a board with columns representing work stages and cards for individual assignments. Work-in-progress limits ensure team members finish tasks before starting new ones, avoiding multitasking. This visual system helps prevent burnout by making workload distribution clear - managers can easily spot if someone is overloaded or underutilized. The pull system nature of Kanban means team members only start new tasks when they have capacity, focusing on quality over quantity. Daily stand-up meetings in front of the Kanban board help discuss progress and blockers, ensuring work is evenly distributed across the team.	['Agile is a set of principles that developers can follow to be more effective in developing their software. The whole thing started with a set of principles that were developed by a group of industry leaders back in 2001.\nGiven that Agile is a set of principles, it is more guidelines vs strict rules to follow. If you review the set of principles, and later the agile frameworks, the biggest take away is to focus on short iterations of work. Always focus on delivering value in each iteration. You can find the set of 12 principles of agile design here. You don’t want to get bogged down with trying to get everything right the first time. A working product is better than a perfect product in most cases.\nFor those looking to adopt agile design practices, there are frameworks to help guide you in your journey. To name a few, there is Scrum, Kanban, LeSS, and Safe.\nLeSS or Large Scale Scrum is a variation on Scrum designed to help coordinate multiple teams towards a given Goal. This could be a few teams, or this could be a thousand teams. SAFE or Scaled Agile Framework is a framework designed to be implemented at the organizational level instead of the team level.\nGiven that LeSS and SAFE are based on Scrum and Kanban, I will focus on those two frameworks. However, if you want more information about the Less and SAFE frameworks, see the links above.\nScrum is a methodology or framework for teams who want to follow agile principles. Scrum is probably the most common agile framework and is pretty structured. The most notable thing about Scrum is you have a concept of sprints. These sprints are agreed upon periods of time between 1 and 4 weeks. During each sprint, the team agrees on what work they can accomplish during that period of time. The team then works on the agreed up items for that period of time.\nThe work the team is working on is organized into a backlog. The backlog contains a prioritized list of all of the work that the team needs to do. In addition to the backlog, there is a sprint backlog which represents a list of all the work that is being worked on during the current sprint.\nThe general rule is once you have started the sprint, you don’t add anything to the sprint backlog, and you only work on the work items in the sprint backlog. This allows the team to focus on what they are doing. Since the backlog was prioritized before the sprint began, the team is always working on the highest priority items.\nThere are 3 roles on a Scrum team:\n- Product Owner\n- Scrum Master\n- Development Team Member\nThe product owner is responsible for organizing the backlog to ensure the team is always working on the most important work items. The scrum master is responsible for leading the scrum meetings, and the development team members are responsible for working on the items in the sprint backlog.\nThere are four meetings a scrum team holds that are led by the scrum master\n- Sprint Planning\n- Daily Scrum\n- Sprint Review\n- Sprint Retrospective\nThe Sprint Planning meeting is when the team plans what backlog items they will work on during the next sprint. The team estimates how much effort is required to complete those items, and tries to ensure they don’t pull in too much work that they can’t complete it in the allotted time, or too little that the complete everything long before the end of the sprint.\nThe Daily Scrum is sometimes called the daily standup meeting. In this meeting, the team gets together to give a status update. There are three main topics of conversation during these meetings:\n- What did you do since the last scrum?\n- What will you be working on next?\n- What blockers do you have?\nBlockers are things that are preventing you from getting your work done. For example, dependency on another team. These meetings are intended to be short and not waste everyone’s time. Frequently these are called standup meetings because everyone remains standing during the meeting. Buy forcing everyone to stand, you incentivize everyone to not let the meeting drag on for too long.\nIn the Sprint Review meeting is held at the end of the sprint and the team looks at what backlog items were completed and not completed. The result of the meeting is a list of probably backlog items for the next sprint, and a reorganized backlog. This sets the team up to be ready for the next sprint.\nThe last meeting in the sprint is the sprint retrospective. In the retrospective, the team looks at what worked and didn’t work on during the previous sprint. The team then commits to what can be done better during the next sprint.\nKanban is an agile framework originally inspired by Lean Manufacturing methodologies at Toyota in the 1980s. The idea behind Kanban is you treat your work similar to the way that work is completed in a factory. You have your designated work areas, and try to limit work in progress (WIP).\nThe word Kanban means signboard in Japanese. This too is a central Tennant to using kanban on your team. In manufacturing, it is more obvious what that status of something is. You can look at a car in production and see that it does not have paint, or it does not have doors. In software development things are more abstract and having a visual representation helps everyone to better understand the status of a given item.\nThe kanban board is divided into different work centers. These work centers will vary depending on your project or team. Typically you will start with the following columns on your kanban board:\n- Doing/Develop/In Progress\nBelow is a sample representation of a kanban board:\nJust like in Scrum you have a backlog that you work from. As things come up that you need to work on, you put something in the backlog column. As you work on a given item, you move it from one column to the next on the kanban board. This gives the visual representation of the work being done.\nAs mentioned, you want to limit work in progress. To do that, you put a Work in Progress or WIP limit at the top of each column. This WIP limit is the maximum number of items that can be in a given column.\nIn Kanban, you don’t have a lot of meetings, but you do have a daily standup just like in Scrum. Also just like in Scrum the focus of your standup is:\n- What did you do?\n- What are you going to do?\n- What is blocking you from getting your work done?\nOne of the main benefits of Kanban vs scrum is the lack of sprints. Since you don’t have sprints, it allows you to shift priorities more often. Remember in Scrum you are not supposed to change the sprint backlog mid-sprint. In Kanban, you just have to wait until you are not violating your WIP limit, and you can continuously reprioritize your backlog.\nThe main drawback of Kanban is that it is not as structured as scrum. Scrum is a much more detailed framework and with the set roles and meetings, it is easier to adopt in many ways. Kanban is not as structured, so it requires a bit more discipline to follow the rules.\nScrumban, as the name implies, is somewhere between Kanban and Scrum. You have all of the meetings and structure of Scrum, but with one added component, limiting Work in Progress.\nIn Scrum, you populate your sprint backlog at the beginning of the sprint, and then everyone starts working on the various backlog items. You might have 20 backlog items in this 4 week-long sprint, and your team starts all of them at once. You might not realize that something is not working until the end of week 3 at which time you don’t have time to fix things, and you have wasted your sprint.\nIf you limit your work in progress to let’s say 3 items, then you don’t start on the 4th item until the previous 3 are completed. This means that you are completing and testing backlog items earlier in the sprint. The difference now is at the end of the sprint you have a big pile of completed backlog items and possibly some non-completed ones. But 10 completed and 10 not-started backlog items are preferable to 20 half done backlog items.\nEmergent Design is an agile approach to product design. In general, it means that the development will develop new features using best practices without getting bogged down in the design process. After the feature has been implemented the team will do another iteration on that feature to better integrate it into the overall project and let the overall design emerge.\nThe goal is that you end up with a smaller code base and a better designed and understood product. The danger is you could end up with a poorly designed product that doesn’t really work. The best guard against this is to do just enough design initially. This ensures that you are following the best practices, and not trying to do something impossible. For more information on Emergent Design, you can look here\nThank you for reading this article about Agile development. Today we have talked about what is Agile development? What are some frameworks for agile development? How do the most common frameworks like Scrum and Kanban work? What are some of the benefits of Scrum vs Kanban?', 'Have you ever experienced burnout at work? The Chances are that you probably have without even knowing it.\nOccupational burnout has become such a regular occurrence in the lives of knowledge-work professionals, particularly considering today’s ever-increasing demands. Many of us aren’t even aware of how close we might be to burning out, or – worse still – we might have been in this state for a while!\nBurnouts can do serious damage to both employees and their companies in general. Stick to the end to learn more about what occupational burnout really is, what causes it, and how to avoid it yourself.\nWhat is Occupational Burnout?\nBurnout, in the context of one’s occupation, is a type of psychological stress characterized by exhaustion, lack of enthusiasm and motivation. In most cases, burnouts are accompanied by frustration and cynicism, which, in turn, lead to reduced productivity at the workplace.\nOne of the most visible signs of organizational stress is an increase in employee turnover. If employees are fearful for their positions, or feel the expectations are unrealistic, they may leave the organization rather than continue struggling.\nTurnover is a very costly process for any organization. Significant monetary costs are accrued in the process of recruiting, hiring, training, as well as general decrease in productivity.\nThe American Management Association believes the cost of finding an employee’s replacement is around 30% of that employee’s salary.\nTurnover also causes additional work and stress on other employees who have to fill in during the recruitment period, thus leading to further instances of burnout in the team.\nFor example, the burnt-out person might be that colleague who is late, for work, each morning, because he hasn’t slept well and dreads getting out of bed to head to the office; or the co-worker who stares at the computer screen for hours on end, although she never seems to focus on the task in front of them.\nThe real problem is when you have a whole team, or even an entire department of burnout people. How can you grow and reach high goals with unmotivated, and uninterested, people by your side?\nThe simple answer is: you can’t!\nThe issue will continue to develop and, as people from other departments feel the instability of their colleagues, inevitably the whole company will be negatively affected.\nWhat Causes Burnout?\nAlthough the common understanding is that burnouts are generally caused by work overload for extensive amounts of time, according to a report published by PLOS ONE there are three types of occupational burnout. Logically, each one is caused by different circumstances.\nFrenetic burnout is the stereotypical version described above, defined by workers who just have too much on their plate. These employees generally adopt a negative tone, venting about their workload.\nThis type of employee burnout, however, affects individuals who plainly feel like they aren’t getting much satisfaction out of their work. Team members experiencing this sort of burnout tend to “cognitively avoid” their work, distancing themselves from what they consider to be an unrewarding experience.\nWorn-out employees are those who struggle with the stress of the daily grind and ultimately choose to neglect their work because of those pressures.\nThe study found that 15 percent of employees in the report experienced frenetic burnout, 9 percent experienced under-challenged burnout, and 21 percent were worn-out.\nStages of Employee Burnout\nThe American psychologist Herbert Freudenberger, and his colleague Gail North theorized about occupational burnout and divided the development of the syndrome into 7 stages. Some are signs of burnout at work, while others come from personal pressures.\nCompulsion to prove oneself. In most cases, this is a result of trying to work on too many assignments simultaneously.\nWorking harder. In their desire to prove themselves to others, or try to fit in as part of an organization that does not suit them, many people establish high personal expectations and, in order to meet them, they tend to focus solely on work and take on more than they usually would.\nNeglecting daily needs. Since the individuals are already devoting all of their time to work, there is no room for anything else in life. Friends and family, eating and sleeping are no longer seen as vital aspects of life, and are just burdens which take away from the time that can be put into work.\nDisplacement of conflicts. People who reach this stage become aware that something is not right but have trouble finding the source of the problem and often start placing blame elsewhere, for example, on the team or organization.\nRevision of values. Sliding down the slope towards burnout, people’s values change. Work consumes all energy, leaving none for friends and the things they previously enjoyed. As work becomes their only focus, they become intolerant to other people’s mistakes and are never satisfied with the work of their colleagues: this often leads to internal conflicts.\nDenial of emerging problems. At some point, people affected by burnout become intolerant, aggressive, and sarcastic. They begin to ignore problems related to the project they are working on because they don’t want to deal with them and they blame it on the pressure that comes with their excessive workload.\nWithdrawal. With little or no social contact all individuals will inevitably become isolated. At that point, depression hits like a ton of bricks. The affected person disengages from team activities and communicates less with their colleagues, this inevitably leads to problems in the team dynamic.\nHow to Overcome Burnouts?\nThere is no “universal panacea” that will guarantee a remedy for ‘burnout’: however, there are a few tried-and-tested methods that might assist in its avoidance. As the condition is stress related, in order to stop it, you must find a way to reduce the sources of stress and reevaluate the way you distribute responsibilities.\nDon’t rush into starting more work than you can finish without pushing past your acceptable threshold, also avoid multitasking. This advice is followed even by the most successful entrepreneurs such as Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos and other business leaders. Mr. Bezos is also a fan of the two pizza rule when it comes to scheduling meetings, which means that Bezos won’t call or attend a meeting if two pizzas won’t feed the entire group.\nIf you cannot pinpoint the exact cause of burnout, take the time to analyze what’s going on in your life and focus on something other than work.\nA good way to escape stress is by practicing sports. A study published by the British Medical Journal shows that regular exercise helps to reduce anxiety, boost a person’s mood, enhance productivity and improve the quality of life.\nGetting enough sleep, eating well, and drinking plenty of water further reduces the stress levels of everyday life.\nTaking time off work to recharge your batteries is also a good idea. A week with family or friends, somewhere far from the office, can do miracles for your mental health. In addition, don’t be afraid to speak out when you are overloaded and seek assistance from your team.\nHow to Optimize Your Process to Avoid Employee Burnout?\nDealing with occupational burnout on a personal level is one thing, protecting your team from recurring burnouts requires even more effort. If you are in the position of a manager, and are responsible for delivering results on a daily basis, keeping your team engaged, and efficient, is vital.\nTo achieve this, and ensure that you’re not working with a bunch of potential burnouts, you should consider changing some of your management practices and experiment with methods focused on workflow visualization such as Kanban.\nKanban is a method for lean management. In short, It allows you to clearly visualize the assignments of your team, on a whiteboard, and apply limits to the amount of work in progress (WIP) available.\nSo, how to avoid burnouts at work with Kanban?\nBuild a Kanban board. Kanban boards consist of vertical columns and horizontal swimlanes. Each column represents a step in your process, while swimlanes are often used to visualize different types of assignments or different priorities.\nPrepare a board that mirrors the most important stages of your process and visualize all assignments on individual Kanban cards. It is important to mention that every card should have a single assignee responsible for processing it.\nPlace WIP limits. Make sure your team works on as few tasks at a time as possible to avoid frequent context switching so they finish what they start before pulling new work in progress.\nWIP limits can regulate the amount of work a certain team member is working on at any given time. Using WIP limits, the manager will be able to monitor the activity of his/her team closely and intervene when they see a problem.\nSet up daily team stand-up meetings. Stand-up meetings have become an integral part of Kanban culture and make it very easy to spot when something is wrong. You just need to gather your team at the beginning of each work day in front of their Kanban board and go through the items that are present.\nCommunicate progress and discuss existing as well as potential blockers to keep everybody in the loop and make sure that work is evenly distributed.\nKanban is a pull system, meaning that team members start new tasks only when they have the available capacity to process them.\nApplying this method of working means focusing on one thing in order to do it in the best possible way, instead of doing five things simultaneously and, consequently, achieving something mediocre. Simply said, quality comes before quantity.\nSome may think that this way of working might end up being slower, but, in reality, it is exactly the opposite.\nOne of the best things about using a Kanban is that every aspect of the project is visualized right in front of you, so the work can be delegated accordingly among the team members.\nWith Kanban, you can see if the colleague that is always complaining about how much work he has, is really that overloaded, or is just lazy and is trying to hide from additional assignments.\nThe same goes for the quiet person, who never complains and just takes everything that is sent her way, though she really has a full plate. By using Kanban it is very clear who is doing what and, if the distribution is not balanced, it will become immediately obvious.\nOccupational burnout is a very serious issue that must not be taken lightly by managers as well as their teams.\nOptimizing your work life is crucial for avoiding occupational burnout. Analyze your situation and consider how to prevent burning out using the techniques we have covered in this article.\nIf you are in a managerial position, and want to see if Kanban might help in protecting your team, we encourage you to test Kanbanize so you can ascertain how best to optimize your processes.']	['<urn:uuid:ffc18058-7697-4eeb-97ff-d1ba6ecc7a24>', '<urn:uuid:ba0fe8c1-95db-4973-9366-feff54bc3485>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	10	97	3434
96	healthcare professional need info urgent care centers emergency departments level iii trauma centers differences capabilities services	Urgent care centers and emergency departments serve different purposes and have distinct capabilities. Emergency departments, particularly Level III Trauma centers like TidalHealth Peninsula Regional and TidalHealth Nanticoke, can provide advanced services including resuscitation, surgery, intensive care, and stabilization of injured patients. They are open 24/7 and equipped to handle life-threatening conditions. In contrast, urgent care centers primarily treat non-life-threatening injuries or illnesses that require immediate care but aren't serious enough for an emergency room visit. Urgent care centers typically have limited hours, and while they offer services like x-rays and treatment for simple fractures, they don't provide the comprehensive emergency services available at hospital emergency departments. They emerged in the 1970s as a cost-effective alternative to emergency departments and have grown to approximately 17,000 centers nationwide.	"[""Emergency services are provided at TidalHealth Peninsula Regional in Salisbury, Md., TidalHealth Nanticoke in Seaford, Del., and at the TidalHealth McCready Health Pavilion in Crisfield, Md.\nOur 24/7 Emergency Care team serves patients around the clock, whether they come by land, sea or air. Treatment spaces are private and on-site x-ray and other diagnostics are available on site. We are ready to handle your emergencies, and to help you transfer to critical care hospitals if needed.\nTidalHealth Peninsula Regional and TidalHealth Nanticoke are both designated as Level III Trauma centers by the American College of Surgeons meaning the center can provide emergency services including resuscitation, surgery, intensive care and stabilization of injured patients. Our teams have earned an outstanding reputation for reliable and accurate emergency and trauma care when seconds count.\nSigns of an Emergency\nIf you believe you are having a health emergency, CALL 911. Every second counts during events such as stroke or heart attack.\n- Chest pain\n- Stroke symptoms:\n- Sudden dizziness, weakness\n- Sudden, severe headache\n- Sudden blurred vision\n- Numbness in face, arm or leg\n- Coughing or throwing up blood\n- Deep wound\n- Fever in newborn (less than 3 months)\n- High fever that does not get better with medicine\n- High fever with headache and stiff neck\n- Inhaled smoke or poisonous fumes\n- Major allergic reaction\n- Pain in the arm/jaw\n- Passing out/fainting\n- Persistent or heavy bleeding\n- Persistent vomiting or diarrhea\n- Poisoning or overdose of drug or alcohol\n- Possible dislocation or broken bone, especially if the bone is pushing through the skin\n- Pregnancy-related problems\n- Serious burn\n- Severe allergic reaction with trouble breathing, swelling, hives\n- Severe pain anywhere in the body\n- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n- Sudden confusion\n- Suddenly not able to speak, see, walk, or move\n- Sudden, severe abdominal pain\n- Suddenly weak or drooping on one side of the body\n- Suicidal thoughts\nWhat to Expect at the Emergency Department\nWhen you arrive at the Emergency Department, a triage nurse evaluates you and places you on a track for care depending upon severity. For higher-acuity patients (those who are likely to be admitted to the hospital), you are placed in a hospital gown, assigned to a bed and evaluation or treatment begins.\nFor lower-acuity patients (those who are not likely to be admitted to the hospital), you may not be placed in a gown or a bed, but instead moved along a path for further evaluation and treatment. This process is specifically designed for mobile patients to help them get care and be discharged in a more timely and efficient manner.\nNo matter what level of care you receive at the Emergency Department, you are continuously monitored for changes in condition or needs. You can be moved from a fast track to a higher acuity care track at any time during your stay.\nThe Emergency Care Team at TidalHealth consists of a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, technicians and support staff. Your initial triage may be done by a physician, an allied health professional such as a Physician Assistant or Nurse Practitioner, or by a specially trained emergency nurse. Radiology, laboratory, or therapy professionals may also be involved in diagnosing or providing treatment during your visit.\nIf you have any questions during your stay, please ask. We are here to make you as comfortable as possible.\nThe Maryland Sexual Assault Kit Initiative (SAKI) project is underway. If you had a sexual assault forensic exam and would like to receive updates about the testing of your kit in Maryland, you can contact a SAKI Advocate at the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault by calling the confidential SAKI information line at 833-364-0046 or by email at [email protected].\nImmediate Care / Urgent Care\nFor conditions that may not be an emergency, but you want treated urgently, you can consider an immediate care, urgent care center or walk-in clinic.

Urgent care centers are primarily used to treat patients who have an injury or illness that requires immediate care but is not serious enough to warrant a visit to an emergency room. Often urgent care centers are not open on a continuous basis, unlike a hospital emergency room that would be open at all times.\nThe initial urgent care centers opened in the 1970s. Since then this sector of the healthcare industry has rapidly expanded to an approximately 17,000 centers. Many of these centers have been started by entrepreneurial physicians who have responded to the public need for convenient access to unscheduled medical care. Other centers have been opened by hospital systems, seeking to attract patients. Much of the growth of these centers has been fueled by the significant savings that urgent care centers provide over the care in a hospital emergency department. Many managed care organizations (MCOs) now encourage their customers to utilize the urgent care option.\nOther ambulatory healthcare facilities\nUrgent care centers are distinguished from other similar types of ambulatory healthcare centers.\nEmergency departments are located within hospitals and are prepared to care for patients suffering true emergencies, such as myocardial infarctions (""heart attacks""), serious motor vehicle accidents, suicide attempts, and other such life-threatening conditions. Being located within a hospital, these centers are positioned to provide ready access to major surgeries and critical care units. Emergency departments are usually staffed by physicians with specialized training or board certification in emergency medicine. Most states in the USA require all hospitals to house an emergency department within the hospital building. A few states in the USA allow freestanding emergency departments to be built outside of a hospital building. Many authorities would consider this type of facility to be a high-acuity urgent care center, rather than a true emergency department.\nPrimary care offices with extended hours\nMany primary care offices are open for some hours in the evenings and weekends. However, unless these centers are open for walk-in patients at all times when open for patients, offer on-site x-ray facilities, and care for most simple fractures and lacerations--these primary care physician offices are not considered to be true urgent care centers.\nWalk-in primary care offices\nAllowing walk-in patients is not a sufficient criterion to define a physician office as an urgent care. If the office does not offer the expanded services and significant after-hours care, then the physician office would not fit the definition of an urgent care center.\nMid-level provider offices in retail stores\nIn 2004, medical treatment began to be offered at small offices in retail stores with onsite pharmacies. These centers are generally staffed with nurse practitioners or physician assistants. Prices are generally posted in public view and patients can do shopping while waiting. Some experts consider these medical treatment sites to be the wave of the future in light of consumer driven health plans such as Health Savings Accounts. These retail clinics are not true urgent care centers, because of the limited level of care that can be provided without a physician nor x-ray facilities on site. Concerns about conflict of interest and incentives to over-prescribe medications in a facility rented from a pharmacy have yet to be fully addressed by organized medicine or governmental agencies.\nOrganized medicine and urgent care\nThe Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA) holds an annual spring convention and, also, offers an annual fall conference. The American Academy of Urgent Care Medicine (AAUCM) and the National Association for Ambulatory Urgent Care (NAFAC) hold a joint annual convention. Many leaders in the urgent care industry now eagerly anticipate the full establishment of urgent care as a fully-recognized specialty with fellowships and/or residencies that allow for proper training in the unique patient mix and patient presentations that are seen in urgent care centers.\nCodes for urgent care\nIn recent years the American Medical Association approved the code UCM (Urgent Care Medicine) for physicians to self-designate themselves as specializing in urgent care medicine, this code was developed with the assistance of the American Academy of Urgent Care Medicine. Services rendered in an urgent care center may be designated, using the place of service code -20 (POS -20) on the CMS-1500 form, as submitted to third-party payors. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have designated two specific codes to apply to urgent care centers: S9083 (global fee for urgent care centers) and S9088 (services rendered in an urgent care center). Because of the complex nature of coding for urgent care centers, the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA) offers a specialized day-and-a-half advanced coding workshop for providers and coders as part of its annual fall conference.\nPostgraduate fellowship training\nIn 2006, the Urgent Care Association of America sponsored the first fellowship training program in urgent care medicine. This fellowship resulted from collaboration between the Department of Family Medicine University Hospitals of Cleveland / Case School of Medicine, the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA), and University Primary and Specialty Care Practices, Inc. in Cleveland, Ohio. The program is partially funded by an unrestricted grant of $30,000 from the Urgent Care Association of America to support the fellowship program. Physicians in the urgent care fellowship program receive training in the many disciplines that an urgent care physician needs to master. These disciplines include adult emergencies, pediatric emergencies, wound and injury evaluation and treatment, occupational medicine, urgent care procedures, and business aspects of the urgent care center. In 2007, the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA) sponsored a second fellowship opportunity through the University of Illinois. The one-year fellowships are open to graduates of accredited Family Medicine and Med/Peds residencies.\nUrgent care journals\nThe official publication of the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA) is the Journal of Urgent Care Medicine (JUCM). It is a monthly publication published specifically for professionals in the urgent care industry. A free subscription to JUCM is available to licensed physicians, who sign up at www.jucm.com. The American Academy of Urgent Care Medicine publishes the journal Urgent Care. The official publication of the American Academy of Urgent Care Medicine is the Urgent Care. It is a monthly publication published specifically for physicans, physician assistants and nurse practitioners in the urgent care industry. A free subscription to Urgent Care is available to licensed physicians, who sign up at [urgentcarejournal.com].\nPoint-of-care medication dispensing\nPoint-of-Care dispensing enables healthcare practitioners in the urgent care setting to ensure that their patients receive their prescription prior to leaving the clinic. To offer this service to patients, urgent care centers need to partner with a point-of-care dispensing corporation.\nOne sign that the urgent care industry is truly emerging as an important sector of the healthcare industry has been the development of supporting industries with specialized urgent care products.\nPractice management software\nSoftware developed just for urgent care has been developed.\nGroup purchasing organization\nGroup purchasing organizations, focusing on the urgent care industry, have been formed. The concept of these GPOs is that they join hundreds of urgent care centers together to allow the type of price bargaining that previously was only available to hospitals.\nMedical malpractice insurance\nMalpractice insurance offerings unique to the urgent care industry have begun to be widely discussed in light of the fact that many insurers do not recognize the reduced malpractice risk of urgent care centers. Insurers that recognize this reduced risk do not group urgent care centers with hospital emergency physicians and other high-risk specialties. Features of this type of insurance may include no charge for tail coverage when providers leave (""tail coverage"" is coverage for malpractice claims which may arise after termination of a policy), 3-5 day approval of new providers, no additional premium when providers are added to the policy, per visit FTE rating, and lower premiums.\n|This article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.

97	hmrc payment arrangements versus irs collection methods compare differences process back taxes	HMRC offers Time to Pay arrangements lasting 6-12 months to help businesses repay outstanding tax liabilities in installments, showing flexibility for businesses with reasonable prospects of financial stability. In contrast, the IRS uses more aggressive collection methods including wage garnishments, bank levies, and liens on homes to collect back taxes, with a 10-year period to collect tax debt from the time of assessment.	['Falling behind on payments to HMRC can easily occur, often a result of bad debt or unexpected expenditure having an immediate negative effect on business cash flow. In order to continue trading, essential payments such as suppliers, wages, rent and utilities are often prioritised above payments to HMRC. If not repaid quickly, this situation can easily spiral out of control and become unmanageable.\nWhat is a Time to Pay Arrangement?\nThe Time to Pay arrangement is a government initiative implemented in 2008. It was initially an attempt to combat the effects of the recession. It works by allowing struggling businesses to repay their outstanding corporation tax, PAYE/ NI or VAT liabilities in instalments, rather than in one go. Usually, Time to Pay arrangements last either 6 or 12 months. However, they may last longer if there is a realistic prospect the debt will be repaid eventually.\nWhat are the advantages of a Time to Pay Arrangement?\nHMRC liabilities will not simply disappear overnight but seeking a Time to Pay arrangement has its advantages.\n- You will be spreading out the repayment of your debt over a period of time, rather than all at once. This will improve cash flow and ensure your business has money to pay other outgoings such as rent, wages and suppliers.\n- Opting for a Time to Pay arrangement will demonstrate a willingness to repay liabilities. This helps your business remain on good terms with HMRC.\n- Proactively seeking Time to Pay will decrease the likelihood of HMRC taking enforcement action against your business.\nOur process of a Time to Pay Arrangement\n- Assess the situation\n- It is important to explore the financial situation of the business and what will be suitable for your business. If you would like some help to establish if a TTP is viable, contact us now for an initial informal chat.\n- Repayment proposal\n- We will assess your business’ finances and any correspondence with HMRC and will then devise a repayment proposal to be put forward to HMRC. Included within the proposal would be details of the circumstances surrounding your cash flow difficulties.\n- Our staff have years of experience working with HMRC and utilise the strong relationships built over time. An experienced consultant will negotiate a structured repayment plan on behalf of your business. It demonstrates to HMRC that you fully intend on repaying your debt. The proposed repayment plan will outline the suggested repayment amounts and term requested.\n- Arrangement starts\n- If HMRC accepts the proposal, the Time to Pay arrangement will commence. The Time to Pay arrangement will conclude once all repayments have been made. Additionally, any interest will have been paid and tax returns submitted.\nIs a Time to Pay arrangement right for me?\nA Time to Pay arrangement is ideal for any type of business – a sole trader, partnership or limited company. It is useful for businesses where tax arrears have accrued during a cash flow shortage. This may be as a result of a bad debt or an unexpected expenditure. As a consequence of this cash shortage, NI contributions/ VAT or PAYE arrears may have accrued with HMRC. However, if the business has reasonable prospects of returning to financial stability, HMRC will usually accept a Time to Pay proposal. It will also assist with the proposal if the submitting of tax returns have been on time and paperwork is up to date.\nWhat if HMRC refuse to accept my proposal?\nHMRC may refuse to accept a Time to Pay arrangement. Factors which could work against you could include:\n- Tax returns being late or overdue\n- The debt has not arisen due to short term financial difficulty\n- Previous arrangements not kept\n- Lack of financial information to support your request\n- Proposal considered unachievable by HMRC\nShould HMRC refuse your proposal, we will be able to discuss alternative solutions for your business. This is with the intention of turning around the business and return it to profitability.\nWhat if I’m nearing the end of a Time to Pay Arrangement and have missed some instalments?\nYour business may be approaching the end of a Time to Pay arrangement with some repayments missing. A failure to take pro-active steps is likely to result in HMRC seeking to carry out enforcement action.\nIf you have missed any of your TTP payments, it’s crucial to make contact with HMRC as soon as possible. With our help, you may be able to renegotiate an extension of the TTP. This could buy your business that extra bit of time which allows you to get your finances on the right track and maintain a strong liquidity position.\nTime to Pay Arrangements are solely for debts to HMRC. If you have debts to other creditors, or you’ve previously been in a TTP which has failed, you could benefit more from other debt-relief options.\nIf you’re looking to continue trading while paying off your debt, there are several options open to you: You can apply for a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), which allows you to stay in control of the company and continue trading while paying off your debts. Alternatively, if your business would benefit more from restructuring, you can explore administration as a solution.\nIf the company’s debt has reached such a level that it’s not possible to continue trading, you may be better off closing the company through a Creditor’s Voluntary Liquidation (CVL), selling off the assets before creditors force the company into compulsory liquidation.\nA Time to Pay Arrangement will give your business a chance to repay any missed tax liabilities such as PAYE, VAT, NI or corporation tax. If your business is genuinely viable, an arrangement could be made which enables you to pay in monthly instalments. It’s critical not to miss any payments as it could mean the arrangement breaks down.\nHow we can help\nIf you are looking to negotiate a Time to Pay Arrangement with HMRC, or are concerned about your current arrangement, we have the experience and expertise to help you through the process. We have developed strong relationships with HMRC, to put us in a great position to negotiate. If HMRC refuses to accept to terms of the TTP, we can still give advice on alternative solutions which could help salvage your business.', 'If you owe the IRS money in back taxes, you must resolve the debt to avoid having the federal agency take action against you.

98	what evidence suggests ancient activity fluid flows hillsides mars surface features	Several surface features on Mars provide evidence of past fluid flows on its hillsides. The planet exhibits gullies with various morphologies, including deeply incised ones with wide alcoves and others with small alcoves and tiny channels. These gullies often start at specific layers visible along crater walls, suggesting possible underground water sources. Additionally, there are arcuate ridges (wavy features) on crater floors that parallel the gully alcoves, resembling Earth's protalus ramparts. These features are found in Mars' mid-latitudes, where there's an ice-rich mantled unit covering the topography. While some researchers suggest gullies and arcuate ridges might result from a single process, their independent occurrence in different locations has led to ongoing debates about their formation mechanisms. Laboratory experiments have also demonstrated that similar gully features can form through the fluidization of dry material under Martian conditions.	"['Gullies and Arcuate Ridges\nThis image shows gullies and arcuate ridges in a crater in the southern hemisphere of Mars. Arcuate ridges and gullies are found together at many places on Mars, which has led some researchers to suggest that their coexistence may be a result of a single process.\nConversely, there are many locations on Mars where gullies and arcuate ridges are found alone, causing the debate about the relationship, or lack thereof, between their origins to continue. The bright regions in this image are frost, probably water frost, that is deposited and removed seasonally.\nThe arcuate ridges are the wavy features on the crater floor. They appear to parallel the alcove heads (upslope end) of the gullies. Arcuate ridges resemble protalus ramparts that are found on Earth. Protalus ramparts form at the bottom of snow-covered slopes when rock debris becomes separated from the slope face and accumulates downslope.\nThere is a mantled unit that covers the majority of the mid-latitudes of Mars that is thought to be ice-rich. This mantled unit drapes over topography and likely contains large amounts of dust, creating a dusty ""snowpack."" It is unknown how arcuate ridges form on Mars, but they are thought to be a result of mass wasting of ice-rich materials, possibly sections of the mantled unit.\nThe gullies seen in this image exhibit a range of morphologies. The large gully in the center of the image is deeply incised with a wide alcove. The gullies on the west (left) rim of the crater have small alcoves and tiny channels. Many of the channels appear to start at one of the fine layers that can be seen along this wall (see subimage, ~ 800 meters across). It is possible that water came from underground along these layers to form the gullies. The gully on the far left of the image extends all the way to the top of the slope. It is likely that the water that fed this gully came from one of the layers and then the slope experienced headward (upslope) erosion and collapse to extend the alcove to the crater rim.\nThe alternating stripes on the left side of the image are camera artifacts, not Martian features.\nImage PSP_001816_1410 was taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft on 15-Dec-2006. The complete image is centered at -38.7 degrees latitude, 194.0 degrees East longitude. The range to the target site was 253.5 km (158.4 miles). At this distance the image scale is 25.4 cm/pixel (with 1 x 1 binning) so objects ~76 cm across are resolved. The image shown here has been map-projected to 25 cm/pixel and north is up. The image was taken at a local Mars time of 03:44 PM and the scene is illuminated from the west with a solar incidence angle of 73 degrees, thus the sun was about 17 degrees above the horizon. At a solar longitude of 151.0 degrees, the season on Mars is Northern Summer.', 'In 1999, the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft sent back some extraordinary images of the surface of the Red Planet. They showed gullies that had been carved into Martian hillsides in the mid-latitudes of the planet.\nThe same sort of gullies form on Earth and here their existence is the result of water erosion. Various planetary geologists immediately suggested that a similar process must be at work on Mars. Their thinking was that some fluid must be responsible.\nThat’s an exciting idea but one that is fraught with problems. Recent evidence from Mars rovers suggest that liquid water once flowed on the surface of Mars but way back in the planet’s past. By contrast, the gullies spotted by the Global Surveyor are probably only a few million years old and over this timescale, the Martian atmosphere has been too cold and thin for liquid water.\nTo counter this, the geologists say that some other heating mechanism could cause liquid water to flow from an underground aquifer. But the gullies look to be the result of repeated flows so if this explanation is correct, there has to be a mechanism that refills the aquifers. On Earth, that mechanism is rain. On Mars, such a mechanism is patently absent.\nThere is another possibility, however. Perhaps the gullies are caused by the flow of sand and dust. Similar gullies are known to occur on dunes on Earth but only when the angle of the hillside is above some critical threshold. The trouble with Martian gullies is that most of the hillsides are not steep enough for this process to occur.\nToday, Yolanda Cedillo-Flores and Héctor Javier Durand-Manterola at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México suggest a solution to this conundrum. Their idea is that the gullies are formed when carbon dioxide in the ground sublimates, causing the sand to become fluidised.\nThis solves a number of problems. For a start, it allows the sand to flow on hillsides that are much less shallow than the critical threshold. It also explains how the gullies form by the action of repeated flows over long periods of time. Their idea is that carbon dioxide is deposited on the ground during cold periods and covered with windblown dust. The carbon dioxide then sublimates during warmer periods, causing the sand to flow downhill.\nThis theory also explains why the gullies form mainly at mid-latitudes and not at the equator or the poles. At the poles, it rarely gets warm enough to regularly heat sand-covered carbon dioxide and at the equator it is too warm for it to form. So the mid-latitudes are the best places for gullies to form.\nCedillo-Flores and Durand-Manterola attempt to seal the deal by recreate in their lab the conditions for martian gully formation by injecting air into a bed of sand. Sure enough, this process leads to the formation of martian-like gullies at angles well below the critical threshold (see picture above).\nThere are some important difference between the experimental gullies and the ones that form on Mars, such as their length. But the researchers say that this can be explained by the difference between the way air is injected into sand and the way carbon dioxide sublimates.\nBest of all, the new theory requires no special hypotheses about the Red Planet. “Our model does not require exotic conditions; only the ones found at present on Mars,” say Cedillo-Flores and Durand-Manterola.\nThat’s a convincing explanation for the formation of martian gullies. And it will be a substantial blow to those looking for evidence of liquid water on the surface of Mars (and the possibility of life it suggests).\nWater may still be present on Mars but it is looking increasingly clear that there are better places in the Solar System for astrobiologists to focus their attention.\nRef: arxiv.org/abs/1004.5417: Martian Gullies: Produced By Fluidization Of Dry Material\nIt will soon be easy for self-driving cars to hide in plain sight.

99	Is it safe to eat raw elderberries?	No, raw and unripe elderberries are possibly unsafe and might cause nausea, vomiting, or severe diarrhea. Only cooked elderberry fruit seems to be safe.	"['Arbre de Judas, Baccae, Baises de Sureau, Black-Berried Alder, Black Elder, Black Elderberry, Boor Tree, Bountry, Common Elder, Elder, Elder Berry, Elderberries, Elderberry Fruit, Ellanwood, Ellhorn, European Alder, European Black Elder, European Black Elderberry, European Elderberry, European Elder Fruit, European Elderberry, Fruit de Sureau, Grand Sureau, Hautbois, Holunderbeeren, Sabugeuiro-negro, Sambequier, Sambu, Sambuc, Sambuci Sambucus, Sambucus nigra, Sambugo, Sauco, Saúco Europeo, Schwarzer Holunder, Seuillet, Seuillon, Sureau, Sureau Européen, Sureau Noir, Sus, Suseau, Sussier.\nOverview InformationElderberry is the dark purple berry from the European elder tree. The berries are used to make medicine. Do not confuse elderberry with American Elder, Elderflower, or Dwarf Elder.\nSome people take elderberry by mouth for the common cold, ""the flu"" (influenza), and H1N1 ""swine"" flu. It is also taken by mouth for HIV/AIDS and boosting the immune system. Elderberry is also taken by mouth for sinus pain, back and leg pain (sciatica), nerve pain (neuralgia), and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).\nSome people also take elderberry by mouth for hay fever (allergic rhinitis), cancer, as a laxative for constipation, to increase urine flow, and to cause sweating. It is also used for heart disease, high cholesterol, headache, toothache, and weight loss.\nSome people apply elderberry to the inside the mouth for gum inflammation.\nElderberry fruit is also used for making wine and as a food flavoring.\nHow does it work?Elderberry might affect the immune system. Elderberry seems to have activity against viruses including the flu, and might reduce inflammation.\nUses & Effectiveness\nPossibly Effective for\n- Constipation. Drinking tea made from elderberry and other ingredients seems to increase the number of stools passed in people who are constipated.\n- ""The flu,"" also called influenza. A specific elderberry juice syrup seems to relieve flu symptoms and reduce the length of time the flu lasts when taken by mouth within 48 hours of the first symptoms. Taking elderberry lozenges within 24 hours of the first symptoms also seems to reduce flu symptoms. Relief seems to occur within 2 to 4 days of treatment for most people. Taking a product that contains elderberry juice and echinacea also seems to relieve symptoms and reduce the length of time flu lasts. It seems to work similar to the prescription drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu).\nInsufficient Evidence for\n- Heart disease. Early research shows that taking elderberry extract daily for 12 weeks does not reduce risk factors for heart disease in postmenopausal women.\n- The common cold. Early research shows that taking a specific type of elderberry extract (BerryPharma by Iprona AG) for 10 days before and up to 5 days after arriving at an overseas travel destination does not prevent colds from developing. However it does seem to shorten the duration of colds and reduce cold symptoms.\n- Gum inflammation (gingivitis). Early research shows that using a mouth rinse (HM-302 by Izun Pharmaceuticals) or mouth patches (PerioPatch by Izun Pharmaceuticals) containing elderberry, echinacea, and gotu kola prevents gingivitis from worsening. However, it doesn\'t seem to improve symptoms.\n- High cholesterol. Early research shows that taking capsules containing dried elderberry three times daily for 2 weeks does not reduce cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol.\n- Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).\n- H1N1 ""swine"" flu.\n- Hay fever.\n- Nerve pain.\n- Other conditions.\nSide Effects & SafetyElderberry fruit extract is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth for up to 12 weeks. It\'s not known if taking elderberry fruit extract is safe when used for longer periods of time.\nElderberry is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when the leaves, stems, unripe fruit, or uncooked fruit is eaten. The cooked elderberry fruit seems to be safe, but raw and unripe fruit might cause nausea, vomiting, or severe diarrhea.\nSpecial Precautions & Warnings:Children: Elderberry is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth for up to 10 days. It\'s not known if taking elderberry is safe when used for longer periods of time.\nPregnancy and breast-feeding: Not enough is known about the safety of using elderberry during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n""Autoimmune diseases"" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions: Elderberry might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of autoimmune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it\'s best to avoid using elderberry.\nBe cautious with this combination\nMedications that decrease the immune system (Immunosuppressants) interacts with ELDERBERRY\nElderberry can increase the immune system. Taking elderberry along with some medications that decrease the immune system might decrease the effectiveness of medications that decrease the immune system.<br/><br/> Some medications that decrease the immune system include azathioprine (Imuran), basiliximab (Simulect), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), daclizumab (Zenapax), muromonab-CD3 (OKT3, Orthoclone OKT3), mycophenolate (CellCept), tacrolimus (FK506, Prograf), sirolimus (Rapamune), prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone), corticosteroids (glucocorticoids), and others.\nThe following doses have been studied in scientific research:\n- For constipation: A tea made from elderberry flowers, anise fruit, fennel fruit, and senna flowers (Laboratórios Klein) mixed in 150 mL of boiling water has been taken three times daily for 5 days.\n- For the flu: One tablespoon (15 mL) of a specific elderberry juice-containing syrup (Sambucol by Nature\'s Way) has been taken four times daily for 3-5 days. Also, a specific lozenge (ViraBLOC by HerbalScience) containing 175 mg of elderberry extract has been taken four times daily for 2 days. Also, one teaspoon (5 mL) of a product containing echinacea and elderberry (Echinaforce Hot Drink by A. Vogel Bioforce AG) mixed with 150 mL of hot water has been taken five times daily for 3 days then three times daily for 7 days.\n- For the flu: One tablespoon (15 mL) of a specific elderberry juice-containing syrup (Sambucol by Nature\'s Way) has been taken twice daily for 3 days. Also, one teaspoon (5 mL) of a product containing echinacea and elderberry (Echinaforce Hot Drink by A. Vogel Bioforce AG) mixed with 150 mL of hot water has been taken five times daily for 3 days then three times daily for 7 days.\n- Azadmehr A, Ziaee A, Ghanei L, Fallah Huseini H, Hajiaghaee R, Tavakoli-Far B, Kordafshari G.

100	I enjoy both photography and ballet as hobbies - which one is more demanding on the body between shooting photos in different angles and dancing en pointe? I'm trying to decide which one to pursue more seriously.	While photography can require physical movement to capture different angles - like squatting, kneeling or bending down - ballet dancing is significantly more physically demanding and carries much higher risk of injuries. Photography mainly requires positioning yourself to get good shots, but ballet, especially dancing en pointe, puts extensive stress on feet, toes, ankles and other body parts. Ballet injuries can include stress fractures, ankle sprains, bunions, sesamoiditis, and various other conditions that can lead to chronic pain. Many professional dancers have short careers, often retiring before age 30 due to the physical toll. Photography, in contrast, primarily requires understanding technical aspects like shutter speed and lighting, without major physical risks.	['Many people find the complexities of photography to be very intimidating. It can be difficult to determine where to find reliable photography advice. In the following article, you are going to learn things about photography that you never knew existed.\nMake sure you know exactly what is going into each photograph. A good picture should be like a small window showing a certain aspect of your subject. Do not try to show too much. To move beyond the small focus of just one picture, try taking a series of photos on the same subject. This is better than one overly general photo.\nPhysically move closer to the subject in order to get a better picture. Getting up close allows you to put a frame around your subject while avoiding any disruptive backgrounds. If you are shooting a person, getting closer also allows to capture their facial expressions with greater clarity. By being too far away from your subject, you often miss the minuscule details that can make a picture truly great.\nKeep settings for your camera simple. Take your time and master one part of the control, like the shutter speed or aperture, before you move on to the next. This allows you to experiment with the setting in different ways, and helps you get good shots without fiddling over a bunch of settings while your subject gets bored and leaves.\nTry out new things; experiment, and don’t be afraid in taking new and original pictures. A creative picture should showcase your own style and allow viewers to see the world in a certain way. Create unique photos that people have not seen many times before. Using your creative skills, try using some fresh angles.\nA slightly blurred background is better for shots of people. If the background is too crisp or clear, viewers may get distracted by it or be unsure of which part of your photograph to pay the most attention to. The easiest way to do this is to increase the distance between subject and background.\nIt is important to give your photos depth when capturing landscapes. Create a good sense of scale with the use of a recognized object in your foreground. Giving sharp focus to your photos can be as simple as changing your settings. Apertures less than f/8 for digital cameras, and f/16 for full framed SLR cameras, will give you the image you really want.\nPhotography is one of the most exciting and creatively stimulating hobbies one can do. Make sure to always keep it exciting, and don’t ever let it overwhelm you. A picture is a way of recalling a certain situation or emotion. If taking pictures is fun, you’ll be more excited to learn new skills.\nDespite the general view that sun-filled days make for good pictures, the reality is that a sunlit day can make for bad pictures The sunlight often creates shadows and glare; also, the bright light causes many people immediately squint as they are photographed. Whenever you possibly can, try taking your outdoor shots in the morning or the evening when the sun is lower and casts less light.\nTake shots from a wide variety of angles to catch different perspectives. Depending on the impression you want to convey, try shooting your subject from different sides or from above and below.\nWhile many photographers prefer to emphasize landscapes from a distance, viewers often focus on the foreground instead. Focusing first and foremost on the foreground of a landscape shot will help you to produce a more striking photograph with greater depth.\nThroughout life, it has been ingrained in our minds to have things symmetrical. Though the pursuit of perfection maybe a noble one, it is not needed in the realm of photography. Capture a more interesting picture by having your subject be off to the side of the frame. Turn off the auto-focus, which will make the lens zero in on whatever it is pointing at. Focus your camera manually, then lock it before taking the picture.\nTake the time to appreciate the little things when photographing on vacation. While they may not seem that important at the time, when you get home and start to reflect on your trip, having these smaller memories will be great. Consider photographing things like signs on the street, odd storefronts, tickets to a museum or the food sold by street vendors.\nWhen you go travelling, look around for new ideas on all the different things you can shoot. To get some good ideas on where to begin, head on over to the closest postcard rack. The post cards that you will see will point you to some great photographic scenery that would add to your photo collection.\nYou will have a better picture if your subject is off-center a little. Pre-focus your camera, and move a little to one side. This can cause the photo to look a bit different than the standard subject centering tactic that many use. Try to off-center your shots so that they are more enticing to the viewers.\nThe lighting will have a huge effect on the outcome of your photos. When taking outside photos, try to pick a time of day when the sun is low in the sky: either early morning or late afternoon. Strong natural light casts long shadows and causes the people you are photographing to squint. If you must shoot in direct sunlight, at least stand to the side and allow the sun to light from an angle.\nExperiment with different perspectives and scales in your images. An otherwise ordinary subject can appear quite artful if placed in an environment where it appears drastically disproportionate in size or humorously out of place. Develop your compositions in order to create a unique outlook on a common object.\nYou might be looking for a dramatic photo where your subjects are covered with raindrops following a storm. Create the effect yourself by carrying along your own spray bottle and gently misting some “rain” on the subject that you need to photograph.\nYou can improve your photography by framing your shots. Try to use natural frames in the pictures you take. Look really closely at the subject of your shot. Are there any elements around it that can be used to create a frame to enhance it? This is an ideal method to use when you want to practice getting a photo’s composition right.\nPatterns have a natural ability to draw people’s attention. Repeating patterns in a photo’s background attract the viewer’s eye and draw his attention to your photograph. In addition, patterns can be used as backdrops and unique perspectives for framing your subject.\nYou should always have an idea as to if you want to use highlights or shadow exposure in your pictures. However, you can also choose to take multiple pictures, and have some of the pictures expose the subject’s highlights and shadows, and not expose them in others. You can then blend them, using software such as Photoshop.\nTry taking photos at different angles to make them more creative. Anyone can look at a simple head-on photo and take a picture of it. For example, you can change the angle by standing above your subject and looking down. Try taking a picture in a sideways angle, or diagonal to make the subject more interesting.\nYou should be aware of the sharpness of your frame of view at all times. Sharpness affects the crispness of your photographs. The image will soften as it stretches towards the edge of the frame established by your lens.\nPlay around with editing your images. There are a ton of photo editing programs available. A feature-rich editing program offers an almost limitless number of ways to modify your photographs. Locate that program that is simple to master for your own needs.\nUse shutter speeds creatively. It is normal to use the quickest shutter speed if you want to freeze action. In the same way, try to consider the things you can do with slower shutters speeds like 1/30. Find a moving object passing by, such as a bicycle. This will make it so that the cyclist himself is pretty sharp, but the background is blurred, which gives a visual clue that he is moving.\nYou can make anything look interesting by adjusting your camera’s settings, using a different kind of lighting or even by just changing the shot angle. Try playing with the settings before you go and take the shot, you will then know how it will differ.\nThe brand of the film you use should be considered when using film cameras. Nearly every photo artist has an opinion on which brand of film works best. There is actually no big advantage of one film brand over another. It is all up to you.\nTaking pictures of natural settings should be done carefully. Take a few minutes to enjoy the scene, and make sure you do not leave any traces of your presence. Don’t clutter up an untouched spot where you took your photographs. Instead, leave it perfect for the next artist.\nSquat, kneel, or bend down so that your camera is level with the child’s eyes. This allows you to get the child’s whole face into the photograph. It is an easy fix that will make a big difference in your portrait quality.\nYour camera can be a fantastic way to get beautiful shots if used correctly. You can blur backgrounds out to focus attention on the photo subject by applying a shallower depth of field.\nDon’t fall into the habit of taking all of your photographs with the camera in its standard horizontal position. You can get some fabulous images when you manipulate the position of the camera in order to take advantage of vertical shots. Use the zoom feature, as needed, to get full effects of an up-close shot. Conversely, zoom out if you desire to get head-to-toe shots of people.\nSpend time putting your subject in different poses. If you find your family photos aren’t turning out very well, it could be because you have too many candid shots. This increases the odds that more of your subjects will look good in your photographs.\nBe aware of when it’s appropriate to use, or not use, your camera’s flash. There’s more to using a flash than just turning it on and leaving it on. If you use too much light, you may wash out the subject and spoil the picture. Photos taken in areas with dim lighting do require the use of a flash.\nMake sure you use optical zoom rather than digital zoom if you want to take close-up shots. Your camera will let you zoom in on the subject; however, you’ll experience poorer quality when the zoom is switched from optical to digital zoom. Pixels are interpolated with digital zoom modes and cuts the image quality greatly. If it is possible to disable this zoom feature, ensure that you do. Your manual should give directions for this.\nMaintain the balance in every picture. A simple way to make your photographs appear worthy for an art gallery is to make sure all the elements are balanced in each individual image. By insuring your horizon is level and all the other elements in your photo make sense, you can ensure your picture has that special “wow factor.”\nBefore you click the shutter, think about the purpose of your shot. Sometimes it is better to shoot a picture horizontally and other times vertically. Sometimes, you can edit this and change it after the fact, but it will always be easier if you just shoot the photo the right way to begin with.\nYou need to make you consider how to hold the camera properly. This is key because without the right holding procedures, you’re not getting the best image possible. Hold a stable position with your arms against your body and your weaker hand holding the lens.\nAs you’ve read, many people struggle to learn photography. Though, as they accumulate knowledge on the subject, the begin to understand its appeal. Use the guidelines this article has given to you, use your camera and start taking photos.\nPhotography is a complex art which takes time and patience to learn, and it is not mastered overnight. A shot does not wait for you to get prepared or make itself ready just because you are prepared. It’s there when it’s there. Trying to artificially force a good shot will only lead to blurry and disappointing pictures.', 'Ballet dancing has been a popular art form for centuries, and for those who have never danced, it has tremendous appeal as either a hobby or a potential vocation.\nChildren—especially girls—are often fascinated by the apparently effortless grace with which dancers move, and by the colorful, intricate costumes they sometimes wear.\nBut ballet has a darker side, and the placid expressions worn by dancers often mask terrible pain caused by ballet injuries.\nThe careers of professional dancers are often short; before they turn 30, most of them retire from dancing, either to teach or to pursue some other, unrelated occupation.\nThe purpose of this article is not to discourage children or their parents from considering ballet lessons, or even to discourage anyone from pursuing ballet as a career; rather, our purpose here is to make the reader aware of the risks that ballet injuries can pose to their future well being.\nTypes of Ballet Injuries That Can Happen\nMany of the various injuries dancers can suffer are not severe, and pose no serious threat to the dancer’s future as a performer, or to his or her ability to participate in other sports or to walk with a normal gait.\nOther types of ballet injuries, however, can be cause for concern. As you read about the various types of ballet injuries, feel free to click on any of the related links to read more about them.\nInjuries and conditions that can be caused by ballet include:\n- Bunion or hallux valgus (sometimes at an unusually young age)\n- Ankle sprains (particularly later ankle sprains)\n- Stress fractures brought on by small, repetitive impacts over the course of time\n- Trigger toe\n- Shin splints\nDancer’s Fracture is the most common acute fracture suffered by dancers. It strikes the fifth metatarsal, the bone that lies along the outer edge of the foot. It usually happens when a dancer jumps and lands badly, coming down on an inverted (turned-in) foot. As the name “dancer’s fracture” suggests, this is a common ballet injury.\nSesamoiditis: When a dancer is on demi-pointe, her weight rests on the sesamoid bones, which lie just behind the big toe. Regular application of this kind of stress can cause gradual onset of sesamoiditis, and the dancer will experience pain when bending or straightening the big toe.\nPlantar fasciitis: This is an inflammation of the plantar fascia, a band of tissue running along the bottom of the foot from heel to toes. The injury is related to overuse.\nAnkle Impingement: Many variations of this condition exist, but the one that concerns us here is posterior ankle impingement syndrome, also known as os trigonum syndrome, and commonly referred to as “dancer’s heel.” This happens when soft tissue becomes trapped and pinched by bones, which causes painful spurs to form.\nAchilles Tendonitis: This condition can be brought on by dancing on a floor that is not properly “sprung,” or in other words is too hard. Overtraining can also cause Achilles tendonitis, especially hard training in a short time after a period of inactivity.\nCuboid Syndrome: Repetitive movement (such as one does when training) or sprains (another common ballet injury) can cause cuboid syndrome, a painful misalignment of the cuboid bone on the outer edge of the mid foot.\nMetatarsalgia: This condition generally manifests itself as pain in the ball of the foot, and in dancers it is often brought on by years of overwork and by forcing the foot into extreme positions, leading to instability in the joints of the toes.\nWhat Causes Ballet Injuries?\nThe particular causes of particular ballet injuries vary, of course, depending on the movement being performed. There are, however, certain techniques and types of footwear used in ballet that are particularly dangerous.\nPointe Technique: Dancing en pointe puts a great deal of stress on various parts of the foot and toes. Poor technique or poorly fitted shoes can make matters worse and increase the chances of injury.\nAlthough dancers who practice this technique wear shoes designed for it, dancing en pointe still causes friction between the toes and the shoes themselves, which can cause chaffing and blistering. En pointe dancing is the culprit in many cases of bunions, hammertoes, sesamoiditis, bursitis, trigger toe, and stress fractures.\nWhat Long-Term Complications Can Result from Ballet Injuries?\nThe long-term complications associated with ballet injuries are as varied as the injuries themselves, but the outlook for such injuries if they are not treated usually involves chronic pain and possibly antalgic gait (or in layman’s terms, a limp).\nHow You Can Prevent Ballet Injuries\nBallet injuries can be prevented by making sure that you are wearing properly fitted shoes, especially if you are dancing en pointe.\nThere are professionals you can see who know how to fit you properly for pointe shoes; ask your ballet instructor how to find one. Once you have your shoes, take proper care of them.\nDancers should not try dancing en pointe before the age of 11 or 12. By doing so, they can risk growth-plate injuries, and the bones of their feet may develop improperly.\nIndeed, no dancer should ever attempt a feat that he or she is not ready for. As in sports, proper training in dancing is crucial to injury prevention.\n- Ensure proper nutrition.\n- If you increase your training schedule, take it slowly; don’t suddenly go from once a week to every day.\n- If you spend most of one workout en pointe or demi-pointe, focus your next workout on something else.\n- Avoid dancing on hard surfaces.\n- Avoid dancing on uneven surfaces.\n- If you are in pain, STOP!']	['<urn:uuid:78cc9332-70f3-4c07-affe-897741ec20fc>', '<urn:uuid:4aea92b0-3025-42b6-847a-19af540fd1e8>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T17:05:38.272100	37	111	3028
