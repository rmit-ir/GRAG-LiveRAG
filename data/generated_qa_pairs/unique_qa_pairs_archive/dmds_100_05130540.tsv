1	As a nutrition coach, I'm curious about healthy fats for young athletes - why are they important?	Healthy fats are important because they help the brain function well, which is crucial for athletes both in school and on the court. Athletes should focus on mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fats, such as olive oil, nuts and avocado, rather than saturated fats and trans fats found in shelf-stable packaged foods, fried foods, whole dairy foods or high-fat meats.	['Snacks done right can fuel your child’s brain, body and athletic performance. Are you making the right choices for your young athlete?\nBy Jill Castle\nIn a world where food is plenty, and there are plenty of rules about food, the question of what’s the best snack is always top of mind for parents. As well it should be—getting snacks wrong can be a problem for health, growth and athletic performance.\nLook at the statistics—23 percent of calories eaten by U.S. kids come from snacks, and some of these are providing high amounts of sugar and saturated fat, according to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. When it comes to the young athlete, snacking healthfully isn’t a given.\nOne study showed that although young athletes have a better intake of fruits, vegetables and whole grains, they also eat excessive amounts of junk food and sweets. In other words, they err on the side of too much snacking, and on the wrong foods.\nSnacking isn’t bad. In fact, snacks can be very useful for the young athlete if done right. Snacks help athletes get the variety of nutrients they need each day and help their brain and body be adequately fueled for training and competition. A dual benefit!\nSo, which snacks with benefits should athletes be eating?\nSnacks made with real food: Sticking to mostly real food (food you can identify, from the ground up) covers all the high points: nutrient-rich food, satisfaction after eating, stocked with ingredients that encourage health and growth, and missing the additions that can cause problems: too much sugar, unhealthy fat, and additives like food dyes and flavors.\nExamples: apples, nuts, edamame, carrots, oatmeal, milk\nSnacks containing protein: Protein is a key nutrient for the development, growth and repair of muscles. It also does a good job of keeping the tummy satisfied after eating. You don’t have to load up on protein—most kids eat enough in their regular diet without making extra additions. But, if you want to reap the benefits of protein timing is key. Athletes should try to eat protein with snacks, and especially after lengthy exercise (longer than an hour) to help repair muscle tissue.\nExamples: hard-boiled eggs, cheese stick or square, deli meat, beef or turkey jerky, Greek yogurt\nSnacks containing fiber: Fiber also has the benefit of contributing to the sensation of fullness after eating. Translated: this means you feel fuller longer and avoid the trappings of overeating. Fiber also helps promote regular bathroom visits. Make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids.\nExamples: Triscuit crackers, a cup of black bean soup, baked sweet potato, Wheaties cereal, celery stick\nSnacks containing complex carbohydrate: All athletes need a steady supply of carbohydrate throughout the day – it is the energy source upon which muscles rely. But it’s the complex ones athletes should focus on, rather than the simple or refined versions like sugar, desserts, candy and other sweets. Complex sources of carbohydrate food sources should appear at most meals and snacks.\nExamples: cubed cantaloupe, sliced apple, pasta salad, whole grain bagel, pretzels, baked potato\nSnacks containing vitamins and minerals: Vitamins and minerals help the body process food, so it’s important to make sure food choices contain a variety of these. If you’re eating mostly real food, it won’t be a problem getting vitamins and minerals in your diet. But, if your snacking focuses on candy, cookies, chips or fried foods, you could be cutting yourself short on these important nutrients.\nExamples: vegetables, fruit, grains, dairy products, fats and lean meat\nSnacks containing healthy fats: Healthy fats have many different health functions, but for the young athlete they help the brain function well, which is important for school and on the court. However, the diet of kids and athletes tends to be too high in the wrong kinds of fats—saturated fats and trans fats. This is partly due to eating shelf-stable packaged foods, fried foods, whole dairy foods or high fat meats (ie, skin on chicken). Stick with healthy fats—mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fats such as olive oil, nuts and avocado—to get the most benefits for your body and brain.\nIt’s hard to go wrong when you focus on the nutrients your child’s body needs. Combine any of these snack benefits to create a healthy, nutritious and delicious snack that will fuel your child’s brain, body and athletic performance.\nJill Castle, MS, RDN is a childhood nutrition expert and co-author of Fearless Feeding: How to Raise Healthy Eaters from High Chair to High School.

2	massive stroke recovery time how long does it take to recover from severe stroke	While doctors cannot provide an accurate prognosis for all patients, massive stroke recovery can take multiple years. Although some specialists claim recovery plateaus after 1-2 years, improvements can continue up to 5 years later. Long-term rehabilitation is the best-known way to recover.	['A massive stroke is a significant medical event that affects the brain. It can be fatal or lead to significant secondary effects such as coma or paralysis. While the prognosis can be grim, there is hope for massive stroke recovery.\nThis post will explain the potential secondary effects of a massive stroke and steps you can take for rehabilitation. The journey may be long, but with the right approach, many massive stroke survivors can recover.\nUse the links below to jump straight to any section:\n- What Is a Massive Stroke?\n- Massive Stroke Recovery Prognosis\n- How the Brain Recovers After a Stroke\n- Potential Secondary Effects of Massive Stroke\n- Methods for Massive Stroke Recovery\n- Understanding Massive Stroke\nWhat Is a Massive Stroke?\nA stroke occurs when the supply of blood in the brain is compromised. When blood flow in the brain is interrupted by a clot, it’s called an ischemic stroke. When an artery in the brain bursts, causing uncontrollable bleeding, it’s called a hemorrhagic stroke.\nWhen the brain does not receive enough blood supply, brain tissue damage can occur. After a massive stroke, many areas of the brain can be substantially affected or die. While you cannot revive dead brain cells, the healthy areas of the brain can step in to pick up some slack.\nBefore we dig into that process, it helps to understand the prognosis for a massive stroke.\nMassive Stroke Recovery Prognosis\nMedical experts often use the NIH Stroke Scale to determine the severity of a stroke. Patients that score between 21 and 42 (the highest possible score) are considered to have suffered a massive stroke.\nWhen asking your medical team what to expect after a massive stroke, they may use your score to provide a rough prognosis. However, every stroke is different and every recovery will be different. This makes it almost impossible for doctors to provide an accurate prognosis for all patients who suffer a massive stroke.\nTherefore, it’s important to follow through with rehabilitation to see what type of recovery is achievable. While one specialist may claim that recovery plateaus after 1-2 years, you might prove that you can see gains up to 5 years later.\nIn order to get the most from rehabilitation, it helps to understand how the brain recovers from damage like a massive stroke.\nHow the Brain Recovers After a Stroke\nMassive stroke recovery revolves around healing the brain to restore function in the body. Fortunately, the brain has an innate ability to heal itself after injury, even large injuries like a massive stroke.\nThrough the phenomenon of neuroplasticity, healthy areas of the brain can take over the functions damaged by stroke. While the recovery process takes time and hard work, there is hope for recovery.\nNeuroplasticity occurs based on experience. Whatever you are repeatedly exposed to, or whatever you repeatedly practice, are the skills that your brain becomes more efficient with.\nThis is why stroke survivors often start rehabilitation before they are even discharged from the hospital. The medical team needs to expose the brain to therapeutic experiences to get the recovery process started as soon as possible.\nAfter discharge from the hospital and inpatient therapy, stroke survivors can maximize recovery from a massive stroke by continuing rehabilitation at home. It often takes years to recover from the effects of a massive stroke, but long-term rehabilitation is the best-known way to recover.\nUp next, you’ll discover what side effects commonly occur after a massive stroke. Then, you’ll learn over a dozen rehabilitation methods you can use to keep recovery going.\nPotential Secondary Effects of Massive Stroke\nThe location of the stroke has a substantial impact on the side effects experienced. For example, a left-hemisphere stroke is more likely to lead to language difficulties than a right-hemisphere stroke; because the language center of the brain resides in the left hemisphere.\nTalk to your neurologist to understand where your stroke occurred. This will help you better understand what to expect after a massive stroke.\nHere are the most common side effects of a massive stroke:\n- Post-stroke paralysis. Loss of motor function is one of the most common stroke side effects. For a mild stroke survivor, the motor loss might manifest as weakness on the affected side (hemiparesis). For a massive stroke survivor, motor loss could mean paralysis on the affected side (hemiplegia).\n- Coma after stroke. Falling into coma after stroke is more common after a massive stroke or brain stem stroke. It’s possible that someone in a coma can still hear you, so talk to your loved one and speak words of encouragement.\n- Severe speech difficulties. Difficulty with speech after a stroke is a condition called aphasia. Sometimes, it makes speech more difficult, and in some cases, massive stroke survivors cannot talk at all. But remember: there is hope for recovery.\n- Difficulty swallowing. A condition called dysphagia can make it difficult for stroke survivors to swallow. They may require a feeding tube while in the hospital until swallowing abilities are regained.\n- Difficulty breathing. Some massive stroke patients cannot breath on their own and require a ventilator. These patients require intensive care in a long-term acute hospital.\n- Cognitive difficulties. Sometimes a stroke can impair a person’s critical thinking or memory skills. Generally speaking, a severe stroke may lead to more severe cognitive difficulties.\n- One sided neglect. A condition called hemineglect can make it hard for a stroke patient to notice things in the environment on their affected side. They may eat only half of their plate because they do not recognize that there’s food on the other half.\n- Sensory loss. If the areas of the brain that contribute to sensory loss are compromised, it can lead to sensory disorders after stroke. A common example is numbness after stroke. It can also include tingling sensations, difficulty feeling hot/cold, and more.\n- Vision problems. Vision is also processed by the brain. If the visual cortex has been damaged, it can cause vision problems like partial blindness.\n- Spasticity and contractures. Spasticity is characterized by muscle stiffness that occurs when a stroke interferes with the signals sent between the brain and body. When spasticity is severe, it can result in contractures where the joints become extremely stiff (as seen with clenched hands after stroke).\nThis is not a complete list because some massive strokes will differ from others. However, these are the most common side effects reported.\nNext, we’ll discuss methods for recovery.\nMethods for Massive Stroke Recovery\nStroke rehabilitation focuses on harnessing the brain’s natural ability to heal itself after injury by exposing the brain to therapeutic experiences. The best results occur when rehabilitation is pursued consistently and long-term.\nWith that said, here are the best rehabilitation methods for massive stroke survivors:\n1. Range of motion exercises\nAfter a massive stroke, it’s important to keep the limbs moving and stretch them with ROM exercises. This will help prevent spasticity from worsening and help prevent bedsores.\n2. Physical therapy exercises\nIf you ask your doctor what to expect after a massive stroke, they will often mention physical therapy. It’s a critical component for recovering movement after a massive stroke.\nYour physical therapist will help guide you through therapeutic exercises that will help retrain the brain to control your muscles. After discharge from inpatient therapy, it’s important to continue with PT at home.\n3. Passive exercise\nIf you struggle with paralysis after a massive stroke, then physical therapy exercises might not be accessible on your own yet. Fortunately, you can start with passive exercise. This is the starting point for many patients during massive stroke recovery.\nPassive exercise involves moving your body parts without exerting effort. For example, you can move your affected arm with your non-affected arm. Although you aren’t “doing it yourself,” this movement still helps spark neuroplasticity.\n4. Electrical stimulation\nMassive stroke survivors that struggle with paralysis can greatly benefit from electrical stimulation. When electrical currents are applied to the affected muscles, it supplies the brain with a large amount of stimulation. This helps spark the rewiring process. When electrical stimulation is paired with physical therapy exercises, it’s even more effective.\n5. Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy\nConstraint-induced movement therapy can help when arm paralysis occurs after a massive stroke. It involves restricting the non-affected arm while forcing use of the affected arm. This type of rehabilitation therapy is difficult, which can be frustrating for the patient, but it’s clinically proven to be effective.\n6. Mirror therapy\nWhen you ask your medical team what to expect after a massive stroke, and you suffer from hand paralysis, they will likely suggest participating in mirror therapy.\nMirror therapy can help patients recover hand paralysis by tricking the brain into thinking you’re moving your affected hand. It’s likely that your inpatient rehabilitation center will use this therapy, as it’s growing in popularity due to its effectiveness.\n7. Mental practice\nAnother great way to spark neuroplasticity is by visualizing your affected limbs moving. In the stroke rehabilitation field, this is referred to as mental practice or motor imagery. Best of all, it’s clinically proven to help improve motor deficits after stroke.\nIt can be tempting to skip simple rehabilitation techniques like mental practice because of its simplicity. Don’t underestimate it, though. During massive stroke recovery, multiple approaches to rehabilitation can help boost results.\n8. Botox (for motor improvement)\nMassive stroke survivors that struggle with severe spasticity may benefit from botox injections. This drug helps temporarily reduce spasticity. Although the results are temporary, patients can use the improved mobility to practice rehab exercises. That will address the root cause of the spasticity, leading to long-term results.\nElectroacupuncture is a treatment that combines electrical stimulation with acupuncture. When combined with physical therapy, it has been found to help improve spasticity in patients during massive stroke recovery.\nAlternative treatments are making their way into the stroke rehabilitation field. Don’t be surprised if you ask your therapist what to expect after a massive stroke and they mention some form of electrical stimulation.\n10. Speech therapy\nIf you have some ability to speak, but you need help improving your speech and cognitive abilities, then speech therapy can help. Working with the experts (Speech-Language Pathologists) can also help you regain the ability to swallow, too.\nThere can be a great need for speech therapy during massive stroke recovery. Many patients will receive help from an SLP for several months after stroke, and then need to continue with therapy at home to continue rehabilitation. Apps like the CT Speech & Cognitive Therapy App can help with this.\n11. Singing therapy\nIf a stroke patient cannot talk at all, they might be able to sing their words. That’s because singing is controlled by the right hemisphere while talking is a left hemispheric function. Singing therapy takes hard work, but it provides hope for getting your voice back.\n12. Sensory reeducation\nIf you struggle with changes in sensation after massive stroke, like numbness or tingling, then sensory reeducation exercises can help. They retrain the brain how to process sensory input, which may help improve sensory issues like numbness.\n13. Vision restoration therapy\nVision restoration therapy can help improve vision problems in some stroke survivors. These programs utilize eye exercises to help retrain the brain how to process visual input.\nUnderstanding Massive Stroke\nA massive stroke is a significant medical event that can alter major abilities, such as movement and communication. Although the side effects can be severe, the brain is capable of recovering from the damage through therapy.\nPatients who survive a massive stroke should participate in rigorous rehabilitation programs to recover as much movement as possible. Other therapies recommended by the medical team, such as speech therapy, should also be pursued.\nThe road to recovery will look different for each massive stroke survivor. Patients can find hope in neuroplasticity: the brain’s innate ability to rewire itself and bounce back from injury.']	['<urn:uuid:7301a0cf-dc16-4699-badc-f4ad47b7a733>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	14	42	1987
3	shoulder muscle imbalance preventative approaches monitoring	Muscle imbalances in wheelchair users occur when anterior muscles become tight while upper back muscles weaken. Prevention involves push-pull exercise routines and muscular endurance training. Modern monitoring methods include motion lab analysis, ultrasound imaging, and wearable sensors that track biomechanical load in real-life conditions.	['Proper muscle balance is essential in order to prevent injuries and to enhance athletic performance. Common sport-related injuries such as rotator cuff tendonitis or bicepital tendonitis are due to overuse/improper muscular balance. These injuries are common in certain sports, but are also common to the everyday wheelchair user.\nA high percentage of athletes in throwing sports (baseball, shot put, discus, etc.) and other sports such as wheelchair track, swimming, and paddling report shoulder pain and/or injury and some studies estimate that up to 75% of manual wheelchair users will develop shoulder pain during their lifetime. The impact of a shoulder injury can be devastating for both the athlete and the wheelchair user impacting performance, functional mobility, and independence.\nRotator cuff tears, degenerative changes, and other pathologies about the coracroacromial arch are commonly found in wheelchair users with symptomatic shoulder pain. These degenerative changes occur from repeated microtraumas when the joint space between the humeral head (upper arm) and the acromioclavicular (A/C) shelf decreases to the point where repeated contact occurs on the same area on the supraspinatus tendon. The position and the repetitive loading of the shoulder joint with use in sports and for propulsion most likely contribute to these changes.\nMuscle Imbalances: Most rotator cuff injuries are due to muscle imbalances of the shoulder. Shoulder strength and muscular length/ROM imbalance can cause impingement of the soft tissue structures of the acromiohumeral space. Wheelchair users are even more susceptible to muscle imbalances. Nearly every motion and all repetitive motions are anterior working the pecs, shoulder internal rotators, anterior deltoid, etc. These anterior muscles become tight and shortened while the upper back muscles become weak and elongated. You can see these imbalances in the postures of chronic wheelchair users. A typical posture is rounded shoulders with mild thoracic kyphosis and forward head. This posture is even more accentuated by non-supportive wheelchair back that is stretched out accommodating this poor posture.\nPreventative Strategies through Strength Training\nIt is important that athletes and wheelchair users perform stretches to the anterior musculature while strengthening the upper back, posterior shoulder, and scapular muscles.It is not uncommon for athletes to skip these muscle groups in favor of spending more time on strengthening the prime-movers specific to one’s sport or general fitness exercise. These include bench press and bicep curls.Performing exercises on the stomach or by being flexed forward in a wheelchair so that one can work the upper/lower trapezius, posterior deltoid, and rhomboids. A focus should also be on the external rotators of the shoulder. By restoring muscle balance, the acromiohumeral space can be preserved minimizing the pressure on the rotator cuff.\nThe upper trunk and shoulder girdle are the foundation of the upper extremities. With a solid foundation from which to move off of, the upper extremity (shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand) will show greater power, endurance, and efficiency as well as having a reduced chance of injury.\nOrder of Exercises\nOne strategy to promote muscular balance is the push-pull routine. After performing the bench press, follow up with compound rowing. By working the agonist and then by turning around and working the antagonist (the opposite muscle group(s)), you are assured not to overwork one muscle group and will increase strength in all of the movements possible at a joint.\nExercise Program Design\nWith use of the appropriate training load, the number of sets and repetitions govern the goal and outcome of the exercise program. Sets and repetitions can be set up for muscular endurance, muscular strength, and muscular power routines. Core muscles such as the scapular and pelvic girdle musculature are best trained via a muscular endurance routine. Other muscle groups can follow any of the above mentioned routines based on specific goals and activities required for sport or activities of daily living. Below is a table with general recommendations for the three routines.\nThe consequences of shoulder injury to the athlete and the wheelchair user can be devastating. Preventative measures can greatly assist in minimizing overuse injuries to the shoulder maintaining independence and enhancing performance.', 'Shoulder Health and Mobility\nDue to their upper extremity dependency in daily life, the mechanical loading on the shoulder in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) is frequent and high. This increases the risk of tissue overload and shoulder complaints, thereby affecting functioning, participation and quality of life. This is confirmed by results from the Swiss Spinal Cord Injury Cohort Study (SwiSCI).\nDue to its anatomical structure, the human shoulder enables a large range of motion while joint stability is mainly controlled by muscles, rendering the upper extremity vulnerable to complaints.\nIn order to diminish the shoulder complaints, we aim our research at:\n- studying underlying mechanisms of shoulder load, in our movement laboratory,\n- quantifying and relating load, capacity and tissue change,\n- development of methods in monitoring shoulder load in daily conditions.\nBased on increased insight in the relation of load, capacity and tissue change, injury prevention programs can be optimized, in an open and bilateral discussion with clinical experts.\nWe currently have a strong national and international collaboration with the Swiss Paraplegic Centre, the Vrije University in Amsterdam, University Medical Center in Groningen and are continuously expanding this collaboration with other research groups, clinical disciplines and the SCI population for their valuable input.\nWith these combined efforts we work towards a quality management system for upper extremity functioning, aiming at long-term preservation of shoulder health in SCI individuals.\nExamples of projects in relation to shoulder health:\n- Handcycling versus handrim wheelchair (completed project)\n- Muscle fatigue induced by wheelchair propulsion (current project)\n- Wearables & big data (future project)\nHandcycling versus handrim wheelchair propulsion\nSeveral factors are involved in the development of shoulder pain, but the repetitive load of wheelchair propulsion is seen as one of the major risk factors. However, mobility devices such as the wheelchair are important since they support people with spinal cord injury (SCI) to live an independent life. Therefore, alternative or additional mobility devices to the manual handrim wheelchair should be considered. Since upper extremity mobility is usually the only means of physical exercise for SCI individuals, a manual device is preferable to maintain regular physical activity.\nThe handbike is one of these alternative mobility devices. It is increasingly used for commuting, recreation and sports. Compared to handrim wheelchair propulsion, the usage of a handbike is physiologically (heart rate, breathing, energy expenditure) more efficient and less straining. Whether also the mechanical load at the shoulder is lower than during wheelchair propulsion has not been investigated.\nThe focus of this project was on the biophysical benefits of handcycling in order to investigate the general assumption that the handcycle is indeed a good device for the prevention of shoulder problems. Additionally, we studied the handcycle-user interface. This will allow for practical advice on how to best adjust the handcycle to its user in order to further reduce the load on the shoulder joint.\nThe figure below shows the difference in shoulder load between handcycling and wheelchair propulsion. Glenohumeral contact force is the force with which the shoulder joint is compressed during the propulsion. The compression is a result of the exerted force by the hand and of the contractions of all muscles around the shoulder to perform the required movement and to stabilize the shoulder joint while doing so. (For example, 10 Newton (N) is the force needed to hold a mass of 1 kg against gravity).\nFrom the graphs it can be concluded that the load on the shoulder is much lower for handcycling.\nMuscle fatigue caused by wheelchair propulsion\n30% to 70% of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) suffer from shoulder pain. This has an enormous impact on functioning, independence and quality of life. The treatment is often unsatisfying and the pain problem remains.\nEarly diagnosis and early intervention of shoulder problems can markedly reduce the impact of shoulder pain. Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, several known factors contribute to the development of shoulder pain.\nOne of these factors is the mechanical load on the shoulder in relation to its capacity, for instance: how much force is needed to propel a wheelchair, and what is the maximum propelling force an individual can deliver? The lower the maximum, the sooner muscles will be fatigued. Improving the capacity to a sufficient level will have a positive effect on the prevention of shoulder pain.\nIt is also known that movement patterns can change due to fatigue, by a change in the activation or coordination of muscles. A less optimal movement pattern during wheelchair propulsion, a weight relief lift or a transfer can increase the risk of shoulder pain. Movement patterns are measured in our motion lab.\nFinally, prolonged activities can also lead to tissue change, for instance thickness and appearance of biceps tendon. Such changes in tendon thickness can be observed and quantified by Ultrasound imaging, not directly during wheelchair propulsion, but shortly after a fatiguing exercise, or during a weight relief lift.\nHow these mentioned changes, due to fatigue, are related to wheelchair propulsion and mechanical load at the shoulder is not known. It is, however, required information for the further development of training and prevention programs.\nQuality management system of upper extremity functioningWearables & Big Data\nFundamental research is required to gain insight in working mechanisms of upper extremity function, for which controlled conditions in motion labs are essential.\nIn addition questionnaires are used to gather information on lived experience from larger groups of participants.\nBoth approaches aim at extracting information from real life, and after analysis and discussion, generalize conclusions back to real life. Both approaches are, however, also just snapshots of what happens in real-life.\nWith the rapid technological development in the past two decades a third approach comes into reach. A broad variety of wearable sensors and smartphones might enable the desired longitudinal monitoring of upper extremity functioning in real life, to obtain an overview of real life demands and clarify dose-response relations among:\n- physical activities,\n- biomechanical load on the upper extremity, up to the level of musculoskeletal modelling,\n- long-term effect on tissue change,\n- performance of function.\nBesides, these non-intervening, discrete and wearable devices can potentially also be used as feedback devices, during rehabilitation or after discharge in real life in order to:\n- optimize or maintain optimal wheelchair propulsion style,\n- indicate over- or underuse with respect to individual capacity,\n- support or coach in adherence to «healthy» performance.\nTo enable the development of such an upper extremity quality management system, we focus our research on:\n- development of methods and algorithms (e.g. to estimate biomechanical load in real life),\n- testing usability of equipment (e.g. Smart Watches, Internet of Things modules) to enable large scale measurement in real life,\n- creation of safe and adequate infrastructure (where to store and process data, who can access data).']	['<urn:uuid:36c820de-237f-455c-8ddd-9f9a7705a4f3>', '<urn:uuid:9075a208-866c-4118-a3af-98c04d46c992>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	6	44	1805
4	ocean species diversity current knowledge gaps marine life identification	The oceans contain an estimated 2.2 million species, from single-celled organisms to blue whales, but scientists have not located or named 90% of them. Of the identified species, only a small percentage has been assessed to determine if their populations are stable, declining or increasing. This demonstrates a significant gap in our understanding of marine biodiversity.	['We know our oceans are in trouble, but we’re not sure just how much. Leading up to World Oceans Day on June 8th, this week we’re spotlighting how some of our staff and partners are using science to assess the health of our global oceans and determine the most effective way to conserve them.\nThe oceans are home to an estimated 2.2 million species, ranging from tiny single-celled organisms to blue whales, the largest living animals on the planet. Yet we understand relatively little about this incredible diversity. Even though our scientific models tell us there are millions of species, we have not actually located or named 90% of them. Of those that we have identified, only a small percentage has actually been assessed by scientists to determine whether their populations are stable, declining or increasing.\nPeople value this diverse marine life for many reasons — as sources of food, potential medicines and tourism revenue. However, there is also the simple “existence value” — just knowing that our planet contains such an amazing variety of species.\nMany of us feel a pull to see a species or a habitat that we have never seen before, or to visit a place that has the highest numbers of fish, turtles or sharks in the world, or is home to one of the world’s rarest species. I have my own wish list of places that I would love to go — including the Bird’s Head Seascape, a place where CI works that has some of the highest numbers of species in the world. I’m hoping one day I can get in the water with some of their famous whale sharks.\nWe still have much to do to protect the world’s marine life so that we don’t lose critical services like coastal protection, food provision and carbon storage. In order to do this, countries need tools that can help them measure how well they are doing at maintaining biodiversity.\nThis is where the Ocean Health Index comes in. A collaborative project of over 60 ocean experts from CI and partners, the Index is the first comprehensive assessment of the health of the oceans that is framed in terms of the many benefits humans derive from them.\nWe developed the Index’s biodiversity goal to determine how well marine biodiversity is faring in 151 countries’ exclusive economic zones (EEZs), the parts of the ocean that each country controls, stretching 200 miles [about 322 kilometers] from their coastlines out into the open ocean. We used publicly available datasets on the extinction risk of species from the IUCN Red List and data on the extent and condition of key marine habitats like coral reefs, mangroves, seagrasses and sea ice.\nWe then integrated measures of social and ecological pressures that negatively impact biodiversity, such as fishing pressure, habitat destruction, climate change, water pollution and species introductions. We also accounted for social and governance factors that should improve the condition of species and habitats, such as the extent of a country’s EEZ that is protected and whether the country has signed onto key international agreements like the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which regulates the trade of wild animals and plants.\nThe results of our work and a detailed look at all of the underlying data and analyses were published last month in PLoS ONE. Our results provide an integrative picture of how species and the habitats that they build are doing globally.\nSome key results from our work:\n- Biodiversity scores were lowest in many of West Africa’s EEZs, while Russia, Finland and Canada had the highest scores.\n- Alarmingly, species are expected to decline over the next five years in almost every country’s EEZ.\n- Habitat condition is generally declining in developing countries in the tropics, but we also saw declines in some developed countries like the United States. Although many marine habitats have undergone recent declines, we found that Canada, Russia, Australia and many countries in Europe have improved the condition of marine habitats within their EEZs since the early 1980s, which we set as our benchmark.\n- We found a strong positive relationship between the Human Development Index and resilience scores, which includes measures of governance based on the Worldwide Governance Indicators. The Human Development Index ranks the development level of countries based on their life expectancy, education levels and income. The Worldwide Governance Indicators project ranks countries based on metrics like government effectiveness and control of corruption. This relationship means that places that are less developed are also less likely to have effective measures in place to improve the management of their biodiversity.\nWe struggled with a number of challenges in trying to measure biodiversity. One issue was how to set a reasonable target for what we think is “healthy” for species and habitats. This is a very contentious issue, because there can be many visions of what is “healthy.” For some, “healthy” may mean being able to do a favorite wildlife-viewing activity, such as scuba diving. Others may feel that a system is only healthy when it is pristine and no human activity is allowed.\nOur research results suggest that we need to work hard in order to meet international policy commitments like those in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Countries that signed on to the CBD committed to several steps including aiming to reduce natural habitat decline by 50% and prevent the extinction of threatened species. Tools like the OHI biodiversity goal can play a role in tracking our progress.\nIn order to get the best measurements to determine the health of the ocean’s biodiversity, we also need to redouble efforts to understand marine diversity. We’ve sent fewer people to the deep oceans than we have sent to outer space; however, even marine ecosystems that are easier to reach, like salt marshes, lack the global monitoring that makes it possible to measure changes in their condition.\nBy creating a measure of how successfully countries are preserving their biodiversity, we hope to spur action to protect the diversity in our oceans for future generations to benefit from — and simply enjoy.\nElizabeth Selig is the director of marine science in CI’s Betty and Gordon Moore Center for Science and Oceans.

5	expert advice bank fishing tactics hide from fish	When bank fishing, it's crucial to stay back initially to determine the best fishing spots. Wear dull colors or camouflage clothing and maintain a low profile to avoid spooking fish. You should learn to sneak along the bank and even cast from your knees. It's important not to approach the water's edge wearing bright colors or making noise, as this will scare away all nearby fish.	['Merriam-Webster’s definition of a fisherman is one who engages in fishing as an occupation or for pleasure. If their definition included an example of a fisherman who does both, it would be “the man in the Tennessee cap”, Bill Dance. Continue reading this exclusive interview on Bill Dance’s top tips for bank fishing.\nDo a Google search for the qualities that make a good man. You will find the words faithfulness, honesty, sense of humor, easy-going, respectful, family-oriented, and driven. Everyone, whether they fish or not, would say that perfectly describes legendary fisherman Bill Dance. Bill’s Granddaddy taught him how to fish at an early age while they fished the banks of creeks and ponds around Lynchburg, Tennessee. Today, Bill is continually teaching others about fishing. Whether it’s on his TV shows, at how-to seminars, in his books, through instructional videos, on social media, or talking to someone who walked up and asked for an autograph. He is an entertainer, but he is also an educator. He is always teaching others about fishing just like his Granddaddy taught him.\nKnowing that, I wanted to ask Bill a few questions about bank fishing on small waters since it is the type of fishing that got him started and is still a great way to catch fish.\nHook & Barrel: Bill how does someone find places to go bank fishing in small waters like streams, ponds, and strip pits?\nBill Dance: The first thing to do is talk to the fisheries department at the local conservation office. They should be more than willing to help, since part of their job is to get more people using their state’s fishing resources. You can also do a Google search, ask employees at their local tackle store and talk to other fishermen.\nThey should be trying to find out what kind of fish there are and what they feed on? Is it shallow water or deep water or both? What is the contour of the land underwater? What kind of structure does it have? Are there shaded areas? All these questions will help determine where the fish are.\nH&B: What should they do when they first get there?\nBD: The first thing is, stay back until you determine where you should fish. Look for areas that are more likely to hold fish. Then, don’t go walking right up to the edge of the water wearing bright-colored clothing and making a bunch of noise. You’ll spook every fish in sight. Wear dull colors or even camouflage, and keep a low profile. Learn how to sneak along the bank and even cast from your knees.\nIf they want to catch bass, they should start by fan casting different types of baits that imitate what the bass feed on at varied distances, depths, and speeds of retrieve. When they catch one, they will usually find other bass in the same type of areas.\nThey also need to be observant. Watch and listen for feeding sounds like a splash in the water, ripples that could be a bass chasing supper, or herons feeding on baitfish at the water’s edge. If baitfish are there, you can bet bass are close by.\nThese small waters can hold big bass. But I definitely encourage taking a quick picture and then getting that bass back in the water so it can be caught again.\nH&B: I have always said that one of these days a state record bass will come from small waters by someone fishing from the bank. Would you agree or disagree with that?\nBD: Yes, I would certainly agree with you. It will be because of the research and knowledge of people like Troy Gousby, who knows how to raise big bass, and Freddy Langsford, who right now is raising bass that grow over 3 pounds a year. As these fish are stocked in small waters across the country and given the right conditions and food to grow even bigger, we will see records being broken.\nH&B: What about other species of fish they can catch from the bank?\nBD: Catfish can be found in just about all small waters, and they are fun to catch and great eating. Catfish feed mainly by their sense of smell. So they will do best using chicken livers, shrimp, prepared catfish dough baits, and things like that. Fish them on the bottom or suspended under a bobber.\nBluegill are also fun to catch on light tackle. Especially if they find a place with big ole’ hybrid bluegill the size of your hand. If you have kids along they will have a ball catching them with a worm under a bobber.\nH&B: Speaking of kids, bank fishing is a great way to introduce kids to fishing, isn’t it?\nBD: You bet! Small waters are great places for kids to get hooked on fishing. Make sure you let them use tackle that fits them— not you—and to the size of fish they will catch.\nOnce you have taught them to catch fish, let the kids take you bank fishing. Be there because you are just tagging along with them. If fishing’s slow, show them how to catch a crawfish or skip a rock. Even let them pick a wildflower to take home to Mom. Just remember, it’s all about making memories.\nH&B: One last question Bill, and this really has nothing to do with fishing but if you could choose three people to go to dinner with tonight, who would they be and why?\nBD: First of all, my Granddaddy. He was my mentor and gave me the greatest gift of all, introducing me to the great outdoors and not only teaching me how to fish, but he taught me so much about fish anatomy. He taught me the importance of sight and how fish can see. And the importance of hearing and how fish hear. This helped me later in life with fishing and my career.\nSecondly, Pope Francis because he seems to really relate and understand more so than any Pope in my lifetime. If there has been one that has stood out and really wants to be one of the boys, Pope Francis is the guy! I would love to spend an evening with this wonderful man.\nAnd the third one would be Billy Graham. Growing up and listening to televangelists, none impressed me more than that of Billy Graham! I was blown away with his gentle voice and wonderful warm quotes like “My home is heaven. I’m just traveling through this world” and “God has given me two hands, one to receive and the other to give with.” There are so many quotes by this great man. I only wish I could have met him. Maybe, someday I will.\nProverbs 27:19 says, “As water reflects the face, so one’s life reflects the heart.” The life of Bill Dance definitely reflects his heart, and I am betting that one day he will meet Billy Graham. When he does, Billy better be ready to hear a bunch of fish stories from “the man in the Tennessee cap.”']	['<urn:uuid:dbf8e2d2-5177-4345-98aa-1f50661648b8>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	8	66	1184
6	paralympic competition changes equipment advances	Paralympic competition has undergone significant changes alongside equipment advances. The Paralympics has transformed from being a low-publicized footnote to the Olympics into a major sporting event with star athletes, as evidenced by the upcoming Tokyo Paralympics featuring 140 athletes from 42 countries. The equipment development has become increasingly sophisticated, with innovations including wheelchairs designed by elite sports car manufacturers, carbon fiber racing chairs that are six times stiffer than conventional aluminum ones, and advanced prosthetics inspired by deer antlers. These technological advances have contributed to higher competition standards, with developments in areas like wind tunnel testing and biomechanical analysis helping athletes achieve better performance.	['Tokyo is about to host the largest and most diverse archery competition in the sport’s long Paralympic history.\nDespite the pandemic, cancelled or delayed qualifying events, and myriad travel restrictions, 140 para athletes from 42 countries will compete for nine Paralympic gold medals in the archery arena at Yumenoshima Archery Park, same venue that was just used for the Olympics, from 27 August to 4 September.\nGreat Britain topped archery’s medal table at the last Paralympics in Rio, winning three golds and climbing the podium six times in total. But as the number of archers at the Games increases and as the number of countries with a world-class para programme grows – so does the competition standard on this elite stage.\n- Friday 27 August – qualifying\n- Saturday 28 August – W1 mixed team finals\n- Sunday 29 August – Compound open mixed team finals\n- Monday 30 August – Compound women open finals (morning), W1 men finals (afternoon)\n- Tuesday 31 August – Compound men open finals (morning), W1 women finals (afternoon)\n- Thursday 2 September – Recurve women open finals\n- Friday 3 September – Recurve men open finals\n- Saturday 4 September – Recurve open mixed team finals\nDays in bold will be available live to international broadcasters.\nClassification and competition categories\nPara archers are classified into one of two categories depending on their level of impairment: open or W1.\nAthletes in the open category usually have an impairment in either the top or bottom half or one side of their bodies. Athletes in the W1 category usually have an impairment in the top and bottom halves of their bodies, torso and at least three limbs.\nClassification assessments at the international level are carried out by trained classifiers – and also define which, if any, assistive devices a para archer can use. Assistive devices include custom release aids, stools or chairs, or other fixed additions that help create a level playing field.\nPara archers with an open classification can compete with a recurve bow in the recurve open category and with a compound bow in the compound open category. Para archers with a W1 classification can compete in the W1 category with either a recurve or a compound bow with limitations on draw weight, a restriction on magnified sights and other changes to the standard rules.\nArchers at the Paralympic Games compete in the discipline of target archery.\nThe competition features individual and mixed team events. A mixed team consists of two archers, one man and one woman, from the same nation.\nNations must qualify quota places to compete at the Games, and only 140 quotas are available across the six individual categories. Any nation that has at least one man and one woman qualified in the same category is eligible for the mixed team event.\nArchers in the recurve open category shoot over a distance of 70 metres at targets measuring 122 centimetres in diameter, aiming to hit a 10-ring measuring just 12.2 centimetres in diameter – or about the size of an orange. Recurve matches are decided using the set system.\nArchers in the compound open and W1 categories shoot over a distance of 50 metres at targets measuring 80 centimetres in diameter, aiming to hit a 10-ring measuring just eight centimetres in diameter. The outer four rings of the target are removed for the compound open competition. Compound and W1 matches are decided using cumulative scoring.\nThese are the nations that will contest each of the nine gold medals. The full entry list of athletes is available in the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games section of the World Archery website.\nRecurve men open (32 athletes from 25 countries): Australia, Bhutan, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, France, Great Britain, Germany, India, Iran, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sri Lanka, RPC, Thailand, Turkey and the USA.\nRecurve women open (24 athletes from 19 countries): Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Great Britain, Greece, Iraq, Iran, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Mongolia, Poland, RPC, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and the USA.\nRecurve open mixed team (13 countries): Australia, Brazil, China, Great Britain, Iran, Italy, Japan, Mongolia, Poland, RPC, Thailand, Turkey and the USA.\nCompound men open: (36 athletes from 23 countries): Australia, Belgium, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Finland, France, Great Britain, Hong Kong China, India, Iraq, Iran, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, RPC, Slovakia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and the USA\nCompound women open (24 athletes from 18 countries): Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Great Britain, India, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, RPC, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Thailand and Turkey.\nCompound open mixed team (11 countries): Brazil, China, France, Great Britain, India, Iran, Italy, Japan, RPC, Thailand and Turkey.\nW1 men (12 athletes from 10 countries): Brazil, China, Czech Republic, Hungary, Iran, Japan, Korea, RPC, South Africa and Turkey.\nW1 women (12 athletes from 10 countries): Brazil, China, Czech Republic, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Korea, RPC, Turkey and the USA.\nW1 mixed team (7 countries): Brazil, China, Czech Republic, Japan, Korea, RPC and Turkey.\nArticle and pics by World Archery', 'Here’s a question for you. What do deer antlers, fighter pilot helmets and elite sports cars have in common? The answer – because you give up, right? – is that they have all been used to inspire the next generation of Paralympic sports equipment. Here’s the story.\nTime was that the Paralympics were a low-publicised footnote to the Olympic Games. Today the Paralympic movement has surged in popularity, with athletes who have achieved star status. As well as an enhanced profile, Paralympic athletes are also enjoying the benefits of increasingly sophisticated sports equipment – from wheelchairs designed by elite sports car manufacturers to prosthetics inspired by deer antlers. Make no mistake. The Paralympics have become a fertile seedbed for engineering innovation.\nEngineering brains add brawn to wheelchair basketball\nImage courtesy of BBC\nWheelchair basketball: fast, furious, often brutal. Player’s wheelchairs must be speedy, balanced and agile, as well as strong enough to withstand powerful collisions. Lots of them. That’s why Team GB’s 2012 wheelchair basketball team were grateful for the engineering chops of wheelchair manufacturer RGK, who joined forces with BMW and Loughborough University to create a revolutionary design specifically for the rigours of wheelchair basketball.\nTrue innovation rarely comes from tweaking the tried and tested. RGK went right back to the drawing board with its wheelchair design, starting from scratch in CAD and iterating its new design based on rigorous automated stress analysis. By building each chair’s frame from aerospace-grade aluminium, the team improved the shock resistance of Team GB’s wheelchairs while reducing weight by around 2kg. Each chair was also made-to-measure, with personalised seats based on 3D scans of the players’ physical dimensions and biomechanics.\nThe result: wheelchairs that were more comfortable, more manoeuvrable and more stable.\nFighter pilot engineers join wheelchair racing’s need for speed\nImage Courtesy of BAE Systems\nOf course, when you swap the basketball court for the race track, speed matters more than strength. Just ask BAE Systems, who formed a partnership with UK Sport’s wheelchair programme and donated £1.5m of engineering services. Part of that included thorough requirement-capture analysis – the same process BAE use to develop fighter pilot helmets. Cue extensive interviews with Team GB’s wheelchair athletes, which revealed a huge amount about how the individual athletes interfaced with their chairs and some of the limitations they faced.\nIn a first for Paralympic sport, BAE also gave Team GB’s athletes access to their wind tunnel – used with famous prevalence by Team GB’s gold rush cyclists. The results from these wind tunnel tests helped to calculate the optimum posture and position for wheelchair racing athletes to promote comfort and speed. This contributed to the development of the first British wheelchair with a chassis made entirely from carbon fibre. It’s six times stiffer than conventional aluminium racing chairs, which reduces drag and increases speed.\nDo deer antlers hold the secret to the future of sprinting?\nPerhaps the image most synonymous with modern Paralympics is that of the blade runners hurtling towards the finish line. Already an engineering marvel, each blade must be tailored to the unique biomechanics and weight of each runner in terms of energy stored and returned. This is achieved by tweaking the shape of the blade as well as the layers of composite to provide the perfect balance of spring and absorption.\nImage Courtesy of The Food Champions\nNow manufacturers are looking to innovate further by improving the interface between the stump and the prosthetic. Challenges include spreading pressure evenly, reducing heat and friction and avoiding the build-up of sweat – all of which can lead to tissue damage and bacterial growth. To help overcome this, prosthetic manufacturer Blatchford has developed a silicon socket that can be laser drilled to drain sweat from the interface. Meanwhile, blade manufacturer Össur has been developing an interface that integrates more directly with the stump, pushing the remaining muscle through holes in the socket to improve control.\nBut the ultimate future interface could come in the form of osseointegration, where the prosthesis connects directly to the bone via an implant. The challenge of course with an implant that breaks the skin is keeping the site free from infection. Though, back in 2006, University College London completed research that mimics the way the protrusion of a deer’s antlers are protected by soft tissue to prevent infection and maintain the integrity of the skin as a defensive barrier. Fascinating stuff.\nThe Paralympics: a hotbed of engineering innovation\nAs with many sports disciplines, the smallest competitive gains can be the difference between going for gold and going home empty handed. Add in the strict parameters governing the design and function of Paralympic equipment and it’s clear that the trend of major innovation isn’t set to stall anytime soon. Future disability sports technology will be increasingly customised for its user – enabling the next generation of Paralympians to go harder, faster, stronger and push the limits of what’s possible within the Paralympic movement.\nYou may also be interested in:']	['<urn:uuid:25538e3f-c3ec-4806-91f0-2ab89be56ab4>', '<urn:uuid:ddd176c5-6b1f-47d1-a3f4-6037bf3cbcd8>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	5	104	1673
7	findings results kennedy thorndike experiment diurnal long period effects measurements analysis	The Kennedy-Thorndike experiment yielded two types of results. For diurnal effects, they found a yearly average of 0.06 thousands of a fringe shift, corresponding to 24km/s, though the random distribution of anisotropies suggested this was likely due to noise. For long period effects, variations were on the order of 15km/s and were 123 degrees away from the average for daily variations. When added vectorially, this gave about 10km/s, which was chosen as the value of the null result, on the level of the Michelson-Morley experiment.	"['The Kennedy Thorndike Experiment:\nDoug Marett 2012\nYouTube video associated with this article is here\nThe Kennedy-Thorndike experiment was an experimental test of the Lorentz-Einstein transformations. They considered the mathematical treatment originally applied to the Michelson-Morley experiment to see if there was a way to design an experiment to discriminate between Lorentz ether theory and special relativity. They predicted that a Michelson interferometer exposed to different velocities would experience a phase shift at the detector which was proportional to the velocity, unless the frequency of the light depends upon velocity in the way required by relativity. Consider the earth’s absolute motion with respect to the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBr). We appear to moving at around 375 km/s towards the constellation Leo. If we have a Michelson interferometer flat on the surface of the earth pointing west, once a day the constellation Leo will cross the western horizon, so the interferometer will be directly aligned with our velocity through space. However, if we were to wait 6 hours after that moment, the interferometer would then be pointing perpendicular to our motion. Although Kennedy and Thorndike were unaware of the direction of our true net motion through space, they hypothesized that as the interferometer moved in and out of the plane of motion, whatever it is, a fringe shift should occur between the two returning light beams from the arms, since they would be affected by the relative motion in different ways depending on our orientation with respect to space. Further, this fringe shift would be amplified if the arms of the interferometer were different lengths.\nThe experiment relied on the following assumptions:\n1) There exists at least one coordinate system in which Huygen’s principle is valid and the velocity of light is the same in all directions. For Lorentz’s ether theory, this is any system at rest in the ether; for relativity, this is all uniformly moving systems.\n2) That some form of Lorentz contraction occurs in the direction of motion, proportional to [1-v^2/c^2] ½\nThe authors put forward as their primary goal to test the validity of the time dilation effect in the moving frame of the interferometer – as they state, “the theory has needed confirmation, particularly in its most revolutionary aspect; i.e., its denial of a significance for absolute time.” It was therefore an underlying premise of the experiment that a null result should only occur if time dilation happens on the moving interferometer as predicted by the theory of relativity.\nDiagram of the Experiment:\nThe interferometer used in the experiment is shown below.\nThe interferometer arms were in a vacuum chamber and the interference fringes were monitored using photographic plates mounted on a window to the chamber. The arms were short (around 61 mm and 220 mm) and placed at an angle of 56 degrees to one another. The device was not rotated - the rotation of the Earth diurnally served as the primary means of pointing in the arms in different directions in space.\nThe experimental results:\nDiurnal Effects: Although the cardinal directions of the apparatus are not cited, along with a lot of other relevant details, the average maximum daily fringe shift per month was provided with the angle it points in sidereal time. This is only a two dimensional slice of the Azimuth angle, so the anisotropy could be anywhere between 0 and maximum depending on the Alt angle formed to the actual Alt direction of the CMBr. However, only the data from October is close to the Azimuth angle of the CMBr.\nKennedy and Thorndike do a simple vector addition of the monthly anisotropies to find the yearly average (based on their weighed values). This gives a value of 0.06 thousands of a fringe shift (direction not given) which corresponds to 24km/s. The seemingly random distribution of anisotropies suggests that no clear direction was found, and that this result is likely due to noise.\nLong Period Effects: The long period variations were on the order of 15km/s and were 123 degrees away from the average for the daily variations. Where added vectorially, this gave about 10km/s. This value is chosen as the value of the null result, on the level of the M&M experiment.\nSimulation of the Kennedy-Thorndike Experiment:\nIn order to show more clearly the predictions and expected results from the Kennedy Thorndike experiment, an Excel simulation of it is provided here using Lorentz ether theory (LET). As will be shown shortly, Lorentz’s exact theorem of 1904, which Kennedy and Thorndike did not take into account, actually predicts the same outcome as Einstein’s special theory of relativity (SR). Both use the Lorentz transformations, so both predict an identical, null result.\nWe make the following basic assumptions:\n1) The speed of light is constant in the stationary frame – for LET this is a system at rest with respect to the ether. This input value is shown in the simulation below as 3 e 8 m/s.\n2) The one way speed of light in the moving frame can be calculated using an algebraic equation that includes the angle of orientation to the motion and the refractive index of the medium. We chose in this case to use an equation from Lorentz’s 1921 paper on the Michelson Morley experiment. I have modified this equation slightly to fully compensate for the effect of refractive index at second order, the final form of the equation is shown below:\nn = Refractive index, c = speed of light in stationary frame, v is velocity of interferometer, and f is the angle between the arm and the direction of motion.\n3) When calculating the final angle f which figures in both the velocity equation and in the Lorentz contraction applied, it is necessary to take into consideration the ultimate position of the arm vertically as well as horizontally from the direction of motion. To show this more clearly, a diagram is provided below which shows the Kennedy-Thorndike interferometer arms (in purple) superimposed on the earth in space. The movement of Leo is shown in two arbitrary positions, one aligned with the long arm, and the other nearly perpendicular, to highlight the horizontal and vertical angles that need to be calculated to arrive at the final velocity vector with respect to our motion through space:\nIn our simulation, we use the angle d and angle q to arrive at a final angle value f that can be applied directly into our equation. The equation used for determining the value is:\nf = 90 – (90- q) * cos(d)\n4) The time for light to traverse a given arm is calculated by taking the length of the arm, multiplying by the directionally dependent Lorentz contraction, and dividing by the one way speed of light. The directionally dependent Lorentz contraction is calculated as follows for each arm:\naLC = (1-v*cos(q)*cos(q)/c2)1/2\nAll forward and reverse paths for a given beam to reach the detector are added together. The sum is then multiplied by the time dilation factor a to determine the total local elapsed time for a given wave front to go from the source to the detector.\n( Lforward * aLC/C’ + Lreverse * aLC/C’ ) * at = t’ sum in local time\n[2L/( Lforward * aLC/C’ + Lreverse * aLC/C’ )] / at = C’ average in local time\nWhere L = path length in forward or reverse direction\nThe average speed of light for the entire trip is also shown below this value. In general, if time dilation and Lorentz contraction are applied, this value is always identical to the speed of light in the stationary frame ( C ) to a good approximation.\nThe simulator is set up with same angle of 56 degrees for the Kennedy-Thorndike interferometer arms, with the pre-loaded conditions having arms about 8x larger so they are more visible on the graph provided. In order to simulate a fringe shift, the Lorentz contraction part of the calculation can be disabled by setting the box [Lorentz contraction 1= Yes, 0 = No] to 0. When this is done, then a large fringe shift in the lower right hand box should appear. With the pre-loaded velocity of 375Km/s and with the second orientation at 80 degrees, the fringe shift should be around 3.9.\nHowever, when the Lorentz contraction is applied [Lorentz contraction 1= Yes, 0 = No] = 1 then the fringe shift should then drop by around 6 orders of magnitude to around 8 e -6 fringes, as shown below:\nThe simulator is designed so that the arm lengths, the angles between the arms, and the velocities experienced by the interferometer, can all be adjusted, to show that none of these adjustments make any difference in the null result. However, if [Time dilation] = 0 is set, the average velocity for the speed of light, C’ will become different when the beams meet at the detector (but the fringe shift remains low). This difference is exactly proportional to the frequency shift on the moving source. If this box is reset to 1, then the speed of light for each returning beam C’ becomes = 3e8 m/s again.\nThe Kennedy-Thorndike experiment demonstrates that Lorentz’s original proposition of the Lorentz contraction and time dilation are experimentally testable hypotheses – using the formulas above, predictions can be made as to the anticipated results, and they can be compared to the results of real experiments to see if the hypothesis is proven true or false. . Lorentz did not anticipate the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment, and as can be seen from the simulation, the only way that we arrive at the correct experimental result is if both of these effects are true. So this experiment stands as a proper test of LET. As will be shown in another simulation, Lorentz’s theorem also predicts the Sagnac effect, a positive outcome not anticipated by Lorentz since the Sagnac experiment was first performed in 1913. Another interesting feature is that the predicted result is unaffected by a change in the refractive index of the arms. This feature shows that LET is entirely consistent with the experimental results of the Shamir and Fox experiment of 1969. A separate Shamir and Fox simulator is available here. To quote M. Ruderfer:\n“The null result obtained by Shamir and Fox for the Michelson-Morley experiment performed in a solid transparent medium does not distinguish between special relativity and stationary (Lorentz) ether theories, as claimed. Ives has shown that in the stationary ether theory the measured one-way velocity of light in a translating refracting medium is independent of the velocity of the medium through the ether.”\nWhat does it mean to say that time dilation is occurring in the interferometer?\nWhat is implied is that the frequency of the light moving in the interferometer differs from the frequency it would have in its stationary state (Jannsen p.53). One would also expect that the measured rate of time (local time for Lorentz) will differ from that in the stationary frame. Lorentz saw this as a mathematical stipulation device, whereas Einstein saw this a change in the rate of real time.\nSo what does it actually mean?\n1) The frequency of the light in the interferometer arms changes based on f/g or f * a - this is orientation independent, since regardless of the direction the source is pointing, the frequency shift (apparent time dilation) is always proportional to a.\n2) The one way wavelength of the light and one way speed of light change at first order in an orientation dependent way. Using C = fl, if the one way velocity of light decreases, the wavelength decreases.\nThe explanation using Lorentz ether theory evolves a little differently than one using SR, since in the former case we are starting from a stationary frame with Newtonian time, and working forward to a moving frame using local time that is dilated with respect to the former. This local time would be equivalent to “proper time” in SR. I use the factor a in the former case to express the time dilation, although the result is the same as in SR, namely that the moving frame is the one with the longer period for one second.\nIt had previously been argued by Popper that Lorentz’s concept of the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction hypothesis was an unsatisfactory auxiliary hypothesis that had no falsifiable consequences. A. Grunbaum later argued that based on the Kennedy Thorndike experiment, the Lorentz contraction hypothesis was in fact testable, but somehow came to the conclusion that this experiment proved the hypothesis false. However, Grunbaum relies on the older mathematical arguments prior to Lorentz’s exact theorem of corresponding states (1899,1904) which generated both the Lorentz transformation and took into account first and second order effects experienced by interferometers used to try to detect our motion through space. This more developed theory of Lorentz has been defended by several authors, including Mansouri and Sexl, Tyapkin, and Ruderfer, as remaining consistent with the predictions of SR in virtually every optical experiment. Using this more advanced treatment, it can be shown that the Kennedy Thorndike experimental result is entirely in keeping with the predictions of LET - the Lorentz contraction is required for the null result, and the effect of time dilation on the moving source is required to maintain the two-way average velocity of light as equal to C. This is true regardless of whether time dilation is considered real or apparent.\n2) Grunbaum, A.

8	how snow roof causes water damage	Snow on the roof can cause water damage when damaged shingles create gaps, allowing melting snow and ice to seep into the roof instead of being routed off. This water damage can spread from the roof into the walls and floors if not quickly resolved.	['Snow Covered Roof FAQ\nMany people love to see snow falling and see snow covering roofs of houses and the accompanying yards, but snow on the roof of a home is not always as beautiful as it seems. Snow covering a roof has the potential to cause homeowners many difficulties that could be disastrous if not taken care of correctly. Here are some frequently asked questions when it comes to snow piling up on your roof.\nWhat Are The Dangers Of A Snow Covered Roof?\nOne of the biggest dangers of snow covering a roof is the weight. Although snow is light and fluffy as it falls, accumulating snow on a roof can sometimes add too much extra weight to the roof of your home.\nSnow covering a roof can also cause issues with the shingles. As the snow freezes and thaws, the change in temperature and the moisture level can cause gaps in between the shingles and the roof of your home.\nWhat Are Signs That You Are Headed For A Collapse?\nWhen your roof is under lots of extra weight from snow or ice, it is important to watch for signs that it might be in danger of collapsing. If you observe any of the following signs, you should immediately evacuate the home and seek help to get your roof issue resolved.\nOne of the biggest signs the roof of your home is about to collapse is that it is noticeable sagging. If you look at your roof and see it sag, your roof is in imminent danger. Other signs that your roof is in deep trouble include noises not usually heard such as a creaking sound or a popping sound, noticeably bad leaks from the roof, cracks suddenly forming down the walls of your home and doors that randomly open by themselves.\nHow Can Water Damage Occur From Snow On Your Roof?\nBeautiful snow covered roofs can also pose the threat of water damage in your home. As snow and ice are adding weight to your roof, damage to the roof can occur. If damage to the shingles occurs and allows gaps between the shingle and the roof, as the snow and ice melts, the water and moisture can seep down into your roof instead of being routed off the roof with the help of the shingles.\nWater damage is a tricky situation when it comes to homes. Damage can start in the roof of your home from melting snow and ice and if the issue is not quickly resolved, the damage can seep into the walls and ultimately into the floors of the home. The longer water damage goes without being taken care of, the more damage can occur. If you notice a leak in your roof, it is imperative to quickly resolve the issue to keep water damage contained to one area of your home instead of allowing the damage to quickly spread.\nEven though snow covered roofs are pretty, a homeowner must be careful to watch for signs of a roof collapse while admiring the snow. If you observe any sign that your roof might be in trouble for collapsing or leaking, call a professional immediately to get the damage fixed before it leads to other issues.']	['<urn:uuid:66669c9d-d9d2-496b-9640-3b5ef2224238>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	6	45	543
9	What are the key differences in driver technology between the HiFiMan Susvara's planar magnetic system and the hybrid driver systems used in professional in-ear monitors?	The HiFiMan Susvara uses planar-magnetic drivers with a nanometer-grade diaphragm less than 1µm thick and pure gold voice-coil traces, suspended between magnets with a rounded shape to reduce air turbulence. In contrast, professional in-ear monitors like the CCA C10 use hybrid driver systems combining different technologies - for example, the CCA C10 features a combination of a 10mm woofer and 6mm tweeter with titanium diaphragms driven by neodymium magnets. Some IEMs like the Yinyoo KZ ZST use hybrid balanced armature technology to handle different frequency ranges effectively.	"['Originally published on SoundStage! Xperience\nHiFiMan Susvara headphones measurements can be found by clicking this link.\nTrying to judge the HiFiMan Susvara headphones on the basis of only their performance and design is as hopeless as trying not to think of an elephant. Once you see the Susvaras’ $6000 USD price tag, there’s no way to banish from your mind this question: “How can a set of headphones be worth so much?”\nThe Susvaras resemble HiFiMan’s HE1000 V2s ($2999). The headband and strap are essentially the same. Both have minimalist metal grilles on their sides, intended to allow the freest possible flow of soundwaves from the backs of the drivers. Both have detachable cables, and include cables for unbalanced or balanced connection, with separate ground connections for the right and left channels.\nThe biggest technical difference is the Susvaras’ planar-magnetic drivers, which work by suspending a thin diaphragm of film covered with a wire voice-coil between metal plates covered with rows of magnets. Most HiFiMan headphones have such drivers; the Susvaras are different in using magnets with a rounded shape, claimed to reduce air turbulence and audio distortion.\nAnother innovation is the Susvaras’ “nanometer-grade” diaphragm, which is claimed to be less than 1µm thick. (A typical human hair is about 100µm thick.) In theory, this means better high-frequency response and more sonic detail.\nA microscopically thin diaphragm isn’t much use if it’s weighed down with a heavy voice-coil, so HiFiMan used voice-coil traces of 24K (pure) gold. The gold’s softness makes it possible to create extremely thin, light voice-coil traces, but the traces’ extreme thinness raises their resistance, which greatly reduces the Susvaras’ sensitivity.\nHiFiMan has been steadily improving the sensitivity of its headphones, to the point where most of them can produce decent sound even when plugged straight into a smartphone. But the Susvaras hark back to HiFiMan’s earlier headphones, such as the HE6 from 2010, whose low sensitivity made them notoriously difficult to drive. Even HiFiMan’s own beefed-up amp, the EF6, could achieve loud listening levels with the HE6es only with the volume control turned full up. Knowing that headphones costing in the mid-four figures would likely be used only with high-quality headphone amps, HiFiMan decided to focus entirely on the Susvaras’ sound quality and not worry about their sensitivity.\nThe company even created an amp specifically designed to drive the Susvaras: the EF1000 ($15,000), a tubes-and-transistors design specified to deliver 20Wpc into 35 ohms -- about 100 times the power delivered by typical headphone amps. You can get the EF1000 and the Susvaras in a package deal for $18,000.\nIn the box\nLike HiFiMan’s other high-end headphones, the Susvaras come in a beautiful presentation box. Inside are two cables: one with a standard stereo 1/4” plug, and one with a four-pin XLR connector for headphone amps that offer balanced connection. The manual is one of the nicest I’ve seen: rather than a stapled pamphlet, it’s a small, hardbound book.\nAt the time of this writing, HiFiMan was offering a free B-stock (i.e., returned or reconditioned) EF6 amp with the first ten orders of the Susvaras.\nI laughed out loud when I first plugged the Susvaras into my Musical Fidelity V-CAN headphone amp. The V-CAN is a well-engineered amp that I use for most of my measurements, but it was clearly overwhelmed by the challenge of driving the Susvaras. The volume level was almost loud enough, but the bass distorted badly. I switched to my Audio-gd NFB-1AMP, specified to output 8Wpc into 40 ohms, and the sound was impeccably clean. Despite the NFB-1AMP’s exceptionally high power rating for a headphone amp, with about half the recordings I listened to I had to turn the gain up full to get a satisfying volume. (The NFB-1AMP’s very conservative maximum volume setting doesn’t allow the amp to clip, at least not with any headphone I’ve tried.) Thus, most headphone amps -- almost all of which are rated at a maximum output of 1Wpc or lower -- won’t be able to deliver satisfying results with the Susvaras. If you don’t want to pop $15,000 for the EF1000, you’ll have to exercise great care in choosing an amp.\nObviously, the Susvaras are entirely unsuited for use with smartphones and tablets. I can’t think of any practical way to use them on the go, unless someone decides to make an ultra-beefed-up portable music player powered by six D-cell batteries.\nI found the Susvaras even more comfortable than the HE1000 V2s, which rank among the most comfortable headphones I’ve tried. The clamping force is light, and the Susvaras’ rounder earpads made for a more natural fit around my ears than the HE1000 V2s’ oblong pads.\nAfter breaking in the Susvaras for ten hours, I decided I wanted to hear what a $6000 pair of headphones sound like with some of the music I first fell in love with when I was using $15 Panasonic headphones, back in the mid-1970s. So I put on the high-resolution version of Yes’s Fragile (24-bit/96kHz FLAC, Atlantic/HDtracks). Right away, I was struck by how real Steve Howe’s guitar sounded in the opening melody of “Long Distance Runaround”; it was as if I were sitting next to a real Fender amp connected to a real Gibson ES-175 guitar in the real 1970s. (I had a somewhat similar rig myself at the time, but with an Ibanez Les Paul copy instead of the ES-175.) I could also tell clearly, for the first time, that Rick Wakeman was doubling the melody on piano, and not on one of his electronic keyboards. It was always clear to me that he played piano on most of the tune, but on the countless other audio systems I’ve listened to this track through, the notes in the opening melody sounded kind of “klacky” and percussive, more like a second guitar overdubbed -- through the Susvaras, I could definitely tell that it’s a piano. As with the guitar, I felt I was in the studio, sitting a few feet from Wakeman’s piano. Same with Bill Bruford’s kick drum. I’ve been in dozens of recording studios, so I know what it feels like to really be there -- and this was it.\n“The hi-hat sounds a little crisp,” I noted, but after considering what the hi-hat on my own drum kit sounds like, I added, “or maybe not. Jeez, it’s hard to think of something about this sound that’s not perfect.”\nWas this just the predictable reaction of hearing a familiar recording on better headphones than I’m used to? To find out, I plugged in the HE1000 V2s. Great as the HE1000 V2s are, the Susvaras were a good deal better. Much about the two was practically the same: the spatial presentation, the precision of bass notes, the seemingly limitless treble extension. But the HE1000 V2s sounded comparatively bright, making the snare drum sound, again, “klacky,” and lacking in natural body. Maybe that doesn’t sound like a big difference, but to me it almost seemed like the difference between hearing an unamplified jazz band and one whose sax player uses a PA system.\nOf course, “Long Distance Runaround” was recorded in 1971, on an early multitrack analog tape recorder using multiple overdubs, so even in 24/96 it’s a long way from an audiophile recording. To hear what the Susvaras could do with something better, I played “But Beautiful,” from We’ll Be Together Again (24/96 FLAC, Chesky), a minimalist stereo recording of Three’s Company, a trio comprising saxophonist Javon Jackson, bassist Ron Carter, and drummer Billy Drummond. Again, the Susvaras sounded shockingly flat, neutral, and uncolored. Carter’s double bass, which I’ve heard live in clubs small and large, sounded like Carter’s bass sounds, with a perfect mix of fullness, body, definition, and detail. As I’d expect from a Chesky recording, the ambience was huge.\nOnce again, I went back to the HE1000 V2s, and once again, the difference was obvious. The HE1000 V2s made Jackson’s tenor sax sound breathier and thinner, and overemphasized Drummond’s brushed cymbals. This time, I also threw in Audeze’s LCD-Xes ($1799), a well-regarded open-backed, planar-magnetic design. The LCD-Xes gave me a much different sound. It was punchier, with stronger bass and treble -- more dynamic, more kick-ass, but also more like a typical multimiked, multitracked jazz recording than a Chesky recording.\nThe Susvaras also beat all comers on a very different version of “But Beautiful,” from singer Valerie Joyce’s Blue Coast Special Event 21 (DSD64, Blue Coast), in which she’s accompanied only by acoustic guitar. All the headphones sounded good with this track, but the Susvaras were the least colored and most natural. The HE1000 V2s sounded much like the Susvaras, but with an added sibilance that was an unwelcome addition to Joyce’s ultra-deep, ultra-smooth voice. The LCD-Xes gave me less of a sense of air and space than either HiFiMan, and more of an uneven response in the upper frequencies of her voice.\nAnother favorite from my youth, the title track of Metallica’s Master of Puppets (320kbps Ogg Vorbis, Elektra/Spotify), also gave me that singular Susvara sensation: as if I were in the studio with the musicians, their instruments right there next to me, much as if I were the band’s producer listening to them at close range and hearing every little detail, every little flaw, every subtle triumph. It felt like a radically different way of listening. I could hear tiny, previously imperceptible imperfections in the abrupt, practiced starts and stops in this track’s intro, which made the rhythm guitar, bass, and drums seem no less precise but far more human and musical.\nAnother Chesky recording -- “No Flight Tonight,” from Larry Coryell, Badi Assad, and John Abercrombie’s Three Guitars (16.44.1 WAV, Chesky) -- gave me a different perspective on the Susvaras. There was no question that their tonality made the Susvaras the most natural-sounding of all the headphones; it got the twang of the acoustic guitar strings exactly right, something almost no headphones I’ve heard can do. But that doesn’t mean I necessarily liked them best. On this recording, the LCD-Xes’ more dynamic sound simply made them more fun to listen to; though there was much less sense of air and space, I loved the way the LCD-Xes pumped up Coryell’s percussive, aggressive playing.\nI had a similar experience when listening to the primordial groove of “Immigrant Song,” from Led Zeppelin’s III (16/44.1 WAV, Atlantic). Again, the Susvaras got everything right: no instrument sounded unnatural or out of balance, and there were loads of detail with no hint of brightness or fatigue. But the LCD-Xes’ stronger bass made the tune slam a lot harder.\nThis isn’t to say that I wouldn’t prefer the Susvaras to any other headphone I’ve ever tried. It’s just to point out that you might find music with which you like other headphones better. I guess even a $6000 set of headphones can’t be everything to everyone.\nI went into this review expecting that HiFiMan’s Susvaras might be just slightly better than their HE1000 V2s: maybe $500 better, but not $3001 better. I worried the Susvaras might actually be worse, placing unnatural emphasis on a few audio bandwidths to make them sound more spectacular. All of my fears were completely unfounded.\nFrom a technical standpoint, the Susvaras are just substantially more refined HE1000 V2s, with what sounds like a flatter frequency response and a smoother sound overall. But that description doesn’t convey what it was like for me to listen to music through these headphones. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of audio products claim to bring you “closer to the music,” and when I see those claims, I always roll my eyes -- it’s just a meaningless marketing statement, possibly written by someone who’s never even heard the product. But the Susvaras really did bring me closer to my music. Lots of audio products can uncover previously unnoticed details in your favorite recordings, but they usually do it by emphasizing some part of the audioband. The Susvaras gave me new, more intimate insights into my favorite recordings simply because they’re better.\nNot many of us can afford to spend $6000 on headphones, let alone thousands more on an amp to drive them -- but I think if you try the Susvaras at a hi-fi or headphone show, you’ll at least understand why some people would.\n. . .

But, they can drown out the rest of the band from a throne perspective. A decent set of IEM system sets can help you hear your band-mates.\nDo I Need an In-Ear Monitor to Play Drums?\nIf you are playing at decent gig venues as part of a group, then it is a wise investment. When you are in a live performance situation, your audio gets fed forwards through a P.A in the direction of the audience, as it should be. This often creates a problem where those on stage can't hear what's going on. This is usually due to the sound that bounces around the venue and back to them.\nIn-ear monitors/ headphones are placed at the front of the stage to feed reproduction of the front audio to the players. However, given that the drums are typically at the back center of a stage, and they are a loud musical instrument without any amplification, things can get problematic.\nAn in-ear monitor has a fair few advantages. Firstly it enables you to have a selective feed with the levels you want specifically of each drum set. So, if you're going to want to hear the bass above all else you can. Likewise, if you are relying on a vocal line to know when to kick into the chorus, you can have a higher level from the vocalist coming in.\nA quality in-ear monitor will also give you some decibel reduction acting as an earplug. We would stress this is also important for the majority of gigging musicians who are playing a large venue. See our earplug article and buyers guide for exactly why.\nEven if you aren't in a band, a pair of in-ear monitors are a useful practice tool for jamming along to new songs in your potential set-lists. Filtering out the higher decibels of your drum kit and allowing you to listen without having to crank your device up to dangerous levels.\nWhat to Look for in an In-Ear Monitor?\nAside from a decent audio reproduction, you really should have your primary focus on comfort and durability when shopping for in-ear live performance or in the studio monitors. The price can dictate this, but you shouldn't sacrifice comfort if you are going to be playing 2-3 sets regularly.\nIf you are shopping with very minimal funds, It would probably be better to get something cheap but ergonomic. Even though you will have to replace them sooner than something durably made that could be damaging to your ears.\nGetting your hands on an in-ear monitor for drummers that won't break the bank is a pretty easy task with an abundance available.\nOf course, the cheaper products are always going to be somewhat inferior, which is to be expected. But, you will find regardless of your budget there are some great deals to be had which make for sensible solutions.\nThe benefits of an in-ear monitor can make the difference between a small-time weekend drummer and a touring pro, and there is never a wrong time to start using one. We hope you've found this in-ear monitor buying guide for drummers useful.\nIt is wise to invest in some high-quality cables for your in-ear monitoring, especially if you play larger venues with bigger stages.\nDid you Know\nIn-ear monitors aren't exclusively for drummers many professional-level live performances will utilize an in-ear monitor for all members of the band as well as the crew.\nIf you've enjoyed this review by Music Critic, please leave a positive rating:""]"	['<urn:uuid:746db71a-e051-48d5-8edd-6435784cf3fe>', '<urn:uuid:658d70be-315a-4daf-b87d-310e7c0d1547>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	25	87	4136
10	In my role as a project manager, I need to understand the core purpose of technical drawings - what exactly is a blueprint meant to communicate in construction and engineering projects?	A blueprint is a two-dimensional set of drawings that provides a detailed visual representation of how a structure should look. It specifies a building's dimensions, construction materials, and the exact placement of all its components. These documents serve as technical drawings that document architectural or engineering design, essentially providing plans for a future project or design for particular parts of a project.	"['do engineers use blueprints\nTo develop and present their designs, both architects and engineers use technical drawings called blueprints. A blueprint is the detailed drawing presented by an architect or engineer that outlines their design.\nWhat is the purpose of blueprints?\nA blueprint is a two-dimensional set of drawings that provides a detailed visual representation of how an architect wants a building to look. Blueprints typically specify a building\'s dimensions, construction materials, and the exact placement of all its components.08-Nov-2020\nWhat do engineers use for blueprints?\nComputer-aided design: Design software used in architecture and engineering to create precision drawings; also known as CAD.\nWhy do they use blue paper for blueprints?\nEver wondered where the “blue” came from in blueprints? These documents actually obtained their trademark blue in 1842 when John Herschel discovered the cyanotype process. Artists and scientists quickly adopted this new way to reproduce notes, efficiently and at a lower cost than previous methods available.12-Apr-2016\nWhy do engineers use blueprint?\nBut what is a blueprint, really? At its most basic, a blueprint is a reproduction of an image that already exists. Engineers or architects use these large-format prints to illustrate project plans using white lines and text on a backdrop of blue. And it\'s not just because they happen to really, really like blue.05-Mar-2013\nWhere are blueprints used?\nBlueprints are reproductions of technical drawings that document an architectural or engineering design. A lot of people refer blueprints to what are now construction documents. They can be plans for a future project or the design for a particular part of a project.11-May-2018\nDoes anyone still use blueprints?\nMost people still associate any type of drawing to blueprints. But due to modern printing methods, architects no longer need to put the drawings through the chemical process that makes them blue. They can just print the drawings from their computers.11-May-2018\nWhy are blueprints used?\nAt its most basic, a blueprint is a reproduction of an image that already exists. Engineers or architects use these large-format prints to illustrate project plans using white lines and text on a backdrop of blue. And it\'s not just because they happen to really, really like blue.05-Mar-2013\nDo engineers still use blueprints?\nIt was widely used for over a century for the reproduction of specification drawings used in construction and industry. The blueprint process was characterized by white lines on a blue background, a negative of the original. The process was not able to reproduce color or shades of grey. The process is now obsolete.\nWho uses a blueprint?\nThe blueprint process is still used for special artistic and photographic effects, on paper and fabrics. Various base materials have been used for blueprints. Paper was a common choice; for more durable prints linen was sometimes used, but with time, the linen prints would shrink slightly.\nWhat is the difference between drawings and blueprints?\nis that blueprint is a type of paper-based reproduction process producing white-on-blue images, used primarily for technical and architecture\'s drawings, now largely replaced by other technologies while drawing is a picture, likeness, diagram or representation, usually drawn on paper.\nAre Engineering Drawings blueprints?\nEngineering drawings (aka blueprints, manufacturing blueprints, prints, manufacturing prints, dimensional prints, drawings, mechanical drawings, and more) are a rich and specific outline that shows all the information and requirements needed to manufacture an item or product.\nWhy were engineering drawings called blueprints?\nAfter the paper was washed and dried to keep those lines from exposing, the result was a negative image of white (or whatever color the blueprint paper originally was) against a dark blue background.

11	I'm learning about different ways people communicate at work. What's the difference between speaking face to face and using body movements, and why are both important in team settings?	Oral communication like saying 'I've got third!' is the most basic form, while nonverbal communication includes body language, gestures, and facial expressions. Both are crucial because verbal communication helps avoid confusion (like when umpires need to coordinate calls), while nonverbal cues can convey emotions and messages that complement or substitute spoken words. Neither should be used in isolation - for instance, just pointing without speaking can lead to misunderstandings, as demonstrated in cases where umpires misinterpreted each other's gestures.	"[""We often think we are communicating well with our partners, when we really aren’t. Good communication is the key for a successful umpiring team.\nThe most basic form of communication is simply oral communication. That often means communicating your location on the field. “I’ve got third!” or, “You’ve got the runner!” are simple but effective communications. Their simplicity should not diminish their importance.\nHave you ever found yourself at third base preparing to make a call and felt the presence of another umpire possibly making a call at the same time? It is vitally important to know where your partner is and what your partner believes his or her primary responsibility is on every play. Though you may have discussed coverage before the game, using verbal communication is critical. In the heat of a developing play, an umpire can lapse and make a call that really isn’t that umpire’s responsibility. If you are talking, you’ll know who is going to call the play.\nOK, we’ve covered the basic (and honestly, the most important) communication technique. So let’s move on to the more “touchy” situations that occur during a game that require excellent communication. A crew recently shared a real-life example of the importance of discussing a situation rather than just pointing at each other.\nHave you seen those types of umpires? Some umpires simply point in the direction of their partner and expect their partner to miraculously know the meaning of the point. I’ve seen and experienced the “mime” umpires in action and I’m never at ease with them.\nThe crew said there was a slight bobble on a throw to first base as the first baseman stretched to catch the ball. On the safe call, the defensive team’s reaction was spontaneous and vociferous. Realizing something was likely amiss, the base umpire pointed to the plate umpire and the plate umpire raised his fist and called, “That’s an out!” More grumbling followed along with the comment, “Both of you missed that one!” But the game continued.\nAfter the game the crew members learned of their poor communication. They thought they had done as they had been trained: “When in doubt, get help from your partner and strive to get the call right.” Well, the base umpire said to the plate umpire, “I wasn’t sure if the fielder bobbled the ball so that is why I thought I should come to you to make the call.” To that, the plate umpire replied, “I thought you wanted to know if his foot was on the bag when he stretched out. That’s why I called him out.” Oops!\nThe first mistake was just pointing instead of also verbalizing. But the biggest mistake was the plate umpire automatically making the out call. If they had agreed that the umpire making the call would be the one to stay with the call or change it based on the information provided by the other official, the plate umpire couldn’t have called the batter-runner out or safe. The officials would have had to talk to know what the base umpire was requesting.\nEven though I’ve worked with my regular “partner” for more than 10 years, I’ve learned the importance of asking for clarification, or asking for a specific answer to a specific question. Sometimes, when it is a really difficult situation, like a catch/no-catch, I’ll ask a more open-ended question.\nI might inquire, “What did you see on that play?” Had the base umpire vocalized, “Did he have control of the ball?” or, “Did he bobble the ball?” the crew could have made the correct call. You simply can’t depend on one umpire reading another’s mind.\nI had a situation where an unfamiliar partner asked, “What have you got?” I responded, “Do you want to know if he had control of the ball?” That way the dialogue could continue with increased probability of getting the call right.\nAre you communicating with your partner? If you aren’t talking, you aren’t communicating. After all, I don’t know of any mind readers on the field.\nWhat's Your Call? Leave a Comment:\nNote: This article is archival in nature.

12	Which are the primary paired currencies that experienced traders deal with in the international exchange marketplace?	The major currency pairs are EUR/USD (Euro/US Dollar), USD/JPY (US Dollar/Japanese Yen), GBP/USD (British Pound/US Dollar), USD/CHF (US Dollar/Swiss Franc), AUD/USD (Australian Dollar/US Dollar), USD/CAD (US Dollar/Canadian Dollar), and NZD/USD (New Zealand Dollar/US Dollar).	['Forex trading involves the exchange of one currency for another, and as such, there are several currency pairs available for trading. The forex market is the largest financial market in the world, with trillions of dollars being traded every day. In this article, we will explore the major currency pairs in forex trading and how many combinations can be made with them.\nMajor Currency Pairs in Forex Trading\n1. EUR/USD – Euro/US Dollar\n2. USD/JPY – US Dollar/Japanese Yen\n3. GBP/USD – British Pound/US Dollar\n4. USD/CHF – US Dollar/Swiss Franc\n5. AUD/USD – Australian Dollar/US Dollar\n6. USD/CAD – US Dollar/Canadian Dollar\n7. NZD/USD – New Zealand Dollar/US Dollar\nThese currency pairs are referred to as major because they are the most liquid and heavily traded in the forex market. They also have the lowest spreads and are highly volatile, making them ideal for traders who want to make large profits.\nHow Many Combinations Can Be Made with Major Currency Pairs?\nThe number of combinations that can be made with major currency pairs in forex trading is determined by the formula n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of currency pairs. Using this formula, we can calculate the number of combinations for the major currency pairs as follows:\nn(n-1)/2 = 7(7-1)/2 = 21\nTherefore, there are 21 possible combinations that can be made with the major currency pairs in forex trading. These combinations include both direct and indirect quotes.\nDirect and Indirect Quotes\nIn forex trading, currency pairs are quoted in two ways: direct and indirect quotes. A direct quote is when the domestic currency is the base currency, while an indirect quote is when the domestic currency is the quote currency.\nFor example, if the EUR/USD currency pair is quoted as 1.1200, it means that one euro is worth 1.1200 US dollars. In this case, the euro is the base currency, and the US dollar is the quote currency, making it a direct quote.\nOn the other hand, if the USD/JPY currency pair is quoted as 109.50, it means that one US dollar is worth 109.50 Japanese yen. In this case, the US dollar is the base currency, and the Japanese yen is the quote currency, making it an indirect quote.\nThe 21 Possible Combinations\nUsing the formula n(n-1)/2, we can calculate the 21 possible combinations that can be made with the major currency pairs in forex trading. These combinations are as follows:\n1. EUR/USD – USD/JPY\n2. EUR/USD – GBP/USD\n3. EUR/USD – USD/CHF\n4. EUR/USD – AUD/USD\n5. EUR/USD – USD/CAD\n6. EUR/USD – NZD/USD\n7. USD/JPY – GBP/USD\n8. USD/JPY – USD/CHF\n9. USD/JPY – AUD/USD\n10. USD/JPY – USD/CAD\n11. USD/JPY – NZD/USD\n12. GBP/USD – USD/CHF\n13. GBP/USD – AUD/USD\n14. GBP/USD – USD/CAD\n15. GBP/USD – NZD/USD\n16. USD/CHF – AUD/USD\n17. USD/CHF – USD/CAD\n18. USD/CHF – NZD/USD\n19. AUD/USD – USD/CAD\n20. AUD/USD – NZD/USD\n21. USD/CAD – NZD/USD\nIn conclusion, the forex market is a vast and complex financial market that involves the exchange of one currency for another. The major currency pairs are the most heavily traded and include the EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, USD/CHF, AUD/USD, USD/CAD, and NZD/USD pairs. There are 21 possible combinations that can be made with these major currency pairs, including both direct and indirect quotes. Understanding these combinations is essential for traders who want to make profitable trades in the forex market.']	['<urn:uuid:2cbf7579-abef-482e-bc17-9cb630767619>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	16	34	567
13	What is the typical cost range for getting braces?	Braces generally run between $3,000 and $8,000 dollars, though some like lingual braces will cost more.	['Let Your Orthodontist Help You Choose the Right Orthodontic Options\nThere are a lot of different orthodontic treatment options available to you if you hear that you or your child need braces. Aside from the traditional metal braces that we have known forever, there are other choices like clear braces and plastic aligners. With so many things to choose from, how can you know if you have picked the right one? By talking to your orthodontist about your preferences and using his or her knowledge of what options are out there as well as what you need, you can be sure you will find the right orthodontic option for you.\nTypes of orthodontic options for adults\nBraces are needed to help with misaligned bites and crooked teeth so you have optimal oral health for a lifetime. If you don’t have teeth that can be cleaned properly, it can lead to cavities, gum disease, or tooth loss. Braces straighten your teeth and align your teeth and jaws to prevent any problems from occurring.\nThere are several types of orthodontic treatment options available today. Your treatment plan will all depend on what you need. Some of the types of braces and treatments include:\nA lot will depend on the size and shape of your jaw, what kind of work needs to be done in terms of your teeth – i.e. are there gaps or a bite alignment issue that need to be corrected? – and the size of your teeth.\nOne factor you won’t notice is age. There is no such thing as a maximum age!\nFor children, the American Association of Orthodontists or AAO recommends that their first visit to the orthodontist is at age 7. If nothing else, this helps your orthodontist determine a baseline. They can examine your child’s jaw and make sure that all of the adult teeth will be able to come in correctly. If some work needs to be done to help your child have enough room for their teeth, now is a great time to seek orthodontic options for crowded teeth. Generally speaking, kids wear braces between ages 10 and 14.\nIf one of the orthodontic options Aventura your child needs means some jaw adjustment has to be done, there is something called a Forsus appliance that helps move either the upper jaw or the lower jaw. It is comprised of springs attached to the braces that take the place of headgear. If the upper jaw is too small, there are palate expanders that are worn on the inside of the upper jaw to gently make it wider and give more room to the teeth. That way they don’t have to pull teeth when the upper jaw’s teeth are too crowded.\nMetal and ceramic braces\nWhen it comes to orthodontic options, traditional metal braces are the ones we are all the most familiar with. They are composed of a series of small stainless steel brackets that affix to the front of the teeth and then small wires called arch wires are run through the center of the brackets. These wires will vary in thickness and shape (i.e. round versus square) during the course of treatment. If you have some jaw issues that need to be corrected also, there may be metal bands with the brackets attached placed around the back teeth on the top and bottom so that additional appliances or elastics can be used to help guide the teeth into their new positions. These elastics are affixed using small posts that stick up from the metal brackets. Regardless of the type of bracket you have, the arch wires are then held in place by small rubber bands.\nCeramic braces work a lot like metal ones do, except that the brackets are made from a tooth-colored ceramic material so they are much less noticeable. The wires are still made of metal so that they have the strength to do the work of applying pressure to the teeth to guide them into place. Tiny rubber bands called ligatures are used to hold the wires in place, just like you would find with metal braces. You can even get these in fun colors that match your mood or the season.\nAnother type of orthodontic options is self-ligating braces. Self-ligating braces are a lot like the familiar metal braces but instead of using the tiny rubber bands to hold the archwire in place, they have tiny clips that snap into place to hold the wire. There are some ceramic braces that can use this type of anchor as well. These types of braces are also considered to be easier to keep clean.\nBecause they don’t have the little bands and rely on a clip, self-ligating braces are not as sturdy as other kinds of orthodontic options North Miami so they may not be able to do everything that traditional metal braces can. But, because the little rubber bands don’t have to be changed out, you end up with fewer visits to the orthodontist and you might even get done with your treatment a little faster since the pressure on the teeth is steady and constant.\nAfter the braces come off, most people are given retainers to wear that will help hold the teeth in their new spots until the bone sets. Orthodontists recommend that you typically wear them every day for six months to a year, all the time, before switching to night only wear so you prevent having your teeth move into the previous positions.\nWhile you have your braces on, one thing that is not optional is dental care! It’s really important that you keep your teeth clean and that you visit your dentist regularly. Another way to care for your teeth is to use a fluoride rinse that helps keep the teeth strong and also helps rinse out any particles of food that might be stuck in there. When you have braces, you need to be even more careful about brushing and flossing so food particles don’t sit on the teeth and cause decay. Flossing is easier if you use the little tiny brushes that go between the teeth or if you use special floss threaders designed for braces or other dental work. You can ask your dentist what he or she would recommend.\nTo brush your teeth around all of those brackets, start along the underside of the brackets and angle your brush at a 45 degree angle and use small circles as you move along the brackets. Then do the same along the top of the brackets.\nWhen thinking about orthodontic options Aventura, another type that is available is lingual braces. Lingual braces are the same as traditional braces of either metal or ceramic, but the big difference is that they attach to the back of the teeth instead. They are great because they are basically invisible, but because they are on the backside, they can be harder to keep clean. They are also a lot more expensive. Since the backs of teeth are curved and not flat like you find on the front, each bracket has to be custom made. Also, adjusting takes more time so you won’t have appointments that are just in and out.\nThey are sometimes used on children, but most of the time they are an orthodontic option for adults because they are invisible.\nFIVE-STAR PATIENT TESTIMONIALS\nAmazing experience! I’ve had my braces for 6 month now and I’m impressed of how much my teeth have changed. No pain at all. Dr. Ivanov is such a sweet person and very professional, he knows what he’s doing and always cares for patients personal concerns. Highly recommended!\nDr. Ivanov was amazing. When I first got my braces I was scared it was going to last 4yrs for my teeth to look better but it only lasted 2yrs and the results are beyond amazing. I’m really happy with everything and would absolutely recommend him to anyone. Thank you so much.\nVery good experience. The attention was great. The doctor is very punctual and they don’t make you wait, which for my busy schedule is super important. Also, the time the doctor told me I had to wear the braces was the exact time I needed and I was very happy with the results. Definitely recommend him.\nDr. Ivanov was amazing. He was very understanding and took the time to explain, every step of the process for my daughters braces. I am proud to say with great care her braces were finally removed and the end result is the beautiful smile she now has. Thank you\nIvan and his staff made my experience a smooth and convenient process. I am absolutely delighted and satisfied with the progress and how far my teeth has come. Ivan and his staff works effortlessly to ensure that my teeth are perfected beyond my expectations. If I had any other choice I would still choose Ivanov Orthodontic experts.\nMy family and I are so happy with the results of Dr. Ivanov!!! So knowledgeable, kind and always available to answer questions. I am so happy we found him and his staff. I am looking forward to addressing my dental needs now that the family is on track!!! How many can say that about their dental experts. Way to go Dr. Ivanov!!!\nJames C. Murphy\nHe is awesome. You will start seeing changes quick in your smile. He shows passion in his work, he cares about you and your smiles. The office is very nice and great customer service. You will be in good hands if you choose to go with him.\nAnother type of orthodontic options North Miami is clear aligners, known often by the brand name Invisalign. These are plastic trays that you can take out when you want to eat or brush your teeth, then put back in. They are clear and fit closely to your teeth, so a lot of times no one will know you are wearing them. They do take a bit of adjustment time, but once you get used to them, they generally do not cause the level of discomfort that metal braces will since there are no small brackets to catch on the inside of the mouth.\nYou will wear them almost all the time every day for about two years, and a new aligner is switched in every two to three weeks. The aligners move the teeth into position much like braces do, but more gently.\nThese orthodontic options Miami are great for people who have basic alignment issues or gaps they want to close. If more extensive jaw alignment is necessary, they are typically not the best choice. Also, they only come in sizes for teens and adults, so kids are not able to use clear aligners.\nMany times at the end of treatment patients are given plastic retainers that can also be removed for eating and cleaning. They are thin and often colored to match the gums so they aren’t very noticeable. They are formed to fit the teeth and palate exactly so they can hold the teeth in place and not let them drift away while the bones of the jaws finish hardening. Some retainers are affixed to the teeth but these are less common.\nSomething your orthodontist might recommend is wearing a mouth guard. If you are into sports, this is a must! You will want to wear a mouth guard to both protect your teeth and all of the orthodontia you have. There are two kinds – one is more generic and you buy it to cover over everything. The other is one that you heat up either in hot water or the microwave and then bite into so it fits your particular mouth perfectly. This one will provide better individual protection for everything you have. Your dentist might also be able to custom make a mouth guard for you that will be a further step up. The AAO recommends wearing a mouth guard of some sort during sports activity regardless of what kind you choose.\nDental options orthodontics\nThere are some other choices to make, like what office to choose. A modern up to date office with a friendly staff is important. Everyone working there should be skilled and also caring. Sometimes you can find an office that has both a dentist and an orthodontist in the same building, which makes it very convenient.\nFlexible scheduling is also very important. You want to be able to make all of your appointments so be sure to find an office that offers times that work for your schedule to maximize your treatment options.\nYour dentist may have some dental options orthodontics as well, including veneers to correct small teeth or bridges to help fill in gaps. Implants are another option for filling in missing teeth.\nOrthodontic payment options\nBraces can be expensive. They generally run between $3,000 and $8,000 dollars, though some like lingual braces will cost more. Many orthodontists will be more than happy to work out a payment plan to help with making it possible to afford braces.\nAnother one of the orthodontic options to pay for braces is through your dental insurance. A lot of plans cover at least part of the cost for teens and children who need braces. Alternatively, if you have Medicaid or CHIP, you often will have coverage for your kids if their teeth or bite are out of alignment and it is medically necessary for them to have braces.\nSome dental schools will be willing to give you a discounted treatment so long as you are willing to be treated by the students. Don’t worry, your treatment will be overseen by a licensed orthodontist at every step.\nYou might have a Health Savings Account or Flexible Spending Account through your employer. You can often tap into these accounts to pay for your braces, also. Check with your benefits administrator and/or your orthodontist office on how that works.\nSumming it up\nChoosing from the various orthodontic options which type of braces or clear aligners you want is part of putting you on the path to a great smile and a healthy mouth. There are types available for everyone, so no matter what you have going on in your life, you can find a solution that works. With an improved bite, your teeth will wear correctly and last a lot longer. So ask your orthodontist today what orthodontic options are available for you so you can get started.']	['<urn:uuid:c4710632-f6b0-4891-ae73-3a94b082e1ff>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	9	16	2418
14	how to control lighting church background bridal photo	To control the lighting in a church background for bridal photos, first set camera to Manual mode at 1/125 shutter speed. Then adjust f-stop for proper exposure, darken by one stop to make bride silhouetted. The shutter speed acts like a dimmer switch for church lights - lowering it (e.g. to 1/60 or 1/80) will brighten the background, while raising it will darken it.	['Photo Recipes: Mixed Lighting Bridal Shoot\nMixed Lighting Bridal Shoot\nToday I am giving you a behind-the-scenes look at a bridal shoot taken on location in a church. This time, our goal is still to mix the existing light with the light from our flash so the image doesn’t look like it’s lit with a flash (even though we know it is), but we’re going to focus on controlling the room light behind our bride, rather than using window light as an edge light, as we did last issue.\nWe’re not breaking any new ground here regarding positioning—it’s a classic bride-standing-in-the-aisle shot, but the area behind her is dimly lit and we want to see that in our image (seeing the church she was married in is very important to the bride). We’re going to work to control the lighting in the background so we get a nice blend.\nThis behind-the-scenes shot shows the simple, one-light setup I’m using for this shoot. I’m using an Elinchrom Ranger Quadra with one flash head running off a small portable battery pack, and a small square 27″ softbox. (You can do this exact same thing with a hot-shoe flash and a 24″ Lastolite Ezybox Softbox, like the Joe McNally Signature series.) It’s mounted on a regular old lightweight light stand. So, why not use a monopod mount like we did with the groom at the other shoot? Because when you want to break between shoots, you don’t have to look for a place to lean it against or a table to sit it on—you just put it down on the floor, so it’s totally a convenience thing.\nWhen I’m shooting on-location flash, I have a formula for getting the look I’m after. First, turn off the flash, switch to Manual mode, and set the shutter speed to 1/125. (This is my standard shutter speed starting point when I’m shooting location flash. It’s kind of a nice, safe starting point that works.) Now move the f-stop until the meter inside your viewfinder shows your exposure is correct (it’s not under- or overexposed; it’s the proper exposure). If you can’t get to an f-stop that makes a proper exposure (it can get pretty dark in a church), you may have to raise your ISO a bit, say from 100 to 200 or 200 to 400.\nNow, I darken the exposure by at least one stop so I’m intentionally underexposing. If my camera said that at f/2.8 my exposure was correct, I raise it to f/4 to darken it by a full stop, and take another test shot. I’m trying to make the bride so dark that she’s a silhouette, and by darkening the scene a bit more, she is. I’m doing this because I want the bride lit with only the light from my flash, not the ambient light. I want the ambient light to only light the room behind her.\nThere’s one problem with this shot, and it’s that the background (the church) is a little too dark. This is where the shutter speed control comes in because it controls the room lights. Think of it as a dimmer switch for the church lights. If you need to turn up the lights a bit, all you have to do is lower the shutter speed a little. Let’s go from my regular starting place of 1/125 down to 1/60 and see how that looks.\nOnce your subject looks like a silhouette (with only the light from behind lighting the room and not your subject), turn on the flash with a very low power setting and take a test shot (shown here). The light itself looks okay, but the whole scene just looks a bit too bright and that keeps the light from mixing well, so it doesn’t look really beautiful quite yet. However, you can really see the difference lowering the shutter speed from 1/125 down to 1/60 did—the church behind her is much brighter. In fact, I think it’s now too bright, so that was too big a drop in shutter speed. I’m going to have to split the difference. Move the shutter speed up a bit to dim the background lights from where they are now. It doesn’t change the power or brightness of the flash—this just affects the background lighting (remember the dimmer analogy).\nIn this behind-the-scenes shot, I rotated the camera to get a vertical shot, raised the shutter speed to 1/80, and took another test shot. I haven’t changed the power of the light yet at all—it’s around 1/4 power.\nNow you can see we’re starting to get there. The 1/80 shutter speed seems like the sweet spot, so now if\nI make any changes, I’ll probably slightly raise or lower the power of the strobe itself to make sure the light isn’t too bright (a common mistake). If we want it to blend and look natural, it can’t look flashy. It has to make you wonder, “Is that lit with a flash?”\nI use this technique shown here to make the lighting look even better and more dramatic. Once I have a shot where the balance looks pretty good, I take it into Adobe Camera Raw or the Develop module in Lightroom (they’re the exact same thing). I go to the Effects panel, under Post-Crop Vignetting, and drag the Amount slider to the left a little bit to darken the edges around the image, which helps to create a more directional look to the lighting. It looks like the light is centered on the subject and it falls off to dark around her. It’s a simple thing, but it has big impact. Just remember to make this a subtle amount. Now compare this with the image in Figure Six to see how darkening the edges enhances the light.\nAfter looking at the previous image up close, I felt that the area around her eyes looked a little dark, so I had my first assistant, Brad Moore, bring in a reflector to bounce some of the light from the flash back into her eyes. We took a test shot using the silver side of the reflector and it was too bright and too harsh, so we flipped over the reflector to the white side and that did the trick.\nSomeone pointed out a problem when I posted my final image on Twitter. This person noted the bright area of light in the stained glass window to the left of the bride and pointed out that if this was someone else’s image and I were critiquing it on our weekly show The Grid (where once a month, we do blind critiques of submitted images), that I would say it’s distracting. He was right; that’s exactly what I would have said.\nI used the Patch tool (nested under the Spot Healing Brush tool [J]) in Photoshop to remove it. Draw a loose selection around what you want to remove (as shown here), then click the tool inside that selected area and drag to an area with similar tones somewhere else in the image. It snaps back into place and the problem is gone! It works amazingly well in most cases. In this particular case, I dragged straight downward to another area of stained glass and it worked perfectly the first time.\nHere’s the final image again, with my “finishing moves” of darkening the edges with a vignette (just like before) and the standard portrait retouching stuff (removing blemishes, smoothing skin, etc.).\nI hope this article helped you see the light (totally intended pun) on two things: First, the shutter speed controls the amount of light in the room. (If you wanted it completely black behind her, raise the shutter speed to 1/200 with strobes, and 1/250 with hot-shoe flash.) Second, your job is to keep the lighting looking soft and subtle by doing test shots and then looking at the shot and seeing if it’s too flashy. Less is more in situations like that, so if you were going to underlight or overlight, it will look more natural underlit.']	['<urn:uuid:38d34706-470e-4e49-bae2-075e2b09803f>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	8	64	1347
15	how does serpentine form underground explain process origin rocks	Serpentine minerals form through metamorphic alteration of mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks, particularly peridotite and pyroxenite. These source rocks are common in the Earth's mantle but rare at the surface. When exposed, they are often altered by hydrothermal fluids. During this process, the original iron-containing minerals are transformed, with most iron forming separate oxides like magnetite and hematite, while the serpentine structure incorporates mainly magnesium. Antigorite, one type of serpentine, can form at high temperatures up to 600°C at depths of around 60 km, while other varieties like lizardite typically form near the Earth's surface.	"['Serpentine is a mineral group that contains chrysotile, antigorite, and lizardite. A rock type that is composed mostly of serpentine group minerals is serpentinite. I chose to leave out chrysotile for now because this mineral has distinctly different appearance and properties from the other two. It has a fibrous habit and is the most widely used asbestos mineral. It definitely deserves a separate article. Here I will continue with antigorite and lizardite which are not fibrous and are therefore much better suited to become sand grains.\nFibrous serpentine chrysotile from the Sayan Mountains in Siberia. Width of sample is 8 cm.\nSerpentine (Mg3Si2O5(OH)4) is a metamorphic mineral group. It was made at an expense of mafic and especially ultramafic igneous rocks like peridotite and pyroxenite. Such rocks are common in the mantle but quite rare at the surface. When they do crop out, they are often altered by hydrothermal fluids. Hence, we often see meta-peridotite instead of real peridotite. The original mineralogy of the rocks is significantly changed. Rocks that are mostly composed of these minerals are called serpentinites. It often contains all three mineral varieties — fibrous chrysotile veins often alternating with massive antigorite/lizardite. Serpentine may also form in contact metamorphosed carbonate rocks.\nAntigorite and lizardite may have a very similar appearance. Thus, there is no reliable method to say which is which in a hand sample. Distinguishing between the two requires more sophisticated approach but even X-ray diffraction may give ambiguous results because they are structurally similar minerals and they tend to occur together.\nAntigorite and lizardite are mostly green and they look greasy or waxy. Both light and dark green colors are possible. Mineral grains are darker when they contain more magnetite inclusions. It is easy to make sure that they mostly do contain lots of tiny magnetite crystals because serpentine grains are usually highly susceptible to magnetic field although the mineral itself is not magnetic at all.\nWhy do they contain magnetite inclusions? To understand that we first have to take a look at the chemical composition of pyroxenes and olivine which are the source material of serpentine. They both usually contain iron but serpentine contains very little iron (its chemical formula contains none but small amount of Mg ions may be replaced with Fe). Most of the iron ions of the precursor minerals are not incorporated into the crystal structure of serpentine, so they tend to form separate iron oxides, most frequently magnetite and hematite.\nAntigorite and lizardite may form sand grains but they have only a local importance near the rocks containing these minerals. Serpentine usually alters to chlorite. Good place to look for serpentine are ophiolite sequences. Ophiolite is a piece of oceanic lithosphere that is tectonically pushed on top of the continental crust. The grains below are from a beach sample collected in Corse, France. An ophiolite sequence is exposed there.\nAntigorite grains picked from a sand sample collected in Northern Corse near Albo. The darker the grains, the more magnetic they are. The wedge-shaped grain on the left that is significantly darker in the upper corner is an especially good example. It flips its darker side towards the hand magnet if the magnet is slowly moved towards the grain. The width of the view is 17 mm.\nMagnesite (white) and serpentine from Norway. Magnesite and serpentine frequently occur together. Magnesite is a magnesium carbonate that forms in low- to medium-grade metamorphic conditions if there was carbon dioxide available. Width of sample 24 cm.\nSerpentine minerals occur in skarns. These are metasomatic rocks (metamorphism with extensive change in the bulk chemical composition) that formed as silicic magma reacted with carbonate rocks. Skarns often contain metallic ore minerals and unusual Ca-bearing silicates. Serpentine is widespread here because the host rock is dolomitic marble that provided lots of magnesium. Gray mineral is magnetite (iron oxide). Tapuli, Sweden. Width of sample 11 cm.\nSkarn sample consisting of serpentine and hedenbergite (iron-rich Ca-clinopyroxene). Tapuli, Sweden. Width of sample 13 cm.\nSkarn with magnetite (gray), serpentine (yellowish green), talc (dark green and micaceous), and calcite (white) as the dominating minerals. Tapuli, Sweden. Width of sample 9 cm.', 'The serpentine group are greenish, brownish, or spotted minerals commonly found in serpentinite rocks. They are used as a source of magnesium and asbestos, and as a decorative stone. The two most common members are antigorite, and the chrysotile group of minerals. The chrysotile group of minerals are polymorphous, meaning that they have the same chemical formulae, but the molecules are arranged into different structures, or crystal lattices. Asbestos, which has a fiberous habit, is in the chrysotile group. Other minerals in the group may have a platy habit. The name is thought to come from the greenish color being that of a serpent.\nThe serpentine group describes a group of common rock-forming hydrous magnesium iron phyllosilicate ((Mg, Fe)3Si2O5(OH)4) minerals; they may contain minor amounts of other elements including chromium, manganese, cobalt or nickel. In mineralogy and gemology, serpentine may refer to any of 20 varieties belonging to the serpentine group. Owing to admixture, these varieties are not always easy to individualize, and distinctions are not usually made. There are three important mineral polymorphs of serpentine: antigorite, chrysotile and lizardite.\nTheir olive green color and smooth or scaly appearance is the basis of the name from the Latin serpentinus, meaning ""serpent rock,"" according to Best (2003). They have their origins in metamorphic alterations of peridotite and pyroxene. Serpentines may also pseudomorphously replace other magnesium silicates. Alterations may be incomplete, causing physical properties of serpentines to vary widely. Where they form a significant part of the land surface, the soil is unusually high in clay.\nAntigorite is the polymorph of serpentine that most commonly forms during metamorphism of wet ultramafic rocks and is stable at the highest temperatures—to over 600 °C at depths of 60 km or so. In contrast, lizardite and chrysotile typically form near the Earth\'s surface and break down at relatively low temperatures, probably well below 400 °C. It has been suggested that chrysotile is never stable relative to either of the other two serpentine polymorphs.\nSamples of the oceanic crust and uppermost mantle from ocean basins document that ultramafic rocks there commonly contain abundant serpentine. Antigorite contains water in its structure, about 13 percent by weight. Hence, antigorite may play an important role in the transport of water into the earth in subduction zones and in the subsequent release of water to create magmas in island arcs, and some of the water may be carried to yet greater depths.\nSoils derived from serpentine are toxic to many plants, because of high levels of nickel, chromium, and cobalt; growth of many plants is also inhibited by low levels of potassium and phosphorus and a low ratio of calcium/magnesium. The flora is generally very distinctive, with specialised, slow-growing species. Areas of serpentine-derived soil will show as strips of shrubland and open, scattered small trees (often conifers) within otherwise forested areas; these areas are called serpentine barrens.\nMost serpentines are opaque to translucent, light (specific gravity between 2.2–2.9), soft (hardness 2.5–4), infusible and susceptible to acids. All are microcrystalline and massive in habit, never being found as single crystals. Luster may be vitreous, greasy or silky. Colours range from white to grey, yellow to green, and brown to black, and are often splotchy or veined. Many are intergrown with other minerals, such as calcite and dolomite. Occurrence is worldwide; New Caledonia, Canada (Quebec), USA (northern California, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland and southern Pennsylvania), Afghanistan, Britain (Cornwall and Ireland), Greece (Thessaly), China, France, Korea, Austria (Styria and Carinthia), India (Assam, and Manipur), Myanmar (Burma), New Zealand, Norway and Italy are notable localities.\nRock composed primarily of these minerals is called serpentinite. Serpentines find use in industry for a number of purposes, such as railway ballasts, building materials, and the asbestiform types find use as thermal and electrical insulation (chrysotile asbestos). The asbestos content can be released to the air when serpentine is excavated and if it is used as a road surface, forming a long term health hazard by breathing. Asbestos from serpentine can also appear at low levels in water supplies through normal weathering processes, but there is as yet no identified health hazard associated with use or ingestion. In its natural state, some forms of serpentine react with carbon dioxide and re-release oxygen into the atmosphere.\nThe more attractive and durable varieties (all of antigorite) are termed ""noble"" or ""precious"" serpentine and are used extensively as gems and in ornamental carvings. The town of Bhera in the historic Punjab province of the Indian subcontinent was known for centuries for finishing a relatively pure form of green serpentine obtained from quarries in Afghanistan into lapidary work, cups, ornamental sword hilts, and dagger handles. This high-grade serpentine ore was known as sang-i-yashm or to the English, false jade, and was used for generations by Indian craftsmen for lapidary work. It is easily carved, taking a good polish, and is said to have a pleasingly greasy feel. Less valuable serpentine ores of varying hardness and clarity are also sometimes dyed to imitate jade. Misleading synonyms for this material include ""Suzhou jade"", ""Styrian jade"", and ""New jade"".\nThe lapis atracius of the Romans, now known as verde antique, or verde antico, is a serpentinite breccia popular as a decorative facing stone. In classical times it was mined at Casambala, Thessaly, Greece. Serpentinite marbles are also widely used: Green Connemara marble (or Irish green marble) from Connemara, Ireland (and many other sources), and red Rosso di Levanto marble from Italy. Use is limited to indoor settings as serpentinites do not weather well.\nLamellated antigorite occurs in tough, pleated masses. It is usually dark green in colour, but may also be yellowish, gray, brown or black. It has a hardness of 3.5–4 and its lustre is greasy. The monoclinic crystals show micaceous cleavage and fuse with difficulty. Antigorite is named after its type locality, the Valle di Antigorio in Italy.\nBowenite is an especially hard serpentine (5.5) of a light to dark apple green colour, often mottled with cloudy white patches and darker veining. It is the serpentine most frequently encountered in carving and jewellery. The name retinalite is sometimes applied to yellow bowenite. The New Zealand material is called tangiwai.\nAlthough not an official species, bowenite is the state mineral of Rhode Island: this is also the variety\'s type locality. A bowenite cabochon featured as part of the ""Our Mineral Heritage Brooch"", was presented to First Lady Mrs. Lady Bird Johnson in 1967.\nWilliamsite is a local varietal name for antigorite that is oil-green with black crystals of chromite or magnetite often included. Somewhat resembling fine jade, williamsite is cut into cabochons and beads. It is found mainly in Maryland and Pennsylvania, USA.\nState emblem \nSee also \n- Serpentinite, rock composed mostly of sepentine minerals\n|Wikimedia Commons has media related to: Serpentine|\n|Wikisource has the text of a 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica article about Serpentine.|\n- Serpentine, American Heritage Dictionary\n- Minerals.net, Serpentine, \n- Serpentine, Encyclopedia Britannica, 1911, s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Serpentine (mineral)\n- National Park Service\n- Hunter, Sir William Wilson and Burn, Sir Richard, The Imperial Gazeteer of India, Vol. 3, Oxford, England: Clarendon Press, Henry Frowde Publishers (1907), p. 242\n- ""Slate – The Delta Story: A Heritage To Be Preserved"".

16	breed differences cattle dna markers tracking	DNA markers are useful but have limitations for tracking breed differences. While mitochondrial DNA analysis can effectively differentiate cattle belonging to European, African and Asian haplogroups, some genetic markers like the κ-casein gene (CSN3) show high diversity within breeds rather than between breeds. Research on Russian cattle breeds found that CSN3 variation was actually greater within individual breeds than among different breeds, making it unsuitable for determining breed relationships. However, these genetic markers remain valuable for other purposes - mtDNA helps trace geographic origins, while CSN3 variants correlate with commercially important traits like milk quality and cheese production potential.	"[""GENEBANK ANALYSIS: SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS OF ANIMALS MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME UKRAINIAN GRAY AND UKRAINIAN WHITEHEAD CATTLE BREEDS\nExamination of variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences has been pivotal in the elucidation of bovine phylogeography. Initial studies have demonstrated a deep bifurcation in bovine mtDNA phylogeny, which indicates a predomestic divergence between the two major taxa of cattle, humped zebu (Bos indicus) and humpless taurine (Bos taurus). Subsequent genetic investigations have yielded further inference regarding origins within the B. taurus lineage. B. taurus mtDNA sequences fall into one of five ancestral star-like haplotypic clusters, which are geographically distributed. Just one of these clusters, T3, predominates in Western Europe. Symmetrically, diversity within Africa is composed almost exclusively of members of a separate haplotypic cluster, T1, which is rarely detected elsewhere. The almost mutually exclusive geographic distribution of these two haplotypic clusters allows geographical exceptions to be securely identified as secondary introductions.\nWe investigated a comparative analysis of mitochondrial genome sequences for different breeds of cattle (Bos taurus, Bos indicus) with global genetic bank. Mitochondrial DNA sequences from bovine animals (Bos taurus) breeds Ukrainian Whitehead and Ukrainian Gray freely available on the global genetic bank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genebank/). Local alignment of sequences for mitochondrial genome of different cattle breeds was performed using the program MEGA 4.0. For the detection of nucleotide replacements used mitochondrial DNA sequence of Bos taurus Hereford breed (Anderson S. at al., 1982) as a reference (accession number V00645).\nHere we report the analysis results of testing for 9 genotypes Ukrainian Gray mitochondrial DNA sequences showed that one animal (GQ129208) has haplotype Bos indicus, other belongs to haplogroup T1 with European origin mtDNA. Analysis of single nucleotide replacement in one of the hypervariable regions mtDNA (position number 16019-16339) shows, that among 10 submitted genotypes of Ukrainian Whitehead the 3 of them (FJ014303, FJ014298, FJ014294) relating to T1a mtDNA haplogroup of African origin, which characterized by replacement of T to C at position 16255. Also have been two animals (FJ014301, FJ014295) with single nucleotide replacements with relatives to Bos indicus mtDNA haplogroup.\nWe performed alignment with reference sequences (Bos_taurus_v00654.1) and comparative nucleotide sequences analysis of another hypervariable D-loop (position number 1-240) mtDNA with 5 Ukrainian Whitehead genotypes and 5 Ukrainian Gray genotypes represented in genetics bank. Among the Ukrainian Whitehead genotypes (FJ014298, FJ014297, FJ014296, FJ014295, FJ014294) all were polymorphic that characterizes large differentiation these animals for maternal and describe deep heterogeneous parent population of studied group. We determined one animal with genotype FJ014295 was significantly different by the number of segregation sites. The analyzed sequences (FJ014290, FJ014289, FJ014288, FJ014287, FJ014286) of 5 Ukrainian Gray genotypes showed no polymorphism in hypervariable D-loop (position number 1-240) mtDNA.\nThe mtDNA analysis of different species of animals allowed to distribute their mtDNA belonging to European, African and Asian haplogroups. The technique, which allows to differentiate the animals represented by their belonging to the respective haplogroups. The process that gave rise to different genotypes in one lineage is clearly of fundamental importance in understanding intraspecific mitochondrial polymorphism and evolution in mammals.\nСomprehensive study genetic material provide more opportunities to optimize costs in-situ conservation of different cattle breeds, to optimize methods and techniques which used in ex-situ conservation programmes of National gene bank of animal genetic resources.\n2.

Typing alleles A and B of CSN3 is of practical importance, because allele B is correlated with commercially valuable parameters of milk productivity (protein content and milk yield) and improves the cheese yielding capacity. The frequencies of the B allele of CSN3 in the breeds studied vary from 0.16 to 0.50; and those of the AB and BB genotypes, from 0.27 to 0.60 and from 0.02 to 0.23, respectively. The Yaroslavl breed had the highest frequencies of CSN3 allele B and genotype BB (0.50 and 0.23, respectively). The frequencies of the B allele and BB genotype in other breeds studied varied from 0.25 to 0.32 and from 0.03 to 0.09, respectively. In none of the breeds studied have the observed and expected heterozygosities been found to differ from each other significantly. However, the observed genotype distributions significantly differ from the expected one in some herds (in most such cases, an excess of heterozygotes is observed). Two herds of the Yaroslavl breed dramatically differ from each other in the heterozygosity level: a deficit (D = −0.14) and an excess (D = 0.20) of heterozygotes have been observed at the Mikhailovskoe and Gorshikha farms, respectively. In general, however, the heterozygosity of the Yaroslavl breed corresponds to the expected level (D = 0.04). Analysis of breeds for homogeneity with the use of Kulback’s test has shown that all cattle breeds studied are heterogeneous, the CSN3 diversity within breeds being higher than that among different breeds, which is confirmed by low F st values (0.0025–0.0431). Thus, a DNA marker based on CSN3 gene polymorphism is extremely important for breeding practice as a marker of milk quality; however, it is inapplicable to marking differences between breeds or phylogenetic relationships between cattle breeds because of the high diversity with respect to this locus within breeds.\nRussian Journal of Genetics – Springer Journals\nPublished: Jan 24, 2007\nIt’s your single place to instantly\ndiscover and read the research\nthat matters to you.\nEnjoy affordable access to\nover 18 million articles from more than\n15,000 peer-reviewed journals.\nAll for just $49/month\nQuery the DeepDyve database, plus search all of PubMed and Google Scholar seamlessly\nSave any article or search result from DeepDyve, PubMed, and Google Scholar... all in one place.\nGet unlimited, online access to over 18 million full-text articles from more than 15,000 scientific journals.\nRead from thousands of the leading scholarly journals from SpringerNature, Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford University Press and more.\nAll the latest content is available, no embargo periods.\n“Hi guys, I cannot tell you how much I love this resource.

Our latest effort through the Rosetta mission has taught us that the water on Earth is\nnot from this one specific comet. The search continues and space is part of the answer.\nTo preserve, manage and optimise the use of all bodies of water should be one of the highest\npriorities of our time.\nThe economy of these bodies remains greatly unexplored and our scientific knowledge about them\nand the ecosystems they host is still far from being exhaustive.\nIt is for this reason that Portugal has defined as its vision to become by 2030 a widely recognised\nglobal authority in the science and economics of space-oceans-climate interactions for the\nadvancement and well-being of all humankind. Through the founding of the AIR CENTER and its new\nnational space agency, Portugal Space, Portugal has clearly indicated its commitment – political and\nfinancial – to this goal through assets in space and on ground and through a multi-disciplinary and\nThis summer has seen much news around our seas and oceans: from migration, to illegal maritime\nactivities and piracy, to a 150 km2 area covered with volcanic rock discovered in the middle of the\nPacific, to the landing of Sargasso in Mexico, to the death of marine life due to plastic waste, and\nThe Mediterranean is one of the busiest bodies of water and a treasure and great responsibility for\nall countries that boast a piece of it as a part of their national territory. But water flows and ignores\nnational boundaries and it would be overly simplistic to define the challenges of the Mediterranean\na problem of those countries alone. It is a joint responsibility and activities should be a common\nBeyond and to complement the on-going activities in all countries that are around the table today,\nPortugal puts forward the proposal of a joint-effort in observing and monitor our bodies of water\nwith a joint constellation of small satellites co-owned by different countries and their interested\nentities to provide data and services to different end-users. Direct receiving stations in different\nparticipating nations would give each country the autonomy of organising their own institutional\nneeds and users independent of other partners in this joint endeavour.\nI take this opportunity to reach out to you with this proposal in the hope that you will reach back to\nus and that we may start on this endeavour before the end of this year.\nI wish you a fruitful conference and look forward to a common positive future together.']	['<urn:uuid:9f63dbc6-21f3-4c86-a9b4-43c2f17e5074>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	19	59	589
18	indian philosophy and john dewey views on education purpose	Indian philosophy of education emphasizes building up a sound system of education based on tradition and culture, with the goal of shaping the inner potentiality of learners through an integrated approach. It has evolved through various stages including monastic, scholastic, realistic, idealistic and pragmatic trends. John Dewey, as an educational innovator, viewed education as intertwined with democratic government and social reform, focusing on the relation between inquiry and human experience. Both perspectives recognize education's role in cultural development, though they approach it from different philosophical foundations.	"['INDIAN PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION AND PEDAGOGY\nINDIAN PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION AND PEDAGOGY: AN ESSENTIAL PROPOSITION\nProf. N.B. Biswas*\nEpistemology and pedagogy both the concepts are philosophical in its origin. The present century demands an integrated teacher who can shape the inner potentiality of a learner through an integrated approach of knowledge of the content area and of the philosophy of teaching. Since, India won Independence; attempt has been made to formulate a national education policy. It has been essential to evolve an Indian philosophy of education in the light of the tradition and culture upheld by Swami Vivekananda, Rabindra Nath Tagore, M. K. Gandhi, Sri Aurobindo and others. Every nation needs an educational philosophy for building up a sound system of education. India has passed through various stages of development during different periods. Since Brahmanistic education it has followed the monastic scholastic, realistic, idealistic and pragmatic trends when values changed and new priorities emerged. India is a land where values have emerged and influenced the cultural life of the land. The cross-cultural studies of modern values show an increasing tendency towards materialistic and self-centered outlook. The world in which we live today is shrinking every day, but every nation is busy in building a wall of prejudice. This is why we need to develop an Indian Philosophy of Education.\nSince 1944 and uptil now about 150 philosophical studies have been carried out on education, out of which only 10 studies have been specially conducted on Indian philosophy of Education. Remaining studies are conducted either on the life and work of Educational thinkers and philosophers. Hardly any attempt has been made to study the Indian philosophy of education as a whole or of its implication in present situation. It reveals that the educational implications of total thought of the Indian system and the thinkers have not been studied carefully in the context of actual situation in the schools. Doctoral theses have been written about the Educational work related to Indian Philosophy and also of Rabindra Nath Tagore, M.K. Gandhi, Shri Aurobindo and others, but such a theses have usually the rather specific objective of obtaining a degree and it does not , as a rule , become part of the stream of academic thinking or find its way to the teachers. I think, some of the renowned scholars like S.K.Das, R.K.Mukaerjee, S.P Chaube, J. Krishnamurthi, R.S. Pandey, J. Krishanmurthi etc have written some books on Indian Philosophy of Education which are very useful for building up discipline of Indian Philosophy of Education.\nThus it is necessary for students of Indian education to ask ourselves why the philosophy or the ideas which these thinkers have advocated so persuasively have failed to evoke sufficient response, why there has been a resistance, or at least indifference, to their acceptance in the day- to-day work of the educational institutions. This gap between theory and practice is alarming. The present research paper entitled ‘Indian philosophy of education and pedagogy: an essential proposition’ is designed with a view to find out the answers of those issues and also to abridge for fulfilling the gap.\n*Dean, A.M.

Dewey\'s insights into the problems of public education, immigration, the prospects for democratic government, and the relation of religious faith to science are as fresh today as when they were first published. His penetrating treatments of the nature and function of philosophy, the ethical and aesthetic dimensions of life, and the role of inquiry in human experience are of increasing relevance at the turn of the 21st century.\nBased on the award-winning 37-volume critical edition of Dewey\'s work, The Essential Dewey presents for the first time a collection of Dewey\'s writings that is both manageable and comprehensive. The volume includes essays and book chapters that exhibit Dewey\'s intellectual development over time; the selection represents his mature thinking on every major issue to which he turned his attention. Eleven part divisions cover: Dewey in Context; Reconstructing Philosophy; Evolutionary Naturalism; Pragmatic Metaphysics; Habit, Conduct, and Language; Meaning, Truth, and Inquiry; Valuation and Ethics; The Aims of Education; The Individual, the Community, and Democracy; Pragmatism and Culture: Science and Technology, Art and Religion; and Interpretations and Critiques.

Whether it is a slab or crawlspace, the first inspection is for the foundation upon which your home is built.\nPhase Inspection Process\nThere are three opportunities available during the building cycle that are recommended to have your third-party inspector evaluate and report on the workmanship and construction of your new home. The standard 3 phase inspection process is utilized to ensure that major construction defects within your home are not covered up.\nThere is a market for these types of inspections for a reason. Additionally, most high-quality home builders fully welcome a third-party inspection. The new construction phase inspection is conducted at three separate times.\nConcrete foundation (Pre-pour) Inspections\nThere is significant value in having your foundation inspected prior to pour day. If you are considering having your foundation inspected there are a few things you should plan for. First, understand that pinpointing the specific date of the pour day is crucial.\nFailure to install your home’s foundation in accordance with the engineered plans can have a devastating impact on the integrity of your home’s foundation. Furthermore, there are numerous workmanship defects that are present on nearly every foundation that can impact the visible appearance as well as the bearing capacity of the foundation.\nWhen to Schedule the Pre-Pour Inspection\nOnce the concrete is poured, the opportunity to have your foundation inspected is gone. It takes time to coordinate with concrete companies for the required concrete for your foundation. That means, your builder knows a few days in advance when they plan on pouring. The best time for the pre-pour inspection is typically two days prior to the actual pour day. This will help ensure that the foundation is ready to inspect, as well as give the builder sufficient time to make any and all needed corrections, or postpone the pour day.\nUpon completion of the on-site inspection, Pro-Tech Inspections will return to the office and begin working on your report. The report will be comprised of photographs and locations of each defect, as well as the relevant references for issues discovered during the inspection. This helps ensure that once your builder has the report, the required corrections can be implemented.\n3 Common Foundation Installation Problems\nImproper Post Tension Cable\nThis photo shows the installation of a Post-tensioned cable that is over-spanned and under supported. The plans for this foundation called for #3 rebar at 48 inches on center. This tendon was characteristic of every tendon installed within the foundation. When tendons are not properly supported, the weight of the concrete, as well as the concrete workers, will drive the tendon into the ground, severely limiting the amount of concrete coverage and potential bearing integrity of the exterior footers. If your inspector is familiar with reading the foundation plans while on site, documenting and addressing these issues become much more efficient.\nUndersized Reinforcing Bar\nAnother common problem is an undersized reinforcing bar. It is important for the integrity of the foundation, and compliance with the designed plans, that all corners, entrant walls, and other designed areas have the appropriate amount and size of rebar. Another important component is the support and fastening of the rebar within your homes’ foundation. The picture to the right shows rebar that was not properly sized. When located at the corners of a post-tensioned foundation, this can increase the probability of corner-pops.\nPoor Grading/Rain Water Management\nAnother common issue with the installation of your home’s foundation is standing water and poor grading and drainage. Grading is typically done by builders after the foundation has been poured, and sometimes later. This directs any recent rainfall into the foundation beams. This will significantly reduce the strength of the concrete when it mixes with the water, and should be avoided.']"	['<urn:uuid:98d19a26-1083-413c-bf2a-0eef12f10746>', '<urn:uuid:749d8b10-41b4-44da-8d92-b34154fdca7b>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	13	54	1254
21	At what frequency do the depth and presence controls intersect?	The crossover point for the two controls is at about 600Hz.	"['The Soldano Super Lead Overdrive has always had a presence control in the feedback circuit. A depth/resonance control, on the other hand, was originally an optional feature.\n""Historically, one of the most popular SLO \'mods\' is the addition of a DEPTH control to the amplifier\'s power section. The Depth control is now standard on the SLO-100. The combination of the Depth and Presence controls provides a powerful EQ section that goes well beyond a typical tone stack, enhancing the tonal possibilities of the amp\'s sonic character."" 1 -Soldano Custom Amplification\nThe depth control (circa 2007) is fed from the 4Ω tap of the output transformer secondary.\nAccording to the Phase Inverter Bass Response calculator, the 0.047μF coupling capacitors create a flat response over guitar frequencies while attenuating sub-audio signals.\nVoltage gain is approximately 27.\nNew! Guitar Amplifier Electronics: Fender Deluxe - from TV front to narrow panel to brownface to blackface Reverb\nThe power tubes are biased at -59V, so at full power the signal at their grids is 59V peak, 42V RMS. The SLO is designed to produce 100 watts, so the RMS voltage at the 4Ω tap is\nVoltage gain from the power tube grids to the 4Ω tap is\n20V / 42V = 0.48 (-6.4dB)\nThe forward (open-loop) gain from the phase inverter input to the 4Ω tap is therefore\n(27)(0.48) = 13 (22dB)\nThis is the gain without feedback.\nGuitar Amplifier Electronics: Basic Theory - master the basics of preamp, power amp, and power supply design.\nFeedback is maximum when the depth control is set to minimum resistance, the presence control is at maximum resistance, and when the frequency is high enough for the 0.1μF capacitors to act as short circuits. Under these conditions the feedback network between the 4Ω tap and the 12AX7 grid can be approximated by a simple voltage divider.\nThe feedback voltage ""gain"" is\n4.7kΩ / (4.7kΩ + 39kΩ) = 0.108 (-19dB)\nClosed-loop voltage gain is therefore2\nThis is 7dB less than open-loop gain.\nFundamentals of Guitar Amplifier System Design - design your amp using a structured, professional methodology.\nWith the depth control at maximum resistance, the break frequency for the 0.0047μF capacitor is\nHere is a SPICE AC analysis simulation3 from the phase inverter input to the 4Ω speaker tap for three settings of the depth control: minimum (zero resistance, blue), 50-percent rotation (10-percent resistance, red), and maximum (1MΩ, green).\nWith both controls at zero resistance, the 0.1μF capacitor above the presence control has a break frequency of approximately\nHere is the response with the depth control at minimum (zero resistance) and the presence control at minimum (25kΩ, green), 50-percent rotation (10-percent resistance, red), and maximum (zero resistance, blue).\nGuitar Amplifier Electronics: Circuit Simulation - know your design works by measuring performance at every point in the amplifier.\nHere is a simulation that steps both controls through the previously plotted knob positions, for a total of 9 combinations of control settings.\nSoldano\'s choice of parts values creates a broad palette of feedback control with a 7dB range. The crossover point for the two controls is at about 600Hz. With both controls at minimum, the phase inverter and power amp response is flat, negative feedback is at maximum, and there is a feedback-induced accelerated transition to overdrive.4 With controls at maximum, there is a slight amount of middle scoop and a more gradual transition into distortion as the power tubes are overdriven.\n1Soldano product description.

22	What are the specific operating temperatures for molten silicon and molten salt when used in concentrated solar power storage systems?	Silicon melts at about 1,400° C, while salt melts at 801° C and is stored at about 566° C.	['Solar power is critical to meeting the world’s need for zero emissions electricity. But solar alone cannot meet the requirements of a 24 hour energy grid. There needs to be some way to store it so it can be put to use after the sun goes down. Researchers in Spain are exploring the possibility of using molten silicon as a storage medium in what is known as a concentrated solar power system or CSP.\nOver the years, many systems have been tried for storing electrical power. In Wales, National Grid operates Electric Mountain. It has a lake at the top and another at the bottom. Inside the mountain are enormous conduits that pump water uphill when electrical power is abundant. When a need for extra electricity arises, the water flows back downhill, spinning turbines as it falls.\nIn the deserts of Nevada, a start-up company wants to build a railway to nowhere. Freight cars loaded with hundreds of tons of concrete blocks would be dragged uphill during the day, only to roll back down again at night, generating electricity as they descend. Also in Nevada, with its open land and abundant sunshine, the Crescent Dunes CSP facility is now online and generating electricity sufficient for about 75,000 homes.\nInstead of using solar panels, Crescent Dunes concentrates the sun’s rays to melt salt. The molten salt is than stored in tanks until there is a need for electrical power. It is then used to heat water to make steam to turn conventional turbines. The facility can continue to make electricity for up to 10 hours after the sun sets.\nResearchers at the Solar Energy Institute of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid are working on technology they say that molten silicone is far more efficient than molten salt. It is able to store 1 MWh of energy per cubic meter — 10 times the capacity of molten salt. The researchers say molten silicon is more abundant and less expensive than molten salt. Silicon is the most abundant element in the earth’s crust and melts at about 1,400° C. Salt melts at 801° C and is stored at about 566° C.\nSilicone has another important advantage. “At such high temperatures, silicon intensely shines in the same way that the sun does, thus photovoltaic cells, thermophotovoltaic cells in this case, can be used to convert this incandescent radiation into electricity,” Alejandro Datas, a researcher on the project told Science Daily.\nThermophotovoltaic cells can produce 100 times more electric power per unit area than conventional solar cells and have higher conversion efficiencies, even over 50%. The researchers say that can result in a compact system with no moving parts that can operate silently and uses inexpensive materials.\nThere is one more thing to consider. Today, there is a movement toward using lithium ion batteries for grid storage. Lithium is rare and hard to get. Its cost is going up as more batteries are produced. Silicone is plentiful and cheap. Are we seeing the beginning of a system for creating and storing electrical power that will be even less expensive than the amazing low prices set recently on world markets? Perhaps the advent of cheap, abundant, zero emission electrical power is close at hand.\nSource: Utility Dive']	['<urn:uuid:8ff31e07-3985-4784-9c11-67adc7b01171>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	20	19	541
23	no salary gaming team prize split	For situations where players don't receive a salary but split prize winnings, the commercial terms of the player's engagement should be documented clearly and unambiguously in writing, preferably in a formal written contract.	['Like traditional sports, player contracts are a necessity for professional Esports players and teams alike. But what should teams/organisation think about before drawing up a player contract and what should be covered in the contract?\nIn this interview, we ask Sheridans’ solicitor Chris Paget for the expert lowdown.\nWhat kind of things should an esports organisation owner consider when creating a player contract?\nChris Paget : What should be included in an esports player contract will, ultimately, depend on the context of the team, the player and the competitions in which it competes. However, there are a couple of important points outlined below that should be considered before drawing up a player contract:\nFairness and Enforceability:\nThere is no point in having a very long and complicated contract which the player is unlikely to understand. First and foremost, it may not be enforceable. It may also be advisable to include an executive summary of the main contractual terms.\nThought should be given to the age of the player that the organisation is looking to sign. If the player is under the age of 18 then the contract may be unenforceable against the player. Therefore, it will be important for the player’s parent or legal guardian to sign off on the agreement, and then put in place a plan of action for when the player turns 18.\nThe agreements will have to meet the minimum legal thresholds to constitute a legally binding contract, namely; contain an offer, an acceptance of that offer, consideration, intention to create legal relations and certainty of terms.\nRelationship of parties:\nThe agreement should set out the basis on which the parties are contracting. Is the relationship an employment relationship or is the player providing services on a consultancy/contractor basis?\nWhile the agreement may not be determinative in this regard (for example there could be an argument that the relationship is actually an employment relationship) if the organisation knows how they want to contract with the player/individual (ie: as a contractor not employee), then it can be drafted in such a way as to alleviate a certain amount of the risk of an employment relationship being created.\nThe relationship between organisation and player will also have other consequences, such as tax, implied statutory employment rights and the right to a pension.\nWill the player be contracted to the organisation on an exclusive (i.e.: the player can’t play for another organisation) or non-exclusive basis or will parts of the engagement be exclusive and other not?\nHow will the player be paid, when and what bonus or other remuneration structures (such as profit shares) will be in place and what expenses and other benefits will the team make/reimburse?\nThe agreement should clearly set out what the obligations are on each party, how they are to be performed and when they are to be performed. Such as the player must use their best efforts when competing for the team, always wear team clothing when on team duty and comply with applicable integrity rules and regulations (whether put in place by the organisation, the leagues or competitions that the organisation compete in, or otherwise). The agreement should also set out the consequences if a party fails to perform their obligations.\nRestrictions & Security:\nWill there be any restrictions in place on the player, for example, the player’s ability to enter personal endorsement agreements or other third party agreements that may compete with agreements/arrangements that the organisation/team has entered into?\nThere may also be the possibility to include certain post-Term restrictions. However, whether or not these should or can be included will be dependent on the type of agreement you have in place, as well as the leagues/competitions in which the organisation/team participates\nIs it appropriate to have a form of buy-out or release clause? This is a clause in the contract that requires that certain obligations (such as a payment of money) must be performed before the player can be released from the contract. Specific advice should be sought in relation to these buyout or release clauses to ensure that they are given the best opportunity of being enforceable.\nThe agreement should set out how long the contract will last, and whether it can be ended (or terminated) early. If it can be ended early, what are the circumstances that trigger this right?\nIt is especially important in esports contracts for the products of the services (and the IP created) to be dealt with. Who owns the IP, are there any restrictions on how it can be used, or where it can be used, or the timings of when it can be used. For example, what rights to the organisations/teams have to use the player’s image, in-game names or any recordings of the player while on team duty?\nContracting law and jurisdiction:\nThe agreement should set out what law governs the contract and which courts have jurisdiction to hear disputes.\nWhy are contracts important for teams?\nThere are numerous reasons why esports organisations should have contracts in place with their players, a few of these reasons are touched upon below:\nIf they are constructed and executed correctly, they provide a legally binding document confirming the exact terms of the agreement/relationship between the organisation and the player, which is to the benefit of both parties\nThey provide a source of security to both the organisation and the player regarding the relationship between them.\n– For the player, this covers their rights and welfare; and\n– For the organisation, the players are its greatest asset (both in terms of their gaming expertise and also the value that they add to the organisation from a sponsorship/marketing/commercialisation perspective) and the contract provides a form of stability. It should facilitate the organisation in building a stable roster, which in turn should lead to the ability to create fan and public engagement, a team identity and a narrative around the organisation and its players. All of this should also assist with sourcing sponsorship and funding.\nThe contract indicates to the market that the organisation is a professionally run organisation, which (provided the contract is reasonable and fair) demonstrates the value that it places in its players and sophistication in the way that it approaches participation/business.\nWhat are your views on players not having a salary with amateur teams, but instead taking a split of any potential prize winnings? Should the players play without a contract in this case, and trust the organisation?\nThe first part of the question is hard to answer as it is predicated on the context and situation of the organisation. However, in relation to the second part, my view is that the agreement in relation to the commercial terms of the player’s engagement should be documented clearly and unambiguously in writing, and preferably in a formal written contract.\nIs there any other advice around contracts you’d like to give to UK teams, players and organisation owners?\nFor teams, it would be to acknowledge that your players are your most important asset, so they should treat them as such.\nFor players, it would be to always understand what is being asked of you (whether in a contract or otherwise), and what the potential implications and ramifications are to you. So, taking the example of a player contract from a team, make sure that you understand what it means, what is expected of you, what is in it for you and what you can or can’t do.\nPlease note that this does not constitute legal advice so please do not rely on it and always take advice specific to your situation and the relevant facts and circumstances.']	['<urn:uuid:0c2ab4a7-bae7-449e-85c7-d22ac80dfd7f>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	6	33	1272

Pansies are popular cool-season bedding plants that produce colourful flowers that range from yellow to blue to purple, and sometimes even white.\nThey’re often used for gardens or pots, with some gardeners growing them as annuals and others as perennials. Pansies are known for being cold-hardy, but the amount of cold that they can tolerate varies depending on the species and variety. In this article, we’ll discuss how cold pansies can tolerate, as well as tips on how to protect them during a cold snap. Whether you’re a seasoned gardener or just starting, having the right knowledge will ensure your pansies thrive in the colder months.\nFactors Affecting Pansy Cold Tolerance\nPansies are lovely cold-hardy plants that bring a burst of color to gardens and landscapes during chilly months. They are a favorite among gardeners who want pretty flowers during winter. If you’re thinking of planting pansies, you may be wondering how much cold they can tolerate.\nThis article will explore the factors that affect pansy cold tolerance.\nGenetic Makeup Of The Plant\nThe genetic makeup of pansies plays a crucial role in their cold tolerance. Pansies that have been bred for colder climates are generally hardier than those bred for warmer areas.\n- Flower size: smaller flowers typically handle colder temperatures better than large ones.\n- Stem length: shorter stems usually cope better with cold weather than longer ones.\n- Leaf texture: thick, leathery leaves can endure colder temperatures than thin ones.\n- Variety: some pansy varieties are naturally cold-hardy and can withstand temperatures as low as 5°f (-15°c).\nApart from genetics, environmental conditions also influence pansy cold tolerance. Understanding these factors can help you create the ideal conditions for your pansies to thrive.\n- Soil moisture: pansies require well-draining soil. Soggy or waterlogged soil can make them more prone to cold damage.\n- Sun exposure: pansies need ample sunlight to photosynthesize and develop robust stems and flowers. However, too much sun exposure during winter can cause drying and scorching of foliage.\n- Air temperature: pansies can handle temperatures as low as 15°f (-9°c). However, if the temperature drops below this threshold, they may suffer cold damage. Frost, in particular, can damage pansy foliage and flowers.\n- Wind exposure: cold winds can cause dehydration and damage to pansy foliage.\nPansy cold tolerance is influenced by multiple factors, including genetics and environmental conditions. By understanding these key factors, gardeners can create an optimal environment for their pansies to thrive. When planting pansies, it’s important to consider these factors and make necessary adjustments to ensure healthy growth.\nUnderstanding Pansy Hardiness Zones\nPansies are beautiful, herbaceous garden plants that flourish in cool climates across the united states. They are known to be hardy and can tolerate some amount of cold weather, but how much cold can they actually withstand? This blog post aims to discuss pansy hardiness zones and help readers understand how to determine the hardiness zone of their garden to ensure their pansies thrive.\nExplanation Of Hardiness Zones\nHardiness zones refer to geographic regions determined by the average minimum temperature in a location during winter. The united states department of agriculture (usda) establishes these zones based on reliable observations of the climate records. Each zone has a different temperature range that is used to grow different types of plants.\nDifferent Zones Across The United States\nThe united states is divided into 13 different hardiness zones ranging from 1a to 13b. Zone 1a has the coldest temperature range compared to zone 13b, which has the warmest. Pansies can tolerate cold weather, and they grow well in zones 4 to 8, which have a temperature range that lies between minus 40 degrees fahrenheit in zone 4a to 20 degrees fahrenheit in zone 8b.\nDetermining The Hardiness Zone Of Your Garden\nTo know which hardiness zone your garden falls under, you can enter your zip code on the usda website and check the interactive map. Once you have determined your zone, it is easier to choose the type of plants that grow best in your area.\nThis way, you can avoid choosing plants that do not thrive in your location and instead select varieties perfect for your garden’s climate.\nUnderstanding hardiness zones is crucial when it comes to planting pansies. By determining your garden’s hardiness zone, you can choose the type of plants that are better suited for your area, ensuring they thrive and flourish beautifully.\nWhat low temperature can pansies tolerate?\nTips For Protecting Pansies From Cold\nPansies are a popular choice for gardeners because of their hardy nature, but they still need protection from frosty conditions. The temperature that pansies can tolerate varies, depending on the variety and growing conditions. However, generally, they can survive temperatures as low as the mid-20s for a short period.\nHere are some tips to help protect your pansies from the cold.\nCovering Pansies With Mulch Or Straw\n- Spread a layer of mulch or straw over the bed of your pansies before the onset of cold weather.\n- Using straw or mulch will provide insulation to the pansies and help to retain heat in the soil.\n- Be sure to cover the entire bed and use a thick enough layer to provide insulation for the roots.\nUsing Frost Cloths Or Blankets\n- Frost cloths or blankets can help protect pansies against frost and cold winds.\n- These cloths and blankets are made from lightweight materials that allow air and water to reach the plants while protecting them from the cold.\n- It’s best to set up the frost cloths or blankets before freezing temperatures set in as it can be challenging to protect plants after exposure to low temperatures.\nWatering Pansies Before A Freeze\n- Water your pansies thoroughly when you know a freeze is expected.\n- The moist soil will help to insulate the roots of the pansies and can mitigate the effects of extreme cold.\n- Be careful not to overwater the pansies. If the soil is too wet and the temperature drops dramatically, the roots could freeze.\nPotting Pansies To Bring Indoors During Extreme Cold\n- Consider potting your pansies to bring them inside during extreme cold.\n- Select a pot that is big enough to accommodate the root structures and provide enough space for the pansies to grow.\n- Place the pot in an area of your home with bright, indirect light, and protect it from drafts.\nBy following these tips, you can help protect your pansies from the cold and keep them thriving. Remember to monitor the weather conditions and take necessary precautions to keep your plants healthy.\nPansy Varieties With High Cold Tolerance\nPansies are gorgeous and versatile flowers that adorn gardens in various regions of the world. While pansies thrive in chilly weather, gardeners still wonder about their ability to endure extreme cold. Luckily, some pansy varieties have proven their exceptional resistance to frosty temperatures.\nLet’s explore pansy varieties with high cold tolerance.\nDescription Of Pansy Varieties Known For Their Cold Tolerance\nPansy varieties that can endure low temperatures and even frost are about as close to winter-perfect pansies as we can get.\n- delta series: these flowers are a popular choice. They typically bloom in bright hues and have a large blossom size.\n- winter flowering series: these are popular in colder climates. They are small size flowers that thrive in low light conditions.\n- crown series: they come in a wide range of colors and bloom in spring and fall.\n- hibernica series: these pansies are exceptionally cold-tolerant, with strong stems that improve their durability in harsh weather.\nBenefits And Drawbacks Of Choosing A Cold-Tolerant Variety\nChoosing a cold-tolerant variety of pansy comes with several benefits and drawbacks, including:\n- Cold-tolerant varieties are ideal for regions with long winters, as they can withstand temperatures as low as twenty degrees.\n- These pansies can continue to flower throughout the winter, which can add a beautiful touch of color to your garden.\n- They are hardy and pest-resistant.\n- Cold-tolerant pansy varieties typically produce smaller flowers with less brightness and fewer blooms.\n- Maintenance is critical; if not adequately cared for, these flowers may bloom erratically or fail to bloom at all.\nTips For Successful Growth And Care Of These Pansy Varieties\nIf you’re thinking of planting pansy varieties with high cold tolerance, consider following these tips for successful growth and care:\n- Plant in a location that receives plenty of sunlight, even during the winter months.\n- Use well-draining soil and add a slow-release fertilizer before planting.\n- Do not overwater the plants, as this can lead to root rot.\n- During snow and frost, lightly brush off any weight from the blooms to prevent the stems from breaking.\n- Remove dead flowers to encourage new growth.\n- Inject a balanced liquid fertilizer every two weeks to promote continuous blooming.\nPansy varieties with high cold tolerance are an excellent choice for gardeners in regions with long winters. They come in several color variations and are proven to thrive in intensely chilly weather. By following the tips provided above, your winter garden will burst with colorful pansies.\nAs we come to the end of our exploration on how cold can pansies tolerate, we can conclude that pansies indeed are sturdy cold-tolerant plants. With proper care and attention, they can withstand temperatures as low as 5°f (-15°c) and still bloom beautifully.\nAlthough pansies are rugged and resilient plants, gardeners should be mindful of the temperature fluctuations and exposure to extreme cold. Ensuring that your pansies are planted in well-draining soil, lightly fertilized, and adequately hydrated can enhance their cold tolerance. Remember to provide protection from harsh winter elements like frost, snow, and ice by covering them with a cloth or mulch.\nPansies are perfect for adding vibrant colors to your winter landscape, and with these tips, you can enjoy them thriving throughout the colder months. Happy planting!']	['<urn:uuid:c4a37bcb-797c-4c9b-9d11-d4c221572bc7>', '<urn:uuid:d60e6f0b-9b83-4d92-b5ff-c0b5ad4872dc>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	11	48	2260
25	fairbanks skogn september precipitation snow rain	In Fairbanks, September sees precipitation 53% of the time, with light rain being most common (48% of precipitation days), followed by light snow (26%) and moderate rain (17%). The chance of snow is highest around September 30 at 30%. In Skogn, September is the peak month for precipitation with a 50% chance of rain on September 22, and the total rainfall accumulation averages 4.2 inches. Snow in Skogn during September is possible as the snowy period begins on October 25.	"['This report describes the typical weather at the Fairbanks International Airport (Fairbanks, Alaska, United States) weather station over the course of an average September. It is based on the historical records from 1974 to 2012. Earlier records are either unavailable or unreliable.\nFairbanks, Alaska has a humid subarctic continental climate with cool summers and no dry season. The area within 25 mi of this station is covered by forests (96%) and lakes and rivers (3%).\nThe month of September is characterized by very rapidly falling daily high temperatures, with daily highs decreasing from 61°F to 45°F over the course of the month, exceeding 70°F or dropping below 35°F only one day in ten.\nOver the course of September, the length of the day is very rapidly decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 3:14 hours, implying an average day-over-day decrease of 6.5 minutes.\nThe shortest day of the month is September 30 with 11:20 hours of daylight; the longest day is September 1 with 14:35 hours of daylight.\nThe earliest sunrise is at 6:33am on September 1; the latest sunset is at 9:07pm on September 1; the latest sunrise is at 8:01am on September 30; the earliest sunset is at 7:21pm on September 30.\nDaylight savings time is observed in 2012 but it neither starts nor ends in September, so the entire month is in daylight time.\nThe median cloud cover is 92% (mostly cloudy) and does not vary substantially over the course of the month.\nOn September 15, a representative day, the sky is clear or mostly clear 19% of the time, partly cloudy 16% of the time, and mostly cloudy or overcast 65% of the time.\nThe average probability that some form of precipitation will be observed in a given day is 53%, with little variation over the course of the month.\nThroughout September, the most common forms of precipitation are light rain, light snow, and moderate rain.\nLight rain is the most severe precipitation observed during 48% of those days with precipitation. It is most likely around September 1, when it is observed during 32% of all days.\nLight snow is the most severe precipitation observed during 26% of those days with precipitation. It is most likely around September 30, when it is observed during 24% of all days.\nModerate rain is the most severe precipitation observed during 17% of those days with precipitation. It is most likely around September 1, when it is observed during 13% of all days.\nThe likelihood of snow falling is highest around September 30, occurring in 30% of days.\nAccumulation at this location in September is unlikely. The chances of there being snow on the ground are highest around September 30, occurring 13% of the time.\nThe snow is typically at its deepest on September 15, with a median depth of 6.4""; the depth exceeds 7.7"" only one year out of ten.\nThe relative humidity typically ranges from 48% (comfortable) to 92% (very humid) over the course of a typical September, rarely dropping below 32% (comfortable) and reaching as high as 99% (very humid).\nThe air is driest around September 1, at which time the relative humidity drops below 57% (mildly humid) three days out of four; it is most humid around September 3, rising above 89% (very humid) three days out of four.\nDew point is often a better measure of how comfortable a person will find the weather than relative humidity because it more directly relates to whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid.\nOver the course of a typical September, the dew point typically varies from 24°F (dry) to 46°F (dry) and is rarely below 15°F (dry) or above 52°F (very comfortable).\nOver the course of September typical wind speeds vary from 0 mph to 11 mph (calm to gentle breeze), rarely exceeding 17 mph (moderate breeze).\nThe highest average wind speed of 6 mph (light breeze) occurs around September 26, at which time the average daily maximum wind speed is 11 mph (gentle breeze).\nThe lowest average wind speed of 5 mph (light breeze) occurs around September 5, at which time the average daily maximum wind speed is 10 mph (gentle breeze).', ""Average Weather in Skogn Norway\nIn Skogn, the summers are cool and mostly cloudy; the winters are long, freezing, and overcast; and it is wet year round. Over the course of the year, the temperature typically varies from 23°F to 65°F and is rarely below 5°F or above 77°F.\nBased on the tourism score, the best time of year to visit Skogn for warm-weather activities is from early July to mid August.\nThe warm season lasts for 3.0 months, from June 6 to September 7, with an average daily high temperature above 59°F. The hottest day of the year is July 25, with an average high of 65°F and low of 52°F.\nThe cold season lasts for 4.1 months, from November 13 to March 18, with an average daily high temperature below 39°F. The coldest day of the year is January 16, with an average low of 23°F and high of 33°F.\nAverage High and Low Temperature\nThe figure below shows you a compact characterization of the entire year of hourly average temperatures. The horizontal axis is the day of the year, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day.\nAverage Hourly Temperature\nIn Skogn, the average percentage of the sky covered by clouds experiences significant seasonal variation over the course of the year.\nThe clearer part of the year in Skogn begins around April 8 and lasts for 5.3 months, ending around September 18. On May 15, the clearest day of the year, the sky is clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy 45% of the time, and overcast or mostly cloudy 55% of the time.\nThe cloudier part of the year begins around September 18 and lasts for 6.7 months, ending around April 8. On January 23, the cloudiest day of the year, the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy 76% of the time, and clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy 24% of the time.\nCloud Cover Categories\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. The chance of wet days in Skogn varies throughout the year.\nThe wetter season lasts 9.6 months, from June 4 to March 23, with a greater than 41% chance of a given day being a wet day. The chance of a wet day peaks at 50% on September 22.\nThe drier season lasts 2.4 months, from March 23 to June 4. The smallest chance of a wet day is 32% on May 4.\nAmong wet days, we distinguish between those that experience rain alone, snow alone, or a mixture of the two. Based on this categorization, the most common form of precipitation throughout the year is rain alone, with a peak probability of 50% on September 22.\nDaily Chance of Precipitation\nTo show variation within the months and not just the monthly totals, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day of the year. Skogn experiences significant seasonal variation in monthly rainfall.\nRain falls throughout the year in Skogn. The most rain falls during the 31 days centered around September 18, with an average total accumulation of 4.2 inches.\nThe least rain falls around May 2, with an average total accumulation of 2.1 inches.\nAverage Monthly Rainfall\nWe report snowfall in liquid-equivalent terms. The actual depth of new snowfall is typically between 5 and 10 times the liquid-equivalent amount, assuming the ground is frozen. Colder, drier snow tends to be on the higher end of that range and warmer, wetter snow on the lower end.\nAs with rainfall, we consider the snowfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day of the year. Skogn experiences some seasonal variation in monthly liquid-equivalent snowfall.\nThe snowy period of the year lasts for 5.9 months, from October 25 to April 21, with a sliding 31-day liquid-equivalent snowfall of at least 0.1 inches. The most snow falls during the 31 days centered around February 5, with an average total liquid-equivalent accumulation of 0.9 inches.\nThe snowless period of the year lasts for 6.1 months, from April 21 to October 25. The least snow falls around July 30, with an average total liquid-equivalent accumulation of 0.0 inches.\nAverage Liquid-Equivalent Monthly Snowfall\nThe length of the day in Skogn varies extremely over the course of the year. In 2018, the shortest day is December 21, with 4 hours, 22 minutes of daylight; the longest day is June 21, with 20 hours, 48 minutes of daylight.\nHours of Daylight and Twilight\nThe earliest sunrise is at 2:52 AM on June 20, and the latest sunrise is 7 hours, 11 minutes later at 10:03 AM on December 25. The earliest sunset is at 2:23 PM on December 18, and the latest sunset is 9 hours, 18 minutes later at 11:41 PM on June 22.\nDaylight saving time (DST) is observed in Skogn during 2018, starting in the spring on March 25, lasting 7.1 months, and ending in the fall on October 28.\nSunrise & Sunset with Twilight and Daylight Saving Time\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\nThe perceived humidity level in Skogn, as measured by the percentage of time in which the humidity comfort level is muggy, oppressive, or miserable, does not vary significantly over the course of the year, remaining a virtually constant 0% throughout.\nHumidity Comfort Levels\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\nThe average hourly wind speed in Skogn experiences significant seasonal variation over the course of the year.\nThe windier part of the year lasts for 5.5 months, from November 1 to April 16, with average wind speeds of more than 6.7 miles per hour. The windiest day of the year is January 25, with an average hourly wind speed of 9.1 miles per hour.\nThe calmer time of year lasts for 6.5 months, from April 16 to November 1. The calmest day of the year is August 5, with an average hourly wind speed of 4.2 miles per hour.\nAverage Wind Speed\nThe predominant average hourly wind direction in Skogn varies throughout the year.\nThe wind is most often from the west for 4.6 months, from April 24 to September 13, with a peak percentage of 41% on June 25. The wind is most often from the south for 7.4 months, from September 13 to April 24, with a peak percentage of 49% on January 1.\nSkogn is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake). This section reports on the wide-area average surface temperature of that water.\nThe average water temperature experiences some seasonal variation over the course of the year.\nThe time of year with warmer water lasts for 2.4 months, from July 4 to September 17, with an average temperature above 54°F. The day of the year with the warmest water is August 12, with an average temperature of 57°F.\nThe time of year with cooler water lasts for 4.7 months, from December 13 to May 3, with an average temperature below 44°F. The day of the year with the coolest water is March 7, with an average temperature of 40°F.\nAverage Water Temperature\nBest Time of Year to Visit\nTo characterize how pleasant the weather is in Skogn throughout the year, we compute two travel scores.\nThe tourism score favors clear, rainless days with perceived temperatures between 65°F and 80°F. Based on this score, the best time of year to visit Skogn for general outdoor tourist activities is from early July to mid August, with a peak score in the first week of August.\nThe beach/pool score favors clear, rainless days with perceived temperatures between 75°F and 90°F. Based on this score, the best time of year to visit Skogn for hot-weather activities is from mid July to early August, with a peak score in the third week of July.\nFor each hour between 8:00 AM and 9:00 PM of each day in the analysis period (1980 to 2016), independent scores are computed for perceived temperature, cloud cover, and total precipitation. Those scores are combined into a single hourly composite score, which is then aggregated into days, averaged over all the years in the analysis period, and smoothed.\nOur cloud cover score is 10 for fully clear skies, falling linearly to 9 for mostly clear skies, and to 1 for fully overcast skies.\nOur precipitation score, which is based on the three-hour precipitation centered on the hour in question, is 10 for no precipitation, falling linearly to 9 for trace precipitation, and to 0 for 0.04 inches of precipitation or more.\nOur tourism temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 50°F, rising linearly to 9 for 65°F, to 10 for 75°F, falling linearly to 9 for 80°F, and to 1 for 90°F or hotter.\nOur beach/pool temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 65°F, rising linearly to 9 for 75°F, to 10 for 82°F, falling linearly to 9 for 90°F, and to 1 for 100°F or hotter.\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\nThe growing season in Skogn typically lasts for 5.2 months (159 days), from around May 3 to around October 9, rarely starting before April 12 or after May 21, and rarely ending before September 18 or after October 30.\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50°F and a cap of 86°F.\nBased on growing degree days alone, the first spring blooms in Skogn should appear around May 30, only rarely appearing before May 17 or after June 20.\nGrowing Degree Days\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy experiences extreme seasonal variation over the course of the year.\nThe brighter period of the year lasts for 3.2 months, from May 2 to August 8, with an average daily incident shortwave energy per square meter above 4.3 kWh. The brightest day of the year is June 21, with an average of 5.3 kWh.\nThe darker period of the year lasts for 4.5 months, from October 13 to February 28, with an average daily incident shortwave energy per square meter below 1.1 kWh. The darkest day of the year is December 20, with an average of 0.0 kWh.\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Skogn are 63.704 deg latitude, 11.193 deg longitude, and 151 ft elevation.\nThe topography within 2 miles of Skogn contains significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 673 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 140 feet. Within 10 miles contains significant variations in elevation (2,228 feet). Within 50 miles contains large variations in elevation (4,797 feet).\nThe area within 2 miles of Skogn is covered by cropland (66%) and water (23%), within 10 miles by trees (38%) and water (33%), and within 50 miles by trees (33%) and herbaceous vegetation (17%).\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Skogn, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\nTemperature and Dew Point\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Skogn.\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Skogn according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\nThe estimated value at Skogn is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Skogn and a given station.\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are: Trondheim Airport, Værnes (78%, 30 kilometers, southwest); Namsos Lufthavn (16%, 87 kilometers, north); and Åre Östersund Airport (6%, 174 kilometers, east).\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Tables of the Sun, Moon and Planets , by Jean Meeus.\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\nTime zones for aiports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\nMaps are © Esri, with data from National Geographic, Esri, DeLorme, NAVTEQ, UNEP-WCMC, USGS, NASA, ESA, METI, NRCAN, GEBCO, NOAA, and iPC.\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose.

26	As someone developing educational space content, I'd like to know how VR astronomy applications combine scientific accuracy with storytelling - what approaches are used for data visualization, and how is narrative incorporated into space VR experiences?	Scientific data visualization is achieved through elaborate methods that make telescope observations and supercomputer simulations tangible, showing different views of cosmic objects and structures. For narrative elements, space VR experiences range from educational approaches like Titans of Space's narrated planetary tours to story-driven experiences like ADR1FT and Homebound, which combine scientific accuracy with dramatic survival narratives in space.	"['Virtual Reality meets Astrophysics\nA new Virtual Reality (VR) website invites visitors to experience the cosmos and to take virtual tours through astronomical observatories - offering 360 degree videos and panoramas.\n10.04.2017 · Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam · HP-Topnews · Projects · Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Engineering\nFoto: C. Kuckein, C. Denker/AIP\nThe Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP) is launching a new Virtual Reality (VR) website. Offering 360 degree videos and panoramas, the new web portal vr.aip.de invites visitors to experience the cosmos and to take virtual tours through astronomical observatories. The website can be navigated either in VR mode, using a VR-headset, or via touch and click on any display. All media is based on scientific results, simulations from supercomputers, or images from telescopes and observatories.\nAstrophysicists get their insights of the universe and its objects from analyzing huge amounts of data from observations and simulations of stars, galaxies and other cosmic objects. Elaborate visualization methods make these data tangible. The videos allow the user to go on a VR excursion through our local cosmic neighbourhood. Its appearance changes dramatically with the kind of objects that are visualized - for instance dark matter, gas or stars. Enigmatic dark matter dominates the cosmic large-scale structure. Stars and galaxies trace this structure. These three different views of the universe also demonstrate how real astronomical observations work, using different telescopes and instruments to decipher the different objects and building blocks of the universe.\n""With simulations and VR we make the invisible visible,"" says Arman Khalatyan, an AIP astrophysicist, IT specialist, the initiator and creator of the AIP VR website. He also produced the VR movies and most of the simulations that they are based on. ""With simple VR headsets and free apps, VR technology can be used by everyone today. With our platform we now open the universe to everyone.""\nVirtual tour to astronomical observatories\nThe second part of the website invites the visitors to a virtual tour through different astrophysical observatories that are linked to the AIP due to telescope or instrument collaborations. If interested in the sun, one could choose a tour to the ""Observatorio del Teide"", for instance. This international observatory is located at 2,400 meters above sea level on the island of Tenerife. During a virtual tour of the campus one can enter and explore the dome of the solar telescope GREGOR or take a look at the other telescopes of the observatory. In the background one can see the Teide Mountain at 3,718 meter not so far away above the clouds. Fans of architecture may choose the tour to the Einstein Tower in nearby Potsdam. More observatories worldwide are planned to follow soon to extend the website experience.\n""With this Virtual Reality project, we would like to tell stories about the universe and encourage the exploration of fascinating locations of astronomical research,"" explains Gabriele Schönherr, an astrophysicist, science communicator and co-initiator of the AIP VR project. ""Modern astrophysical observations are an international effort. This thought becomes alive in Virtual Reality.""\nLeibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP)\nTel.: 0331 / 7499 - 803', 'List of Space Exploration VR Experiences\nThe Universe is unfathomably massive – it’s so vast, that so far mankind has barely scratched the surface. What we can’t realistically achieve for now can be made possible through virtual reality space experiences. VR media developers and production houses of all sorts are scrambling to leverage the power of virtual reality through immersive and lifelike visual tours of intergalactic space. If you want to see beyond the Earth’s atmosphere without actually being there, have a look at this list of space exploration VR experiences that you can have right now.\nThe collaboration between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Melbourne-based Opaque Media Group (OMG) has led to the development of Earthlight, a virtual reality space-walk experience that uses high-end VR headsets and hand-based controllers. First demonstrated at the PAX Australia gaming convention last 2015, Earthlight VR lets you take the experience of being an astronaut walking in orbit, first-handedly seeing the Earth being enveloped in the darkness of space. A narrow field of view is achieved with the bulky VR headset, helping to replicate the constrained nature of the spacesuit. OMG took advice from NASA in order to achieve the sense of microgravity within Earthlight through accurate visual elements and making use of ultra-low latency between the user’s physical movements and the visual response.\nIf you are in the mood for a space VR experience with a heavy storyline, the ADR1FT space game experience might be something worth looking at. Beginning the story with the player being a stray in space with no memory of a tragic past, ADR1FT takes you to a mission of gaining valuable resources from scratch, learning about living in space, and fighting for survival. The emotional and physical attachments of this VR space game will take your senses to an entirely new level of immersive gaming. ADR1FT is available for the PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One with the help of the Oculus Rift VR headset.\nCreated by London-based studio Rewind and news network giant BBC, the spacewalk experience called “Home: A VR Spacewalk” is heavily inspired by works of NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) training programs, and takes you 250 miles above ground. This VR space experience is quite unique among its contemporaries, as it won the Audience award at the Sheffield International Documentary Festival, owing to its use of experimental VR elements such as spatial audio, integrated haptics and biofeedback, and use of Unreal Engine 4 for advanced graphics. Home: A VR Spacewalk evokes the user’s sensory feedback through its novel use of narrative storytelling and advanced multisensory technologies, resulting in an immersive and realistic spacewalk experience. It uses the HTC Vive VR headset and a haptic chair in the virtual tour.\nThe latest among all space exploration VR experiences listed here, “Mission: ISS” is the brainchild of Oculus VR and three space agencies. Aiming to bring a realistic recreation of being in the International Space Station, Mission: ISS takes you to the routines being taken by ISS-based astronauts, which involves tasks such as docking cargo capsules, spacewalks, and many mission-critical operations. It’s a collaboration project made by visual effects studio Magnopus, NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), with the purpose of bringing space down to Earth with an educational directive. Select high school students in the United States will have direct access to a pilot program that will showcase Mission: ISS through Oculus Rift headsets.\nHoping to bring an educational tour of the Solar System, “Titans of Space” was originally conceived for the Oculus Rift Development Kit (DK) back in 2013 as one of the pioneer VR space exploration projects. Titans of Space showcases the beauty and vastness of the Solar System through its realistic visuals of planets and other celestial bodies such as moons and asteroids. An hour-long narrated tour introduces you to the virtual planetarium, showing each planet with their corresponding names and size measurements. There’s a high attention to detail in terms of relative distances and sizes, so you can measure up everything you see as you would actually see them in space. Titans of Space is available for the Samsung Gear VR, HTC Vive, and Oculus Rift headsets.\nFollowing suit with the likes of ADR1FT, “Homebound” takes you to an experience of space isolation and the need for survival. It’s a first-person space VR experience created by a single developer – you read that right, as Homebound is a work of an indie developer named Wiktor Öhman from the graphics tools studio Quixel. To boot, Homebound offers an interactive space VR experience where you play a character faced with the struggle of recovering from a disaster in space, and going through the facets of distress, isolation, and eventually, survival. Immersion is the key word in describing Homebound – it takes you into a virtual space where you are in full control of your fate, along with intricate visuals and a chilling storyline. Although the end of the story is quite predictable (spoiler: there’s only one ending), Homebound presents itself as a quick virtual space tour with an added touch of realistic drama and chilling exhiliration. Homebound is available for Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and OSVR which can be used within the Steam PC application.']"	['<urn:uuid:a6f6b7d8-01b0-4220-81b0-2050acb50c7d>', '<urn:uuid:fc83818b-d7fd-4b2f-9191-0a7fad6c55af>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	36	58	1394
27	how women lost citizenship before 1934	Before 1934, a woman would lose her citizenship if she married a man from another country, as women's citizenship was vested in their father or husband.	"[""What Are the Roots of Gender Inequality? Women's Rights, Race and Reproduction\nSource: Arizona State University College of Liberal Arts and Sciences\nThroughout history, women have faced intense discrimination—from a lack of legal rights and very little independence from their husbands, to being thought to have inferior brains. In many societies, women have long been viewed as less than fully human.\nAmerican society has come a long way in recognizing and protecting women’s humanity and human rights. However, women will always be fundamentally different than men because of their ability to bear children. We are reminded of this by current political debates concerning abortion and contraception, which some have called a “war on women.”\nWhat are the roots of gender inequality? How have the challenges faced by women changed over time? Sally Kitch, an Regents’ Professor of Women and Gender Studies at Arizona State University, has spent many years exploring the reasons why the world sees men and women so differently. To find answers, she has explored questions ranging from the gendered origins of race to American utopian communities.\nThe intersection of race and gender\nKitch, who is also the director of ASU’s Institute for Humanities Research, a research unit in ASU's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, covered 300 years of history tracing the connection between gender and race in her book, The Specter of Sex: Gendered Foundations of Racial Formation in the United States (State University of New York Press, 2009). She discovered that gender inequities have been central to societies for centuries, but race is a very modern idea.\n“One thing we know about race is that it doesn’t exist. It’s not a biological category,” Kitch says. Some believe that groups of people who share similar physiological characteristics constitute races, but race is really a system imposed by historical, cultural and political processes, Kitch says. Genetically speaking, a black and white person may have more in common than two people of the same race. How, then, did race become so significant?\nEuropean explorers of the sixteenth century noticed differences like skin color when they encountered natives of other continents, but they were even more interested in the unfamiliar sexual and reproductive practices of other cultures, Kitch says.\n“The Europeans thought that cultures in which men and women weren’t that different in terms of their behavior or appearance were uncivilized,” Kitch says. Marriage customs, sexual practices, and even whether or not women experienced pain during childbirth (it was considered more civilized to feel pain) were all important distinctions used to disparage certain groups and, eventually, define races.\n“That gave me the insight that racial characteristics really evolved on the basis of comparative gender characteristics,” Kitch says. “My work provides the backstory of the concept of intersectionality by showing how race and gender judgments evolved together and influenced one another.”\nDifferences in gender behavior also served as Europeans’ justification for using slavery to further their own economic interests. “When Europeans began to enslave Africans, they didn’t start with their skin color to explain why,” Kitch says. Instead, they used observations on sexual behavior and religious practices to decide the African culture was inferior.\nA history of discrimination\nTo understand how gender continued to influence race over time, Kitch traced five racial groups in the U.S. from the Colonial period to the mid-20th century – American Indians, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans and European whites. After exploring the roots of racial formation, she focused on the categories of bodies, blood and citizenship, finding evidence that gender and sex were foundations of racial judgment throughout the centuries.\nFor example, before race meant anything more than a person’s geographic location, European settlers in Virginia made distinctions between English and African women based on the work they did. The work done by African women was considered labor and was taxable by her employer, while work done by English women was considered domestic (and therefore more civilized) and could not be taxed.\n“It disadvantaged one group over the other, but it was entirely arbitrary because both groups of women did all kinds of work,” Kitch says. These kinds of distinctions provided a foundation for the belief that Africans were culturally inferior and should be enslaved.\nGender distinctions were also involved in the process of granting U.S. citizenship. While American women achieved the right to vote in 1920, their citizenship was still vested in a father or husband until 1934. Up until then, a woman would lose her citizenship if she married a man from another country.\n“If you had offspring outside of the U.S. with a non-American husband, your children wouldn’t have been seen as American because a woman couldn’t transfer her citizenship to her children,” Kitch says.\nPerhaps one of the most powerful factors affecting women’s social power and status, however, is their ability to bear children.\n“For some reason, societies have decided that there’s something inherently inferior about having a female body and producing offspring,” Kitch says.\nThroughout history, and especially in the 19th century, the U.S. witnessed the formation of several “utopian” communities that attempted to overcome gender inequality. Kitch has written three books on the subject of utopianism and gender, including Higher Ground: From Utopianism to Realism in American Feminist Thought and Theory (University of Chicago Press, 2000). She wanted to explore whether these communal societies could achieve gender neutrality, and what that would look like.\n“What I discovered was that the only communities that managed to achieve gender equity of any kind were celibate societies in which sex and reproduction were just taken out of the equation,” Kitch says.\nOne such community was the Shakers, a religious group that came to the U.S. from England. Officially called the United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing, they advocated for gender equality more than a century-and-a-half before American women were granted the right to vote.\n“Reproduction, as these people rightly saw, was a way that women were kept subordinated and kept from achieving other things in their lives. So they would prohibit sex and raise children collectively,” Kitch says.\nThe community often took in orphaned and homeless children in lieu of bearing their own.\nWhile the Shakers and other experimental utopian communities lost traction over the years, their ideas about women’s freedoms and social status eventually caught on. Today, women vote, own property, have custody rights, and pursue careers. However, holding down a high-powered job usually involves sacrifices to family life.\nA recent State of the World's Mothers report by the Save the Children Foundation found that maternity leave policies in the U.S. are among the least generous in the developed world. Unlike families in other first-world countries such as France, which provides free 24-hour childcare for working parents, Americans receive little support in caring for their children. Because women still shoulder the majority of child-rearing responsibilities, they are most affected by these policies.\nThe United States was ranked 25th of teh best places for mothers, trailing that of many developed countries. Norway was ranked first in the report.\n“We do see women empowered, but when we start studying who these women are and what their lives have been like, you discover that marriage and family and high-powered careers are still extremely difficult to navigate,” Kitch says.\nIn addition, political debates over access to family planning services are raising fears that women in the U.S. may face increased obstacles to balancing work and family. An example of this is the Blunt Amendment, which was narrowly defeated in the U.S. Senate, but would have allowed any employer or health insurance company to deny coverage for contraception.\n“We’ve been reminded again recently about how sex and reproduction work in terms of social status in the United States,” Kitch says. “It certainly feels right now like we’re back to the place where some men in power are willing and eager to make decisions about women’s bodies and reproductive rights, without women’s consent or participation. It’s coming out in some pretty aggressive ways.”\nWomen and Gender Studies is part of the School of Social Transformation, an academic unit in ASU's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.""]"	['<urn:uuid:39533fa3-5604-47c2-96cf-696e0c0a9eb3>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	6	26	1350
28	forest river water quality oregon vs mississippi	Both regions show how forests affect water quality, but in different ways. In Oregon's Willamette Valley, when water interacts with forested floodplains, it slows down allowing sediments to settle, resulting in cleaner water that benefits aquatic species. The water can also soak into groundwater, becoming cooler over time, which helps cold-water fish like salmon. In the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, restored bottomland forests help reduce nutrient run-off to streams and sequester carbon in the soil, though the historic flooding regime has been altered by flood-control levees.	['Crafting a Future Forest\nAll over Oregon, landowners are planting native trees and shrubs to restore forests to places they once thrived. In the Willamette Valley, this work often focuses on restoring forests within the floodplains of rivers. When a water body interacts with its floodplain, whether it is for a few days or for months at a time, all sorts of amazing things happen!\nWater quality can be improved significantly when water interacts with the floodplain. Water velocities will slow, allowing suspended sediments (dirt, sometimes carrying pollutants) to settle out of the water and deposit on the floodplain, resulting in less turbid (dirty) water, which is good for aquatic species and for people.\nDepending on the composition of the soil in the floodplain, water can soak into the ground and replenish groundwater, or water can pond on clay deposits and create wetlands which support a diverse array of wildlife. When water soaks into groundwater, it can stay there for weeks or years, and over time will become cooler. This cooler water often seeps back into the river creating cold water zones that cold-water fish, like salmon, can use for migration, resting, feeding or spawning.\nWater also picks up a lot of material when it interacts with the floodplain, ranging from small particles of leaves and insects to huge trees. Many of Oregon’s native fish and wildlife are dependent on these materials to provide food or suitable habitat to survive. Salmon, for example, will eat insects picked up by floodwaters, and they also depend on diverse habitat in the river that large log jams formed from floodplain trees can provide. Salmon are only one example of a large number of native species that depend on good water quality and complex aquatic habitat.\nEven when floodwaters don’t actually reach a nearby forest, a mature native forest located near a river (a riparian forest) can still provide numerous benefits including shade to cool river water, and habitat for the large number of species who depend on riparian habitat in Oregon. These hardwood forests provide wintering habitat and movement corridors for songbirds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles. Breeding and migratory bird densities in cottonwood-dominated riparian forests are generally the highest of all habitat types in North America.\nOregon State Parks has partnered with numerous organizations and individuals to restore floodplain forests at sites along the Willamette River. The Willamette is one of many rivers that have been largely disconnected from its floodplain over time as other land uses have come to dominate the landscape. In the 1850s it is estimated that hardwood riparian/floodplain forests occupied 67% of the riparian zone along the Willamette River main-stem, reduced to less than 10% by 1990. Many of OPRD’s Willamette River Greenways and some of our state parks and natural areas contain areas that used to be dominated by forest, where land conversion has occurred over time.\nTo properly start a forest from scratch, you need to keep in mind a number of principles borrowed from the fields of forestry, botany, and agriculture. The density, arrangement and species composition that you plant in year 1 will influence how your forest appears and functions in 10, 50, and 100 years from now, at maturity.\nDifferent species have vastly different tolerances to environmental conditions, such as flooding, animal damage (deer, voles, beaver, etc.), competition with other plants, drought, and other factors. These differences will influence which species survive over time and are present in your future mature forest. How you prepare your site prior to planting, and how you manage your planting area for the first 5-10 years will also greatly influence your future mature forest.\nRestoration practitioners in the Willamette Valley have implemented a number of different approaches to floodplain and riparian forest restoration, with none of them being inherently “right” or “wrong”. Instead, your chosen approach will depend on your desired future condition (i.e. what you want your site to look or function like at some time in the future), what your starting site conditions are, what foreseeable problems may come up at a site, planned management interventions at the site , and of course, what financial and staff resources you have available.\nNotable examples of floodplain and riparian forest restoration work occurring at Oregon State Parks sites within the Willamette Valley include Luckiamute Landing State Natural Area, Half Moon Bend Landing, Darrow Rock’s Landing, Elijah Bristow State Park, and Willamette Mission State Park. These projects are using a variety of approaches in their density, arrangement, and species composition based on site specific conditions. Over time, all of these project areas will mature and begin to provide the ecological functions of improved water quality, shade, habitat complexity, and food sources for native fish and wildlife.', 'The vast Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV) that stretches along the Mississippi River from southern Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico once supported 24 million acres of bottomland and wetland forest — rich stands of oak, gum, ash, hickory, baldcypress, and water tupelo.\nThe hydrology of the original floodplain was drastically altered by flood-control levees built to support intensive agriculture across the region, which reduced forest extent by nearly 80 percent and resulted in the loss of valuable wildlife habitat and other ecosystem services.\nOver 20 years ago, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs such as the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) started offering incentives to private landowners in the MAV to restore marginal cropland to bottomland hardwood forest, primarily by planting trees in protective easements. In the beginning, the success of these afforestation efforts was evaluated in terms of forest structure — tree density, growth, and species composition. Because the WRP also establishes managed moist-soil areas as a means of hydrology restoration on the easements, the focus has broadened to include recovery of ecological functions, prompting a need for additional ways to measure the success of afforestation.\nAs part of the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service’s Conservation Effects Assessment Project, U.S. Forest Service and Geological Survey scientists recently published findings from a study that compared afforested WRP sites and mature bottomland forest sites to determine if understory vegetation could serve as an indicator for MAV floodplain forest restoration success.\n“The plants that grow in the understory of bottomland hardwood forests are sensitive to water and soil site conditions, so the variation in understory plant composition could be a useful indicator of ecological success on different sites,” said Diane De Steven, research ecologist for the Forest Service Southern Research Station Center for Bottomland Hardwoods Research, and lead author of the article.\nTrees can be planted to achieve desired forest structure, but the herbs, shrubs, and vines that make up the understory must come from seed banks or dispersal of seeds from nearby forests, which are now scarce in the MAV. The researchers wanted to know if those passive mechanisms would establish an understory flora similar to that of natural bottomland hardwood forests. They surveyed 37 WRP restoration sites and compared them to 26 mature bottomland hardwood sites. Both groups of sites were distributed across three states in the MAV and were similar in terms of landscape position, soils, and elevation.\n“The WRP seeks to recover multiple ecological services that include more natural hydrologic function, so we used both species composition and functional vegetation attributes to assess the developing understories of afforested sites,” said De Steven. “Our findings indicated that the understory vegetation reflected several factors that influence restoration progress.”\nThe analyses found that the understories of WRP and bottomland forest sites differed substantially in species and growth-form composition, largely due to greater prevalence of herb species in young afforested sites compared to mature forests. All bottomland hardwood sites and most WRP were populated with a majority of hydrophytic species (plants that are associated with wet conditions), qualifying the understory vegetation as meeting “wetland” criteria.\nThe study also found considerable variation among WRP sites. Distance to nearby forest and overstory tree density were important determinants of understory development, as woody species were more prevalent relative to herbs when trees were denser and sites were closer to forest. Site wetness conditions were also important, as WRP areas near enhanced-hydrology features (either managed moist-soil areas or natural wet swales) had relatively more wetland species, which has implications for restoration practice. Where WRP sites lack the majority of hydrophytic species, wetness conditions may be inadequate for restoration.\n“Given that recovering the historic flooding regime of the MAV as a whole is impractical, local hydrology restoration is critical for improving habitats and functional conditions,” said De Steven. “As indicators of hydrologic status, the relative prevalence of hydrophytic and wetland species can suggest whether a restored site has the potential to support the functional processes associated with ecological services such as reducing nutrient run-off to streams and sequestering carbon in the soil.”\nFor more information, email Diane De Steven at email@example.com.']	['<urn:uuid:d9363b01-9aec-4fe4-a990-03198a3396c2>', '<urn:uuid:3d6bba31-0a3f-4d17-968d-7e3c4ecdc5eb>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	7	85	1470
29	modern desert architecture how built stay cool sustainable features	Modern desert architecture employs various innovative cooling and sustainability features. For example, some homes use metal canopies over the roof to encourage air flow, eliminating the need for air conditioning, while others utilize underground or partially buried construction to take advantage of cooler air closer to the surface. At the Piedras Bayas Beachcamp, the design incorporates light structures and local materials, with buildings strategically separated to maximize natural ventilation. These designs often combine practical cooling solutions with environmental consciousness, using local materials and minimizing intervention in the natural landscape.	['You can explore the beauty of Chile’s Atacama Desert through eco-friendly domes\nThe latest Piedras Bayas Beachcamp introduced by MOREAS is an architectural beauty with both its ultra-creative structure and its eco-friendly design. Located in the Atacama Desert, North of Chile, the cabin covers an area of 7534.74 square feet and serves as a prime spot for tourists to stay! Surrounded by the natural life of the desert, the structure takes complete advantage of light structures, uses local materials, has a non-contaminant sanitary system and includes ample amount of green-facilities to aid to the conservation of the environment.\nThe arid Atacama Desert is a comparatively dry zone which sees a very low amount of rain per year. The coastal zone remains at a very high temperate all year round and is rich in archeology and geology. The major attraction of the Piedras Bayas Beachcamp is the limited intervention of human life which provides optimal privacy and serenity by allowing the visitors to intake all the natural beauty that surrounds them.\nThe complete structure consists of a service station and three separate bedrooms. Inside the service station, two bathrooms, one office, one community room, a room for the ranger and a family room has been built in. Each of these rooms, feature a separate bathroom and is essentially a wood platform with a dome. The entire process of building these cabins involved three stages along with three carpenters, two local artisans, and one on-site architect. Each of these domes is built well separated (a distance of 50 meters) from the other so as to maintain visitors’ privacy and to allow maximum viewing of the surrounding natural landscapes.\nA skeleton was first formed using the local materials and the rest of the structure was built through it. Instead of forming a large building which would occupy a bigger volume, multiple smaller buildings were made which were then all interconnected through exterior pathways.\nThe basic structure was built out of wooden pillars, each of which were buried one meter into the sand. The sea water was used to conjugate the pillars and create a stable foundation which helped omit the use of cement. Local materials that were mainly used during the construction were “Brea” and “Tortora”, both of which are native to a small village that is 40 minutes away from the site.\nA local bush was used which can easily grow in the wetlands around the area and validate for the use of the material for construction purposes. The Brea material being the top best with its ability to protect the building from harsh sunlight.\nCurrently a mandatory of at least 2 nights stay can be booked at the Piedras Bayas Beachcamp for USD 120 where the guests are offered kayaks, electricity and hot water all day long.\nFunctionally, such structures can prove to be beneficial as they can easily be rebuilt or removed without compromising on the aesthetic values of the surrounding natural landscape.\nAll Images: © Alejandro Gálvez, Cristina Ananias, Eduardo Montesinos via Arch Daily\nProject: Piedras Bayas BeachCamp\nh/t: Arch Daily', 'Once built purely for practicality in the face of some of the world’s most extreme climactic conditions, desert architecture has evolved into a modern art form, not just in stunning rammed-earth-meets-glass-and-steel visuals but in cutting edge energy efficiency.

Though it does not actually extend underground, it looks as if it could, seemingly rooted in the sand. The home was constructed off-site using 3D digital modeling and prefabrication techniques.\nTent-Like Open-Air Home\n(images via: design boom)\nConstructed almost entirely of scrap, waste and local materials, this open-air home designed by Simon de Aguero for the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture features a core structure made of rammed earth and a stretched vinyl shade acting as a roof.\nUnderground Stunner in Rural Greece\n(images via: deca)\nBarely visible above the bluffs in the arid desert climate of rural Greece, this rectangular underground home nestled in the valley between two hillsides takes advantage of cross-winds as well as the cooling effects of a green roof. Half-buried, the residence – designed by Deca – is open and airy, inspired by the simple white color palette of classical Greek architecture even when it doesn’t borrow busy details like columns.\nRustic Modern with Earth, Wood & Steel\n(images via: pique architecture)\nVarying volumes make this desert home by Pique visually engaging, especially with surface textures that include the requisite desert building material rammed earth as well as intentionally rusted metal and warm honeyed wood. All of these elements play off each other to present a cohesive whole that is simultaneously organic and geometric.\nDesert Dome in a Dormant Volcano\n(images via: redfin listing)\nPerched atop a dormant volcanic dome like a crown – or perhaps a wayward UFO – this unusual home between Las Vegas and Los Angeles is still up for sale after a long time on the market. Though it looks like solid concrete from afar, it’s actually wood covered in a thin layer of plaster. The driveway that spirals from a shallow lake at the base of the volcano to the home at its pinnacle gives the property an even more dramatic appearance.\nNeutral and Modern in the Arizona Desert\n(images via: chen + suchart studio)\nIn the urban desert of Tempe, Arizona, the Sosnowski Residence by Chen + Suchart Studio combines earthy and industrial elements with a glass-and-metal rectangular volume stacked atop a rammed earth base. This neutral lower level makes the upper floor, with its bold black frame and steel-paneled ceilings, seem to float above the sand.\nLefevre House: Where Peruvian Desert Meets Ocean\n(images via: archdaily)\nThere are few home sites more dramatic than the rocky cliffs of the Lefevre House, which acts as a conceptual bridge between the desert and the sea. Located in Punta Misterio, Peru, the home’s roof is an extension of the sand while a glass volume juts out of the cliff, providing incredible views of the crashing waves below.\nDesert Wing House by Brent Kendle\n(images via: cuded)\nWith its angled roof, made with copper mined locally in the Arizona desert, the Desert Wing House by Brent Kendle is dramatic and dynamic, seemingly ready to fly off into the sky at any moment. The solid rammed earth and concrete walls were designed to keep out the desert sun while walls of glass focus the views on nature rather than neighbors.\nGeltaftan System by Nader Khalili\n(images via: weburbanist)\nTaking a cue from ancient architecture that used local raw materials to create custom solutions for particular climates, architect Nader Khalili developed the Geltaftan System, building strong structures of mud bricks that are then fired for an entire day at 1,000 degrees Celsius – just like pottery. These ‘ceramic houses’ are permanent, water-resistant and earthquake-resistant with a finished result that blends seamlessly into the dunes of the surrounding landscape.\nWhen the Desert Takes Over: Homes Swallowed by Sand\n(images via: indiawaterportal,foreignpolicy.com, keyhole.com, sharonchadha)\nFor all the beautiful buildings that are thoughtfully designed to withstand the hot and dry desert climate, over time, nature does tend to take back over – as evidenced by these four structures, which have been swallowed by sand over decades or even centuries.

31	whitetail deer hunting location strategy elevated vs ground setup effectiveness advantages	Both elevated and ground setups have distinct advantages for whitetail hunting. Elevated stands provide a wider field of view to spot targets sooner and keep hunters above deer's vision and scent, though distance judgment is harder due to angles. Ground blinds offer effective cover for shot preparation and can be placed strategically, but limit visibility and shooting lanes, with scent being easier for deer to detect at ground level. The key to success is preparing locations based on five fundamentals: trails, funnels, pinch points, bedding areas, and food sources, while considering wind direction patterns for optimal positioning.	"['When I look at bowhunters who continue to take great bucks year after year, I believe the common thread boils down to one thing — being prepared. Some may argue it is their hunting spot. Some argue it is luck. Some say it\'s both.\nBut from where I stand, I know my whitetail success across North America has a repeating element that equals success. It\'s the preparation!\nOne particular area of preparation that really separates the good bowhunters from the great ones is stand location prep. Being ready for the rut is all about doing the right things NOW — in the summer — long before opening day. I think most of you hunters who are reading my articles are at a point where you really want to step up your success in the field.\nI hope you have moved past showing up at your local bow shop five days before the season to get your bow set up, buy a new trail camera and buy a new treestand. If you want your success to skyrocket, you need to put in some homework and a little pre-season prep to guarantee you punch your tag. This article is all about the crucial topic of pre-season stand preparation, because right now is the time to set the stage for a quick and efficient strike when your moment of truth presents itself.\nEach year, there are going to be some obvious things you should do for your stands. I don\'t want to spend a lot of time talking about these typical yearly things I believe most hunters do anyway; things such as making sure your shooting lanes are cleared and that your stand straps, chains, climbing sticks and other gear are safe and in good working order.\nI also highly recommend installing safety lines from the top of your stand all the way to the ground. This way you can be locked in from top to bottom throughout the season. This can literally be a lifesaver and isn\'t something worth saving a single penny on! Take it from someone who spent a year\'s pay on hospital bills for a kidney that was damaged while falling from a tree.\nAlso make sure you don\'t have anything below your tree that can impale you should you fall! This is serious stuff, my friends. You owe it to your family and friends to take my advice on this. So, clear your lanes and make sure your stands are hung correctly. For me, these are the obvious considerations. Now, let\'s get into the stuff that separates a good spot from a killing spot!\nFor each new season, I consider installing a new stand or relocating an old one. The one thing that is most important is to make sure you factor in what you learned the previous year. Observation is critical intelligence! For example, when I moved to Iowa and got permission on new hunting ground, I was going in blind when I first made my sets. I could only set up based on five fundamental things I found when scouting — trails, funnels, pinch points, bedding areas and food sources.\nRegardless of how long you have hunted, these five things are always important to know and can always serve as a good starting point for stand placement. Many times they will produce but often times not the biggest bucks. In my case, as a deer season unfolded and I sat those stands I started to notice certain patterns. The biggest bucks were using paths but not the ones most traveled by other deer. And as a result, they were just out of bow range.\nI find that the bigger bucks often fall into a continual pattern through the season and many times these patterns may be on the perimeters of the obvious. Certain ridge tops or thickets start to have dominant bucks show up each year about the same time. Some food plots may rarely have a good buck visit during daylight until the last weeks of the late season.\nKey observations such as this allow you to set up a stand for that spot. More importantly though is using your experience to know to save these locations for WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT! Experience tells me that learning patterns from the previous year and remembering them can help you produce really quickly, and here is my proof.\n""If you want your success to skyrocket, you need to put in some homework and a little pre-season prep to guarantee you punch your tag.""\nAfter a few years of spending time in a stand I was sure would produce but hadn\'t, I decided to learn from it. Although I liked the spot, I continually watched bucks travel each year during the first week of the rut about 200 yards away. My original spot had more trails and better sign, but the reality was the bucks just liked running this ridge a certain way for whatever reason. I moved my sets in the summer and knew I couldn\'t sit that stand until rut was in full swing.\nOn Nov. 3, 2014, I had the right wind and I knew the rut was heating up. I sat in the stand for the first time since I had set it up almost six months earlier. Two hours into my hunt, I had a buck of a lifetime come strolling right by with a young doe. One day, one strike! It was an extremely efficient hunting location.\nFast forward one year TO THE DAY! It\'s Nov. 3, 2015, and I have my good buddy and BOWHUNTING Editor Christian Berg in Iowa for his first time drawing a buck tag. I\'ll keep the story brief, because I know he wants to write a story about it, but to put it simply, the wind was right and we knew the chase was on. So, I took him to the same tree.\nAt eight o\'clock that morning, just two hours after we climbed into the tree, here comes a giant buck I hadn\'t seen a single time all year. Christian made a perfect heart shot and then just stared at me with a completely blank expression, wondering how that just happened and why his Iowa hunt was over so fast. I know, it\'s a story you probably want to dismiss and say, ""Yeah, right."" But it\'s true!\nThe moral of the story is, take note of where you see buck traffic the year prior and make sure you have a perfect killing tree set up in that spot next year. It has been my observation that patterns slightly adjust every few years. Observation and reaction is key!\nKnow the Ins and Outs\nOne of the most overlooked factors in picking a great stand location is knowing the best access routes. No matter where a stand is located, I guarantee you it is only as good as how stealthy you can be climbing into and out of it. Otherwise, it will fall victim to what I call ""the three-sit rule.""\nThe first sit you may see great movement, the second sit you will only see half the activity as the first and the third sit you see nothing. Then the stand is burned out, in my opinion. If you are noisy or visible getting into your stands, you will certainly be patterned by your deer. If I know a stand location is in the right place, the next thing I need to do is build my quiet entrance and/or exit route.\nA great resource for making a good entrance into a stand is an old push lawn mower. I have had one I picked up for $100 about 15 years ago. I can throw that on my Yamaha ATV in the middle of summer and go to my stands and fire it up to make a quick push in and out. This gets the deadfall and new growth mulched off the path and has it 90 percent ready for when I walk in during the season. If you do this for a few years, you may even try raking in a bag of clover or grass seed and see if you can make a two-foot-wide groomed trail.\nIn the stand I discussed earlier where Christian and I shot two giant bucks, I had done just that. I had mowed a path for about 150 yards though the timber since the day I hung it so that we could walk into the wind with extreme stealth. This has made a world of difference, because both deer were close by when we climbed in the stand. This mowing tactic can also be used in CRP fields, where it\'s extremely thick to walk in as well. One mowed path will serve a double purpose of a quiet trail for you and also a natural travel path for the deer to walk on. Several bucks had used the path we walked in on as a scrape line. I believe deer are lazy, and quiet paths such as these serve as good funnels.\nAlways Have an \'Easy\'\nSometimes, having a stand option that is very low impact can be the best stand location you have! These options are extremely effective during times of the year when you know you may only have an hour or two to hunt.\nThis may be during the rut on a morning you have two hours before heading to work. It could also be that day when the wife is testing you and says, ""You should have gone hunting tonight,"" about an hour after she knows you would have already left. If you have an ""easy,"" you can call her bluff and literally grab your bow and GO even if you are in your jeans and hoodie.\nThe ""easys"" are stands that may be fairly close to a road or close to where you can park. On my main hunting farm, I have an easy set up for any of the wind directions. I have two stand locations within 150 yards of a road. I know I can walk in and out of these spots at any time of the day. Both these spots are on pinch points of well-traveled trails that eventually cross the road. Neither is next to food or bedding. They are simply spots where deer randomly walk by at sporadic times of the day.\nIf you want to kill the biggest deer in your area, the key is to not ever reveal you are out hunting him. For that reason, I never risk burning a stand that may produce a dominant deer simply because I\'m low on time. Have your hotspots, but if you aren\'t able to be there in time to be stealthy, or the wind changes on you at the last minute, fall back into one of your easy spots.\nThis past year I was hunting with another good buddy of mine, Mike, the week after Christian left Iowa. One morning, we took too long getting ready and when we came outside it was starting to break daylight already. I knew if we went into the deep timber where I wanted to spend the day, we would blow most of it out walking in during the daylight. So instead, I told Mike we were heading to one of my easy spots since it would be low impact getting there in the light. A few hours later, we rattled an awesome buck to the base of the tree and Mike was in disbelief based on how close we were to the road.\nBe Ready for a \'Wrong\' Wind\nEach year, I capitalize on having a great few days of hunting simply because I have a treestand set for the least likely wind direction. It never fails that at some point during the year you are going to get a weather system move through that totally flips the natural wind directions 99 percent of your spots are set up for.\nI know lots of people who are then stuck either not hunting or having to ""risk"" not being smelled from one of their hotspots. Here in my state, the least likely wind direction is an east wind. I have two spots that sit idle except for the one or two days a season the winds flip from the east. One of the biggest bucks in my office came from one of those stands. I would have never bet that an early-December hunt with freezing temps and icy sleet and spitting rain and fog would have rolled in from the east, but it did. I was ready for it, and I was rewarded!\nI know a lot of hunters who like to hunt during the late fall or early winter and only set up for the common north or west wind pattern. You have to be ready for all winds, my friends! During my first few years living in the Midwest, I planned the majority of my stands for the cold west and north winds but neglected the southerly winds. That was a big mistake!\nI\'ve learned that the south winds often blow here just ahead of or behind the storm fronts. Each of the hunts I spoke of in the earlier sections came from stands I had set up for a southerly wind direction that was blowing in just before a major cool down. If you want to change your luck from the stand this year, then be ready for a change in the winds.\nGround blinds are a great option for bowhunters. What I like about them is the ability to fine-tune their location based on the wind direction even when a perfect tree is not available.\nNinety percent of my food source hunting has been done out of a Bale Blind or a hard blind in the past few years. They help contain movement and are great for the bitter days where you need to make a long day sit, like in the late season. Be sure to get them set up early and make sure they are secure. Deer build a quick tolerance to blinds and some are certainly better than others. If they are flopping around then they will be less tolerable!\nAnyone Can \'Get Lucky\'\nI have been really fortunate as a bowhunter over that past 20 years, especially in the whitetail woods. My success strings out from the far north of Canada to the far south of Mississippi. The truth is, I hunt a on limited budget. I hunt some private farms but also knock on a lot of doors and still love hunting public land. I fill a lot of tags, my best being three ""book"" bucks in three states in four days.\nI wish I had a dollar for every time someone told me I have a lucky horseshoe stuck in my butt. But I feel like my being ""lucky"" on a continual basis is actually based on something one of my great archery coaches told me, ""Being lucky is all about being prepared for when an opportunity presents itself."" I\'ve built my life and bowhunting career on that. I think anyone can.', 'Whether you shoot from the ground or from the trees, it all depends on which bowhunting blind you use.\nThere are a few different types of blinds to use when hunting.\nHere are some types to think about when you are preparing for bowhunting season.\nA ground blind is one of the most popular methods of blinds when it comes to hunting. It can be as basic as a natural blind built near trees, bushes, or logs; or something more man-man and specific like the portable camouflage cloth blinds.\nWhen using a ground blind, always place it downwind or crosswind from where you think you may see your target. Make sure to clear the ground cover from the floor to minimize noise if you need to move around.\nIt is especially important to use camouflage face paint or covering camo attire such as a mask or gloves when in a ground blind.\nYou can set up a ground blind ahead of time so it is all ready when you get out into the woods. Ground blinds also provide effective cover so you have more time to prepare for the shot.\nYou are at ground level so your scent is easier for deer to pick up; any movement is eye-level to any deer that may be in front of you. Also, ground blinds limit your visibility and shooting lane.\nA pit blind is a type of ground blind that consists of a shallow hole dug into the ground about knee-deep. It is usually surrounded by natural vegetation and camouflage cloth.\nBefore building a pit blind, check both state and local regulations as they are illegal in some areas. If you do build a pit blind to use when bowhunting, remember to always return the site to its natural state.\nSince you are half-buried in the ground, you have a lower silhouette than being in a regular ground blind. You can construct a built-in ledge seat so you don’t have to cart around a bucket for a seat and also make your pit large enough to accommodate all your gear.\nPit blinds are prohibited in most state-owned areas; this is why it is a good idea to check the regulations in the area of where you will be hunting.\nOnce you have ensured that you can build a pit blind, picking the perfect spot to hunt is vital because this type of bowhunting blind is not portable.\nAn elevated stand is the most popular type of stand for bowhunting whitetail deer and black bears.\nThe most common type of elevated stand is a treestand; a temporary stand that sits in or against a tree.\nUnlike a ground blind, an elevated blind permits a wider field of view, allowing you to spot your target sooner and have more time to plan for the shot. As you sit in the trees, you are above the vision of the deer, so your movement is slightly less noticeable as well as your scent.\nThere have been many injuries from hunters falling out of treestands. If you use one, be sure to use the safety harness provided. Some may be difficult to carry and when set up, there is no protection from the elements.\nJudging distance in a treestand is a little more difficult than on the ground because of the angle, and that is one of the most important things when bowhunting.\nEach one of these bowhunting blinds has its ups and downs. The best one to choose for your bowhunting experience is simply the one you prefer the most and the one you are most comfortable in.\nWhichever type of bowhunting blind you choose to use, pick it out and get it set up so you are ready for the start of the season.']"	['<urn:uuid:9e19fe90-3974-45d3-b269-7773e0cdff73>', '<urn:uuid:a31d4a0c-49f8-4ad5-aa13-361da28e53b2>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	11	97	3159
32	difference constructive destructive criticism	Constructive criticism is a compassionate attitude aimed at uplifting someone materially, morally, emotionally or spiritually, typically coming from someone with higher experience or knowledge and within a healthy personal relationship. Destructive criticism, in contrast, is intended to harm someone's creation, prestige, reputation and self-esteem, and may be done intentionally or out of ignorance. Sometimes destructive criticism can be disguised as constructive to be more painful while harming.	"['1 disapproval expressed by pointing out faults or shortcomings; ""the senator received severe criticism from his opponent"" [syn: unfavorable judgment]\n2 a serious examination and judgment of something; ""constructive criticism is always appreciated"" [syn: critique]\n3 a written evaluation of a work of literature [syn: literary criticism]\n- Albanian: autokritikë, vetëkritikë\n- Arabic: (naqd)\n- Czech: kritika\n- Dutch: kritiek\n- Finnish: kritiikki, arvostelu, arviointi, tarkastelu\n- French: critique\n- German: Kritik\n- Hebrew: ביקורת (biqoret)\n- Italian: critica\n- Turkish: tenkit, kusur bulma, eleştiri.\n- Ukrainian: критика (krytyka)\nThe word critic comes from the Greek , - one who discerns, which itself arises from the Ancient Greek word , , meaning a person who offers reasoned judgment or analysis, value judgment, interpretation, or observation. The term can be used to describe an adherent of a position disagreeing with or opposing the object of criticism.\nModern critics include professionals or amateurs who regularly judge or interpret performances or other works (such as those of artists, scientists, musicians, or actors), and typically publish their observations, often in periodicals. Critics are numerous in certain fields, including art, music, film, theatre or drama, restaurant, and scientific publication critics.\nCriticismCriticism in terms of expectations means democratic judgment over the suitability of a subject for the intended purposes, as opposed to the authoritarian command, which is meant as an absolute realization of the authority\'s will, thus not open for debate.\nCriticism is the activity of judgement or informed interpretation and, in many cases, can be synonymous with ""analysis."" In literary and academic contexts, the term most frequently refers to literary criticism, art criticism, or other such fields, and to scholars\' attempts to understand the aesthetic object in depth. In these contexts the term ""critic,"" used without qualification, most frequently refers to a scholar of literature or another art form. In other contexts, the term describes hostility or disagreement with the object of criticism. Sometimes context, and the contentiousness of the subject, are the only differentiating factors between these two approaches. In politics, for instance (as in the phrase ""criticism of U.S. foreign policy""), criticism almost exclusively refers to disagreement—while in an academic, artistic, or literary context (as in ""criticism of Romantic poetry"") it usually refers to the activity of subtle interpretation or analysis.\nConstructive criticismConstructive criticism is a compassionate attitude towards the person qualified for criticism. Having higher experience, gifts, respect, knowledge in specific field and being able to verbally convince at the same time, this person is intending to uplift the other person materially, morally, emotionally or spiritually. For high probability in succeeding his compassionate criticism the critic has to be in some kind of healthy personal relationship with the other one, which is normally a parent to child, friend to friend, teacher to student, spouse to spouse or any kind of recognized authority in specific field. Hence the word constructive is used so that something is created or visible outcome generated rather than the opposite. Participatory learning in pedagogy is based on these principles of constructive criticism. Here the saying applies that example is better than precept.\nThere can be tension between constructive and useful criticism; for instance, a critic might usefully help an individual artist to recognize what is poor or slapdash in their body of work—but the critic may have to appear harsh and judgmental in order to state this. But useful criticism is a practical part of constructive criticism.\nDestructive criticismDestructive criticism is intended to harm someone, derogate and destroy someone’s creation, prestige, reputation and self-esteem on whatever level it might be. This may be done intentionally or out of sheer ignorance and foolishness. Hence the word destructive is used. In practical life destructive criticism may be disguised as constructive to be more painful while harming. Valid examination of intention of critic is when asked to prove, to help or to be somewhat useful at all. Often destructive criticism comes from persons who are envious, cruel and those who judges in fields which are not their own.\nAn alternative definition of the difference is ""Criticism by me is constructive. Criticism of me is destructive."" More usefully, whether criticism is constructive or destructive depends heavily on the use the listener makes of it. ""Whether the critic meant to be constructive or destructive in pointing out that ""2+2 does not equal 7"" is not nearly as important as whether the person addressed corrects his arithmetic. Many of the common definitions of ""constructive"" and ""destructive"" border on logical fallacies: here the given definition of ""constructive"" is very close to argument from authority, and the definition of ""destructive"" makes it easy to fall into argument ad hominem. Criticism cannot be ignored or accepted based on whether it is constructive or destructive.\nCriticism in psychologyCriticism can also be a tool of antisocial behavior, such as a passive-aggressive attack.\nOne of the symptoms of Narcissistic Personality Disorder is an inability to tolerate any forms of criticism.\n- Art historian\n- Critical management studies\n- Critical theory\n- Critical theory (Frankfurt School)\n- Critical thinking\n- Critical vocabulary\n- Criticism of atheism\n- Criticism of religion\n- Cultural critic\n- Film criticism\n- Food critic\n- Literary criticism\n- Music journalism\n- Social criticism\n- Textual criticism\n- What ""Critical"" means in ""Critical Thinking"": Donald Jenner, BMCC/CUNY (pdf)\ncriticism in Arabic: نقد\ncriticism in Czech: Kritik\ncriticism in Danish: Kritik\ncriticism in German: Kritiker\ncriticism in Spanish: Crítica\ncriticism in Esperanto: Kritikisto\ncriticism in Indonesian: Kritik\ncriticism in Dutch: Kritiek\ncriticism in Japanese: 評論家\ncriticism in Polish: Krytyka\ncriticism in Russian: Критик\ncriticism in Albanian: Kritika\ncriticism in Simple English: Critic\ncriticism in Serbian: Критичар\ncriticism in Finnish: Arvostelu\ncriticism in Swedish: Kritiker\ncriticism in Turkish: Eleştiri\ncriticism in Ukrainian: Критик\ncriticism in Chinese: 評論家\nadverse criticism, analysis, animadversion, appraisal, approval, aspersion, assessment, bad notices, bad press, book review, captiousness, carping, cavil, caviling, censoriousness, censure, comment, commentary, commentation, condemnation, critical bibliography, critical journal, critical notice, critical review, critique, cryptanalysis, cryptography, cryptology, diagnostics, disapproval, disparagement, editorial, epigraphy, estimate, estimation, evaluation, examination, exception, exegetics, faultfinding, flak, gloss, hairsplitting, hermeneutics, hit, home thrust, hostile criticism, hypercriticalness, hypercriticism, imputation, judgement, knock, leader, leading article, lexicography, literary criticism, metoposcopy, nagging, niggle, niggling, nit, nit-picking, notice, obloquy, observation, oneirology, opinion, overcriticalness, paleography, pathognomy, pestering, pettifogging, physiognomics, physiognomy, priggishness, quibble, quibbling, rap, rating, reflection, remark, renew, report, reproachfulness, review, running commentary, semeiology, semeiotics, slam, stricture, study, swipe, symptomatology, taking exception, textual criticism, trichoschistism, tropology, valuation, write-up']"	['<urn:uuid:a8bdd36a-df18-4928-b901-5c987a2bd9f9>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	4	67	1072

In wave 1 we found just the respondent, a single working mom, with one child, age 7. In wave 2 the respondent had become a grandmother and her adult daughter, age 24, had moved in. Both were employed. A new focal child was selected in wave 2, age 4, and that was the child of the adult daughter. The daughter also had a 6-year-old living in the household. This meant that the respondent had one child and two grandchildren living in the home. At wave 3 the children stayed the same, but another adult daughter came to live with them. She was 27 and the aunt of the focus child, now age 7. All the children are boys. The respondent has a GED. In wave 1 (when she was the only adult in the HH) she indicated that she had been with her employer for 3 years and that household income was between $10,000 and $14,999. She said that she did not have a checking account because “I deal with cash.” In waves 2 and 3 the household income stayed around $30,000 despite the addition of the two working adult daughters. The family received food stamps in waves 1 and 2 but not 3.

"['Mgrublian Center for Human Rights\nInspiring Human Rights\nThe Center will continue its mission to instill in students an understanding of human rights as central to moral conduct and ethical decisions in their personal lives, in their careers and in the public arena.\nIn fulfillment of its mission, the Center:\n- will promote human rights globally and locally through public advocacy, service and education;\n- will provide practical experience for students through internships, task forces and research; and\n- will advance scholarship in the study of human rights, Holocaust history and genocide studies, including the Armenian Genocide.\nThe Center’s educational program has as its core a sequence of courses designed to enable students to understand the causes and lessons of the Holocaust and contemporary human rights abuses and genocide.\nThe Center’s programs offer students the opportunity to work with and gain exposure to scholars, activists, advocates, business and political leaders in four broad areas:\n- Student internships and projects in leading human rights and Holocaust organizations\n- Academic study and coursework\n- Academic research and publication\n- Conferences and other events\nThe Center’s human rights internships support students to work as interns in leading human rights, genocide and Holocaust organizations.\nStudents gain practical experience of the ways in which knowledge, political and economic policies, and leadership must be combined to understand and overcome human rights abuses and genocide in today’s world.\nThe Center also supports course work and research in these fields by faculty and students and brings leading human rights and Holocaust specialists to the campus to speak with students and the larger community.\nClaremont McKenna College’s mission is to provide students with a superior liberal arts education that prepares them for leadership in business, the professions, and government. In keeping with these goals, CMC began to support teaching and research about the Holocaust in the early 1970s, and launched the Center for the Study of the Holocaust, Genocide and Human Rights in March 2003, placing the College among the forerunners in the field of Holocaust Studies. The name of the center was changed in May 2009 to The Center for Human Rights.\nFounding donor Leigh Crawford ’94 made possible the establishment of the Center in March 2003. Professor John Roth, who served through 2006, was the Center’s founding director. Professor Jonathan Petropoulos, initially the Center’s associate director, succeeded Roth from 2007-2008. Professor Edward Haley directed the Center from 2008-2014.\nFrom the very beginning, through its programs of teaching, visiting scholars, academic travel, internships, and service, the Center has sought to enable students to understand the causes and legacy of the Holocaust and to develop the ethical commitments and leadership qualities necessary to prevent and overcome human rights abuses in today’s world.\nThe Center\'s human rights initiatives led by students include a role in founding and developing Students Against Genocide, a nation-wide effort aimed at stopping genocide in Darfur, Sudan, and a mission to provide relief to residents of New Orleans following the destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina. Other initiatives supported by the Center include summer human rights internships for students, the Center’s student-led Human Rights Task Forces, and funding for student-faculty research, visiting scholars, and speakers.\nStudents Against Genocide (SAG)\nWith support from the Center, Students Against Genocide (SAG) was created in the fall of 2004 to raise awareness about the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Darfur, a western region of Sudan. Led by a committee of students at CMC, SAG produced an extensive research report on the genocide in Darfur titled ""From Kigali to Khartoum: Genocide in Western Sudan."" The paper, which explores the similarities between the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and that in Darfur, is available here on the SAG website. SAG also distributed fliers on campus and to student groups at other colleges. In January of 2005, the group traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with policymakers and experts regarding the situation in Sudan. The group met with more than 20 Congressional offices, with Jerry Fowler, director of the Committee on Conscience, and with Charles Snyder, the senior expert on Sudan at the State Department. In cooperation with other student groups at the Claremont Colleges, SAG facilitated the sales of thousands of ""Stop Genocide in Sudan"" t-shirts to students and activists around the world. The shirts, designed by CMC student Keara Duggan, are available online. SAG is supported by CMC\'s Holocaust Center and its Student Advisory Committee.']"	['<urn:uuid:ea572a15-00ff-417e-a811-0d6600da6f16>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	7	39	731
35	what chemicals released during inflammation process cause physical symptoms immune system	When white blood cells release substances into blood or affected tissues, it increases blood flow to the injury or infection area, causing redness and warmth. Some chemicals cause fluid to leak into tissues, resulting in swelling. This process can stimulate nerves and cause pain.	"['The body\'s white blood cells and substances that they produce to protect our bodies from infection by foreign organisms, such as bacteria and viruses.\nIn some inflammatory diseases, however, the body\'s defense system -- the immune system -- triggers a response when there are no foreign substances to fight off. In these diseases, called autoimmune disorders, the body\'s normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues. The body responds as if normal tissues are infected or somehow abnormal.\nWhat Diseases Are Associated With Inflammation?\nSome, but not all, types of arthritis are the result of misdirected inflammation. Arthritis is a general term that describes inflammation in the joints. Some types of arthritis associated with inflammation include the following:\nWhat Are the Symptoms of Inflammation?\nInflammation is characterized by:\nOften, only a few of these symptoms are present.\nInflammation may also be associated with general ""flu-like"" symptoms including:\n- Fatigue/loss of energy\n- Loss of appetite\n- Muscle stiffness\nWhat Causes Inflammation and What Are Its Effects?\nInflammation occurs when substances from the body\'s white blood cells are released into the blood or affected tissues to protect your body from foreign invaders. This release of chemicals increases the blood flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in redness and warmth. Some of the chemicals cause a leak of fluid into the tissues, resulting in swelling. This protective process may stimulate nerves and cause pain.\nThe increased number of cells and inflammatory substances within the joint cause irritation, swelling of the joint lining, and eventual wearing down of cartilage (cushions at the end of bones).\nHow Are Inflammatory Diseases Diagnosed?\nInflammatory diseases are diagnosed after careful evaluation of the following:\n- Complete medical history and physical exam with attention to the location of painful joints\n- Presence of joint stiffness in the morning\n- Evaluation of accompanying symptoms and signs\n- Results of X-rays and laboratory tests\nCan Inflammation Affect Internal Organs?\nYes. Inflammation can affect organs as part of an autoimmune disorder. The type of symptoms experienced depends on which organs are affected. For example:\n- Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis) may cause shortness of breath or fluid retention.\n- Inflammation of the small tubes that transport air to the lungs may cause shortness of breath.\n- Inflammation of the kidneys (nephritis) may cause high blood pressure or kidney failure.\nPain may not be a primary symptom of an inflammatory disease, because many organs do not have pain-sensitive nerves. Treatment of organ inflammation is directed at the cause of inflammation whenever possible.\nHow Are Inflammatory Joint Diseases Treated?\nThere are a number of treatment options for inflammatory diseases including medications, rest, exercise, and surgery to correct joint damage. The type of treatment prescribed will depend on several factors, including the type of disease, the person\'s age, type of medications he or she is taking, overall health, medical history, and severity of symptoms.\nThe goals of treatment are the following:\n- Correct, control, or slow down the underlying disease process\n- Avoid or modify activities that aggravate pain\n- Relieve pain through pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs\n- Maintain joint movement and muscle strength through physical therapy\n- Decrease stress on the joints by using braces, splints, or canes as needed\nWhat Drugs Are Used to Treat Inflammatory Diseases?\nThere are many drugs available to decrease joint pain, swelling and inflammation, and possibly prevent or minimize the progression of the inflammatory disease. The medications include the following:\n- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen or naproxen)\n- Corticosteroids (such as prednisone)\n- Antimalarial medications (such as hydroxychloroquine)\n- Other oral drugs, including apremilast (Otezla), azathioprine (Imuran), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), leflunomide (Arava), methotrexate, and sulfasalazine\n- Biologic drugs such as abatacept, adalimumab (Humira), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), enercept-szzs (Ereizi), golimumab (Simponi, Simponi Aria), infliximab (Remicade), rituximab (Rituxin), and tocilizumab (Actemra).\nSome of these medications are traditionally used to treat other conditions such as cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, or to reduce the risk of rejection of a transplanted organ. However, when ""chemotherapy"" drugs (such as methotrexate or cyclophosphamide) are used to treat inflammatory diseases, the doses are significantly lower and the risks of side effects tend to be less than when prescribed in higher doses for cancer treatment.\nWhen you are prescribed any medication, it is important to meet with your doctor regularly so he or she can detect the development of any side effects.']"	['<urn:uuid:7ef83d0d-9b1e-4558-835d-df35ee8f6fac>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	11	44	739
36	How do conservation projects preserve religious and cultural heritage sites?	The Sarica Church conservation project in Cappadocia preserved a Byzantine church's authentic architectural character while adapting it for modern visitors, including restoring wall paintings and geometric designs. In Serbia, the Ambassador's Fund supported various religious heritage preservation projects, including the restoration of frescoes at Studenica Monastery - an important Serbian religious and cultural center since the 12th century, and the reconstruction of the roof at Bela Crkva Catholic Church, which serves both as a religious site and community center for cultural events.	"['Sarica Church Conservation and Restoration Project involves the conservation and restoration of a Byzantine church located in Cappadocia, Turkey. Initiated by the aspirations of a private firm, the project successfully enabled the revitalization of the dilapidated church and provided its accessibility to visitors. Within the unique geographical setting of Cappadocia, Sarica Church stands out as one of the properly restored and revitalized churches in the region.\nSarica Church is within a first degree natural conservation area and very close to the area in Cappadocia which was designated a World Heritage Site in 1985, namely the ""Gouml;reme National Park and the Rock Sites of Cappadocia"". Located within a geography known for the monastic life of the early Christian period in Anatolia (Asia Minor), Sarica Church is an example of troglodyte heritage, carving the naturally soft tuff stone that characterizes the region of Cappadocia to create living spaces.\nThe conservation and restoration of the church, features a \'\'nature repair\'\' approach, aimed to ensure the healthy survival of the building\'\'s authentic architectural character, and introduce the information and visitor based functions of a permanent exhibition space.\nRock-carving is a centuries-old tradition in Cappadocia. Especially dominant in the construction of churches, the method is simple: to carve a straight tunnel inside the rock and then to elaborate this into other spaces as required. The master usually starts from the top of the structure, finishing the upper structure of domes, vaults and arches first and then continuing to the bottom. Since there are no structural necessities involved in rock-carved buildings, such as having to construct columns or load-bearing walls, all the structural elements that are seen in these churches are all for appearances sake; in other words, the columns, domes, arches that are frequently used in rock-carved churches are actually not functional and merely serve the purpose of making the building look like a masonry construction. It is known that usually two or three workers did this work, depending on the hardness of the tuff stone. Following the end of the Byzantine Empire, these churches were never used as frequently as they were during the empire. These spaces were mostly used as storage units.\nSarica Church, was constructed in a hybrid style, combining the early Byzantine \'\'cross-in-square\'\' plan seen from the 9th century onwards and the triconchs / tetraconchs plan seen in later centuries. The decorations on the church walls, made with a single colour of red ochre, are not sufficient for accurately dating the building. However, considering similarities with other churches in Cappadocia containing the cross-in-square plan layout, such as Elmali, Karanlik and Haci Ismail churches, which were dated to 10th-13th centuries in view of their wall paintings, Sarica Church can be dated to the same period. The church lying in an east-west direction, consists of a nave, narthex and a space (possibly a refectory - trapeza?) unearthed during restoration works.\nSarica Church was in a very poor condition prior to conservation interventions. The current owner, who bought the land in which the church is located in 1992, did not make use of the church and it is not known when the church was last used for any purpose. Buried in earth, the building was a hidden ruin, with only a hole on top of the church that enabled entrance to it. When project work started, the exterior and interior of the building was accurately documented to reveal the state of the building.\nSimilar to many other rock-carved churches in Cappadocia, which no longer operate, Sarica Church had natural deterioration problems as well as housing evidences of later interventions that harmed several parts of the building. Deterioration is observed throughout the church and narthex spaces, whereas human interventions remain isolated.\nSurface erosion is the most serious problem, observed in almost every space, especially the lower sections of the walls and columns. Columns in the church and narthex as well as the pilasters in the east space (refectory / trapeze) have eroded to a wide extent. This is a general deterioration problem encountered throughout the whole Cappadocian region. Flaking, yet another problem frequently observed in this region, is mostly seen in the upper structure of the narthex. One of the columns in the church space was missing, though one small part of it was found.\nExamining the building in detail reveals that the church continued to be used after it ceased to function as a church. There are missing architectural elements; the altar stone must have been removed at some period. Other interventions, mostly carved niches, indicate that the church might have been used as a pigeon house for a while. An evidence of later use is the hole opening to the outside, either to let pigeons in or to light the interior. This prevented the interpretation of the dome as a whole. The ground at the entrance to the church space from the narthex side was carved out at some stage, leaving a big hole preventing pedestrian access to the church space.\nIn spite of the climatic effects of hundreds of years and human interventions, the qualities that make Sarica Church one of the characteristic churches of the Byzantine era can be easily identified. The decay and later interventions do not prevent the interpretation of its architectural plan and the church still maintains its former qualities.\nDiscovered by the sponsor firm VASCO during a tourism event in 1996, the church was unrecognizable from the outside and in a very poor physical condition. The project sponsor, which aspired to help preserve the ancient buildings in the Cappadocian region, made an application to the Turkish Ministry of Culture for the necessary permission to repair Sarica Church. Work started following the permission that was granted. A conservation and restoration project for the church was started in August 1997 and completed in April 1998 upon the approval of the Nevsehir Regional Council for Protection of Cultural and Natural Heritage. Project implementation took place between the years 2001 - 2004.\nFor the project\'s documentation purposes, drawings were prepared based on the site work where optic / electronic and manual measurements were made, as well as various analyses on the building\'\'s defects. The documentation was followed by an evaluation study and a restitution project examining the building\'\'s past and present periods.\nThe conservation - restoration project, prepared on the basis of the gathered findings, features a \'\'nature repair\'\' approach, aimed to ensure the healthy survival of the building\'\'s authentic architectural character, and introduce the information and visitor based functions of a permanent exhibition space. Thus, measures were taken for the removal of harmful human interventions and natural damage, for repairs to be made within the framework of emergency consolidation, such as the reinforcement of the natural material and remedy of cracks in the rock of the superstructure.\nAt first, all plants, soil, debris, etc. were cleared off the site and a survey excavation was conducted, leading to the discovery of an additional space believed to be a refectory.\nFor the repair of architectural elements on the dome and facade, which had undergone severe erosion by rainwater, the damaged parts were supported by load-bearing scaffolding, and the softened rock was replaced with harder local tuff stone of similar color. The exterior dome surface was filled with light gravel until the original rock profile was regained.\nThe main aim of the implementation works was the redirection of naturally formed drainage channels to manage the rainwater that damaged the church, while maintaining the authentic rock structure and material. Within this scope, a new drainage canal and a low wall were constructed, buried in the soil, along the vineyard boundary on the hill where the church is located. Eroded stone on the facade was also replaced by a covering of harder tuff stone. Afterwards, a steel matting was hung over the church roof and facade, suspended from the wall by thin steel cables and covered with layers of a local sand- hydraulic lime mixture, in a way that catches the even, natural surface. A layer of local slate was then applied to the surface to hold the soil.\nAfterwards, the wall paintings of the narthex and nave, featuring mostly geometric designs, were repaired by specialist restorers.\nFollowing these conservation works, the building was adapted to enable visitors to see the building and get information on the project. For this purpose, a walkway was designed which was built at a distance to the walls, and information panels were erected in the narthex. Appropriate lighting provided the interiors to be fully interpreted.\nThe church began operating in 2004. Today, the church is open to visitors from 1 April to 31 October. There is also a tour guide / attendant present at the church at all times.\nSarica Church has received two prestigious awards in the year 2004. Within the scope of the National Architecture Exhibition and Awards, which is considered the highest award of the architecture community and the ninth of which was held, KA.BA Conservation of Historic Buildings and Architecture Ltd received the \'\'Conservation Award\'\' in the building category for the Sarica Church Conservation - Restoration and Exhibition Project.\nThe \'\'Green Palm\'\' Award of GEO - SAISON, one of the largest tourism magazines of Germany, has been given to Dr. Yusuf Ornek, Owner of VASCO Tourism Investment Industry and Trade Inc, for his efforts to preserve the Sarica Church.\nFurthermore, Sarica Church, received an Achievement award from the Association of Historic Towns and Regions, Encouragement Award for historic Heritage Conservation Projects and Implementations.\nLastly, the church received the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / EUROPA NOSTRA Awards, 2006 / Architectural Heritage Top Prize. This is the first time a project in Turkey is being so honored.\nThe Best in Heritage\nThe world\'s only survey of award-winning museum, heritage and conservation projects.\nEuropean Heritage Association\nTrg kralja Petra Krešimira IV, 7\n© Copyright 2002-2017 The Best In Heritage.

The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs administers the Fund, established by Congress in 2001 to assist countries to preserve their cultural heritage. The U.S. Congress, in approving funding for the Ambassador’s Fund for Cultural Preservation, noted, “By taking a leading role in efforts to preserve cultural heritage, we show our respect for other cultures.” The American Embassy in Belgrade views this Fund as an important sign of the American people’s respect for Serbian culture and of the strong friendship between our two countries.\nThe Ambassador’s Fund for Cultural Preservation supported these projects in Serbia:\n2016 - University Library Svetozar Markovic - restoration of the façade and roof - $106,000\nThis project aims to repair the leaking roof and the damaged facade of the main library building. Repairing these damaged areas will prevent further destruction of the library’s structure and subsequently reduce the possibility of losing its priceless old and rare books, manuscripts and maps. The University Library Collection consists of monographs, periodicals, reference books, manuscripts, archival materials, doctoral dissertations and electronic resources. In addition, invaluable special collections and legacies (27 in total) among which is the Carnegie collection, which was donated to the University Library in 1927, are stored in the building. The building has suffered serious damage due to rainfall and subsequent water penetration. The roof is corroded and full of bad joints, and the facade is significantly damaged. Dampness in the rooms creates mold and jeopardizes the condition of numerous valuable collections such as legacy collections from famous Serbian scientists and writers, archival records containing documents from the 17th to 20th centuries, 15 incunabula from the 15th century, portions of manuscripts dating from the 13th century and over 10,000 additional old and rare books and manuscripts.\n2013 - Roman Imperial Palace Sirmium – Conservation And Restoration Of Mosaics - $73,000\nThe cultural preservation program is designed to return the primary elements of the interior decoration in one of the best preserved rooms (Room 16, probably part of the residential quarter in the late Roman Imperial Palace) to something approximating its original luxurious state. This is an integral part of the celebration of the 1700 anniversary of the Edict of Milan in this former capital of the Roman Empire with strong associations with the first Christian emperor Constantine and his successors. The program will be accomplished by restoring decorative features which were clearly documented in the original excavations in the 1970’s, namely the marble-faced fountain at the end of the room, the geometric pavement presently in place and the earlier figural (representation of the god Mercury) mosaic pavement from the room, for wall display. The wall display of the Mercury mosaic will lead the way into the second phase of the Palace presentation project, which is the step by step restoration of the mosaic pavements and their presentation in the Palace pavements and on the preservation structure walls.\n2011 - Felix Romuliana Magura Hill – Conservation And Restoration Of Romula's Tumulus - $65,800\nThe purpose of the project is to conserve and restore Romula’s tumulus, or burial mound, on the Magura Hill, the site of the Imperial Palace complex of Felix Romuliana, which is a Late Roman palace and memorial complex built in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries, commissioned by the Emperor Galerius Maximianus. The strong fortifications of the palace reflect the fact that the Tetrarch Emperors were all senior military leaders. The spatial and visual relationships between the palace and the memorial complex, where the mausoleums of the Emperor and his mother Romula are located, are unique. Conservation and restoration of Romula’s tumulus is essential as the circular stone wall around the mound has collapsed in several places which can be seen in the attached photos. Conservation of the wall is essential to prevent further weakening of the entire tumulus.\n2010 - Ethnographic Museum - Reconstruction Of Roof To Protect Frescoes - $65,200\nThis project had in mind to completely repair the roof of the Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade, Serbia. The Ethnographic Museum building was constructed in 1935 by a famous Serbian architect, Mr. Aleksandar Djordjevic.\nIt was built for the use of the Belgrade Stock Exchange and is located in the center of the city. It is located near University of Belgrade, which is a donation of Misa Anastasijevic and near Ilija Kolarac and other national historical building sites. This building is under the special protection of the Institute for Cultural Monument Protection for the City of Belgrade and the initiative for prevention from further damage and restoration has been started. For this reason, the main project has been restoration of the facade of the Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade and replacement of the roof. The first phase of restoration, including windows, is completed and financed by local donors.\nThe next step was to completely remove the existing roof and install a new one. The reason for initiating this project was because the building was suffering major damage due to rainfall and penetration of water into the offices and exhibition rooms. Dampness in the offices created mold and jeopardized the condition of numerous valuable exhibit pieces located at the Ethnographic Museum which were collected during the past 100 years.\n2009 - Bela Crkva Catholic Church - Reconstruction Of Roof To Protect Frescoes - $44,500\nThe project entails replacement of damaged and weather-exposed roof tiles in the Church of St. Ana, a Catholic Church in the multi-national and multi-confessional community of Bela Crkva, Northwestern Serbia. The paintings on the ceiling of the church have been damaged and are at great risk for further destruction in a short period of time. The Church is considered a landmark of the town, and it importance to the community is of greater significance than just the number of catholic churchgoers. The building is also used as a community center for all faiths and events as it has the best acoustics in town of all the public places, and is often a venue for civic and cultural events.\n2008 - Studenica Monastery - Restoration Of Frescoes - $33,850\nThe Studenica Monastery serves as a guardian of Serbian religious tradition and culture. As the most important monastery complex of medieval Serbia, Studenica is still the most important artistic and spiritual center of the Serbian people. Since the 12th century, when it was founded, the life of the monastic community has never been interrupted and its cultural strata can be ascertained by the great number of architectural and painting achievements. The spiritual and cultural richness of the Studenica Monastery has drawn the attention not only of the domestic public, but also the international community, who understand that Studenica is placed in the first rank of the world’s cultural and religious monuments.\n2007 - Viminacium Roman Archeological Site – Excavation Of The Amphitheater - $31,255\n$31,255 for the analysis and excavation of the Roman amphitheater at Viminacium. On September 13, 2007, U.S. Ambassador to Serbia Cameron Munter signed a grant of $31,200 to help preserve the Roman amphitheater at the Viminacium Archaeological Site through the Ambassador’s Fund for Cultural Preservation. Dr. Miomir Korac, Assistant Minister of Culture of the Republic of Serbia and Viminacium Project Director accepted the grant. The signing took place at the mausoleum located at the Viminacium site. Funds for the project will be used to define the physical extent of the site where the amphitheater is located and evaluation of the state of preservation of the structure in order to place it under the protection of law as a cultural monument. The project will also plan for the conservation and presentation of the archaelogical means and artifacts associated with the structure.

Is there a scientific connection between lack of sleep and how well our brains work?	Yes, there is a strong scientific connection between sleep deprivation and cognitive performance. Studies show that lack of sleep severely impairs cognitive function - even losing just 1-2 hours of sleep per night can significantly reduce your ability to function. In fact, research conducted at a New Jersey mall demonstrated that sleep deprivation can reduce fluid intelligence scores by the equivalent of 13-14 IQ points, which can move someone from 'average' to 'borderline deficient' cognitive performance. Sleep deprivation affects various cognitive abilities including concentration, problem-solving, creativity, and accuracy. It can also lead to microsleep - brief moments of sleep while awake - which can be extremely dangerous, especially when driving or operating machinery. Getting proper sleep (7-9 hours for adults) is essential for maintaining cognitive performance, productivity, and overall brain function.	"['In this exclusive excerpt of Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much, Harvard economist Sendhil Mullainathan and Princeton psychologist Eldar Shafir explore the concept of scarcity: its ubiquity, its challenges, and its silver lining.\nTime and Money\nSendhil was grumbling to Eldar. He had more to-dos than time to do them in. Deadlines had matured from “overdue” to “alarmingly late.” Meetings had been sheepishly rescheduled. His inbox was swelling with messages that needed his attention. He could picture his mother’s hurt face at not getting even an occasional call. His car registration sticker had expired. And things were getting worse. That conference one connecting flight away seemed like a good idea six months ago. Not so much now. Falling behind had turned into a vicious cycle. Re-registering the car was now one more thing to do. A project had taken a wrong direction because of a tardy email response; getting it back on track meant yet more work. The past-due pile of life was growing dangerously close to toppling.\nThe irony of spending time lamenting the lack of time was not lost on Eldar. It was only partly lost on Sendhil who, undeterred, described his plan for getting out. He would first stem the tide. Old obligations would need to be fulfilled, but new ones could be avoided. He would say no to every new request. He would prevent further delays on old projects by working meticulously to finish them. Eventually this austerity would pay off. The to-do pile would shrink to a manageable level. Only then would he even think about new projects. And of course he would be more prudent going forward. “Yes” would be rare and uttered only after careful scrutiny. It would not be easy, but it was necessary.\nHaving made the plan felt good. Of course it did. As Voltaire noted long ago, “Illusion is the first of all pleasures.”\nA week later, another call from Sendhil: Two colleagues were putting together a book on the lives of low-income Americans. “This is a great opportunity. We should write a chapter,” he said. His voice, Eldar recalls, lacked even a trace of irony.\nPredictably, the chapter was “too good to pass up,” and we agreed to do it. Just as predictably, it was a mistake, written in a rush and behind schedule. Unpredictably, it was a worthwhile mistake, creating an unexpected connection that eventually led to this book. Here is an excerpt from our background notes for that chapter:\nShawn, an office manager in Cleveland, was struggling to make ends meet. He was late on a bunch of bills. His credit cards were maxed out. His paycheck ran out quickly. As he said, “There is always more month than money.” The other day, he accidentally bounced a check after overestimating the money in his account; he had forgotten a $22 purchase. Every phone call made him tense: another creditor calling to “remind” him? Being out of money was also affecting his personal life. Sometimes at dinner he would put in less than his fair share because he was short. His friends understood, but it didn’t feel good. And there was no end in sight. He had bought a Blu-ray player on credit, with no payments for the first six months. That was five months ago. How would he pay this extra bill next month? Already, more and more money went to paying off old debts. The bounced check had a hefty overdraft charge. The late bills meant late fees. His finances were a mess. He was in the deep end of the debt pool and barely staying afloat.\nShawn, like many people in his situation, got financial advice from many sources, all of it pretty similar: Don’t sink any deeper. Stop borrowing. Cut your spending to the minimum. Some expenses may be tough to cut, but you’ll have to learn how. Pay off your old debts as quickly as possible. Eventually, with no new debts, your payments will become manageable. After this, remain vigilant so as not to fall back in. Spend and borrow wisely. Avoid unaffordable luxuries. If you must borrow, be clear about what it takes to pay it back. This advice worked better in theory than in practice for Shawn. Resisting temptation is hard. Resisting all temptations was even harder. A leather jacket he had coveted went on sale at a great price. Skimping on his daughter’s birthday gift felt less sensible as the day got closer. There were too many ways to spend more than he planned. Shawn eventually sank back into the debt pool.\nIt did not take long for us to notice the resemblance between Sendhil’s and Shawn’s behavior. Missed deadlines are a lot like overdue bills. Double-booked meetings (committing time you do not have) are a lot like bounced checks (spending money you do not have). The busier you are, the greater the need to say no. The more indebted you are, the greater the need to not buy. Plans to escape sound reasonable but prove hard to implement. They require constant vigilance—about what to buy or what to agree to do. When vigilance flags—the slightest temptation in time or in money—you sink deeper. Shawn ended up stuck with accumulating debt. Sendhil ended up stuck under mounting commitments.\nThis resemblance is striking because the circumstances are so different. We normally think of time management and money management as distinct problems. The consequences of failing are different: bad time management leads to embarrassment or poor job performance; bad money management leads to fees or eviction. The cultural contexts are different: falling behind and missing a deadline means one thing to a busy professional; falling behind and missing a debt payment means something else to an urban low-wage worker. The surroundings differ. The education levels differ. Even aspirations can differ. Yet despite these differences, the end behavior was remarkably similar. Sendhil and Shawn did have one thing in common: each of them was feeling the effects of scarcity.\nBy scarcity we mean having less than you feel you need. Sendhil felt harried; he felt he had too little time to do all the things he needed to do. Shawn felt cash-strapped, with too little money for all the bills he needed to pay. Could this common connection explain their behavior? Could it be that scarcity itself led Sendhil and Shawn to behave in such similar ways?\nImagine that you are surfing the web on your laptop. On a reasonably fast computer, you easily go from page to page. But imagine now that there many other programs open in the background. You have some music playing, files downloading and a bunch of browser windows open. Suddenly you are crawling, not surfing, the web. These background programs are eating up processor cycles. Your browser is limping along because it has less computing power to work with.\nScarcity does something similar to our mental processor. By constantly loading the mind with other processes, it leaves less “mind” for the task at hand. Scarcity directly reduces bandwidth — not a person’s inherent capacity, but how much of that capacity is currently available for use.\nIt may strike you as odd that a person’s “capacity” can be so easily affected, but that is precisely the point—we are used to thinking of cognitive capacity as fixed, when in fact it might change with circumstances. To see the effect of scarcity on fluid intelligence, an aspect of mental bandwidth, we ran some studies with our graduate student, Jiaying Zhao, where we presented people in a New Jersey mall with simple hypothetical scenarios, such as this one:\nImagine that your car has some trouble, which requires a $300 service. Your auto insurance will cover half the cost. You need to decide whether to go ahead and get the car fixed, or take a chance and hope that it lasts for a while longer. How would you go about making such a decision? Financially, would it be an easy or a difficult decision for you to make?\nWe then followed this question with a series of Raven’s Matrices problems, which are used to measure fluid intelligence and are common on IQ tests. Using self-reported household income we divided subjects, by median split, into rich and poor. In this set-up we found no statistically significant difference between the rich and poor mall-goers. Of course, there may been some difference but it was not big enough for us to detect in this sample. The rich and the poor looked equally smart. For other mall-goers, we ran the same study but with a slight twist. They were given this question instead:\nImagine that your car has some trouble, which requires an expensive $3,000 service. Your auto insurance will cover half the cost. You need to decide whether to go ahead and get the car fixed, or take a chance and hope that it lasts for a while longer. How would you go about making such a decision? Financially, would it be an easy or a difficult decision for you to make?\nAll we have done here is replace the $300 with $3,000. Remarkably, this change affected the two groups differently. Coming up with a half of $300 or $3,000 was easy for those who were well off. They could just pay out of savings or put it on a credit card. For the less well off, finding $150 for an important need was not too hard either. Not enough to make them think too much about scarcity and their own finances. Not so for the $3,000 car expense: finding $1,500 was going to be hard for those with low incomes. A 2011 study found that close to half of all Americans reported that they would be unable to come up with $2,000 in thirty days even if they really needed it.\nOf course the question we gave the mall respondents was hypothetical. But it was realistic, and it likely got them thinking about their own money concerns. They may not have a broken car, but experiencing money scarcity would mean they had monetary issues close to the top of mind. Once we tickled that part of the brain, the all too real non-hypothetical thinking about scarcity would come spilling out. Coming up with $1,500 would be hard. My credit cards are maxed out. Already the minimum payment due is so large. How will I make the minimum payment this month? Can I afford to miss another payment? Should I take a payday loan this time instead? A little tickle could raise a racket in the brain. And this racket affected performance. The well-off subjects, with no racket, did just as well here as if they had seen the easy scenario. The poorer subjects, on the other hand, did significantly worse. A small tickle of scarcity and all of a sudden they looked significantly less intelligent. Preoccupied by scarcity, they had lower fluid intelligence scores.\nWe have run these studies numerous times, always with the same results. To understand how big these effects are, here is a benchmark from a study on sleep. In this study, one group of subjects was put in bed at a normal time. Another group were forced to stay awake all night. Pulling an all-nighter like this is terribly debilitating. Imagine yourself after one night without any sleep. The next morning, the sleeping group was awakened, and both groups were given a Raven’s test. Not surprisingly, the sleep-deprived did much worse. In comparison, how big was our effect at the mall? It was even bigger. Picture yourself after a night of no sleep. How smart do you feel? How sharp would you be the next morning?\nOur study revealed that simply raising monetary concerns for the poor erodes cognitive performance even more than being seriously sleep deprived.\nThere is another way to understand the size of our findings. Because the Raven’s test is used to measure fluid intelligence, it has a direct analogue with IQ. Our effects correspond to between thirteen and fourteen IQ points. By most commonly used descriptive classifications of IQ, thirteen points can move you from the category of “average” to one labeled “superior” intelligence. Or, if you move in the other direction, losing thirteen points can take you from “average” to a category labeled “borderline deficient.” Remember: these differences are not between poor people and rich people. Rather, we are comparing how the same person performs under different circumstances. The same person has fewer IQ points when she is preoccupied by scarcity than when she is not. This is key to our story. The poor responded just like the rich when the car cost little to fix, when scarcity had not been rendered salient. Clearly, this is not about inherent cognitive capacity. Just like the processor that is slowed down by too many applications, the poor here appear worse because some of their bandwidth is being used elsewhere.\nThe Silver Lining\nThe poor stay poor, the lonely stay lonely, the busy stay busy, and diets fail. Scarcity creates a mindset that perpetuates scarcity. If all this seems bleak, consider the alternative viewpoint: The poor are poor because they lack skills. The lonely are lonely because they are unlikable; dieters lack will power; and the busy are busy because they lack the capacity to organize their lives. In this alternative view, scarcity is the consequence of deep personal problems, very difficult to change. The scarcity mindset, in contrast, is a contextual outcome, more open to remedies. Rather than a personal trait, it is the outcome of environmental conditions brought on by scarcity itself, conditions that can often be managed. The more we understand the dynamics of how scarcity works upon the human mind, the more likely we can find ways to avoid or at least alleviate the scarcity trap.\nAdapted from the Book SCARCITY: Why Having Too Little Means So Much.

38	What makes remembering Great Lakes different from autobiographical memories?	While people with hyperthymesia can recall their life experiences with extreme accuracy as a natural ability, remembering the Great Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, Ontario) requires different memory strategies for most people. Unlike autobiographical memories in hyperthymesia, which are automatically stored and recalled without effort, the Great Lakes order is typically memorized using mnemonic devices, particularly phrase-style mnemonics when they need to be remembered in a specific order from West to East.	['Hyperthymesia is an ability that allows people to remember nearly every event of their life with great precision.\nHyperthymesia is rare, with research identifying only a\nIn this article, we define hyperthymesia and explain the causes, characteristics, and diagnosis.\nHyperthymesia is also known as highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM). According to a\nThese details can include exact dates and intricate information about previous experiences. Current\nPeople can retain information as either short-term or long-term memories. People with HSAM likely process short-term memories in a similar way to most other people. However, a\nHSAM is different than having a good memory. For example, people with HSAM do not use mnemonic devices to remember long strings of information.\nPeople with hyperthymesia can recall details relating to past experiences with extreme accuracy.\nPeople with both conditions also tend to have certain structural differences in particular regions of the brain. However, despite these similarities, there is no definitive link between having HSAM and OCD.\nPeople with HSAM are unable to forget their life experiences. Further research is necessary to assess the long-term effects of this.\nAs there are relatively few people with hyperthymesia, there is a lack of research examining the causes. There are some theories as to what contributes to hyperthymesia, but the exact cause remains unknown.\nSome research suggests that the cause of hyperthymesia may be biological, genetic, or psychological. However, more studies are necessary to gain a better understanding of what causes hyperthymesia.\nThere is some evidence that hyperthymesia may have a biological cause.\nAnother theory is that hyperthymesia may be genetic. However, current research is ongoing as to whether the ability has a genetic basis.\nSome researchers believe that hyperthymesia may have psychological causes. This theory implies that people with HSAM\nAs hyperthymesia is a rare ability, there is currently no formal way of diagnosing it.\nSome research suggests that people with hyperthymesia have hyperactivity in certain parts of their brain. Doctors could potentially, therefore, assess whether a person has HSAM by taking an MRI scan while they undergo a memory test.\nComplex memory tests can also help confirm whether someone has hyperthymesia. These tests can include an\nA person with hyperthymesia can remember nearly every event of their life in a lot of detail. On the other hand, eidetic memory is the ability to accurately recall an image after only seeing it once for a short period.\nThose who have a superior eidetic memory can continue to visualize something they have recently seen with great precision. They may be able to hold the intact visualization in their mind for up to several minutes.\nFor most people, eidetic memories tend to fade after a few seconds. In some cases, the visualizations may change or become stored as a long-term memory.\nPeople often confuse eidetic memory with photographic memory. People who claim to have a photographic memory state that they can remember a visualization for a long time in the same detail as when they first saw it. However, scientific research debates the existence of photographic memory.\nSimilarly to people with hyperthymesia, people with a good eidetic memory do not rely on memory devices, such as mnemonics.\nThere is little research exploring hyperthymesia and eidetic memory. The reason for this may be that they are hard phenomena to test. However, it is likely that people with hyperthymesia do not have a superior eidetic memory.\nMore research is necessary into both eidetic memory and hyperthymesia to understand their similarities and differences.\nHyperthymesia is the rare ability to recall nearly all past experiences in great detail.\nThe causes of HSAM are currently unknown, but some theories suggest that it may have biological, genetic, or psychological origins.\nThere is currently no way to diagnose hyperthymesia formally. Possible ways to assess this may be through MRI scans and complex memory tests.\nHyperthymesia differs from eidetic memory in that it focuses on a person’s ability to recall their autobiographical experiences rather than to hold visualizations in their mind.\nFurther research is necessary to examine the differences and similarities between hyperthymesia and eidetic memory.', 'Creating mnemonic devices for simple lists of information that you need to memorize can be a pretty easy task, but what happens if you have to memorize a list of information that may be quite a bit longer, lacking in words starting with vowels and must stay in order for that information to retain its usefulness. Often times, a basic word forming mnemonic device simply will not work for such information – requiring you to use another form of mnemonics which will allow you to create a phrase instead.\nNow, depending on how your mind works, coming up with a phrase may be a bit more difficult than coming up with a word as your mnemonic device. Personally, I find it far easier to make a phrase, sentence or poem as a mnemonic device than I do to make a word. After all, words have to follow specific rules. They have to have consonants, vowels and actually make a bit of sense.\nOn the other hand, if you create your own phrase style mnemonic device, the skies are the limit and you have full creative freedom to make whatever mnemonic device you see fit – no matter how off the wall it may sound to someone else.\nWhen would you need to come up with a phrase style mnemonic device? Well, as mentioned earlier, a phrase style mnemonic device can be used whenever a word forming style mnemonic device is used but they especially come in handy during three special circumstances: when the information you need to memorize has to be in order for it to be useful, when you have an exceptionally long list of information that would be impractical to quickly turn into a word, and when the information that you need to memorize consists of many of the same letters – making it impossible to form a coherent word with the necessary data.\nLet us begin our quest for the perfect phrase forming style mnemonic device by going back to our example with the Great Lakes. You already know that you can use the names of the Great Lakes to create a word forming style mnemonic device – HOMES, but what if you have to remember the Great Lakes in a specific order. For example, let us assume that you are taking a geography class and your teacher tells you that on the test you will have to memorize the Great Lakes in order from West to East.\nNow, in this case, your previously created mnemonic device of HOMES will not be useful at all because the lakes are not in order from West to East under that acronym. Instead, you should create a phrase style mnemonic device that will allow you to remember the names of the Great Lakes from West to East. So you do not have to look them up, here is the order in which they should go:\nSuperior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, Ontario\nChances are that you probably did not have a very difficult time coming up with your own phrase to remember this information. Unlike word forming mnemonic devices, when it comes to making a phrase, there is not usually a generally accepted phrase that every person uses to remember the information given.\nThat is the beauty of the phrase style mnemonic device – it can be anything that you want it to be. For the Great Lakes in order from West to East, I could come up with She Made Him Eat Olives or even something like Sally Massages Harry’s Ears Often. The possibilities are truly endless when you consider all of the different ways to convert the Great Lakes in this order into a phrase forming style mnemonic device.\nMoving right along, the second time you should consider using a phrase forming mnemonic device is when you have a list of information with letters that, no matter how hard you try, you cannot turn into a word style mnemonic to memorize. Now, that very statement contradicts what a good mnemonic should be – you should always try to keep your mnemonic devices simple and easy.\nIf you are thinking about them too much then they are not a good mnemonic.\nThe planets of our solar system present us with a perfect place to practice the phrase forming style of mnemonic devices. Now that Pluto is no longer recognized as a planet, there are only eight planets to remember, but that does not mean that you cannot use a phrase style mnemonic device to do so. Let’s try out with an example. In case you do not remember what the planets are, here is a list to help you get started:\nMercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune\nThis bit of information would be impossible to memorize without the help of a phrase forming style mnemonic device. After all, what kind of word could you hope to create with the first letters from the words of the planets in our solar system? It certainly would not be anything recognizable or easily memorized.\nIn fact, you could probably directly memorize the planets in the solar system before you could even hope to memorize a word that you would have created with their first letters. As with the names of the Great Lakes, whatever you choose to create is totally up to you, but to keep you on the right track, one of the most popular mnemonic devices for the planets of our solar system is: My Very Efficient Monkey Just Sorted Unused Napkins.\nFinally, we have the third reason that you would want to create a phrase forming style mnemonic device instead of a word style mnemonic device – you have a list of information that you need to memorize that is just too long to create a word quickly and easily.\nOur example this time comes from the metric system of measurement, which we may all have to memorize should the United States ever convert our system of measurement away from archaic inches and pounds into the more practical system of measuring meters and grams.\nThoughts on the metric system aside, imagine you have to memorize all of the prefixes that are used to represent amounts that are more than one and less than one. The prefixes are listed below for your ease of viewing:\nExa, Peta, Tera, Giga, Mega, Kilo, Hecto, Deca\nDeci, Centi, Milli, Micro, Nano, Pico, Femto, Atto\nNow, as you can see, these lists are far too long to make any useful word style mnemonic devices out of. You could spend hours looking at them and probably never come up with a word that could easily suit them. So, realizing this, you should instead turn to the phrase forming style mnemonic device which will allow you to use the first letter from each word to create your own clever quip that will help you remember the prefixes for the metric system.\nAs with all other phrase style mnemonic devices, there is no right or wrong answer here, but just in case you are stuck – here are some of the more commonly used mnemonic device phrases to help you out. For the amounts greater than one, a commonly used mnemonic phrase is: Every Person That Gave Me Kisses Has Diarrhea. And for the prefixes that are used for amounts which are less than one, a common phrase is: Dairy Cows Make Milk, Not Pink Fruit, Andrew.\nJust to make sure that you are on the right track when it comes to your phrase forming mnemonic devices, how about a little test here to see if you know what you are doing. Let us go to the field of geology for this example.\nSay that after watching the latest Indiana Jones movie, you decide that you want to take some classes in archaeology and geology, so you enroll at your local college and find that you have to memorize all kinds of information.\nOne such topic that you will probably come across is the scale of mineral hardness which includes a relatively long list of different types of rocks.\nTalc, Gypsum, Calcite, Fluorite, Apatite, Orthoclase, Quartz, Topaz, Corundum, Diamond\nAt first glance, this list looks impossible to memorize.

39	As a SWAT officer, what protection level should I look for in body armor?	The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) establishes protection levels, with level II and III-A being common for protection against handgun rounds and some 00 buck loads. You should first ensure the vest protects against your duty carry ammo, then consider the threats likely in your locale. Higher numbers indicate higher ballistic protection, but remember that more protection means a heavier and thicker vest.	"['3 considerations for buying body armor\nOnce you\'ve decided with level of ballistic protection best meets your working environment, consider comfort, camouflage and cost\nBy Andrew Butts, C1 Contributor\nBody armor vests, often incorrectly called ""bullet proof"" vests, are a necessity for today\'s law enforcer. Offering protection against firearm attacks, body armor can also protect the wearer from slash and knife assaults and even blunt force trauma caused by impacts with steering wheels during automobile accidents.\nThe levels of ballistic protection offered are established by the National Institute of Justice, or NIJ for short. The NIJ is somewhat akin to Underwriter Laboratories and sets standards and monitors quality for many items related to law enforcement.\nNIJ ballistic protection standards are broken down into levels with level II and III-A being commonly used to categorize protection levels offered against many of the more common handgun rounds and some loads of 00 buck. Basically, the higher the number, the higher the level of ballistic protection.\nSo how should officers choose the vest that best meets their professional needs? The first consideration should be the minimal ballistic protection available, which protects against the wearer\'s duty carry ammo. Having a vest that will offer protection against the ammo in your service weapon is critical and should not be overlooked. After this selection is made, the next level that should be considered is that which is likely to be encountered in your locale. An officer working in an inner city environment will likely have differing ballistic protection needs than a game warden in a rural setting. Be realistic with your most likely encountered threat and purchase accordingly.\nOnce you\'ve decided with level of ballistic protection best meets your working environment, consider comfort, camouflage and cost.\nComfort ties in directly with ballistic protection. The more protection offered, the heavier and thicker the vest. A Level III-A vest might offer an extremely high level of protection but such a vest is worthless if it’s so heavy and uncomfortable it gets left hanging in the station locker room. Talk to your local uniform supply store and ask some coworkers what they\'re wearing and how uncomfortable the vest is after a long day on patrol.\nIn addition, a vest should be measured to fit your body type and weight and when properly measured, will also affect comfort. Comfort not only includes the bulk and weight of the vest but the comfort in inclement weather. I\'ve found a vest to offer little warmth and insulation in cold weather but one can certainly make for an uncomfortable work day when temps climb into the 90\'s!\nIn such weather, you\'ll have to make the conscious decision to either wear the vest, be hot and try to acclimate or not wear it at all and take the chance. I personally don\'t want to take the chance.\nCamouflage is the vest\'s ability to blend in with uniform wear. A vest worn under a uniform shirt is the best choice for camouflage as long as the cover shirt is tailored correctly. A current trend is to wear the vest in some type of exterior carrier that makes the vest easy to don and doff. If you go this route, make sure the vest cover closely matches the color of your uniform. Don\'t advertise the fact that you\'re wearing body armor just in case a potential attacker gets the idea that a head or pelvic shot might be his first course of action! Ideally, I would recommend wearing the vest underneath the shirt as much as possible, unless working in an area of high heat, when being able to remove the vest is paramount for comfort.\nCost is last on my list because, in a perfect world, an officer would be provided with a vest by the department or would receive an allotment to spend on such a purchase. But that\'s not always the case. If your agency doesn\'t offer some type of vest purchase program, ballistic protection can still be found for a fairly reasonable price. Just remember the NIJ standards outlined above and make sure a private purchase offers protection from your duty ammo.\nLastly, keep in mind that ballistic vests have only a five year service life. Chances are the vest will still perform long after the five year lifespan but there\'s no point in spending money on something that\'s going to expire in five years if you aren\'t going to use it! Buy wisely. Wear it daily!\nFor more information on body armor or ballistic protection, visit the National Institute of Justice website.']"	['<urn:uuid:1da1c064-1dba-4e08-b323-ebc43202e05a>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	14	63	761
40	How did male-female friendships change from early to late medieval times?	The early and High Middle Ages were actually a golden age for relations between the sexes, with extensive evidence of robust friendships between men and women, including exchanges of poetry and letters between monastic communities and nunneries. However, this changed around the early 15th century, when figures like Jean Gerson began warning that friendship with women risked 'diabolical deception', marking a shift toward increasing misogyny.	"['Aside from that judgment, I am not ready to weigh further on the book\'s quality; but he does make one claim that is quite wrong. He is asking for a reconciliation of sorts between the old ""paternalistic, Christian heritage"" and the new world. Along the way he defends the old faith with a historical reference: ""[A]s Rene Girard says it is not because we invented science that we stopped burning witches, but rather when, because of the Judeo-Christianity, we stopped burning witches that we invented science."" (p. 39-40)\nThis is wrong as a point of history. We invented science when we started burning witches.\nThe usual dates for the witch-burning craze are 1480-1750, around the time of the Reformation and the Thirty Years War. It was about the time that there was this deep questioning of tradition -- that would lead to the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and modern science -- that there also coincidentally spread a new cultural distrust of the feminine.\nI was just reading a collection of essays called Friendship in Medieval Europe that shows how much things changed. Several of these essays note that -- contrary to what many people might expect if they were raised with the modern critique of Western history as ""paternalistic"" -- the early and High Middle Ages were a golden age for relations between the sexes. Of the Anglo-Saxon period, we learn:\n""What we can conclude on a formal level, however, is that \'friendship\' is not significantly limited, either in a hierarchical manner -- Boniface and Alcuin are friends with bishops as well as priests, abbots as well as monks -- or with regard to gender -- they are friends both with men and women. Every person (ominis homo -- and not: \'every male\') needs a friend, as the Anglo-Saxon abbess Eangyth writes to St. Boniface; and she chooses him to be hers. Alcuin counts several women among his friends."" (125)It turns out that there are vast examples of robust friendships between men and women throughout the early and High middle ages, and into the late middle ages, including whole collections of letters now being studied by scholars across Europe. There is particular importance placed on the exchange of poetry between men and women as tokens of friendship; in the last few years, we\'ve gained awareness of a huge amount of female-written Medieval poetry that is normally captured in letters between friends, including between monastic communities and nunneries. St. Thomas Aquinas wrote on the virtue of friendship, drawing on Aristotle\'s dictum that we can say to our friend, ""You are the other half of my soul,"" (in Aristotle this is more usually translated \'the friend is our other self\'); and the priest Richard Rolle, who died in 1349, wrote that in spite of the dangers of physical attraction between men and women, ""that sort of friendship is not improper, but rewarding, if it is practiced with a good intention.""\nHowever, in 1401 the chancellor of the University of Paris, Jean Gerson, wrote a sermon in which he charged that friendship with women put you at risk of ""diabolical deception"" and \'great evil unless God in his goodness averts it.\' Gerson nevertheless knew some women, including Christine de Pisan, whom he engaged with intellectually (and agreed with) in the famous debate of the morality of Roman de la Rose. Christine de Pisan, in the early 1400s, was challenging this new, rising misogyny and objected to the vulgar language that the book put into the mouths of noble women. But when Gerson wrote his own book about it, he ignored her contributions and did not mention her at all. Gerson lived at the same time as Bernardino of Siena, whose traveling sermons popularized the idea of witches.\nAs for witch-burning in the early and High Middle Ages, it was actually banned by the Church under penalty of death. The same decree, in 785, banned belief in witches in order to suppress violence against women. That held until the 1400s, when popular pressure in Switzerland and Germany began to force the Church to rethink its stance. As late as the 1390s, though, women confessed to practicing \'white magic\' to Inquisitors, but the Inquisitors had nothing in their guidelines about women using magic and had to write for advice.\nIt looks like the early 15th century is the turning point in which the Church (following popular movements from German-speaking central Europe) began to take the dark view of female sexuality that we have come to associate with witch-burnings.\nThe easy friendships between men and women that we observe in Chaucer, who lets the Wife of Bath have a merry wit and deliver a good long sermon on the virtues of women, did not quite die with him in 1400. Sir Thomas Malory, born in 1405, stands at the end of this golden age. He was in the English speaking world, which did not receive the witch-burning craze until after his death (England did not pass a law on witchcraft until 1542). Though it is commonplace to blame Malory for making Guinevere\'s sexuality the cause of the fall of Camelot, it is clear that Malory does not view Guinevere as a bad or wicked woman. In fact, one of the few times that Malory directly addresses his audience is to make the point that ""she was a true lover and therefore she had a good end."" Her love with Lancelot, though it had tragic practical consequences, is what redeems her for Malory, not what damns her.\nEven the wicked sorceress Morgan le Fay is not a witch, but a student of necromancy -- see the article on the meaning of this in the Early and High Middle Ages, which is different from the word\'s meaning today. Of course, Morgan was a necromancer for Malory, but earlier she had been something else, not a witch but a fairy. In this guise she is the heroine of Marie de France\'s Lanval, saving the knight from an unfair judgment.\nThere is a doctrine that the Middle Ages were a dark and miserable time, and that the story of the Reformation, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment is a story of ever-marching progress toward a more rational society. In truth, the story is more complicated. The same breaking of the old order that allowed for a new scientific world view also let loose a great deal darker. It was not when we became scientific that we stopped burning witches. Rather, that was just when we began.\nHistory Ireland has a counterexample, the earliest witch-burning case I\'ve heard of from 1324. It\'s worth reading their account in full. The only one who was burned was a minor figure, a servant of the family chiefly charged with heresy; and the secular law worked hard to defy the Church in the face of a very enthusiastic (and foreign) bishop. Of the principal defendants, the woman escaped by flight (she was extraordinarily wealthy), and her husband got off with a penance. The Church forced him to go on pilgrimage and to re-do a part of the local cathedral with lead. It turned out the lead was too heavy for the cathedral roof, which collapsed as a consequence of his fulfilling the penance the bishop had imposed. Divine judgment, possibly.\nIt\'s interesting to see how this early case played out, compared with the enthusiasm that would appear in later centuries.']"	['<urn:uuid:c34fbf46-3799-4251-b47e-7a019b9b5f9d>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	11	65	1232
41	combat preparedness mental wellness navy aircraft carriers	The U.S. Navy's combat preparedness faces challenges with their aircraft carriers becoming vulnerable to China's DF-21D anti-ship missiles, which creates significant strategic limitations as carriers must stay beyond the 1,200-mile range of these weapons. This military vulnerability can lead to mental health impacts including lack of motivation, difficulty concentrating, and anger or frustration among naval personnel. These mental health symptoms can affect combat readiness and require proper stress management through various techniques like deep breathing exercises, physical activity, and seeking support through counseling or therapy. If left unaddressed, these stress symptoms can develop into more serious long-term health consequences.	"['After nearly two decades of counter-terror operations around the world, the United States military has recently begun shifting its focus away from this form of asymmetric warfare and back toward the potential for near-peer conflicts with nations like China or Russia.\nDespite maintaining the most powerful military apparatus on the globe, this pivot won’t be without its challenges. Over the past 19 years, the United States military has funneled the majority of its funding into combat operations and new technologies that support the counter-terrorism endeavor. During this time, national opponents like China have had ample opportunity to observe the way America’s military operates, and find cost-effective methods of countering the U.S.’ most significant strengths.\nIn 2015, for instance, both China and Russia established space-specific branches of their armed forces tasked with replicating some of America’s orbital strengths (like a GPS satellite constellation), but also with finding ways to mitigate America’s established orbital dominance. Put simply, it’s cheaper and easier to interfere with or destroy technology than it is to replicate it, and America’s enemies have leveraged that simple logic to great effect in recent years. Today, it’s believed that both Russia and China operate semi-autonomous orbital assets that can already spy on or potentially even destroy satellites that are currently in orbit.\nBut while America has maintained the lead in orbital technology, it has apparently fallen behind in some weapons technologies that saw reduced focus throughout these many years of fighting terror organizations–namely, weapons technologies intended for use against technologically capable opponents. Hypersonics, as one pressing example, are a rapidly developing field of extremely fast (higher than Mach 5) weapons that, to date, no air defense system can counter. While both China and Russia claim to have operational hypersonic weapons in their arsenals, there’s one weapon that has wreaked more havoc in American military strategy than any other: China’s hypersonic DF-21D anti-ship missile.\nWhy is the DF-21D such a threat?\nThe DF-21D is a hypersonic anti-ship missile employed by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The platform itself is a medium-range, road mobile ballistic missile. In fact, it’s the fastest anti-ship ballistic missile in service to any nation today. Once launched, the DF-21D follows a similar arc to that of an intercontinental ballistic missile, flying high into low earth orbit before deploying a hypersonic glide vehicle that can reach speeds as high as Mach 10 during its guided descent phase. Existing missile defense systems simply can’t intercept a target moving that fast, making it all but impossible to stop one of these missiles once it’s been fired.\nWhile the DF-21D’s speed makes it a clear threat to U.S. Navy ships, it’s the missile’s range that poses the biggest problem. The DF-21D has an operational range of about 2,000 kilometers, or a bit more than 1,200 miles. By placing these platforms along the Chinese coastline, the PLA has been able to establish an area-denial strategy, sometimes referred to as an area-denial “bubble,” or a 1,200 mile circle around each missile that enemy ships can’t enter without being within range of the weapon system.\nIt’s important to note that, while these missiles can carry both conventional and nuclear payloads, the sheer kinetic force of a Mach 10 impact would be enough on its own to sink many ships, and when coupled with an explosive warhead, could conceivably take even a massive Nimitz-class super carrier out of the fight with a single shot.\nThe strategic implications of China’s “Area-Denial Bubble”\nChina’s area-denial bubble that extends some 1,200 miles from their shoreline poses a significant challenge for America’s conventional wartime strategy of using aircraft carriers as a means of force projection. The U.S. Navy maintains a fleet of 11 super carriers, each capable of delivering more firepower than many entire nations could manage. One Nimitz-class carrier is capable of accommodating as many as 130 F/A-18 Super Hornets, or as many as 90 aircrafts of varying types, along with a massive 6,000 service personnel. The U.S. uses these carriers to deliver huge amounts of firepower to any region of the globe, using carrier-based aircraft to deliver ordnance to targets extending out hundreds of miles.\nIt’s that “hundreds of miles” part that is the real issue here. The U.S. Navy’s workhorse fighters are F/A-18 Super Hornets, which are currently undergoing a massive overhaul that will offer a similar increase in capabilities to the previous shift from Block I Hornets to Block II Super Hornets in 2001. However, even with these Block III Super (Duper) Hornets, the ranges these jets are capable of engaging targets at are still far too short to compensate for China’s area denial bubble.\nBlock III Super Hornets and F-35Cs still come up short\nThe Navy’s current Block II Super Hornets have a combat radius of approximately 500 miles while carrying a full weapons payload. That means these jets can take off from a carrier, fly 500 miles to engage a target, turn tail, and fly 500 miles back to their ship. The forthcoming Block III variant of these fighters will add conformal fuel tanks (additional fuel tanks that hug the fuselage of the aircraft) which will allow them to carry 3,500 pounds of additional fuel, which will increase their fuel range by approximately 300 miles, or combat radius by 150. That means the top-end fourth generation fighters employed by the U.S. Navy in the near future will need to be launched within 650 miles of a target to be able to engage it.\nThe Lockheed Martin F-35C (carrier variant) offers about 10% more fuel range than the Block II Super Hornet, making its combat radius approximately 660 miles. Again, that mark falls far short of China’s DF-21D anti-ship missile at better than 1,200 miles.\nThis means that, in a best case scenario, the U.S. Navy would have to park its carriers about 650 miles off of Chinese shores to be able to target shoreline assets, which places it well within China’s area denial bubble. The minute an American carrier comes closer than 1,200 miles from Chinese shores, we run the risk of losing it to an DF-21D strike. Put succinctly, this single missile platform has effectively neutered America’s most potent form of force projection.\nIncreasing the fuel range of carrier-based aircraft\nThe U.S. Navy is currently developing a carrier-based drone refueler called the MQ-25 Stingray. Originally developed to serve as a low-observable Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (or armed drone), Boeing was able to convert their platform into a carrier-based refueler when the Navy began to recognize the importance of pulling more mileage out of existing fighters.\nOn August 30, 2018, the U.S. Navy awarded Boeing an $805 million contract to continue development on the platform, and the drone took its first test flight just over a year later in September of 2019. The Navy intends to purchase a total of 76 Stingrays from Boeing, and according to the Pentagon, they may be able extend the range of carrier-based aircraft by as much as 400 miles. If you half that figure to assess its benefit to combat radius, the MQ-25 will allow the Block III Super Hornet to be able to reach out to 850 miles on a combat sortie, and the F-35C to approximately 860 miles. This increase in range is substantial–but isn’t substantial enough to allow carriers to launch sorties from outside China’s area denial bubble.\nWhile there are current concerns about the MQ-25 program being delayed by external issues within the Navy, a spokesperson from Naval Air Systems Command recently confirmed that they expect to reach initial operating capability for the MQ-25 sometime in 2024.\nFinding alternatives to carriers\nThere are a number of initiatives in development aimed at offsetting the strategic advantage China maintains in the region through their area-denial strategy, but thus far, no single effort that has been discussed publicly will do it on its own.\nThe U.S. Marine Corps has had a great deal of success launching F-35Bs (short take off, vertical landing variant) off the deck of smaller “flat top carriers” the U.S. refers to (for legal reasons) as amphibious assault ships. These vessels would likely be called aircraft carriers by other nations, but are significantly smaller than the Navy’s Nimitz or Ford class super carriers — making them a more difficult target to locate and engage.\nIt’s important to recognize the significant challenge accurate targeting will be for China’s DF-21D. Aircraft carriers may be massive, but against the backdrop of the Pacific Ocean, they’re practically tiny and can move at around 35 knots (40 miles per hour) with the throttle open. In order to hit one on the move, China intends to employ supersonic drones to locate and transmit targeting data back to the missile. A smaller target (in the form of an amphibious assault ship) does make effective targeting even more difficult.\nOther efforts include creating austere airstrips for F-35Bs on land masses inside China’s area denial bubble. These hastily cleared airports would allow heavy lift helicopters to deliver fuel and ordnance for F-35Bs to land, resupply, and take off once again. However, these hasty airstrips, like a stationary aircraft carrier, would have a short shelf-life inside the range of China’s ballistic missile arsenal.\nSupport from the Air Force and the Army\nWhile the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have both been working tirelessly to find ways to extend the reach of America’s carrier strike groups, it may be the Air Force that would need to lead the way in a conflict with China. Northrop Grumman’s forthcoming B-21 Raider is expected to be the stealthiest bomber ever to take to the skies and will offer global strike capabilities similar to that of its predecessor, the B-2 Spirit.\nThe B-21, then, may come to the Navy’s rescue by flying long-distance bombing missions over Chinese shorelines, engaging DF-21D and other hypersonic anti-ship platforms to clear the way for America’s carriers to sail close enough to begin launching sorties of their own. However, because the DF-21D is road mobile, it’s likely that it will be difficult to be sure where these platforms are. That’s where the Army may be able to help.\nArmy Secretary Ryan McCarthy recently let the cat out of the bag about a new program under his purview called “Vintage Racer,” which is a previously undisclosed hypersonic weapon that, unlike the hypersonic missiles employed by China and Russia, aims to solve problems through data collection and lots of brainpower, rather than brute force alone.\nVintage Racer closes with targets at hypersonic speeds, making it just as difficult to defend against as China’s own hypersonic missiles, but once it reaches a target area, the platform deploys a loitering system that uses its own sensors to find hidden or moving targets in the area. Once that system spots a mobile missile platform, it can then engage and destroy it.\nDoes this even matter if we don’t go to war with China?\nWhile the capabilities the U.S. is developing with an eye toward China will certainly benefit combat operations in any theater, there’s another important aspect of defense technology development that warrants consideration: diplomatic leverage.\nLike Theodore Roosevelt’s “talk softly and carry a big stick” approach to diplomacy, military capability is often as much about the threat of use as it is about actual use. When engaged in diplomatic talks, the understanding that warfare is foreign policy by other means is ever-present. When it comes to aggressive states like China, who are moving to enforce illegal claims over the hotly contested South China Sea, knowing we can’t stop them plays an important role in how they approach the subject in international dialogue.\nLikewise, if China is aware that the U.S. possesses the capability to do away with their anti-ship arsenal and began launching combat sorties in their airspace, it forces them to engage with the dialogue directly. A great deal of foreign policy really comes down to posturing and veiled threats, but threats are only effective when they’re backed by real capability.\nFrom a strategic military standpoint, the most effective way to deter a 21st century war with China is to ensure America would win such a conflict. In order to get to that point, the capability gap created by China’s area denial bubble needs to be closed, and right now — that all boils down to fuel range.', ""How Does Stress Affect The Body: Symptoms And Solutions\nUpdated August 27, 2020\nMedically Reviewed By: Lori Jones, LMHC\nAre you exhausted all the time? Do you have a lot of muscle tension and pain? Is your head or stomach bothering you? It could be stress. There is a long list of symptoms that falls under the question, “How does stress affect the body?” And, learning how to identify the symptoms can help you find the right solution.\nStress levels have been on the rise in Americans over recent years. It’s impacting people of all ages and spans a wide range of worries and concerns.\nThe Impact Of Chronic Stress\nEveryday stress can have a negative impact on multiple areas of your life. However, when the stressful situation passes, you may find that things return to normal even if you didn’t do anything to address your stress. This isn’t the healthiest way to get through stress, but it happens this way for some people.\nHowever, if you’re experiencing chronic stress, it’s not going to just go away. It may not be tied to a specific situation in your life. Instead, it might be the result of poor habits or not knowing how to deal with past trauma. It will not just go away if left untreated.\nThe Effect Of Stress On The Body\nStress can wreak havoc on your body if it’s left unchecked. Not only does occasional stress show up in your body, but chronic stress can also have long-term negative consequences for your physical health. When you are feeling stressed, you may experience:\n- Increased heart rate\n- Rising blood pressure\n- Muscle tension\n- Upset stomach\n- Lack of sexual desire\n- Change in appetite\nAnd these are just a few of the symptoms that you may experience. If you suffer from chronic stress, the symptoms above can start to turn into more serious health consequences.\nChronic stress can lead to health problems such as heart disease, high blood pressure, gastrointestinal problems, heart attack, and strokes, among others. These are clear indicators that allowing chronic stress to continue in your life can be detrimental to your physical health and well-being.\nHow Stress Affects Mental Health\nStress also impacts your mental health and wellness. It can lead to you experiencing many different negatives and difficult emotions such as sadness, anger, frustration, and fear.\nSome of the mental health symptoms that you may notice in your life from stress include:\n- Lack of motivation\n- Irritability and anger\n- Lack of concentration and focus\nThese are serious symptoms that should not be taken lightly. If you experience chronic stress, you may begin to think that these symptoms are just a normal part of life. But, they’re not. All of these symptoms can grow into more serious problems if you don’t work on addressing them.\nHow Stress Affects Behavior\nStress can also impact your behavior. If you look at the symptoms listed above under physical and mental health, it can be easier to understand how stress changes your behavior. If you’re living under constant overwhelm and anxiety and experiencing things like frequent headaches or stomach aches, it can be easy to lose your temper with your loved ones, for example. Here are some of the other behavioral changes that you may experience in your life as a result of stress:\n- Angry outbursts\n- Eating too much or not enough\n- Substance use or abuse\n- Social withdrawal\nThese behaviors can have a negative spiral effect on your life. For example, as your withdrawal from friends and family because of stress, you may find that you struggle even more to cope with stress in your life. This can lead to additional problems which keep you away from a social activity even more. This is why it’s important to learn to recognize and healthily address your stress.\nStress Management Tips To Overcome Chronic Stress\nThankfully there are many things that you can do to address your chronic stress and learn to overcome it. This doesn’t mean that you’ll never experience stress again. Instead, it means that when you do go through stressful situations, you’ll have tips and strategies that you can use to relieve stress and handle it healthily.\nSome of the stress management solutions you may benefit from include:\nLearn to identify your stress triggers\nWhen you start to feel stressed, it can be helpful to take time to identify where the feelings are coming from. This allows you to begin investigating what you can do to make to address it.\nWhile there will be some things causing you to stress that you can’t do anything about, there will be some things that you can address. For example, if a family member’s behavior is causing you to feel stressed, you probably aren’t going to be able to control how they are behaving. But you may be able to establish boundaries in your life that stop the other person’s behavior from having as large of a negative consequence on you.\nThere will be some things that you find are short term stressors. But there also might be habits that you identify that are causing you unnecessary stress. When you learn where the stress is coming from, you can start to take your first steps to address or removing it.\nPractice Deep Breathing\nWhen you’re starting to feel the stress and tension build up within your body, deep breathing can help to break up some of the physical symptoms that you’re experiencing. For example, you may notice that you start to breathe faster as your frustration grows. This can cause your heart to race, as well. And, as your heart beats faster, your blood pressure rises. These physical symptoms can continue to build and even lead to things like full-blown panic attacks.\nDeep breathing can help to stop your physical symptoms from progressing. As you start taking slow, deep breaths in and out, you may notice that it feels like your blood pressure is lowering, and your heart rate is returning to normal.\nYou may also find that deep breathing can help you to slow your thoughts. Your mind will be forced to temporarily shift from your stress and worry to the breathing technique that you’re using. This can help you to regain mental clarity and look for solutions to the stressful situation or problem that you’re facing.\nThere are multiple types of breathing techniques that you can use, so practice a few of them to find what works best for you. It can also help to practice them when you’re not under stress, so when you find your stress starting to build, you will know how to put the breathing exercise to use without too much thought.\nNot getting enough sleep can make it even harder to deal with stress. You may find that you struggle to be patient with others, and you cannot think clearly to look for solutions. If you’re having problems falling asleep or staying asleep due to stress, it’s an important symptom to address.\nMany different things may help improve sleep troubles. A few that you could try include:\n- Keeping a strict sleep schedule\n- Cutting out caffeine\n- Not exercising too close to bedtime.\n- Sleeping in a dark, cool room\n- Using white noise\nHowever, if you’re continuing to struggle, don’t be afraid to talk with your doctor to explore additional options.\nGet More Physical Activity\nPhysical activity and exercise can help you release tension that has built up from chronic stress. It also releases chemicals in your brain that work to boost your mood. But these chemicals also act as natural pain killers, which can help reduce some of the physical symptoms you’re experiencing.\nThere are other ways that physical activity and exercise can help with stress. You may find that you sleep better when you exercise. And, you may experience a boost in your self-esteem as well.\nThe Anxiety and Depression Association of America shares that you may start to experience these positive mental boosts after just five minutes of physical activity. So, if you’re feeling stressed, you don’t need to feel like you have to get in a full workout. Simply getting moving for a few minutes can start to help.\nTalk To Someone\nHaving a trusted person to turn to for support can help when you’re going through stressful situations or experiencing chronic stress. This could be a friend or family member. It could also be a support group. For example, if you’re under stress as a result of losing a loved one, you may benefit from connecting in a group for others experiencing grief from losing someone.\nIf you don’t have anyone to turn to or could use additional support in handling your stress, a licensed therapist is an effective option to consider. Not only can they listen as you talk through the stress in your life, but they also have education on how to help you overcome it. A therapist, like those at BetterHelp, can assist you in finding stress-relieving strategies that work for your specific situation.\nPrevious ArticleHow Stress Can Lead To Emotional Breakdowns And What You Can Do To Avoid It\nNext ArticleAre You Under Too Much Stress?

42	brain image processing lag real time delay	It takes around 100 milliseconds for our brains to process visual information after light hits our retinas. During this processing delay, a person walking slowly can move about 10 centimeters, which is why our brains have developed compensation mechanisms and make predictions about what we are perceiving and what we will perceive shortly.	['Expand the image above to fill your screen and stare at the black blob in the centre. (You can also find the original version here.) Most people perceive the blob as expanding or feel that they’re falling toward the hole. This new-to-science illusion has given researchers some more insight into how human vision works, and it shows how our perception of the world is shaped by predictions our brain makes.\nUnlike other black hole illusions that have resulted in someone literally falling into a big hole, this black blob — created by Akiyoshi Kitaoka as part of research published earlier this week — is set against a pattern of smaller black dots on a white background and is a completely static image. It creates a false sense of movement that also causes the observer’s pupils to expand, according to the study. The physical reaction happens no matter where the observer is, even if they’re looking at the illusion in a well-lit room where pupil adjustments aren’t needed. There’s seemingly no reason for the physical response to occur, but the researchers believe this illusion demonstrates how our brains compensate for the processing time needed to visually perceive the world around us in real-time, and that certain involuntarily reflexes aren’t necessarily controlled by someone’s physical reality.\nIt’s a type of optical illusion that has come to be known as “perceiving-the-present,” which was first named back in 2008. As fast as we think our brains are at processing what we perceive, it can actually take around 100 milliseconds to make sense of the data generated when light hits our retinas. Someone walking slowly can cover as much as 10 centimeters during that time, which is not insignificant, and demonstrates why our brains have needed to develop these compensation mechanisms and frequently make predictions as to what we’re perceiving and what we will be perceiving momentarily.\nAnother image that demonstrates this phenomenon is Akiyoshi Kitaoka’s “Asahi” illusion of brightness. Our brains perceive the white at the middle of the illusion as being much brighter than the white surrounding it, when in reality they both have the exact same RGB values, and the brightness of the image is completely uniform. Researchers have also found that a subject’s pupils will contract when observing this illusion, even when the lighting in the environment they’re physically in doesn’t change.\nIt’s believed that this illusion causes a physical pupil reaction because the brain is attempting to protect the retina from the sudden glare of a bright light, which can not only temporarily inhibit our ability to see but also potentially damage the retina. The centre of the Asahi illusion is no brighter than its other white areas, but the arrangement of shapes and the dark-to-light gradients create a perceptual correlation to walking through a forest dense with trees and occasionally catching glimpses of the bright sun through the leaves. Even though the observer isn’t actually at risk of looking at the sun, this is what the brain is predicting will happen, and the pupils react accordingly.\nIn the case of the back hole illusion, researchers found that observers’ pupils expanded when looking at the image, as their brains likely perceived them to be physically moving toward a space that was considerably darker than their current environment. The brain was preemptively compensating by making the eyes ready to gather more light. The illusion of forward movement is thanks in part to the black blob’s softened edges, which create the appearance of motion blur; that’s why observers see the black blob as growing, the same thing one would see when walking towards a dark cave, for example.\nIt’s slightly disconcerting that, at any given time, what we think we’re really seeing could be just an educated guess that our brain is making about what we might be seeing 100 milliseconds from now — and that those educated guesses can trigger involuntarily physical responses. What’s also intriguing is that roughly 86% of the people the team studied had the physical pupil response, and they’re not exactly sure why 14% did not. What makes those people different, and does that put them at a disadvantage when it comes to navigating the world?']	['<urn:uuid:2295c093-f63b-4213-a878-62783e0b5c32>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	7	53	699

Since 1982 it has a Hepatitis B vaccine, with a level of effectiveness in preventing 95% disease.\nHepatitis B can be acute or chronic. In the first case the hepatitis B lasts for about 6 months; in the second case, however, hepatitis lasts six months, because the immune system is unable to fight the virus, the infection can become chronic.\nIn general, even though symptoms may vary from one person to another, the viral infection of the liver causes fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, and emotional level, apathy and unwillingness to daily obligations. Other symptoms that may occur are nausea, abdominal pain, headaches and change of skin tone (becoming more yellow).\nThe disease does not always manifest itself clearly, the symptoms can be confused with other pathologies in the early stages, especially in winter, when the probability, for example, of getting the flu is frequent, a disorder that also usually accompanied by bones pain, fatigue or fever. Other signs that might warn us of a liver problem is increasing the amount of urine, with a more intense color.\nTransmission and spread\nHow hepatitis B transmitted? HBV virus can be transmitted through blood, urine, sperm or other bodily fluids. Another possibility of infection is the sharing of syringes, because the hepatitis B virus is easily transmitted through needles contaminated with infected blood. Even accidental punctures with dirty needles can be a concern for health workers.\nThe pregnant women can transmit the virus to their babies during childbirth. Infection is also possible in the breast-feeding.\nThere is something to keep in mind is that around 10% of patients who are infected with the virus do not develop the disease, although they become carriers and potential source of infection to other people.\nIt is important to diagnose the disease as early as possible to slow down its evolution and liver damage. To diagnose the disease used some blood tests. In particular, tests were conducted to determine if we can transmit HBV to detect the presence of antibodies against the virus, to see if there was an infection in the past or if you currently have the disease. Logically, if we know the mode of transmission of hepatitis B, it will be easier to avoid the risk of contagion and take the necessary precautions (use protection during sex, do not re-use needles…).\nIn the case of doctors, nurses and health workers should take special precautions, such as wearing gloves, masks and other protection to prevent passage of the pathogen from an infected person to a healthy one.\nAn infection of the liver caused by the HBV virus can lead to serious consequences. Among them, cirrhosis, an inflammatory reaction that results in scarring of the liver tissue. This threatens the ability of the body to function properly. It can also cause acute liver failure which, in some cases, may require a liver transplant to survive. Chronic hepatitis B may also involve kidney problems, inflammation of the blood vessels, vasculitis and liver cancer.']"	['<urn:uuid:d46eca5e-8517-4a83-abdd-8290a318d8d0>', '<urn:uuid:a8eff991-4d83-45da-85ea-eab733bbc071>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	10	91	1237
44	aomori traditional crafts preservation methods durability	In Aomori prefecture, both BODOKO and Tsugaru lacquerware demonstrate different approaches to durability and preservation. BODOKO achieves durability through multiple layers of hemp and cotton cloths sewn together, surviving through severe cold winters for generations. Tsugaru lacquerware, on the other hand, achieves high durability through a complex production process involving multiple layers of lacquer coating, which are applied dozens of times over two months. The lacquerware uses specific preservation techniques including wood collection, fabric dressing, clay application, and multiple stages of coating and polishing. Both crafts represent the region's emphasis on creating lasting items, though through different methods - BODOKO through fabric layering and Tsugaru lacquerware through repeated lacquer application.	"['In Aomori prefecture, there were sheeting cloths called BODO or BODOKO which were made by the technique of sewing many pieces of hemp and cotton cloths from the clothing once worn by the ancestors for generations and generations.\nBODOKO were used as sheets to lie on during the night spread over the straw or dry leaves on the floor, and oftentimes were also used during childbirth as the sheet for the baby to be delivered on. Receiving the baby with the multi-layered cloths which had been once worn by long dead ancestors was literally to carry the message to the baby that they were not delivered alone.\nWe as individuals do not stand on our own. We are here through our parents, grandparents, and all the ancestors that existed before us. We could easily trace back to more than 1,000 lives of our ancestors through the past 10 generations. BODOKO had always reminded us that we would not be standing here right now if even just one person had been missing from that family line. Childbirth is accompanied with infinite cycles of life and death. The new born baby delivered on the BODOKO receives unspoken blessings and messages such as gYou are and will never be alone. Look at this BODOKO that holds you, you are protected among the all-embracing descendantfs family bonds. You are now officially part of us. Welcome!h BODOKO stands for the full realization of one motherfs earnest wishes for the baby that is blessed into this world, and the prayers of silent hopes from all the ancestors who would welcome this babyfs new arrival into the eternal lifeline of its proud family lineage.\nBODOKO remembers sweat, blood, tears and birth fluids of all the mothers throughout the generations. The new born baby was first wrapped with this BODOKO, and then loaned the clothing of the healthy elders of the village, with a wish of the same longevity of those elders.\nFor the numerous times people in Aomori prefectures had struggled from poor harvests or famine: small children were always vulnerable and first to be affected. Compassion toward life became more prominent in such a harsh environment. They took the ashes from the bottom of the iron pot that was hung around the fire pit, and rubbed the ashes onto the babyfs soft forehead. As you can see from the structure of the old traditional houses, the pillars or beams that are covered with the ashes from the fire pit are usually strong and durable. Rubbing the ashes onto the babyfs forehead was a symbol of parents wishing for the baby to be as strong and durable as the pillars and beams are.\nBODOKO had always been there closest to the families. People have survived through the severe cold winters of Aomori prefecture with BODOKO for many generations. BODOKO for sure have been carved with the memories of the lives and the love of the everlasting family linage. Today BODOKO stands proudly in front of our eyes with much awe and inspiration.\nWe exhibit not only the collection of Mr. Chuzaburo Tanaka, but also the valuable BODOKO collected by Mr. Toshio Kojima (Gallery Kojima) and Ms. Sayomi Okamune (Art gallery Hagisha). The stunning world of art unexpectedly created on the cheap shabby clothes: I hope you enjoy what is the opposite of todayfs consumer culture.\n“Museum of Textile Arts and Ukiyo-e” AMUSE MUSEUM\nDirector & Chief Curator Kiyoshi Tatsumi', 'Tsugaru lacquerware Tsugaru nuri\nLayers of bright colors and modern black lacquer\nmake a powerful and elegant lacquerware\nWhat is Tsugaru lacquerware ?\nTsugaru lacquerware is produced around the city of Hirosaki in the Aomori prefecture. Lacquerware has been produced in this region since the middle of the Edo period (1603-1868), but it is said that the name of Tsugaru lacquerware appeared from the time of their exhibit at the World Exposition in Vienna in 1873. Today, it is used as a general term for traditional lacquerware produced in the Tsugaru region.\nThe characteristics of Tsugaru lacquerware are its practicality, high durability and its highly refined appearance. The unique togidashi kawari nuri technique brings beautiful multi-layered patterns of colored lacquer to the surface. Lacquer is coated dozens of times onto a base made using Tsugaru cypress. This process is carried out repeatedly for two months to produce strong, thick and beautiful lacquerware.\nDiverse coating techniques were developed in the Edo period, including techniques that are still used today, such as kara nuri for the typical one, nanako nuri for creating fine patterns as its characteristic, monsha nuri for creating stylish impression using charcoal and black lacquer, and nishiki nuri for creating fine complexed patterns which requires advanced skill.\nTsugaru lacquerware started to be produced in the middle of the Edo period (1603-1868), when Nobumasa TSUGARU (1646-1710) who was the fourth feudal lord was ruling the Hirosaki Domain. In 1642, the administrative system of alternate attendance called (sankin kotai) was established. Then the cultures of Kyoto and Edo (ancient name of Tokyo) were transmitted to the provinces and local industry protection was being carried out in each place and many handicrafts were produced. Lacquer masters were even invited to the Hirosaki Domain, and before long, the lacquering master Genbe IKEDA created unique lacquerware. At first, this was used to decorate the scabbards of short swords used by samurai, but after a while various furnishings came to be produced utilizing the method of Tsugaru lacquerware.\nAccording to the “Tsugaru Information Chronicle” written by traders of those days, the Tang lacquer coating technique (kara nuri) had already been established by 1758, and various articles such as Tsugaru lacquerware document boxes, stacked boxes and short sword scabbards were being produced. Tsugaru lacquerware furnishings used as gifts to the Imperial Court, the nobility and the shogunate, and its methods were cordially protected and developed by the Domain.\nGoing into the Meiji period (1868-1912), the Aomori Prefecture exhibited lacquerware produced in the Tsugaru region as “Tsugaru lacquerware” at the World Exposition held in Vienna in 1873. This led to the name “Tsugaru lacquerware” becoming widely known, and thereafter Tsugaru Llcquerware developed as an example of leading Aomori Prefecture handicrafts.\nGeneral Production Process\n- 1. Wood collection In the first process, wood is dried thoroughly after lumbering, and is then cut into sizes and planed. The hard, cracked, knots and core of the wood are roughly cut off. Cypress is used for producing furniture such as trays and low tables that are made by jointing boards and magnolia is used for sawn items such as bowls cut on a potter""s wheel.\n- 2. Fabric dressing\nThe main undercoating technique used for Tsugaru lacquerware is called katashitaji (solid undercoating).\nTo begin with, wood polishing is carried out to prepare the surface for rubbing Japanese lacquer (urushi) directly into the surface to make it waterproof.\nNext, in order to protect the wood from damages or warped, fabric is pasted with starch lacquer produced by mixing rice starch with urushi.\nThe fabric is wrapped around the surface of the wood so that woods stick strongly together.\n- 3. Clay application\nLacquer is first applied with the roughest base lacquer and is gradually shifted to fine lacquer. Yamashina polishing powder, a mixture of raw and starch lacquer, is used for clay lacquer.\nAfter coating evenly with a spatula and drying it adequately, the surface is polished on a whetstone.\nThen, finer polishing powder is applied and polished in the same manner to be rust-proof. The characteristic of undercoating until this step is that it is done without any water. An intermediate coat of lacquer is applied to finish parts that will not have any patterns, such as the back of stacked boxes.\n- 4. Preparation\nOn top of the undercoat, a speckled pattern is drawn by preparatory lacquer, which is a mixture of sugurome lacquer, pigments and albumen. Patterns are applied to all the surfaces using a small spatula, and the lacquer is thoroughly dried to the core over approximately 5 days.\n- 5. Coating\nAfter the preparatory lacquer is dried, colored lacquer is applied on top with a paintbrush. In order to make the patterns stand out, coating is carried out with colored lacquer that have a strong contrast, such as yellow and black.\n- 6. Coloring A pattern is drawn with color lacquers scattered in a checkered pattern, and brilliance is produced by coloring in accompaniment with the color tone of the kara nuri. The colored lacquer that is mainly used is a mixture of red and green colored lacquers known as ryosaishiki. The coloring produces the unique pattern of kara nuri. A calm color tone is achieved by further applying clear, dark reddish-brown lacquer over the patterns.\n- 7. Color adjustment\nA thin lacquer coat is applied over the entire article, and tin powder is sprinkled above.\nAfter polishing a kara-nuri pattern, the coating lacquer of tsuma nuri borders the boundaries between the ground color and patterns, which emphasizes the patterns.\n- 8. Overcoating\nDepending on the colors used for finishing, such as red lacquer or sugurome lacquer, the names vary for each as red finishing, black finishing and wax finishing.\nOvercoating is applied thickly with a paintbrush.\n- 9. Polishing\nTo begin with, rough polishing is performed to remove any unevenness.\nIn order to adequately dry the planed surfaces, the pieces are then placed inside a lacquer bath which maintains the appropriate humidity and temperature to dry.\nThen, the patterns are curved even more. Lacquer is stroked into dented parts, and polishing is performed by repeating the coating process many times over.\n- 10. Detailed polishing\nAfter the polishing process, articles are repeatedly polished again with oil polishing powder which is made by mixing canola oil and polishing powder, and the polished marks are further refined.\nOnce the polishing is finished, the pieces are completely wiped off to ensure that no oil content remains.\n- 11. Wax coating (wax color polishing)\nFinally, the pieces are finished polishing with wax-colored lacquer.\nCharcoal coated with wax-colored lacquer is used to repeatedly polish and wipe off little by little to produce a glossy look.\nWhere to Buy & More Information\nTsugaru Densyo Kogeikan\nClosedOpen every day\nBusiness Hours8:15am to 5pm\nSee more Lacquerware\n- Wajima lacquerware\n- Kamakura-bori lacquerware\n- Tsugaru lacquerware\n- Aizu lacquerware\n- Yamanaka lacquerware\n- Kawatsura lacquerware\n- Echizen lacquerware\n- Joboji lacquerware\n- Kiso lacquerware\n- Hidehira lacquerware\n- Kagawa lacquerware\n- Ryukyu lacquerware\n- Takaoka lacquerware\n- Wakasa lacquerware\n- Hida-shunkei lacquerware\n- Ouchi lacquerware\n- Kanazawa lacquerware\n- Kishu lacquerware\n- Kyo laquerware\n- Odawara lacquerware\n- Naruko lacquerware\n- Niigata lacquerware\n- Murakami carved lacquerware']"	['<urn:uuid:58b89cc4-6d5a-45a3-a6d7-418460b95f61>', '<urn:uuid:25e69de3-a60d-443d-ab93-45ba1acf38af>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	6	110	1775

"['Who can attend Camp Aranu\'tiq\'s programs?\nCamp Aranu\'tiq is for those who feel that they do not fit into the norms our society has prescribed for gender. This includes those who have ""transitioned,"" those who happen to express their gender differently than others, and those who may experience teasing or bullying because of their gender.\nWhy don\'t you say exactly where your camps are?\nConfidentiality and privacy are very important to our campers and their families. Our camp population is not as safe as we wish they could be in the world outside of camp, and we want to make sure that the only people with access to our location are families & volunteers who are signed up to attend.\nIs Aranu\'tiq a ""therapy"" camp?\nNo. Aranu\'tiq is in most ways a very typical overnight summer camp; our population (and great people!) are what makes us unique. We do not hold formal discussions about personal experiences of gender, though of course many of our campers talk about it with each other. Our campers should be able to be successful in a structured, loud, and very busy environment for a full week or two with 100+ other people.\nWho are the Aranu\'tiq camp counselors?\nOur counselors are a mix of staff and volunteers who help create a wonderful place for our youth. Many return summer after summer. About half to two-thirds of our counselors at each program are trans-identified. We feel it is important to have role models who are of all gender identities and expressions. We seek a diverse group of staff and volunteers. We have an application process that includes interviews, references, and background checks.\nCan camper parents be volunteers?\nUnfortunately, due to the high number of requests we receive, we have made a blanket policy not to accept parents, guardians, or close family members of campers as volunteers. Check out our family camp!\nWhat is Harbor Camps?\nHarbor Camps is the overarching ""parent"" organization that Camp Aranu\'tiq is a part of. Harbor Camps was also founded by Nick Teich and is run by the same staff that runs Aranu\'tiq. Harbor Camps includes not just Camp Aranu\'tiq (although that is its largest camp), but also two weeklong camps separate from Aranu\'tiq for the following populations:\n- Camp Seneb for youth with dwarfism (2016)\n- Youth with craniofacial anomalies/facial differences (2019)\nEach of these communities are often marginalized and face teasing and bullying simply because of who they are. Harbor Camps seeks to be a safe camp atmosphere that brings together youth, historically under-served in the camp community, who can understand each other\'s journeys and make lifelong friends. All of Harbor Camps\' additional camps take place at our property in New Hampshire.\nVisit www.harborcamps.org for more information.\nHow do you pronounce ""Aranu\'tiq?""\nWhat does ""Aranu\'tiq"" mean?\nAranu\'tiq is a chugach (Yup\'ik, an Indigenous people of Alaska) word for a person who was thought to embody both the male and female spirit. Aranu\'tiq people were often revered and thought to be very lucky because their existence transcended traditional boundaries.\nHow many times can campers return to Aranu\'tiq\'s programs?\nCampers can come back until they age out of each program, as long as we have room.\nHow many campers attend Aranu\'tiq?\nWe have approximately 135 campers in each session.\nCan you accommodate special diets at Aranu\'tiq?\nYes, our chefs are used to providing food for a typical diet, as well as for vegetarians, vegans, and those with gluten intolerance. We are a peanut-free camp. If your child has more complex food needs, please contact us so we can discuss them.']"	['<urn:uuid:53f937b3-b093-4646-a3be-03e53918bfde>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	12	6	598
46	percentage young adults reporting feelings loneliness frequency mental health study	According to the study, 25-30 percent of the young adult sample reported feeling lonely sometimes, while an additional five percent reported frequent feelings of loneliness. The association between loneliness and sleep quality remained even after accounting for mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, which are commonly associated with sleep problems and feeling lonely.	['A new UK study finds a link between loneliness and poor sleep quality in a study of more than 2,000 British young adults.\nResearchers from King’s College London discovered lonelier people were 24 percent more likely to feel tired and have difficulty concentrating during the day.\nLoneliness is defined by researchers as a distressing feeling that people experience when they perceive their social relationships to be inadequate.\nInvestigators say that this is distinct from the concept of social isolation, as people can be socially isolated without feeling lonely, or feel lonely despite being surrounded by many people.\nThe research appears in the journal Psychological Medicine.\nWhile the effect of being lonely is well documented among the elderly, it is a common problem for young people too. In fact, the Mental Health Foundation reports that loneliness is most frequent between the ages of 18-34.\nDespite this, little is known about health problems that are associated with loneliness among young adults, or the impact on sleep.\nThe researchers from King’s College London sampled data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a cohort of 2,232 18-19 year-old twins born in England and Wales.\nThey measured loneliness by scoring responses to four questions: ‘How often do you feel that you lack companionship?’, ’How often do you feel left out?’, ‘How often do you feel isolated from others?’, and ‘How often do you feel alone?’\nThey also measured sleep quality in the past month, including the time it takes to fall asleep, sleep duration, and sleep disturbances, as well as daytime dysfunction such as staying awake during the day.\nOverall 25-30 percent of the sample reported feeling lonely sometimes, with an additional five percent reporting frequent feelings of loneliness.\nThe researchers found that the association between loneliness and sleep quality remained even after they accounted for symptoms of mental health problems such as depression and anxiety — conditions which are commonly associated with sleep problems and feeling lonely.\nOne of the proposed reasons for restless sleep in lonely individuals is the possibility they feel less safe, so the researchers examined the impact of past exposure to violence, including crime, sexual abuse, child maltreatment, and violent abuse by family members or peers.\nAnd, they discovered the association between loneliness and poor sleep quality was almost 70 percent stronger among those exposed to the most severe forms of violence.\nThe study authors suggest a number of biological processes which may explain the association between loneliness and sleep quality, including a heightened biological stress response. Previous research suggests that loneliness is associated with changes in circulating cortisol, indicating elevated activation of the stress response system.\nPhysiological arousal resulting from this process may play a role in the disrupted sleep of lonely individuals.\nProfessor Louise Arseneault from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College London, explains:\n“Diminished sleep quality is one of the many ways in which loneliness gets under the skin, and our findings underscore the importance of early therapeutic approaches to target the negative thoughts and perceptions that can make loneliness a vicious cycle.\n“Many of the young people in our study are currently at university, living away from home for the first time, which can compound feelings of loneliness. It is therefore important that they receive appropriate support to address these feelings before they turn into severe mental health problems.”\nTimothy Matthews from the IoPPN at King’s College London, added: “We also found that past exposure to violence exacerbated the association between loneliness and poor sleep, which is consistent with the suggestion that sleep problems in lonely individuals are related to feeling unsafe.\n“This makes sense as sleep is a state in which it is impossible to be vigilant for one’s safety, so feeling isolated from others could make it more difficult to sleep restfully, and even more so for individuals who have been exposed to violence in the past.\n“It is therefore important to recognize that loneliness may interact with pre-existing vulnerabilities in some people, and that these individuals should receive tailored support.”\nSource: Kings College — London']	['<urn:uuid:e6c73627-2280-4af1-b4b5-26d756456b3d>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	10	55	679
47	How does LSVT therapy integrate with comprehensive rehabilitation services?	LSVT therapy (BIG and LOUD) is a specialized program that can be integrated into comprehensive rehabilitation services. The therapy involves intensive 4-week programs where patients practice exaggerated movements and loud speaking to address Parkinson's disease symptoms. LSVT can be combined with other rehabilitation services including physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, and recreational therapy. Facilities like HealthSource Saginaw offer these comprehensive services, allowing patients to transition between different levels of care while maintaining continuity in therapy. The programs involve weekly team conferences with multiple specialists and can be delivered in various settings including inpatient rehabilitation, skilled care, and outpatient services.	"[""Unique Therapy Addresses Parkinson’s Disease in 'Big' and 'Loud' Ways\nHow a concentrated therapy program uses a team approach to easing movement and speech symptoms in people with PD.\nIf you have movement or speech problems because of Parkinson’s disease, a specialized therapy program can help.\nLSVT BIG and LOUD® therapy was developed for people with Parkinson’s disease. It also can be used for people who have other neurological conditions. LSVT programs are administered in an intensive manner — four times per week for four weeks — and are tailored to each patient.\nThe emphasis is on exaggerated activity to compensate for PD’s movement and speech symptoms. For movement issues, therapists ask patients to move in BIG or amplified ways, whether they’re walking, buttoning shirts and pants, getting keys or change out of pockets, or writing. For speech, the focus is on a single goal: LOUD speaking. Activities may include sustaining a vowel sound such as “ah,” oral reading and speaking activities that increase in complexity (word and paragraph length).\n“The majority of PD patients I send for therapy find it to be extremely helpful,” says Kelvin L. Chou, M.D., professor of neurology and neurosurgery at Michigan Medicine and co-director of the STIM (Surgical Therapies Improving Movement) Program.\nHow LSVT works\nMichigan Medicine physical therapist Krysten Salla says LSVT BIG trains people with Parkinson’s to exaggerate their physical movements so movements that feel “too big” to them appear normal. Certified PTs, such as Salla, and occupational therapists use specific techniques to improve bradykinesia (slow movement), hypokenesia (small movement) and kinesthetic awareness (sensory deficits). Salla notes that LSVT does not treat dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movement).\nWith the program, patients need to tolerate one to two hours of activity per day, four days per week, for four weeks. “The patients who tend to benefit most from BIG therapy are those who report some difficulty getting out of a bed or chair,” Chou says.\n“Speech-language pathologists who use the LSVT LOUD program target the specific speech problems related to Parkinson’s disease, such as softness and difficulty forming sounds clearly,” says speech-language pathologist Jen Gostlin. Patients are trained to increase healthy speech loudness during 16 one-hour sessions over four weeks.\n“The patients who benefit the most from LOUD therapy are those who report being asked to repeat statements twice,” says Chou.\nLSVT therapy benefits\nPatients usually report significant improvements in their quality of life. Salla says LSVT BIG patients typically notice improvements in walking, getting in and out of chairs, and rolling in bed as well as overall flexibility, balance, strength and endurance. Because the program is specific to individual patients and their needs, results are based on personal goals.\nAs for whom it can help, Salla says, “the people with Parkinson’s disease who benefit the most from LSVT BIG therapy are early on in their diagnosis or have minimal to moderate functional deficits.”\nPeople who are having some difficulties but are still able to walk and get in and out of bed with little or no assistance can greatly benefit. The program requires cognitive effort to change habits and reprogram the brain to make bigger, more efficient movements, so patients who have little to no cognitive problems are the most successful.\nGostlin reports that LSVT LOUD patients can notice improvements in speech volume, voice quality, disordered rate and articulation, facial expression and intelligibility.\nShe notes that the best candidates for LSVT LOUD therapy are at the early stage of diagnosis, have higher levels of cognitive ability and are motivated to complete daily home exercises.\nKeys to success\nEssential components of both LSVT BIG and LSVT LOUD are follow-through, practice and carryover to home. Patients are asked to incorporate the BIG and LOUD principles and strategies into their everyday lives for greatest success to improve their quality of life.\n“It’s important to remember that those who get the most out of the program are those who practice the exercises they learn in class at home,” says Chou. “Those who continue their exercises after the program is over will maintain the benefit, while those who do not continue their exercises will eventually lose the benefit.”\nAssistance at U-M MedRehab\nUniversity of Michigan Briarwood MedRehab in Ann Arbor offers both types of LSVT therapy. Prospective patients need to obtain a referral from their physician. Patients may also benefit from completing both the BIG and LOUD programs together if indicated. Referrals should specify LSVT and Briarwood MedRehab.\nA multidisciplinary team of clinicians (physical therapist, occupational therapist and speech-language pathologist) will determine if the patient is appropriate for the program. At the end of the program, MedRehab offers a group class one or two times a week; this is a private-pay option.\nOn the LSVT Global website, you can search for an LSTV clinician in your area."", 'You or a loved one urgently needs rehabilitation after a stroke, brain/spinal cord injury, amputation, fall, car accident, neurological disorder, surgery, or any other temporarily incapacitating condition.

48	condensation moisture mold growth prevention tips	To prevent mold growth from condensation and moisture, several measures are crucial. Fix water problems promptly and maintain indoor humidity between 30-60% using air conditioners, dehumidifiers, and exhaust fans. Prevent condensation on cold surfaces by adding insulation to windows, piping, walls, and floors. In HVAC systems, condensation occurs when cold components meet warm, humid air, particularly in air ducts. Combat this by insulating ducts, especially in damp areas like crawl spaces, and improving air circulation. Clean and dry any damp materials within 24-48 hours, avoid carpeting in perpetually moist areas, and ensure proper ventilation in bathrooms and moisture-prone areas.	['Allergy Partners provides tips about mold in your home or work place and what would be considered reasonable or excessive amounts that could be dangerous to your health. Molds are part of the natural environment, and can be found everywhere, indoors and outdoors. Outdoor molds play a part in nature by breaking down dead organic matter such as fallen leaves and dead trees. Molds are usually not a problem indoors, unless mold spores land on a wet or damp spot and begin growing. Indoors, mold growth should be avoided.\nHow do molds affect people?\nMolds have the potential to cause health problems. Molds can produce allergens and irritants. Inhaling or touching mold or mold spores may cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Allergic reactions to mold are common. They can be immediate or delayed. Allergic responses include hay fever-type symptoms, such as sneezing, runny nose, red eyes, and skin rash. Molds can also cause asthma attacks in people with asthma who are allergic to mold. In addition, mold exposure can irritate the eyes, skin, nose, throat, and lungs of both mold-allergic and non-allergic people. Symptoms other than the allergic and irritant types are not commonly reported as a result of inhaling molds.\nAre there federal regulations or standards regarding mold testing?\nStandards or Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) for airborne concentrations of mold, or mold spores, have not been set. Currently, there are no EPA regulations or standards for airborne mold contaminants.\nMold testing and sampling\nIs sampling for mold needed?\nIn most cases, if visible mold growth is present, sampling is unnecessary. Since no EPA or other federal limits have been set for mold or mold spores, sampling cannot be used to check a building’s compliance with federal mold standards. Surface sampling may be useful to determine if an area has been adequately cleaned or remediated. Sampling for mold should be conducted by professionals who have specific experience in designing mold sampling protocols, sampling methods and interpreting results. Sample analysis should follow analytical methods recommended by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), or other professional organization.\nMold Remediation and Prevention:\nIf you already have a mold problem – ACT QUICKLY. Mold damages what it grows on. The longer it grows, the more damage it can cause.\nWho should do the cleanup depends on a number of factors. One consideration is the size of the mold problem. If the moldy area is less than about 10 square feet (less than roughly a 3 ft. by 3 ft. patch), in most cases, you can handle the job yourself.\nHere are some useful tips to prevent and clean up mold in your home:\nMolds can be found almost anywhere; they can grow on virtually any substance, providing moisture is present. There are molds that can grow on wood, paper, carpet, and foods. There is no practical way to eliminate all mold and mold spores in the indoor environment; the way to control indoor mold growth is to control moisture\n1. Fix the source of any water problem or leak promptly to prevent mold growth.\n2. Reduce indoor humidity (to 30-60%) to decrease mold growth by:\n- Venting bathrooms, dryers and other moisture-generating sources to the outside\n- If there’s some mold in the shower or elsewhere in the bathroom that seems to reappear, increasing ventilation (running a fan or opening a window) and cleaning more frequently will usually prevent mold from recurring\n- Using air conditioners and de-humidifiers\n- Using exhaust fans whenever cooking, dishwashing and cleaning\n3. Clean and dry any damp or wet building materials and furnishings within 24-48 hours to prevent mold growth.\n4. Clean mold off hard surfaces with water and detergent, and dry completely. Absorbent materials such as ceiling tiles, that are moldy, may need to be replaced.\n5. Prevent condensation: Reduce the potential for condensation on cold surfaces (i.e., windows, piping, exterior walls, roof, or floors) by adding insulation.\n6. In areas where there is a perpetual moisture problem, do not install carpeting (i.e., by drinking fountains, by sinks, or on concrete floors with leaks or frequent condensation.\n7. Do not paint or caulk moldy surfaces. Clean up the mold and dry the surfaces before painting. Paint applied over moldy surfaces is likely to peel.\n8. Absorbent or porous materials, such as ceiling tiles and carpet, may have to be thrown away if they become moldy.\n9. If you are unsure about how to clean an item, or if the item is expensive or of sentimental value, you may wish to consult a specialist.\nSome situations where you may need professional help to clean up mold in your home:\n- If there has been a lot of water damage, and/or mold growth covers more than 10 square feet, consult EPA guide Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings. Although focused on schools and commercial buildings, this document is applicable to other building types.\n- If you choose to hire a contractor (or other professional service provider) to do the cleanup, make sure the contractor has experience cleaning up mold and ask the contractor to follow the recommendations in EPA guide (above) or the guidelines of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), or other guidelines from professional or government organizations\n- If you suspect that the heating/ventilation/air conditioning (HVAC) system may be contaminated with mold (it is part of an identified moisture problem, for instance, or there is mold near the intake to the system), consult EPA guide before taking further action. Do not run the HVAC system if you know or suspect that it is contaminated with mold – it could spread mold throughout your home.\n- If the water and/or mold damage was caused by sewage or other contaminated water, then call in a professional who has experience cleaning and fixing buildings damaged by contaminated water.\nIn order to avoid exposure to airborne mold spores while cleaning, you may want to wear long gloves , goggles and a N-95 respirator mask available in many hardware stores or via the Internet (cost $12-25). If you have health concerns, consult a health professional before starting cleanup.', 'Signs of Mold in Your Heating & Air Conditioning System\nYou only need to do something about mold in your air conditioning system if there are obvious signs, such as visible mold or a strong mildew smell. The typical places you want to check for mold include the air ducts, intake vents, cooling coils, and drip pans.\nIf you can’t see any signs of mold, but there is a definite odor, you should call a professional to inspect your system. Mold in your air ducts or other parts of your air conditioning system should be dealt with immediately. Failure to address this problem can encourage mold spores to be spread throughout your house as the system blows air across the mold and into the various parts of the house. Do not run your air conditioning system, especially if mold is present in your air ducts or near the intake vent.\nCauses of Mold in Your Heating and Air Conditioning System\nThe two major causes of mold in your air conditioning system are condensation and organic material. Condensation occurs when parts of your air conditioning system get cold, especially when the surrounding air in the room is warm and humid. For example, if your basement tends to be humid and the air ducts get cold while the air is blowing, the water vapor in the room can begin to condense on the air duct, creating a small amount of water. If the humidity is low enough, the water will quickly evaporate once the a/c turns off. If the humidity is too high, then the water will persist and that’s when you begin to have a mold problem.\nAir conditioning systems tend to collect dust, both in the unit itself and within the air ducts. Dust contains all kinds of organic material, such as pollen and dead skin cells, which is essentially food for mold. Combined with a damp environment, this creates a great place for mold to grow.\nHeater and Air Conditioner Mold Removal\nRemoving mold in your air conditioning system can be very difficult because a lot of places are hard to access, especially areas inside your air ducts. Additionally, mold in your a/c system can have serious consequences since it easily spreads mold spores throughout the entire house. For these reasons, we recommend you call a professional mold removal contractor to tackle this job unless the mold is in an isolated area and it is easy to access. For tips on best ways to select a good contractor, check out our Hiring a Pro section.\nFor removing small areas of mold, try the following:\nStep 1- Choose a cleaning solution\n- Mixture of household detergent and water (recommended by the EPA).\n- Commercial mold removal product (always follow manufacturer’s instructions on the label).\n- Baking Soda -Detergent Solution (1/2 cup baking soda, 1 cup water, 1 Tbsp mild liquid detergent).\n- Borax Solution (1 gallon of water to 1 cup of borax, or 1 part borax to 16 parts water).\nSpecial note on Bleach: Bleach is not needed on hard, non-pourous surfaces, such as sheet metal. One of the options above will be adequate, and will also be a lot more safe.\nStep 2 – Put on Protective Clothing and Make Safety Precautions\nDepending on the severity of the cleaning solution that you chose, you will need to take some safety measures in order to keep yourself free from harm. Because you are working with mold, we recommend the following:\n- A respirator, or air mask, that is adequate for blocking mold spores from entering your lungs. The EPA recommends a N95 mask or equivalent.\n- Rubber or Nitrile gloves.\n- Safety goggles that do not have air vents in the sides.\n- If you are moderately sensitive to mold exposure, we recommend wearing coveralls to protect your skin as much as possible. If you are severely sensitive to mold exposure, we recommend getting somebody else to perform the task.\nIf you are using a product that has strong or dangerous fumes, also make sure your are working in a well ventilated room.\nTo see more on how to prepare to remove mold, click here.\nStep 3 – Apply the Cleaning Solution and Scrub\nApply the cleaning solution that you have elected to use. You can do this with a spray bottle, a lightly damp rag, or a low-abrasive brush or pad. Do not use anything abrasive, such as a wire brush.\nApply the mold removal solution generously. Let the solution sit for a few minutes, then scrub the area in circular motion with your rag, brush, or a scrub pad. Using a disposable towel, or a regular towel that you can disinfect with bleach later, wipe off the area and the excess.\nContinue this process until the mold is removed from the surface.\nStep 5 – Clean Up and Let Dry\nAfter the mold is removed, clean up the area and either dispose of anything that has had contact with the mold, or clean it with a proper detergent or fungicide.\nLet the area dry by keeping it warm and with good ventilation. If you live in an area with higher humidity, you may want to run a dehumidifier.\nStep 6 – Check for Signs of Mold\nIf mold begins to reappear in the next few weeks, it is probably because of condensation. Look for ways to improve air circulation, perhaps by opening a window or running a fan or dehumidifier. If this isn’t possible, try to insulate the area that tends to stay wet. This will help reduce the temperature difference between the ambient air, and the effected area. This will disrupt the mold growth process and prevent it from getting established. Remember, reducing moisture is the probably the number one factor in air conditioner mold removal.\nIf the mold reappears, repeat steps 1 through 5.\nPrevent Re-Growth of Mold in Your Heating and Air Conditioning System\nDepending on the situation and where the mold tends to grow, keep in mind the following principles of mold prevention in your heating and air conditioning system:\n- Change the air filter regularly, typically every 2-3 months. Filters capture fine particles, which can create a place for mold to grow.\n- Run a dehumidifier. This is helpful, especially in areas that tend to be damp and cool.\n- Insulate if possible. By insulating air ducts, especially in a damp place like crawl spaces, the air immediately around the duct will be kept at a similar temperature and will reduce the amount of condensation. This works for cooling coils also.\n- Hire a profesional to clean the HVAC system, including the air ducts. Only perform this if you know your air ducts are cluttered with dust and debris, otherwise you could be just wasting your time and money.\nWe hope this was helpful!

49	fermentation temperature ale versus lager yeast brewing process comparison	Ale and lager yeasts ferment at different temperatures during the brewing process. Ales ferment at higher temperatures of 62-75°F (17-24°C) and act quicker, while lagers ferment at lower temperatures of 46-58°F (8-14°C) and take longer to complete fermentation.	"['Views: 44 Author: Site Editor Publish Time: 2022-10-27 Origin: Site\nFermentation is at the heart of the craft brewing process. During fermentation, the wort made from the raw material is converted into beer by yeast. Fermentation is when yeast produces all the alcohol, aroma and flavor compounds in beer. It is also “where the magic happens”. Fermentation is divided into 3 recognized phases: lag phase, active phase and stationary phase.\nBeer Fermentation Stage -\nOnce the yeast is cast, it goes into what we call a later stage. Although there isn’t any clear fermentation, there’s still something going on. Yeasts are absorbing oxygen from the wort (producing sterols), which are essential for reproduction and healthy growth.\nYeasts are living organisms, so they need oxygen. This is why wort aeration is important in commercial brewing. Yeasts need oxygen to grow and produce important cell wall components. Also to absorbing oxygen, yeast also absorbs vitamins and minerals needed for growth.\nGood timing on the fermentation temperature. The style of beer you choose to brew, as well as the yeast you use, will determine the fermentation temperature.\nAle: 62-75 °F (17-24 °C)\nLager: 46-58 °F (8-14 °C) *Note: Lager fermentation can begin at elevated temperature (~60 °F/15.5 °C) until signs of fermentation (gravity drop, CO₂ production, head part formation) is obvious. Once symptoms of fermentation are observed, cool to desired fermentation temperature.\nWheat and Belgian styles: 62-85 °F (17-29 °C)\nBeer Fermentation Stage -\nDepending on the beer style, visual activity will begin to be seen within 24-48 hours of pitching. Yeast is coming out of the lag phase and into the anaerobic phase. The lag period can be as short as 30 minutes.\nYeast cell counts increase during the active phase. Yeast starts to consume the sugar made on brewing day. Carbon dioxide is produced and a layer of foam can be seen.\nAs the number of cells increases, ethanol and flavor compounds are produced. At this point you can smell the fermentation. If neutral yeast is used, such as Fermentis US-05, it may smell like olive oil.\nActivity at this stage is temperature dependent, and the higher the temperature, the more active the activity. Yeast consumes sugar in a certain pattern. Monosaccharides are first consumed with glucose, followed by fructose and sucrose, before entering metabolism. The glucose content in a typical beer wort is about 14% of all sugars.\nThe main sugar and the heart of the brew is maltose, which is an important flavor ingredient. Maltose makes up 59% of the wort sugar in a typical beer. Maltose is used by yeast to impart properties to beer that many brewers have planned in formulation development. When fermentation is at its most active, the foam at the top of the wort usually turns from yellow to brown. Brown spots made of oxidized hop resin can also be seen.\nLagers – For some strains of lager, brewers increase the fermentation temperature after 50 to 60% fermentation. They allow the beer to “free rise” and the temperature can be as high as 20°C (68°F). The elevated temperature will make the beer “self-purify”, reducing the rate of diacetyl.\nCool down to 10°C (50°F) and hold at this temperature for 48 hours\nCool to 5°C (41°F) and hold at this temperature for 24 hours\nCool to 0 to 3°C (32°F), the temperature maintained for ripening.\nBeer Fermentation Stage -\nDuring the fermentation stage after most of the sugar in the wort is consumed, the fermentation rate drops sharply. During this period, most of the final sugars are consumed and some secondary metabolites are converted by yeast. As the alcohol content increases and sugar and nutrients are depleted, the yeast begins to flocculate and settle.\nYeast growth slows as the beer enters a stationary phase. Most flavor and aroma compounds have already been produced. These include fusel alcohols, esters, and sulfur compounds. During the resting phase, the beer is conditioned. Yeast reabsorbs diacetyl produced during fermentation. Hydrogen sulfide escapes from the fermenter as a gas. The attenuation level is checked by measuring the specific gravity of the wort.\nReduce the production rate of ethanol and carbon dioxide\nReduction of some flavor compounds through yeast metabolism or carbon dioxide scrubbing\nReach terminal gravity\nYeast flocculation and sedimentation start\nAles: same as primary fermentation (higher temperature increases diacetyl reduction rate)\nLager: 40-60 °F (4-15 °C). Some brewers allow the temperature of the beer to be elevated to speed up the reduction of diacetyl. This elevated temperature usually only lasts 24 to 48 hours.\nWheat and Belgian beers: same as primary fermentation (higher temperature increases diacetyl reduction rate).\nIf the brewery’s next step is to re-ferment the yeast, the brewery will first confirm that the quality of the harvested slurry has reached certain standards of viability and purity by the end of the secondary fermentation. Since these methods are beyond the scope of most homebrew needs, there are some simple techniques to help determine whether re-extracting yeast from homebrew is a good option.', ""Part 4/4 - Yeast, the Magician\nWelcome back! We hope you have been busy exploring all the unique beers available over the holidays and in to the late winter. We have been. There is a lot to talk about, but last but not least we need to talk about the 4th and final ingredient in our 4 part series about beer: yeast!\nWithout yeast in beer you have a barley and hop soup. Yeast is a simple yet complex ingredient. It can be found naturally nearly everywhere, but is also hard to control. In the brewing process yeast is somewhat a sacred part of the beer.\nGetting down to the basics, there are two main of strains of yeast that divide beer into two main styles of beer: ales and lagers. Nearly every beer drinker is familiar with these two types. You can take the exact same recipe of malt, water and hops and by changing the yeast you significantly change the overall character of a beer.\nSo what does yeast do?\nYeast is added once the barley and hops have been processed appropriately in the hot water mixture mixture. This process is called 'pitching'. In either an ale or lager the process is the same, the yeast performs the function of breaking down the sugar from barley (or whatever other forms of sugar were added to the batch) and turning them into alcohol. This is the process known as fermentation. This is what creates the alcohol in beer and gives it the foaminess that we have all come to love. As fermentation happens sugar is converted to alcohol and carbon dioxide is released.\nAle vs. Lager Yeast\nThere are a few differences between ale and lager yeast. Ale yeast is referred to as top fermenting and lager yeast is bottom fermenting. These are generic references and simply mean when either of the yeasts are pitched they ferment the beer from the top of the fermenter or the bottom. Beyond the basic top and bottom difference, they also ferment best at different temperatures and speeds. Ale yeast usually ferments at a higher temperature and acts quicker whereas lager yeast performs best at a slightly lower temperature and usually takes longer to finish the fermentation.\nOn a side note, another cool thing about yeast is that it is reusable. Yeast can be skimmed off the top or bottom of a batch of beer and reused in another batch. Over time reusing the yeast will make the flavouring properties change. Ale yeast tends to be a bit more resilient whereas lager yeast can fade out after 7-8 uses.\nWhy does it matter?\nSo really why would I care about yeast?\nIf you are a person that enjoys beer of any type, yeast may actually be the factor that hinges your entire preference. Ales and their yeast varieties usually produce a more full bodied beer. Lager yeast gives a lighter body.\nBreweries go through extreme lengths during the fermentation process ensuring yeast reacts just the way they want it to provide the certain flavour they are seeking. For example; Duvel, the world famous Belgian Golden Strong Ale uses a variety of yeasts to ferment, moving it through different temperature ranges and conditions, before it is put in the bottle (with more yeast) to become the ultra foamy, complex, and beautiful golden colour. This is an amazingly elegant beer that has become world famous, mainly through the careful attention the brewery gives the yeast.\nSome flavours you may taste coming from yeast are things like: banana, clove, raisin, barnyard, and other subtle fruit flavours. Yeast can be open fermented in a large vat or closed fermented in a vessel. In either case the brewery must ensure that there are no unwanted natural yeast that make its way into the beer, so the fermentation stage must be somewhat protected and the beer not disturbed once the yeast is added.\nYeast can certainly not be overlooked as it can make or break a beer. Malted barley or hops can both be substituted with other forms of ingredients to derive fermentable sugars or bitterness and preservation. Yeast is the key that makes it all happen and ties the ingredients together to transform everything into the beverage we all love.\nOnce again thanks for reading! If this is your first time reading our blog go back and check out our older posts. From here on in we will be focusing our blog on other beer related things. Look for us on the street and book a tour if you'd like to learn more about beer and get to know Saint John a bit better.\nOnce again here is a shortlist of what is happening on the beer scene right now!\n1. Beer to Drink Now! - Aphrodisiac Ale, Picaroons - Only around for a bit longer and till clinging on to that loving feeling from Valentines Day. This is a great flavoured beer that has subtle chili notes with chocolate taste. Light bodied and interesting; it won't last long.\n2. Gateway Beer! - Old Growth ESB, Maybe Brewing Company - Extra Special Bitters' (ESB) would usually not be a great beer to introduce someone to hop forwardness, but this one presents itself very delightfully. It is not in your face with hops, but you know they are there. A great beer for someone who is interested in the craft scene but hasn't made the leap yet. They just need to get past the name. It is barely bitter.\n3. Most Crowd Pleasing! - Ruckus IPA, Long Bay Brewery - Available at the brewery, on tap, and now in bottles. A seriously drinkable IPA. Quality and juiciness at every sip. So easy to drink. A great IPA all around. Hopefully this one sticks around. It will certainly become a staple Uptown.\n4. Most Adventurous! - One Hot Minute, Hammond River Brewing - Yes another beer with chilies added. This one is spicy. But that all subsides after a few sips. A really interesting beer that is not for everyone, but you have to try. High quality and tasty. This will keep your belly warm and is great for anyone that likes chili heat.\nStay tuned for our next post! Cheers!

50	ankle injury treatment prevention	When treating ankle injuries, first aid involves helping the person lie down and elevating the injured ankle on soft padding to minimize swelling and pain. The shoes should not be removed unless there's a suspected open wound. For long-term treatment and prevention, physical therapy is recommended to strengthen weak muscles around the ankle joint. Conservative treatment options include bracing, medication, and exercises to strengthen the muscles that control the ankle joint. Proper footwear with good support is essential to prevent re-injury.	"['Fractures occur when the bones break. Open fractures are when the bone has broken through the skin or when a wound is present. A fracture is closed when there is no disruption of the skin. On the other hand, dislocations occur when there is an abnormal separation in the joints, where the bones meet.\nIn all cases of fractures and dislocations, the person should not be moved unless danger is present in the environment. Basic first aid requires that the injured bone, even the limbs, should not be realigned or pushed back. Moreover, it should not be allowed to move at all. Provide soft paddings and slings to support the position chosen by the person. Apply ice to the fractured or dislocated limb. These should reduce swelling and pain. The rescuer should check and monitor for circulation, ensuring that the injured area has continuous blood flow or nerve sensations. Emergency medical assistance should be called immediately. Fracture injuries in the limbs vary in first aid treatment. This is because of the different types and shapes of the bones in the body,\nWhen the arm is fractured, the weight of the elbow and the lower arm is supported by the person to minimize pain. Fracture of the upper arm may be grave due to the pressure on the major nerves and blood vessels, especially the ones adjacent to the shoulder and elbow joints. Help the person into the most comfortable position, usually sitting on a chair or half sitting with assistance. Place the injured arm of the person on a pillow or folded clothing. While waiting for emergency help, apply an elevation sling to minimize the injured arm’s movements.\nIf the lower arm or wrist is fractured, the injured arm of the person may be supported with the other arm. Help the person into the most comfortable position, usually sitting down with the weight of the injured wrist against the body. To give support, a pillow or clothing may be placed on the lap to give a soft support for the patient to use so he/ she can rest the burden of the arm. While waiting for emergency help, utilize a firmly folded newspaper folded into a gutter shape and use as a splint under the fractured wrist. Use a narrow-fold bandage above and below the injured limb to keep the splint in position. Arm slings may be applied for supplementary support and stability.\nThe same treatment can be given to a fractured hand and fractured or dislocated finger. Do not attempt to move replace the dislocated finger, only a medical professional may do so. To relieve of pain, soft padding may be applied around the injured hand and/ or fingers. Apply an elevation sling, taking extra precaution to prevent hitting the injured area when tying the knot.\nOftentimes, it is hard to determine whether a person has suffered a fracture of sprain in the ankle. However, when there is doubt, treat the injury as a fracture. The same treatment may be given to fractured or dislocated foot or toe/s. Help the person to lie down\nand elevate the injured ankle/ or foot on soft padding. This will remove the weight from the injured food and minimize swelling and pain. Do not remove the shoes to prevent any further injury unless there is a suspected open wound. A soft pillow or rolled blanket may be utilized to immobilize the injured area. To keep the padding in place, make use of a two narrow-fold bandage.\nAlthough these injuries are fairly common only in sports, medical assistance is required for any type of bone injury. The sooner first aid is performed on victims, the greater chances of minimizing damages. Through first aid training and various other workplace approved programs, the lay community can provide to victims to minimalize pain in emergency situations such as these.', 'Posts for: January, 2018\nFollowing an ankle injury or ankle surgery, you’ll inevitably lose some strength and range of motion from being immobilized for an extended period of time. A weak ankle can hinder normal mobility, and even lead to another injury. So what can you do to strengthen your ankle and get back to your old self again?\nStrengthening Your Ankle\nYour ankle or leg may feel stiff, especially if your treatment required wearing a cast or a walking boot. Stiffness and instability are common symptoms following an ankle injury that will need to be addressed in order to get you back to your normal range of motion and activity level.\nYour podiatrist may recommend post-injury physical therapy or home exercises that will help you strengthen weak muscles surrounding the ankle joint and restore mobility to lower your risk of reinjury. These include range of motion exercises for the injured ankle, which help loosen stiff ankles, and stretching exercises for the calf muscles, which help decrease your risk of hurting your ankle again. As with all exercises, progress slowly and discontinue if painful. Pain is most certainly not gain when it comes to physical therapy!\nChoosing the Right Shoes\nThe shoes you wear will also play an important role in protecting your injured ankle and restoring your mobility. Supportive shoes will provide more comfort, better balance and help stabilize the weak ankle to prevent re-injury. Stay off high heels or flats and flip flops without support until your ankle is completely mended.\nProper care and rehabilitation following an ankle injury is critical to ensure your ankle fully heals. Always consult your podiatrist if ankle pain or stiffness persists or worsens and before starting any new exercise program.\nChronic ankle instability is a condition characterized by a recurring ""giving way"" of the outer side of the ankle. It most often develops following an ankle sprain. When the stretched or torn ligaments do not heal properly or completely, ankle instability is often the result.\nIf you have chronic ankle instability, you may find it difficult to walk on uneven surfaces. Other symptoms include a repeated turning of the ankle during physical activity, tenderness and persistent discomfort and swelling.\nHow Can I Treat My Ankle Instability?\nTreatment for an unstable ankle will depend on the degree of instability. Bracing, medication and physical therapy are all conservative treatment options that may help strengthen your weakened ankle. Often patients with ankle instability can be treated without surgery by strengthening the muscles that control the ankle joint, avoiding or limiting high impact activities and using a supportive brace to decrease the risk of recurrent ankle sprains.\nIn severe cases, or when conservative treatments aren’t successful, your podiatrist may recommend surgery, which involves repair or reconstruction of the damaged ligaments.\nIf your ankle feels unstable or if you have had recurring ankle sprains, visit your podiatrist for an evaluation. Left untreated, chronic ankle instability leads to activity restrictions, tendon complications, arthritis and continued instability. Your podiatrist can provide a recommended treatment plan based on the severity of your instability, so that you can get back to the activities you enjoy!']"	['<urn:uuid:89202a48-993f-4f4c-a2df-5582df7e6dab>', '<urn:uuid:547b5a10-eaf6-4b29-8d66-61b984ca1b23>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	4	81	1166
51	Could you explain in simple terms what happens when big investment companies want to buy stocks and other investments?	Buy-side firms, which include mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, private equity funds, and hedge funds, acquire securities and assets for their own benefit or their customers'. They develop private, confidential methods to identify undervalued assets in the market. Their analysts conduct financial research and develop strategies to determine which specific investments will add maximum value to the company. The confidentiality of their methods is crucial because if their investment strategies became public, market forces of supply and demand would drive up prices and eliminate potential profit opportunities.

How Does Buy Side Trading Work?Academic Research on Buy Side\nWhat is Buy Side Trading?\nBuy-side is the face of the Wall Street constructed by institutional investors like mutual funds, pension funds in addition to insurance firms that tenders in purchasing a high volume of securities for purposes of financial management. Sell-side being the antonym of Purchase side, deals with the provision of endorsements of public markets upgrade, reduction, price objective, and additional issues. Buy-side complements sell-side making up Wall Street\nHow Does Buy Side Trading Work?\nBuy-side firms deal with the acquiring of securities and other assets for their benefits or that of their customer's. Besides mutual funds, pension funds and insurance companies, private equity funds, hedge funds, and individual traders are also members of buy-side. Although the sell-side recommendations are provided to the public, buy-side recommendation isis private to the institution, and any applicable method, vision, formula developed by the buy side analysts are confidentially maintained. Ideally, buy-side investments are valued for firm's or its customer value creation by establishing and purchasing assets whose market values are lower than book value. Given that the security prices are affected greatly by the market economic responses, the buy side is appropriate when the method is confidentially kept from the public. For instance when a buy-side analyst becomes aware of the technology stock price to be lower than its fellow group although it performs highly based on the propriety financial model that the analyst uses, then the analyst can conclude of the company stocks to be undervalued and advice his clients for the purchase of the said stocks. On the other hand, if the analyst decides to make the findings to the public, then the low priced stock will be lost as many will demand the said stock and with the economic market forces of demand and supply, the equilibrium price will rise hence making the stock price to increase. Because of confidentiality needed for buy-side, companies that employ both buy-side and sell-side analysts a boundary is created separating the two sides. Although there are cases where investment banks with both buy-side and sell-side may decide to minimize the boundary created. There is a possibility of a buy-side exiting analyst endorsing a selling side analyst to make a recommendation, and this conveniently results from sharing price increase before sales. A buy-side analyst undertakes financial research and strategy development of a company. In the development of a company's strategy, a lot of research and financial modeling are involved. Buy-side analysts' research is specific to whether a specific investment is appropriate and is for maximum value addition to the company.\nAcademic Research on Buy Side\n- Buy-side vs. sell-side analysts' earnings forecasts, Groysberg, B., Healy, P., & Chapman, C. (2008). Financial Analysts Journal, 64(4), 25-39. This paper states the earning versus forecasting performance comparison of analysts at a large company buy-side company with another analyst from sell side in the year 1997 to 2004. Buy-side was of more optimism and lesser forecast than the sell-side analysts as a result of retaining poorly performing analysts by buy-side and the use of various yardsticks in the performance evaluation of from buy side and sell side.\n- Buy-side analysts, sell-side analysts, and investment decisions of money managers, Cheng, Y., Liu, M. H., & Qian, J. (2006). Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 41(1), 51-83. The paper is about the examination of financial analysts in coming up with the institutional investor decisions. The model used showed that it is the role of a fund manager to undertake investments in stock-based optimal findings on both biased sell-side analysts and unbiases sell analysts. The is a lot of emphasis on the reports when the buy-side analyst information quality compared to that sell-side analyst rises. There was evidence found to support the model forecasting the weight the managers allocate ton buy-side research compared to the sell side and those found without involving both buy-side and sell-side analysts.\n- Buy-side trades and sell-side recommendations: Interactions and information content, Busse, J. A., Green, T. C., & Jegadeesh, N. (2012). Journal of Financial Markets, 15(2), 207-232. The author examined in the buy-side institutional analysts and sell-side brokerage analyst performance on stock recommendations. Buy-side uses the stock recommendations, but sell-side do not use that of buy-side. With these recommendations variation, buy side and their sell-side conducts business in the same sell-side recommendations. These changes yield similar returns as sell-side hence the institutional investor's exhibition is not of special skills in comprehending the recommendation quality.\n- A review of the empirical disclosure literature: discussion, Core, J. E. (2001). Journal of Accounting and Economics, 31(1-3), 441-456. Healy and Palepu, J. Account. Econ. (2001). The author talks about the need for empiric exposure reassessment of literature and assumes policies of the firms regarding the exposure that are ascertained within the company by similar management that develops the structure and undertakes incentive provisions. The similarity in the management provides a strong view to literature in addition to the provision of possible justification regarding the reassessment outcome and particular opinion regarding the forecasted study.\n- Factors affecting earnings forecast revisions for the buy-side and sell-side analyst, Williams, P. A., Moyes, G. D., & Park, K. (1996). Accounting Horizons, 10(3), 112. The author illustrates the benefits of the earnings forecasts and the prediction revisions of sell-side analysts as the originator of information against which investors base their decisions regarding the future earnings and firm profitability in addition to investment decisions. Earlier findings also showed the correlations between stock market returns and the analysts' prediction revisions. The study also indicated that the individual investor's dependence on the analysts for their information\n- Do buy-side analysts out-perform the sell-side?, Groysberg, B., Healy, P., Chapman, C., Shanthikumar, D., & Gui, Y. (2007). The study was based on the comparison of the buy-side compared to sell-side performance. The study showed the less optimistic recommendations made by buy-side in large investments than their sell-side counterparts. Less optimism is directly related to their few conflicts of interests. Sell-side recommendations outperform buy-side whose income predictions are optimistic in addition to being falsely stated. Sell side's higher retention of analysts whose performance is wanting partly explains the performance variations in addition to the use of different yardstick in the valuation.\n- The non-linear market impact of large trades: Evidence from buy-side order flow, Bershova, N., & Rakhlin, D. (2013). Quantitative Finance, 13(11), 1759-1778. There was empirical examination conducted in the large institutional orders undertaken in the US equity market. The study was on the price reversion upon trade completion. The finding was that permanent effect is the square root function of the duration of the trade. The trade duration is the total influence seen at the final fill is approximately two-thirds. There was confirmation that post-trade price gets back to a level equivalent to normal pricing environment, Effect decay is of longtime activity estimated by the power law in the initial fewer minutes after completing order and followed by exponential deterioration\n- The stock selection and performance of buy-side analysts, Groysberg, B., Healy, P., Serafeim, G., & Shanthikumar, D. (2013). Management Science, 59(5), 1062-1075. Even though investment companies perform their buy-side study themselves, there is still stock selection and recommendation incentives that they face than their fellow sell-side analysts. The findings in the research were that the buy-side recommendations were less optimistic for larger market capitalization stock and lower variations than their colleagues from the sale side this is in line with the few conflicts of interests they go through besides their preference to liquid stock. The was no variation found to be existing in the performance between buy-side analyst recommendation and those from sell-side upon control of the selection effects.\n- The influence of buy-side analysts on mutual fund trading, Frey, S., & Herbst, P. (2014). Journal of Banking & Finance, 49, 442-458. The facts presented was based on the buy-side analysts trading and performance effects. Buy-side analysts were found to significantly affects trading decisions. Buy-side analysts were found to be more influential than their sell-side counterparts as fund managers followed the recommendations regardless of the control determinants that were put in place. Also, mutual fund traders performance also showed the favorable extraordinary returns of the buy-side.\n- The activities of buy-side analysts and the determinants of their stock recommendations, Brown, L. D., Call, A. C., Clement, M. B., & Sharp, N. Y. (2016). Journal of Accounting and Economics, 62(1), 139-156. The study of 344 buy-side analysts from 181 and performance of 16 comprehensive assessments understand the buy-side analyst's performance, their compensation factors, stock recommendation inputs, their financial reporting quality belief and the importance of sell-side in a buy-side study. The main finding was that there was obvious usefulness of 10-k reports than those quarterly conferences and management provisions for stock recommendations by buy-side. Also,, it was found that sell-side value addition to buy-side is based on the provision of deeper industrial knowledge in addition to reaching company decision makers.\n- Buy-Side and Sell-Side: The Industrial Organization of Information Production in the Securities Industry, Chen, Z. (2004). The study is based on the division of the information generation between buy-side and sell-side companies.

52	best shoes arthritis feet	For arthritic feet, the best shoes should have a lower heel, good arch support, and proper fit with a finger width between the back of the shoe and foot. They should have a square or rounded toe box and rubber soles for cushioning and shock absorption.	['April Articles 2016\nThe plantar fascia is a connective tissue in the heel that stretches across the bottom length of your foot. Plantar fasciitis occurs when the connective tissue becomes inflamed, causing heel pain and discomfort during physical activity. Although the condition is completely treatable, traditional methods can take up to a year to start becoming effective.\nPlantar fasciitis is caused by a number of everyday activities, so understanding the condition is important for managing and treating it. One of the most common causes of plantar fasciitis is excessive running, especially with improper fitting or non-supportive shoes. Too much exercise can lead to the plantar fascia being overworked and overstretched, which can cause tears in the tissue. Along with improper fitting shoes, pronation, the rolling of the feet inward, is a common cause of plantar fasciitis. If not treated properly, the plantar fascia becomes overstretched and starts to tear, causing inflammation.\nDespite the common causes of plantar fasciitis, there are many different treatment options. For less severe cases, conservative home remedies include taking anti-inflammatory drugs to alleviate pain, applying ice packs to the bottom of your foot and heel, slowly stretching and exercising your feet to re-strengthen the tissue, and using orthotic devices are all ways to help manage your plantar fasciitis.\nFor more severe cases, shockwave therapy has become a common solution for plantar fasciitis. Shockwave therapy can effectively break up the tissue on the bottom of your foot which facilitates healing and regeneration.This fights the chronic pain caused by plantar fasciitis. Even if this doesn’t work, surgery is always a final option. Surgery on the tissue itself can be done to permanently correct the issue and stop the inflammation and pain in your heels.\nNo matter what the case may be, consulting your podiatrist is the first and best step to recovery. Even the slightest amount of heel pain could be the first stage of plantar fasciitis. Untreated symptoms can lead to the tearing and overstretching of tissue. Because the tearing of tissue can be compounded if it remains ignored, it canevolve into asevere case. The solution is early detection and early treatment.Talk to your podiatrist about the possibilities of plantar fasciitis if you’re experiencing heel pain.\nAll About Broken Ankles\nBroken ankles are a serious injury that can lead to an inability to walk, function, and also cause a significant amount of pain. A broken ankle is a break in one of the three bones in your body that connect at the ankle joint, the tibia, the fibula, and the talus. The tibia and fibula are your two primary leg bones that connect at the knee, which sit directly upon the talus bone. This is protected by a fibrous membrane that allows for movement in our ankle joint. A broken ankle is usually caused by the foot rolling under or twisting too far, causing one of these three bones to snap.\nA broken ankle is different from an ankle sprain, which occurs when the ligaments are ripped or torn but no bones have been broken. A sprain can still be very severe, causing bruising in the foot and an inability to hold your own weight, much like a broken ankle would. If you’re unable to stand, and suspect that you have a broken ankle, the first thing to do would be to get an immediate x-ray to determine the severity of the break.\nA common cause of broken anklesis when the ankle is rolled over with enough pressure to break the bones. This usually happens during exercise, sports, or other physical activity. Another common cause is a fall or jump from a tall height.\nOne immediate treatment for pain reliefis elevating the feet above your head to reduce blood flow to the injured area. You can also apply ice packs to your ankles to help reduce swelling, redness, inflammation, and pain. After these initial steps, getting a cast and staying off your feet as much as possible will aid in the recovery of the broken ankle.The less movement and stress the ankle has to endure, the more complete it will heal.A doctor can determine if surgery is needed in order to heal correctly. In these cases, an operation may be the only option to ensure the ability to walk properly again, followed by physical therapy and rehabilitation.\nIt is highly important to determine if surgery is needed early on, because a broken ankle can become much more severe than you realize. If not professionally treated, the broken ankle will inhibit your walking, daily functioning, and produce a large amount of pain. Treating your broken ankle early on will help prevent further damage to it.\nArthritic Foot Care\nDuring your lifetime, you will probably walk about 75,000 miles, which is quite a lot of stress to put on your feet. As you get older, the 26 bones and 30 joints in your body will lose flexibility and elasticity.Your foot’s natural shock absorbers will wear down as well. Having arthritis added to this mix only makes matters worse. Your joints will become distorted and inflamed, which is why arthritic foot care needs to be something to think about every day.\nWhen dealing with arthritis, having additional foot complications, such as bunions, hammertoes, or neuroma, can be a serious detriment. To avoid these, buy well-fitting shoes with a lower heel and good support. Arthritis causes you to lose your arch, so having shoes with good arch support is also highly recommended.\nAside from getting good arch support, the shoes need to fit comfortably and properly as well. A good place to start is by leaving a finger width between the back of the shoe and your foot to gauge proper size. It is also helpful to have a square or rounded toe box in the front to provide even more comfort. Another thing to look for is a rubber sole that can provide a cushion and absorb shock as you walk. This adds flexibility to the ball of your foot when you push off your heel to walk.\nExercise is another key aspect of arthritic foot care. Exercise not only strengthens and stretches your muscles and joints, but helps to prevent further injury and pain as well. Stretching the Achilles tendon, the tendon located in the back of your heel, will give you added mobility and reduce pain due to stress. Another thing you can do is massage your feet, kneading the ball of your foot as well as your toes from top to bottom.\nStretching the Achilles tendon is a simple exercise that you can do at home anytime. Lean against the wall with your palms flat against the surface while placing one foot forward, towards the wall, and one foot behind you. Bend your forward knee towards the wall while keeping your back knee locked straight, and make sure both your heels are completely touching the ground at all times. This will stretch your Achilles tendon and calf muscles as well. You will feel the stretch almost immediately. You can also stretch your toes in a couple ways. One involves taking a rubber band and wrapping it around both your big toes while your heels remain together. Then, pull them apart to stretch your big toe. You can also place a rubber band around all the toes of one of your feet. Then, try to separate each individual toe, stretching them all.\nA final step you can take to help your arthritis is taking non-steroid, non-inflammatory drugs or topical medicines with capsaicin. Unfortunately, there is no complete way to remove all of your arthritic pain.However, following some of this advice can go a long way in staying as pain-free as possible.\nIn most cases, foot surgery is often chosen as the last-available option for conditions that have otherwise been unsuccessfully treated. Surgery may be necessary for several reasons, including the removal of foot deformities (e.g. bone spurs or bunions), arthritis problems, reconstruction due to injury, and congenital malformations (e.g. club foot or flat feet). Regardless of one’s age, foot surgery may be the only successful option for treatment for certain conditions.\nThe type of surgery one undergoes depends on the type of foot condition the patient has. For the removal of a growth, such as a bunion, a bunionectomy is necessary. If the bones in the feet need to be realigned or fused together, a surgical fusion of the foot is needed. For pain or nerve issues, a patient may require surgery in which the tissues surrounding the painful nerve are removed. Initially, less invasive treatments are generally attempted; surgery is often the last measure taken if other treatments are unsuccessful.\nWhile in many cases surgery is often deemed as the final resort, choosing surgery comes with certain benefits. The associated pain experienced in relation to the particular condition is often relieved with surgery, allowing patients to resume daily activities. The greatest benefit, however, is that surgery generally eliminates the problem immediately.\nPodiatry history has shown that foot treatments continue to evolve over time. In the field of foot surgery, endoscopic surgery is just one of the many advancements. As technology vastly improves, so will the various techniques in foot surgery, which already require smaller and smaller incisions with the use of better and more efficient tools. Thanks to such innovations, surgery is no longer as invasive as it was in the past, allowing for much faster and easier recoveries.']	['<urn:uuid:9b7938eb-21b1-4ef4-8549-015f039c5cc1>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	4	46	1572
53	What receptor does HIV use to enter cells?	HIV uses the CD4 antigen found on T-helper cells as a high-affinity receptor molecule for entry.	['The Native Antigen Company manufacturers Retrovirus receptors using state-of-the-art expression and purification techniques. Custom preparation of recombinant and native proteins for a broad range of disease states is also available upon request.\nRetrovirus Receptors Background\nRetroviruses comprise a large and diverse family of enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses (7-12 kb ssRNA[+] genome) that replicate in a host cell through the process of reverse transcription, after gaining entry by a variety of host-encoded retrovirus receptors. The different genuses of retrovirus virions have diverse morphology, but they are defined by common taxonomic denominators, including structure, composition and replicative properties (Coffin 1992, 1996). Retroviridae is subdivided into Orthoretrovirinae and Spumaretrovirinae. Retroviruses are further subdivided into seven groups defined by evolutionary relatedness, each with the taxonomic rank of genus.\nWithin Orthoretrovirinae the various genus are;\n- Alpharetrovirus (Rous sarcoma virus, avian sarcoma leukosis virus)\n- Betaretrovirus (Mouse mammary tumor virus, Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus)\n- Gammaretrovirus (murine leukemia virus, Abelson murine leukemia virus, Friend virus, koala retrovirus, xenotropic murine leukemia-related virus)\n- Deltaretrovirus (Human/primate T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) types 1–4, simian T-lymphotropic virus types 1–4, Bovine leukemia virus)\n- Epsilonretrovirus (Walleye epidermal hyperplasia virus)\n- Lentivirus (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV), feline immunodeficiency virus, puma lentiviruses, bovine immunodeficiency virus, caprine arthritis encephalitis virus, visna virus) are present.\nWithin Spumaretrovirinae only one genus is present;\n- Spumavirus (simian foamy virus, human foamy virus)\nFive of these groups represent retroviruses with oncogenic potential (oncoviruses), and the other two groups are the lentiviruses and the spumaviruses. They are classified into two types, simple and complex, based on their RNA genome structure: the RNA genome of simple retrovirus contains only three essential genes, gag, pol, and env whereas that of complex retrovirus contains additional gene(s). All oncogenic members except the human T-cell leukemia virus–bovine leukemia virus (HTLV-BLV) genus are simple retroviruses. HTLV-BLV and the lentiviruses and spumaviruses are complex.\nMost retroviruses infect dividing cells during mitosis, when the chromatin is exposed to the cytoplasm. However, the genus of Lentiviruses, including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have evolved to infect non-dividing cells. Retrovirus infection requires entry into host cells, reverse transcription, integration, expression of viral genes, and production of viral particles. At each step, retroviruses utilize the host machinery for their propagation.\nThe retrovirus particle is spherical and 80-100 nm in diameter. It consists of the inner core and the outer envelope. The core contains two copies of a plus strand of the viral RNA genome and viral proteins, such as capsid (encoded by gag) and reverse transcriptase (encoded by pol), whereas the envelope consists of the viral coat proteins (encoded by env) and the lipid bilayer derived from the host cells.\nRetroviruses enter the host cell through the attachment of their surface glycoproteins to specific plasma membrane receptors, which leads to fusion of virus and cell membranes. The virus envelope consists of lipids that are obtained from the host plasma membrane during the budding process including glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 in the case of HIV. The envelope glycoprotein complex of retroviruses includes two polypeptides, an external, glycosylated hydrophilic polypeptide (SU) and a membrane-spanning protein (TM), that together form an oligomeric knob or knobbed spike on the surface of the virion. Both polypeptides are encoded by the env gene and are synthesized in the form of a polyprotein precursor that is proteolytically cleaved during its transport to the surface of the cell. The SU domain binds to a specific receptor molecule on the target cell, which appears to activate the membrane fusion-inducing potential of the TM protein and the viral and cell membranes then fuse. Activation of the fusion potential of the TM protein requires a functional association between the receptor and SU and it is likely that several glycoprotein/receptor oligomers must associate within the plane of the membrane for an effective “fusion-pore” to form. The specificity of the SU/receptor interaction defines the host range and tissue tropism of a retrovirus; viral particles lacking envelope glycoproteins are non-infectious, and cells lacking a receptor are nonpermissive for viral entry. Viruses may bind weakly but in the absence of a specific receptor molecule, they are unable to initiate the infection process.\nThe receptors for retroviral entry that have been identified and characterized to date appear to be distinct for the different major viral subgroups; for example, the CD4 antigen found on T-helper cells is a high-affinity receptor molecule for HIV and SIV whereas murine and feline leukemia viruses require three different membrane transporter molecules.\nRetroviral infections can lead to diseases such as cancer and immunodeficiency in many species, including humans. In addition, retroviruses are used as gene delivery vehicles because the DNA form of the viral genome becomes an integrated part of the host cell genome. Therefore, there is considerable interest in defining the functional interactions between retroviral envelope proteins and retrovirus receptors.\n- Coffin J.M. 1992a.

54	cardiac arrest workplace survival statistics first aid	According to statistics, there are approximately 10,000 cardiac arrests in the workplace each year in the United States. When bystanders provide effective CPR in the first few minutes of cardiac arrest, it can increase the chances of survival by two to three times. Additionally, for each minute that defibrillation is delayed, the chance of survival is reduced by approximately 10%.	['4 Important First Aid/CPR/AED Questions Answered\nDid you know that there are about 10,000 cardiac arrests in the workplace each year in the United States? Effective CPR provided by a bystander in the first few minutes of cardiac arrest can increase the chances of survival by two to three times.\nResponding to a medical emergency is something that all employers need to plan for. Regardless of your industry or company size, first aid training is beneficial to your workplace. Under most circumstances, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) requires employers to have one or more people certified to perform first aid, CPR, and automated external defibrillator (AED) response. Here we answer some common yet important questions.\nAm I required to have my employees certified to perform first aid, CPR, and use an AED?\nOSHA requires that in the absence of an infirmary, clinic, or hospital in near proximity to the workplace which is used for the treatment of all injured employees, a person or persons shall be adequately trained to render first aid under 29 CFR 1910.151. The average response time for first responders to arrive once 911 is called is between 8-12 minutes. In a cardiac event, for each minute defibrillation is delayed, the chance of survival is reduced by approximately 10%. For this reason, it is recommended that all workplaces have employees certified in first aid, CPR, and AED response on each work shift.\nHow many employees should be trained?\nThis number depends on the size of your facility, its layout, and how many shifts your facility works. There should be at least a primary and a back-up responder on each shift, with additional responders to ensure a quick response time in all work areas. In the event of a cardiac event, first aid/CPR/AED-certified employees should be able to collect their response equipment and access the injured employee within 3 minutes.\nHow do my employees become certified?\nThere are several ways to obtain certification. Employees can go offsite for a certification course, or the more preferred method is to have a Certified First Aid/CPR/AED trainer come on site to certify your team. By having a trainer on site, employees do not need to travel from your facility, their time away from the job is kept to a minimum, and employees are more willing to volunteer to be certified. Onsite trainings can certify up to 14 employees per 5-hour training session.\nWhat else do I need for my first aid/CPR/AED response program?\nEmployers must designate an employee responsible for maintaining the company’s emergency response program. This designated person can be an EHS manager, a facilities manager, or a consultant. Maintaining a first aid/CPR/AED response program involves a few key components.\n- Employee Training: A sufficient number of employees must be trained. This should include multiple employees on each work shift. Employees must be retrained every 2 years.\n- First Aid Kit: First aid kits must be stocked and placed in convenient locations for all employees to access. OSHA advises that employers follow the ANSI Z308.1-2015 standard for first aid kit supplies. The ANSI standard advises that first aid kits contain burn dressings, exam gloves, cold packs, and a number of other pieces of helpful supplies. The employer is responsible for keeping the kits stocked and ensuring that supplies have not expired.\n- AED: This piece of life-saving equipment can be rented or purchased and should be placed in a location accessible to all employees. Employers must ensure that AEDs are inspected regularly and must replace expired batteries and pads as necessary.\n- Response: Employees should know how to respond if they are injured. This involves posting a list of the first aid/CPR/AED-certified employees in a visible location, and training all employees on injury response (initiating first aid/CPR/AED response, notifying management, incident response, documentation, and follow up).\n- Documentation: This includes documentation of trained employees, incident investigation, OSHA logs, and the Emergency Response SOP. The SOP should designate responsibilities, inspection content and frequency, emergency response procedures for common emergencies, and follow-up actions.\nEnsure your employees are properly trained so that, in the event of a workplace medical emergency, they can minimize the harm.

55	how improve experiment results research lab	To improve experimental results in research, it's beneficial to employ design space exploration and design-of-experiment (DOE) studies. DOE involves systematically evaluating an analysis model multiple times with different variable values to identify which factors most affect the design. This process uses response surface models (RSM) to visualize relationships between variables. Additionally, instead of fixing experiment sizes, it's advantageous to evaluate multiple design sizes and compare their performance. This allows for better resource management in sequential experimentation, helping save resources for later experiments or allocating more resources early when needed for better understanding. The comparison of different design sizes can be evaluated based on multiple criteria including statistical power, parameter estimation independence, and prediction accuracy in different regions of the design space.	['Bruce Jenkins • President • Ora ResearchDesign optimization is a powerful technology you can use to automate the search for solutions to engineering problems. But before optimizing a chosen design, it can be useful to employ design space exploration—a family of quantitative methods that help you gain a better, more complete understanding of a new product’s potential “design space” by discovering which design variables will have the greatest impact on product performance.\nThe numerical methods that underpin design space exploration have been long known—and sometimes applied, when the attendant costs in expertise, time and labor could be justified. What’s changing now is the rapidly maturing generation of software tools transforming these powerful but formerly difficult-to-use methods into practical everyday engineering aids.\nBefore diving into how design space exploration works, how does it relate to design optimization in a product development project? Chris Mattson, director of BYU’s Design Exploration Research Lab, offered this perspective: “Design optimization depends on a well-posed optimization problem formulation, which generally includes (i) a well-defined objective function, (ii) inequality and equality constraints, and (iii) the expression of stakeholder preference, all of which are likely to be multidisciplinary in nature. In an arguably real way, such a problem formulation predefines the optimum solution, thereby allowing the mathematical rigor of the optimization to lead to the optimum design by an iterative, computational search.”\n“Design exploration, on the other hand, assumes that the optimal design is initially unknown and initially uncharacterizable,” Mattson continued. “The process of design exploration discovers design conditions and little by little (often through some form of experimentation) characterizes what an optimal design looks like. Once this is known, the final solution can then be found through a convergent design optimization algorithm.”\nThe essential quantitative method for design space exploration is design-of-experiment (DOE) studies. In a DOE study, an analysis model is automatically evaluated multiple times, with the design variables set to different values in each iteration. The results identify which variable(s) affect the design the most, and which the least. This information allows variables that are not important to be ignored in subsequent phases of the design process, or set to values that are most convenient or least costly.\nConcretely, a designed experiment is a structured set of tests of a system or process. Integral to a designed experiment are response(s), factor(s) and a model.\nA response is a measurable result—fuel mileage (automotive), deposition rate (semiconductor), reaction yield (chemical process).\nA factor is any variable that the experimenter judges may affect a response of interest. Common factor types include continuous (may take any value on an interval, for example, octane rating), categorical (having a discrete number of levels, such as a specific company or brand) and blocking (categorical, but not generally reproducible; an example is automobile driver-to-driver variability).\nA model is a mathematical surrogate for the system or process.\nThe experiment consists of exercising the model across some range of values assigned to the defined factors.\nIn deciding what values to use—more precisely, in deciding on a statistical strategy for selecting values—the goal is to achieve coverage of the design space that will yield maximum information about its characteristics with least experimental (computational) effort, and with confidence that the set of points sampled gives a representative picture of the entire design space.\nNumerous statistical sampling methods exist. Which method to use depends on the nature of the problem being studied, and on the resources available—time, computational capacity, and how much is already known about the problem.\nThe results of a DOE sampling process are then used to generate an approximate model of the system being studied, called a response surface model (RSM). The RSM is generated by interpolating between the discrete DOE results to create a continuous surface map or model. The RSM is a convenient and efficient tool for visualizing the design space, examining relationships among design variables and their effects on key responses, and rapidly evaluating design alternatives—all without the need to perform additional expensive CAE evaluations or experiments.\nFiled Under: ALL INDUSTRIES', 'Table 1: Aspects to compare between competing designs\nExperimental design methods\nHow to negotiate experiment size when choosing a design\nIn classes where we learn about design of experiments, the problem is often posed as “Select a design with N runs ….” So it is tempting to think about this as a given constraint in our selection process. However, it can be to our great advantage to think about the size of design as a flexible criterion on which we want to evaluate our choices and make comparisons. In recent years, I have been an active advocate for looking at multiple criteria when examining the appropriateness and desirability of designs for the goals of our experiment.1,2,3\nIt can be to our great advantage to think about the size of design as a flexible criterion on which we want to evaluate our choices and make comparisons.\nClassical designs like factorial and fractional factorial designs for first-order models, and central composite or Box-Behnken designs for second-order models, have long had an important role in design of experiments if we are interested in spherical or cuboidal design spaces and if the size of our design matches the standard sizes. More recently, computer-generated D- or I-optimal designs have become available to allow greater flexibility when the shape of the design space and/or design size are nonstandard. Both of these categories of designs have strengths and weaknesses, so using the Evaluate Design platform in JMP allows careful exploration of important questions such as:\n- What kind of power can I expect from the design?\n- Will I be able to estimate all the terms in my model independently?\n- If the model is misspecified, how will parameter estimates be affected?\n- How well will I be able to predict the response in different regions of the design space?\nUnderstanding these important questions before the experiment is run can save us from running an ineffective experiment that cannot do what we want it to, or allow us to choose between alternatives to match the priorities of our experiment.\nFor many years now, when I have been asked to design an experiment as part of a project, I have created multiple designs that not only included the target design size, but also a couple of choices that are smaller and larger. Since most studies involve questions that cannot be answered with a single experiment, it is valuable to view the management of resources in the context of sequential experimentation. If we can save some resources early in the process, that frees them up for potential later experiments. If we need more resources early to really understand what is going on with our process or product, this can position us to make key decisions and understand the underlying relationship between inputs and outputs. We can then use this knowledge to guide later experiments. Hence, the exploration of multiple design sizes to understand our choices.\nIn JMP, the Compare Designs platform makes these between-design size evaluations easier. Not only can it make comparisons between different design choices of the same size, but it can also provide useful information about different-sized designs. Imagine that you are asked to create an 18-run design to estimate the main effects for seven factors. Constructing the right designs to compare is also easy with the Custom Design and Augment Design platforms. You could use the Custom Design platform in JMP to construct designs with 16, 18 and 20 runs, and perhaps also include a definitive screening design (with a default of 17 runs). Armed with these four designs, we can now consider the impact of design size on their performance. Note that JMP allows comparison of up to three designs in a single window, but it is easy to have two Compare Design windows open with the same base design to allow for easy comparisons of up to five designs. Table 1 describes some questions of interest with the JMP tools that make it easy to assess these aspects of the designs.\nFigures 1 through 3 show a sample of the tools available in JMP for the three (16-, 18- and 20-run) custom designs with the 18-run chosen as the base design. In Figure 1, I have adjusted the different factors to have different sized anticipated coefficients to see the ranges of powers. (Note: These designs are all symmetric with the same power for all effects of the same size.)\nFigure 2 provides one summary of the correlations. You’ll see there are interesting comparisons to consider: The 18-run design has some slightly correlated main effects in the primary model, while the 16-run and 20-run designs have no correlation between any terms in the primary or possible models. It is not uncommon to have some sample sizes that are less suited to good balance and symmetry. The 16-run design has the smallest correlations between all sets of terms considered in Figure 2, but it has slightly less power than the 18- and 20-run designs.\nFigure 3 shows a summary of the overall prediction variance profile across the seven-factor design space.4 In this case, there seems to be a similar reduction in the prediction variance with each increase in sample size. How we value the differences between the designs is dependent on our priorities and our tolerance for different costs.\nOnce we have examined these characteristics of competing designs, we can make the right choice for our particular study. In addition, it will be much easier to defend our choice of design, because we understand what performance is realistic to expect before any resources are spent. If we need to make the case that a larger experiment is needed, this discussion will be concrete and driven by available information. If we are able to suggest a smaller experiment than originally requested, then we may buy leverage for the next experimental problem when perhaps more resources are needed early in the process. Whenever we can translate a fix constraint into a tactical choice made for a justifiable reason, we are going to feel much more comfortable about our choice.\nMany times, the initial resources allocated to the experiment are not sufficient to realistically meet our goals. By exploring alternative design sizes, we can put ourselves into a better negotiation position for getting additional experimental resources. How would you rather state your case: “A bigger experiment would be better,” or “The current experiment is not adequate for the power and prediction variance that we need to be able to answer the questions that the study is tasked to tackle. Here is an experiment that satisfies our needs”? We might not always win that negotiation and be able to increase the size of the design to our desired target, but we are making a compelling, data-driven argument that highlights the consequences and tradeoffs of several alternatives.\n- Lu, L., Anderson-Cook, C.M., Robinson, T.J.

56	How do modern educational approaches combine theoretical principles with practical implementation in creativity and global problem-solving contexts?	Modern education combines theoretical principles like divergent and convergent thinking with practical implementation through research-supported strategies that can be worked into existing curriculum. This is applied through global collaboration projects where students use digital tools to address real-world problems, working with others across the globe while applying both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. The emphasis is on strategies that can be implemented in almost any learning context, with limited adaptation leading to creative growth.	"['IAP BOOK SERIES\nApplied Creativity for Practitioners\nThe topic of creativity is receiving a great deal of attention in education, with interest in both formal and informal settings. From classrooms to afterschool programs, childcare settings to residential summer camps, the importance of creativity is frequently discussed and reinforced.\nYet there is a dearth of research-supported material for practitioners about how to foster creativity in applied settings. Books tend to be either academic in nature or practitioner-focused and devoid of theoretically- and empirically-supported strategies. There is also an odd trend of creativity books becoming longer and longer, which makes them unlikely resources for time-pressed practitioners.\nFrom an enhancement perspective, the trend over the past 25 years has been to encourage educators to rethink their practice regarding creativity, implying that they need to overhaul their practices. And it takes a brave educator to consider redoing all of their curricula and instructional strategies. But the majority of creativity-fostering strategies can be implemented in almost any learning context, with limited tinkering and adaptation leading to creative growth (i.e., improving rather than replacing).\nThe purpose of this series will be to produce short, practitioner-friendly books that directly address key principles from creativity theory and research and provide detailed recommendations for fostering creativity, with an emphasis on strategies that can be worked into existing curriculum and activities.\nThis series could also have wide appeal in other countries, most notably China, where there is a tremendous desire for materials on educating for creativity across a broad range of formal and informal education settings.\nFormat of the Books\nAfter a concise opening chapter that reinforces the importance of creativity and introduces the book, each volume will be organized using 10-12 principles drawn from psychological and educational theory and research. After each principle is described in 1-2 pages, a set of general strategies for applying the principle will be included. To supplement the strategies, specific examples will be provided, perhaps in the form of vignettes drawn from real-life examples, real lesson plans or activity descriptions that have been modified to address the principle, etc. This approach – using theory and research to frame but not dominate the sharing of practical strategies for creativity enhancement – should be appealing to a wide range of practitioners, and at an attractive price point.\nPrinciples could include:\n• Definition of creativity as originality and usefulness\n• Divergent thinking\n• Convergent thinking\n• Creativity as both divergent and convergent thinking\n• The role of problem-finding\n• Working with constraints\n• The role of the creative product\n• Implications of the emerging sociocultural perspective on creativity\n• Group vs. individual creativity\n• The role of modeling\n• Domain/task generality vs. specificity\n• Importance of attitude and role of attitude change\n• Creative personality\n• Creative articulation\n- Contemporary Issues in Accreditation, Assessment, and Program Evaluation Research in Educator Preparation\n- Contemporary Perspectives on Black Homeschooling\n- Contemporary Perspectives on Learning Environments\n- Contemporary Perspectives on Problem-Based Learning\n- Contemporary Perspectives Through Action Research Across Educational Disciplines\n- Current Perspectives on School/University/Community Research\n- Current Research in Rural and Regional Education\n- Journal of Research on Organization in Education\n- Out-of-School-Time STEM Programs for Females: Implications for Research and Practice\n- Research Focus on Education and Sport\n- Research in Life Writing and Education\n- Research, Theory, and Practice Within Academic Affairs\n- Survey Methods in Educational Research\n- Teacher Induction Research, Policy, and Practice: A Global Perspective\n- Theory to Practice: Educational Psychology for Teachers and Teaching', 'Gold Quest-Classroom Collaboration\nThe focus of this Quest is to support global collaboration with other classrooms or projects around the world.\nThe International Society of Technology in Education has identified Problem-Solving and Collaboration as key skills for success in society.\n“A Global Collaborator has the ability to address and potentially solve significant problems in students’ communities and around the world, both independently and in collaboration with others.”\nThis Quest involves classroom-to-classroom collaboration and communication. The goal is to solve an issue or problem of significance with others across the globe. Your classroom will take on a problem and work through a possible solution or solutions. This might also be done with students in smaller groups. You will be investigating possible solutions through collaboration with other students around the globe.\nI Can Statements\n- collaborate with others on a project\n- create a presentation backing it up with research\nGlobal Collaborator: A global collaborator is a student that uses digital tools to connect with others from different backgrounds and cultures to learn and work together.\nDigital Citizen: A digital citizen is a student that recognizes the rights, responsibilities, and opportunities for living, learning and working with others using technology.

57	wild irish salmon fishing ban drift netting	Drift netting at sea for wild Irish salmon was banned in 2006. Since then, wild salmon is only caught through draft net fishing in estuaries during the summer season from May to mid August	['Ireland the Seafood Island\n“You can’t separate the artisan food business in Ireland from our geography… our landscape is at the heart of what we create. What we have in Ireland is wonderful raw material and we have the skills to bring those raw materials on, through husbandry”\nFresh Organic Irish Salmon from Clare Island\nIt’s extremely important to us to source the best quality locally from a sustainable supply. From 1982 when fish stocks were abundant, Frank smoked only wild Irish salmon caught at sea. Since 2006, when drift netting at sea was banned, we have been smoking Irish salmon farmed organically in some of the world’s most remote and untamed sites in the Atlantic Sea, off the west coast of Ireland.\nDraft net wild fish, caught in estuaries with a net shot in a loop from the shore is a centuries old tradition that continues to this day, sustaining fisherman and their families during the short summer season. From May to mid August we buy fish caught by local fishermen in the estuary of the River Lee, County Cork, where quotas are tightly controlled and stocks monitored year on year.\nSustainable Organic Salmon\nAll year round we also source organic salmon farmed in Ireland. Compared to Scotland and Norway, where mass production dominates in still-water loughs and fjords, Ireland’s small, mostly organic farms on the wild Atlantic coast collectively produce a tiny one per cent of Europe’s fresh salmon.\nIrish husbandry and the conditions for deep sea cultivation are amongst the best in the world and from our experience produces the only farmed fish that is good enough for hang smoking. Even with organic fish, there are variations in quality. We buy the finest grade from the most experienced producers, and we are proud of our association with Marine Harvest Ireland.\nStrong currents, the exposed sites of the west coast, and low stocking densities practiced by our suppliers are essential to healthy fish with toned flesh. These conditions also reduce the risk of disease and environmental degradation. The salmon are fed a natural marine and vegetal feed, free from GM products and chemical additives or preservatives, and they are matured for a minimum of three years. The result is non-fatty, flavourful fish with good muscle tone, ideal for hanging.\nWithin a day of harvesting the fish are in the smoke house in Cork being filleted and cured, so they are smoked when as fresh as possible. We use a pure, dry-salt cure which kills any bacteria, flavours the fish and acts as a natural preservative. The sides are then washed and hung in small batches on tenterhooks in the smoke house for as long as they need.\nAnything other than the best quality fish cannot withstand our hanging process. Indeed our method is the litmus test for our raw ingredients. In turn, we are confident that the unique conditions of our smoke house, and our hanging tradition make the fish the very best it can be.\nFor more information, please visit SmokeHouse\nMade Entirely by Hand\nWhen we say hand made, we mean hand made. Experienced people, rather than automated machines, fillet the fish for salting. We do not skin our fish, nor remove the collar bone as these add flavour and are the means by which we hang the salmon. We trim and pin bone by hand, all of which takes time, but which conserves the delicate flesh. We only offer cuts which preserve the natural seals of the smoked salmon sides and are less wasteful. You can see the quality of the fish by the healthiness of its skin and the firmness of its lean flesh.\nSimilar quality simply cannot be achieved with industrially farmed fish pummeled through machines, ultra-trimmed, or sliced and interwoven with plastic.\nIrish Mackerel & Mussels\nOur mackerel are wild, winter fish, caught by trawls in the Atlantic Sea. Crucially they are not feeding which means they are digestible as well as delicious. They are frozen at sea to preserve their freshness as naturally as possible, which also means they are available year-round.\nOur mussels are Irish organic rope grown mussels. They are cooked, shelled smoked and preserved with a flavourful whole-grain mustard vinaigrette.']	['<urn:uuid:4a5b837e-ffa9-49a5-a914-bf2272406076>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	7	34	702
58	tropical deforestation effects global warming climate	Tropical deforestation has significant effects on both global warming and climate. It accounts for approximately 10% of global warming emissions. The impact extends beyond carbon emissions, as rainforests play a vital role in regulating world climate and are involved in nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon cycles. They supply over 20% of the planet's oxygen while storing carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide greenhouse gases.	"['2 Objectives List three characteristics of tropical rain forests.

top foliage layer in a forest where the trees extend above surrounding treesTrees in this layer grow and emerge into direct sunlight reaching heights of 60 to 70 m and can measure up to 5 m aroundAnimals such as eagles, bats, monkeys, and snakes live in the emergent layer\n12 Layers of the Rain Forest Canopy - layers of treetops that shade the forest floor, and is considered to be the primary layer of the rain forestThe tall trees, more than 30 m tall, form a dense layer that absorbs up to 95 percent of the sunlightThe canopy can be split into and upper canopy and lower canopy with the lower canopy receiving less of the sunlight\n13 Layers of the Rain Forest Epiphytes - plants that use another plant for support but not for nourishment, and are located on high trees in the canopyMost animals that live in the rain forest live in the canopy because they depend on the abundant flowers and fruits that grow there12 month growing seasoncm precipitation each year\n14 Layers of the Rain Forest Understory -

60	What does a construction site need for safety both workers and public?	Construction sites require several safety measures to protect both workers and the public. They must have hoarding construction - a perimeter boundary that shields workers from debris and prevents public access to potential risks. The hoarding must be thick, durable, and have secured gates at access points. Additionally, according to OSHA standards, workers must be provided with personal protective equipment including eye, face, head protection, and safety belts when working at heights. For areas near water, workers need Coast Guard-approved life jackets and ring buoys must be readily available.	['Safety is not an option or a privilege for anyone. You have all the right to be physically protected or at least warned for any possible danger. The law mandates an assessment of any potential risk in an environment that may cause any form of tragedy or mishap to the general public. Establishment sites, some research laboratories, and other places of work have specific health and safety regulations. So, what are some of the practices that promote safety to people like you? Specifically, how do construction companies ensure safety not just for the people, but also for their employees or workers?\nHave you ever seen a barrier that separates a construction site from a local area? Have you noticed those panels covered by tarpaulins that advertise something about the building? Those are called hoardings. And technically, hoarding construction is essential for any construction process.\nWhat exactly is a hoarding construction?\nHoarding serves as a perimeter boundary that shields construction workers from debris and prevents them from being distracted by the view of the surrounding area. At the same time, it protects the public from the construction site’s potential risks. It should be thick and durable to avoid accidents that may arise near the construction area. Hoardings also provide access to authorized personnel only. Trespassing is prohibited in all construction sites.\nTry to observe if there are ongoing building constructions on your way home. You will see that there is a fence-like hoarding construction board that surrounds the entire site, which comprises metal or wood. You might also notice that there are images, texts, and even graphics in it too. It is a smart marketing move for people to remember what it would look like when the construction is over, right? Hoarding construction boards can be taken advantage of by marketing specialists for brand awareness and local advertisement. It is the best way to promote who is responsible for the site as it is most likely situated in a prime location.\nThings about hoarding constructions that you should know\nMaybe you might have ignored the presence of a certain construction site when you walked past it. You are confident that the authorities have ensured its safety. But some vulnerable individuals are paranoid of falling debris or unstable scaffoldings. So there are some steps that construction companies consider in site hoarding. Principal contractors ensure that the hoardings will not obstruct the normal activities of the people who pass by and prevent them from trying to view the site.\nThey also use warning tapes or barricades to highlight the hazard posts in the area. You should already know that unauthorized entry to the site is prohibited. Those hoardings have secured gates at access points that only the contractors can control. Even in the presence of secured hoardings surrounding the site, contractors also operate additional safety procedures to make sure that objects, materials, and tools will not fall beyond the boundary. They use toe boards, brick guards, and netting to avoid debris falling out of the hoardings that can jeopardize anyone’s safety.\nSince public protection should be the topmost priority of construction companies and site managers, compliance with health and safety regulations is part of their responsibilities that they must take seriously.

61	arctic climate shifts marine ecosystem impacts	The shift from Arctic to sub-Arctic conditions has caused significant ecosystem changes. In the Bering Sea, there was a major ecosystem reorganization following the late-1970s temperature shift, with pollock biomass increasing by 400% while cold-water species like Greenland turbot decreased by over 80%. More recently, young seals are increasingly affected, with studies showing higher stranding rates of young harp seals due to declining sea ice, while their genetic diversity remains unaffected by these environmental changes.	"[""Current State of the Bering Sea\n|Fig 2. (a) Air temperature at St. Paul Island and (b) sea ice concentration in the southern Bering Sea|\nThe Bering Sea is one of the major Large Marine Ecosystems in the world (fig 1); fisheries from Alaska represent half of the marine harvest in United States waters. The Bering Sea is also home to large bird and marine mammal populations. The climate and ecosystem of the Bering Sea has changed over the previous fifty years. There are two shifts in climate associated with increased warm temperatures and other factors, the first in the late 1970s and again around 2000. There was a major ecosystem reorganization following the late-1970s shift. These changes represent a transition from primarily cold Arctic ecosystems earlier in the 20th century, dominated by sea ice, to sub-Arctic conditions.\nThe record of annual surface air temperature on St. Paul Island in the southeastern Bering Sea beginning in 1916 shows the warm temperatures after 1976, with a short period of warm temperatures in the late 1930. Figure 2 (a) shows warm temperature anomalies at St. Paul Island for the previous 15 years. Summer temperatures at Nome inferred from vegetation records indicate generally cold temperatures from 1800 to the 1970s. Ocean temperatures for the previous decade (Fig 3) from an oceanographic mooring (M2, Fig.4) show a shift toward warmer temperature of 2 deg C around 2000. Of particular importance is that recent winter temperatures are above the freezing point, indicating no or little sea ice in the southeastern Bering Sea for the previous four years (Fig 2 (b)).\nFig 3. Vertically averaged ocean temperature at the Mooring 2 (M2) location.\nFrom NOAA FOCI program.\n|Fig 4. Oceanographic mooring in the Bering Sea at the M2 location during the 1990's.|\n|The biomass of pollock, a major commercial fishery, increase by 400 % following the late-1970s climate shift (fig.5) and has generally remained high at 10 million metric tons, an enormous amount compared with many other fisheries. Other species have decreased in the last 25 years; Greenland turbot which favors cold, near bottom waters dropped in biomass by over 80 %. Lack of sea ice should favor biological productivity in the upper ocean compared to near bottom species. The reduction in snow crab in the last 5 years is in part thought to be due to a combination of warmer temperatures and decreased bottom productivity (fig.6). Marine mammals may also be affected by climate. There was a major decrease in fur seal pups born on St. Paul Island after the late 1970s and again in the last four years (fig. 7). There is some indication of increases in fin and humpback whales in the late 1990s compared to earlier decades.|\n|Fig 5. Bering Sea Pollock. Diamonds indicate biomass, and vertical bars indicate recruits to the population each year. From the NOAA/NMFS SAFE report.|\n|Fig 6. Biomass of eastern. Bering Sea crab.

Error bars are approximate 95% confidence intervals. From NOAA NMFS AFSC||Northern fur seal Callorhinus ursinus. From the NOAA Photo Library.|\nChanges are also seen in the northern Bering Sea. Native peoples noted a shift away from Arctic conditions after 1976 with more variable timing of seasonal changes and a reduction in the quality of sea ice for hunting activities. Productivity and biomass of bottom species have decreased since 1998 and the dominant species of clam has shifted. Gray whales which were found south of Bering Strait in the 1980s were found north of the Strait in 2002.\nWill such changes away from Arctic conditions continue? In the past, the Bering Sea was known for large differences in weather conditions from year-to-year. Change in the last five years is characterized by the persistence in warm ocean temperatures and lack of sea ice in the southern Bering Sea. Without sea ice, the ocean can absorb more solar energy and provides resistance to ice formation in the following winter. There may be additional warm ocean temperatures brought by currents from the Gulf of Alaska. The changes in the Bering Sea are part of a large regional climate change from Siberia eastward to northern Canada. Thus, while it is impossible to predict future climate, the balance of the evidence suggests a continuation of current conditions.\nFind more information (references and websites):"", 'Harp Seals Abandoning Their Pups Thanks To Climate Change\nLee Rannals for redOrbit.com – Your Universe Online\nDuke University scientists have determined that young harp seals off the eastern coast of Canada are at a greater risk of getting stranded than adult seals due to climate change.\nResearchers wrote in the open-access journal PLOS ONE that declining sea ice is leaving baby harp seals stranded in greater numbers.\n“Stranding rates for the region’s adult seals have generally not gone up as sea ice cover has declined; it’s the young-of-the-year animals who are stranding (those less than one year old),” said David Johnston, a research scientist at Duke’s Nicholas School of the Environment. “And it’s not just the weakest pups – those with low genetic diversity and presumably lower ability to adapt to environmental changes – that are stranding. It appears genetic fitness has little effect on this.”\nHe said that harp seals rely on stable winter sea ice as a safe platform to give birth and nurse their young until the pups can go off on their own. However, in years with light ice cover, younger seals are being left to fend for themselves before they’re ready.\nJohnston and his colleagues expanded on a study published last year that found seasonal ice cover in all four harp seal breeding regions has declined by up to six percent since 1979. The team compared winter ice from 1992 to 2010 in a region off Canada’s east coast with yearly reports of dead harp seal strandings along the US northeast coast that were grouped by gender and estimated age of the seal.\nAccording to the latest analysis, in years when ice cover was reduced, stranding rates for younger seals rose sharply, even though stranding rates of adult seals remained relatively stable. The team also compared DNA samples from 106 harp seals that had been stranded ashore with those from seals that had been caught by fishing boats in the region during the same period.\n“We used measures of genetic diversity to determine if the dead seals that came ashore were less fit than the presumably healthy ones that had been caught by fishermen, but found no difference,” said Thomas Schultz, director of Duke’s Marine Conservation Molecular Facility. “The stranded animals appear to have come from a genetically diverse population, and we have no evidence to suggest that genetic fitness played a role in their deaths.”\nThe study found that male seals were stranded more frequently than females during the study period, and that this relationship was strongest during light ice years.\n“Our findings demonstrate that sea ice cover and demographic factors have a greater influence on harp seal stranding rates than genetic diversity,” said Brianne Soulen, who co-led the study while she was a master’s degree student in marine ecology at Duke.\nKristina Cammen, a Duke PhD student who also co-led the study, said this study provided more context for how climate change is affecting younger animals during a crucial part of their life.']"	['<urn:uuid:aa2cd2cf-5919-4ca5-8e98-7264ec48aade>', '<urn:uuid:4e019bff-6f29-45b7-aa5f-0db677a4cf9d>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	6	75	1238
62	natural healing methods muscles tension anxiety medical studies	Studies have shown that natural healing approaches like Post-isometric relaxation (PIR) and biofeedback are effective for treating both muscle tension and anxiety. PIR works by using controlled muscle contractions followed by passive stretching, stimulating the Golgi organ to relax affected muscles. For anxiety treatment, both EMG and alpha-EEG biofeedback combined with relaxation sessions have demonstrated significant effectiveness, showing improved galvanic skin resistance and decreased anxiety levels. These methods work because the body functions as a unified system where physical and mental health are interconnected.	['Post-Isometric relaxation relates to the effect of subsequent relaxation, experienced by a muscle, or group of muscles, after brief periods, during which an isometric contraction is performed.When a muscle is isometrically contracted, its antagonist will be inhibited, and will relax immediately following this. Thus, the antagonist of a shortened muscle, or group of muscles, may be isometrically contracted, in order to achieve a degree of ease and additional movement in the shortened tissues. Shortening of muscle is a self-perpetuating phenomenon, the muscle is incapable of returning to a normal resting length as long as this continues. Whilst the effective length of the muscle is thus shortened, it is nevertheless capable of shortening further. The pain factor seems related to its inability thereafter, to be restored to its anatomically desirable length. The conclusion is that much joint restriction is a result of muscular tightness and shortening.\nDamage to any muscle results in the patient either (1) compensating for the damaged muscle by retraining other muscles to perform the same motion, or (2) changing the motion drastically in order to reduce the work required of the damaged muscle (Lieber 1992).\nThe health of any joint is dependent upon a balance in the strength of its opposing muscles. If for any reason a flexor group loses part, or all of its function, its opposing extensor group will draw the joint into a hyperextended position, with abnormal stress on the joint margins. Lack of attention to the muscular component of joints in general, and spinal joints in particular, results in frequent inappropriate treatment of the joints thus affected. Correct understanding of the role of the supporting musculature would frequently lead to normalization of these tissues, without the need for heroic manipulative efforts.\nWhere is damage to the soft or hard tissues of a joint a factor?\nIn such cases the periarticular and osteophyte changes, all too apparent in degenerative conditions, are the major limiting factor in joint restrictions. If, due to injury, inflammatory processes occur as a more serious evolution takes place, as inflammatory exudate triggers the process of contracture, resulting in shortening of connective tissue. This means that following injury, two separate processes may be occurring simultaneously: scar tissue development in the traumatized tissues and also fibrosis in the surrounding tissues. In both situations, however, Postisometric relaxation may be useful, although more so where muscle shortening is the primary factor.\nHealthy, well-coordinated muscles receive and respond to a multitude of signals from the nervous system, providing the opportunity for coherent movement. When, through overuse, misuse, abuse, disuse, disease or trauma, the smooth interaction between the nervous, circulatory and musculoskeletal systems is disturbed, movement becomes difficult, restricted, commonly painful and sometimes impossible. Dysfunctional patterns affecting the musculoskeletal system which emerge from such a background lead to compensatory adaptations and a need for therapeutic, rehabilitative and / or educational interventions.\nThe use of both neuro-muscular technique and muscle energy technique, is indicated in such a situation, as a means of breaking the cycle and, initially, relaxing the contracted muscles.\nThe body is a unit; all parts function in the context of the entire organism. Disease is a reaction of the organism as a whole. Abnormal structure or function in one part exerts abnormal influence on other parts and, therefore, on the total body economy. The organism has the inherent capacity to defend itself, to repair itself, and to resist serious upsets in external impact.\nPost-Isometric Myorelaxation (PIR)\nPost isometric relaxation (PIR) techniques consist of isometric tension for 15-25 seconds followed by passive stretching. The idea of PIR is such that at the time of isometric constriction, unaffected parts of the same muscle stretch pathologically affected parts. Post isometric stretching stimulates Golgi organ, which, in turn, additionally relaxes the affected muscle. This method, along with trigger points therapy, muscular mobilization and fascia release has significant healing power. I would also like to point out that all methods that I mentioned above, are equally important in treatment of muscular pathologies and must be part of comprehensive treatment. PIR methods have many possible variations that will affect the results. For example, the muscle length at starting position; the effort of the client or therapist; the duration of the contraction; whether the contraction is pulsed or single; the number of repetitions of the contraction; whether the position changes with each repetition, i.e. moving to tissue tension; the direction of effort, i.e. whether it is an eccentric or concentric contraction; client breathing and eye movements in the direction of the force; type of resistance, i.e. gravity, therapist or immovable object. These variables need to be combined and controlled depending on the particular needs of the case.\nThe method gives immediate pain relief in 94%, lasting pain relief in 63%, as well as lasting relief of point tenderness in 23% of the sites treated.(Myofascial pain: relief by post-isometric relaxation, Lewit K, Simons DG, Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 1984 Aug;65(8):452-6) Pain was relieved in both the muscle itself and at tender insertion points. The treatment of muscular pathologies is one of the most difficult challenges for healthcare practitioners. The difficulties that health-care professionals face is due to the fact that no physical therapy equipment or muscular relaxation and anti-inflammatory medication can cause energy balance within pathologically hypertonic muscles.\nReferences: L.

All treatments resulted in reductions of STAI-Trait Anxiety and psychophysiologic symptoms on the Psychosomatic Symptom Checklist. Self-reported decrease in anxiety was maintained 6 weeks after treatment. In addition, subjects receiving alpha-increase biofeedback showed significant reduction in heart rate reactivity to stressors in a psychophysiological testing session.\nAfsaneh Moradi, Farzaneh Pouladi, Nooshin Pishva, Bagher Razaei, Maliheh Torshabi, Zahra Alam Mehrjerdi\nThis study examined the effect of neurofeedback in two anxiety disorder patients. They calculated the patients’ scores in each of the nine symptom dimensions: somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, psychotics, and paranoid ideation. The patients were tested before and after a 10 week treatment of neurofeedback, as well as one year after the treatment. They found that all nine of the anxiety symptoms areas showed significant improvement, and these improvements were maintained at the one year follow up. The drawbacks to this study is that there were no controls or placebos. However, the results are encouraging, and further research should be done.\nEun-Jin Cheon, Bon-Hoon Koo, Wan-Seok Seo, Jun-Yeob Lee, Joong-Hyeon Choi, Shin-Ho Song\nThis study examines the effects of neurofeedback on adult psychiatric patients. 77 people participated, with diagnoses including depression, anxiety disorders, sleep disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and many others. They were given varying amounts of neurofeedback treatments, ranging from less than 5 sessions to greater than 20. Their neurofeedback treatments were specialized to the specific needs of their diseases. The effectiveness of this treatment was based on the change in CGI score and Hill-Castro Checklist Score. The average difference of pre vs. post CGI scores was 1.11, corresponding to a statistically significant decrease in symptom severity. According to the Hill-Castro Checklist score, the patients exhibited improvements in depression, anxiety, self-esteem, hostility, attention, and hyperactivity. The importance of this study is that it showed neurofeedback can work across a variety of psychiatric disorders. However, there are limitations in that there wasn’t a control group, so further research needs to be done in this subject.\nHitanshu Agnihotri, Maman Paul, and Jaspal Singh Sandhu\nThis study examined the efficacy of relaxation biofeedback training for treating generalized anxiety. The experiment divided 45 participants into 3 groups: a control group, a group treated with electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback training, and a third group treated with alpha-EEG biofeedback training. Patients in all three groups practiced relaxation for 25 minutes per day for 12 days. Patients in the biofeedback treatment groups underwent 35 minutes of biofeedback training in addition to the relaxation sessions for the 12 treatment days. Measurements for all participants were taken prior to treatment and two weeks after completion of treatment.\nThe results indicated that both EMG and alpha-EEG biofeedback training were more effective in treating generalized anxiety disorder. Both biofeedback training groups had a significantly increased galvanic skin resistance after treatment when compared to the control group. The biofeedback treatment groups also had a significant decrease in state anxiety and trait anxiety tests. The efficacy of EEG biofeedback training in treating anxiety may be attributed to its operant conditioning effects and ability to relieve cognitive tension.']	['<urn:uuid:ce63fd10-baf9-4740-ab1b-ba2d7aab8c9b>', '<urn:uuid:0f817767-a994-40bb-b913-39f386cf02be>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	8	84	1436
63	flint knapping safety concerns silica dust protection	Flint knapping requires safety measures due to sharp flying flakes and silica dust. For protection, workers need safety glasses, gloves, shoes, sturdy pants, and must work in well-ventilated areas to avoid breathing dust. Additionally, since silica dust is 100 times smaller than sand and can cause severe respiratory diseases including silicosis, lung cancer, and COPD, proper respiratory protection like N95 respirators, PAPRs, or SARs is essential for filtering out dangerous particles.	['By Jason Knight\nFlint knapping is the age-old art of making arrowheads and other edged stone tools. Hunter-gatherers relied upon this key wilderness survival skill to create important tools and hunting implements. Many people continue to practice the skill today, including traditional bowyers, experimental archaeologists, and primitive skills enthusiasts.\nAt its most basic level, flint knapping consists of: breaking open a piece of parent material (called a core); striking flakes off of that core; and then shaping those flakes into the intended tool.\nIn general, the process of making arrowheads includes the following primary concepts:\nBecause flint knapping includes breaking apart rocks with force, where sharp flakes can fly off in any direction, it is very important to wear safety glasses. Gloves, shoes, and sturdy pants are also highly recommended. It is also important to flint-knap in a place where you can easily catch the sharp flakes that will fall to the ground (so that they are not accidentally stepped-on). You can put down a tarp or sweep up afterwards. Also, use a well-ventilated area, so not to breathe the dust created by breaking rocks.\nWhen it comes to the ethics of flint knapping, the primary concern is to be mindful of the archaeological record. To an archaeologist, piles of flaked stone (debitage) can indicate the presence of an ancient village or camp. To prevent your work from being confused as archaeological evidence, always add a penny or two to your pile of debitage and be sure to sign and date your completed work with a diamond-tipped pen.\nThe best stones for making arrowheads include flint, chert, obsidian, jasper, quartzite and other stones that are somewhat brittle and have a fine-grained, uniform texture that is free of cracks, fissures, and fractures. Glass and porcelain can also be used. You can also tap the stone and listen to the pitch. Stones that produce a higher pitch when tapped are generally better for knapping.\nTo break apart and shape your material you will be using some simple tools for percussion and pressure flaking. These tools can be made out of antler, soft metal, soft stone, bone, or very hard wood. The best pressure flaking tools are made with an antler or copper tip.\nPercussion flaking is the act of striking your material to break it apart in a controlled manner. In a uniform material, the force from a strike moves out from the point of impact in a cone shape that is roughly 100 degrees wide. This is called a Hertzian Cone (see figure 1). Understanding this concept of how forces move through stone allows you to angle your stone to break it apart in an intentional way.\nIf your parent material (also called a core) has rounded edges, the first step is to break it apart so that you have good edges to work with. This can be done by using a large hammering tool. The goal is to create platform edges that are less than 90 degrees (see figure 2).\nThe next step is to strike flakes off of your core using smaller striking tools. It is these flakes that you will be further shaping into implements such as arrowheads (see figure 3).\nPressure flaking is the act of using a pressure flaking tool (such as an antler) to load significant pressure against an edge and then popping off a long thinning flake. Pressure flaking allows a flake to be carefully shaped down into the finished tool.\nTo pressure flake, an edge often needs to be strengthened by abrading it to remove thin weak pieces. A platform is then picked out, which is a point on the edge that sits below the centerline of your flake. The pressure flaking tool is then pushed onto the platform with significant force and a small thin flake is popped off of the piece (see figure 4).\nNotching is the final step in making arrowheads. The notches are made using a combination of pressure flaking and abrading to carve out the gaps that allow the arrowhead to be bound to an arrow shaft (see figure 5).\nYou now have a completed arrowhead. You can haft it onto an arrow shaft and begin working on another. Happy knapping!\nA great material to start working with is beer bottle bottoms. It allows you to practice and learn the concepts before spending money on expensive stones. Here is a great article on making arrowheads from beer bottles.\nMaking arrowheads and other stone tools is taught as part of our\nWilderness Certification Program.\nFor detailed information on flintknapping, we recommend the book:\nThe Art of Flint Knapping by D. C. Waldorf.\nAbout the Author: Jason Knight is the Director at Alderleaf Wilderness College. He has been teaching wilderness skills for over twenty years.

And, approx. 2.3 million people in the U.S. are exposed to silica at work every year.\nSo, what are some of the dangers? More importantly, what do you need to know about silica dust protection for you and your team?\nLet’s break it down.\nRelated Article: OSHA Targets Silica Hazards in Cut Stone Industry\nRelated Article: How to Protect Your Team from the Effects of Silica\nHealth Implications of Silica Dust Exposure\nWhen inhaled, silica dust particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause various respiratory ailments.\nProlonged exposure to high levels of silica dust can lead to the development of silicosis, a debilitating and irreversible lung disease. Silicosis is characterized by the formation of scar tissue in the lungs, reducing their ability to function effectively.\nSymptoms of silicosis include persistent cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue.\nIn addition to silicosis, silica dust exposure is also associated with an increased risk of developing other respiratory conditions. These include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tuberculosis, lung cancer, and kidney disease. Furthermore, silica dust has been linked to an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections and exacerbation of existing respiratory conditions, such as asthma.\nRelated Article: NIOSH Takes Step toward Reducing Silica Dust Exposure in Mines\nThe Importance of a Workplace Respiratory Protection Program\nGiven the serious health risks posed by silica dust, it is crucial for workers to use appropriate respiratory protection measures to minimize their exposure. Respiratory protection can effectively reduce the inhalation of silica dust particles and safeguard the respiratory system. There are various types of respiratory protection equipment available, and the choice of the most suitable option depends on the nature of the work being performed.\nFor proper silica dust protection, your team should be equipped with one of the following.\n1. N95 Respirators\nN95 respirators are a common form of respiratory protection widely used in industries where workers are exposed to silica dust. These respirators filter out at least 95% of airborne particles, including silica dust, with a diameter of 0.3 micrometers or larger.\nN95 respirators create a seal around the nose and mouth, ensuring that the air breathed in is properly filtered. Remember that for silica dust protection, it’s essential to conduct fit testing to ensure a proper fit.\n2. Powered Air-Purifying Respirators (PAPRs)\nPAPRs are another option for respiratory protection, particularly in situations where the concentration of silica dust is high.\nPAPRs use a battery-powered fan to draw air through filters before delivering it to the wearer’s breathing zone. These respirators provide a higher level of protection than N95 respirators, and are more comfortable to wear for extended periods.\nHowever, they require regular maintenance, including filter replacement and battery recharging.\n3. Supplied Air Respirators (SARs)\nSARs, also known as airline respirators, provide a continuous supply of clean air from a remote source.\nThey are suitable for environments with extremely high levels of silica dust or where the oxygen concentration is insufficient. SARs are typically used in confined spaces, such as underground mines or tunnels. These respirators offer excellent silica dust protection, they can sometimes restrict mobility due to the need for an air supply line.\nImplementing an Effective Silica Dust Protection Program at Your Worksite\nTo ensure effective respiratory protection against silica dust, employers should establish comprehensive respiratory protection programs.\nThese programs should include the following elements:\n1. Hazard Assessment\nEmployers must conduct a thorough assessment of workplace hazards to determine the extent of silica dust exposure. This assessment helps identify areas requiring respiratory protection and enables the selection of appropriate equipment.\n2. Silica Dust Protection Training and Education\nWorkers should receive proper training on the risks associated with silica dust exposure, the proper use and maintenance of respiratory protection equipment, and the importance of following safe work practices. Regular refresher training sessions should be conducted to reinforce these principles.\n3. Proper Equipment Selection\nEmployers should select respiratory protection equipment that meets the required standards and is appropriate for the specific work environment. This includes ensuring that respirators have the correct filter type and efficiency level for silica dust particles.\n4. Fit Testing and Maintenance\nFit testing should be conducted to ensure that respirators fit properly and provide an effective seal. Regular maintenance, including inspection, cleaning, and replacement of filters, is essential to keep respiratory protection equipment in good working condition.\n5. Monitoring and Evaluation\nRegular monitoring of silica dust levels in the workplace is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures and identify any necessary adjustments or improvements to the respiratory protection program.\nSee OSHA’s guidelines on respirable crystalline silica- 1926.1153.\nBringing It Together\nProtecting workers from the adverse effects of silica dust is essential for maintaining occupational health and safety. By understanding the health hazards associated with silica dust exposure and implementing appropriate respiratory protection measures, employers can safeguard the well-being of their workforce.\nRespiratory protection programs, including proper equipment selection, fit testing, training, and maintenance, play a crucial role in mitigating the risks posed by silica dust, enabling workers to breathe safely and maintain their long-term respiratory health.\nAbout Worksite Medical\nIn most cases, OSHA requires medical surveillance testing, and at no cost to employees.\nWorksite Medical makes that program easier with mobile medical testing.\nWe conduct on-site respirator fit tests, as well as audiometric exams, pulmonary function tests and heavy metal lab work, right on your job site. We also keep accurate, easy-to-access medical records for your convenience. You’ll keep your employees at work, and stay ahead of OSHA inspections.']	['<urn:uuid:f9fd69e6-e5ec-4152-a28e-38a11a7762de>', '<urn:uuid:8f4da841-15f6-4f16-b21f-73c3a6c35f3c>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	7	71	1787
64	education professional here need learn cognitive benefits standard testing beyond assessment	Testing has benefits beyond assessment as it directly enhances learning through retrieval practice. When students actively retrieve information from memory during a test or quiz, they are much more likely to remember that information long-term compared to passive restudying. Research shows that more benefit comes from short answer tests where students have to retrieve information versus multiple choice tests where they just recognize it. This effect applies not just to facts but also to concepts - studies show that people who learn through testing can better grasp concepts and generalize them to new examples compared to those who only study.	['I am a keen admirer of the work of Professor Roddy Roediger, a cognitive psychologist who investigates how quizzes and tests directly aid learning by giving retrieval practice. I recently interviewed him and here is how he explains this effect and how we can apply this in practice.\nCould you explain a little about your background and how you moved into the memory field?\nI have a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology from Yale University. I’ve always been interested in memory, and I was surprised to find there was an academic discipline devoted to studying remembering, so I naturally gravitated to that. I worked with Robert Crowder and Endel Tulving at Yale, two leading people in the field. Since then I have taught at Purdue University, the University of Toronto and Rice University. I am now James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor at Washington University in St. Louis.\nMost of my career has been doing laboratory research trying to show factors that help or harm memory. In the 1990s I published a series of studies on illusions of memory – that is, on false memories — how we can have very strong memories of something that either never happened or that happened quite differently from how we remember it. About 8 years ago I became interested in applying what we were learning about memory to education, and I started looking at factors that are important for learning and remembering but that are not well appreciated in education. One of these is retrieval practice, which is what happens when we test ourselves, or when we are given a test or quiz. When we actually retrieve information from memory, it’s a very potent enhancement to remembering it. We are much more likely to remember something again if we actively retrieve it than if we are passively exposed to it in restudying.\nIs this the testing or quizzing effect — that if you learn something and answer questions on it, you are much more likely to retain it for the long term than if you don’t answer the questions?\nYes, absolutely. Making people actually think about material, to reconstruct it, to say it in their own words is much more effective than simply restudying it, yet many students don’t seem to appreciate this. If you ask students how they study to remember, their study strategy is typically re-reading and reviewing. That’s good up to a point, but it would be much better if they actively practiced retrieval, which is what a test requires them to do. If you haven’t constructed or answered practice questions, you won’t do as well on a test as students who have practiced.\nA lot of our readers are in corporate training; does this apply in this field too? How should this affect people’s design of learning programs?\nI think retrieval practice can have direct implications in the corporate world.\nLet me give you an anecdote. One of the people I was talking with about this was skeptical. She was going to work on the train, reading the newspaper like she does every morning. She decided she’d put the paper down after each story and summarize it to herself mentally in her own words. When she got home that night, she asked her husband to test her on the stories she’d read. And she did really well, surprising them both. Because after she’d read the stories, she’d retrieved them and put them in her own words in her mind.\nSo if you’re a sales person and you need to remember a lot of qualities of your product to go out and sell it, the best way to do it is to practice retrieving the information and consult your notes only when you fail to retrieve a critical piece of information. Then when you are with a customer you will know all the information. I talk to textbook sales people a lot. Some can walk in and tell me all about the books while others just get out their notes in their folders and show them to me. It’s so much more impressive when the the salespeople can look you in the eye and tell you about the book without having to refer to their notes.\nHow does this actually work inside the brain?\nWe don’t know the neural mechanisms yet, but i can tell you some factors that seem to be important.\nThere seems to be something about effortful retrieval that matters. If you have to put a bit of effort into the retrieval — if it’s harder to bring the fact out of memory — that helps. So imagine you are trying to remember a face or a name; say you meet someone and you want to remember her name. You might think it would be good to repeatedly retrieve the name immediately after you met her, but it is not. Repeated immediate retrieval is like rote rehearsal – and that doesn’t do very well. But if you space out your retrievals – so you do it right away after you meet the person (to make sure you have the name) and then you wait a while to try again and you keep trying at spaced intervals, you will remember the name much better. The delayed retrieval makes you expend a bit more effort. You want to make retrieval a little difficult for yourself, so something about retrieval effort does seem to matter.\nAnother way you can see that is if you have people read a passage and take a multiple-choice test. In a multiple-choice test you see all the alternatives and you see which one is familiar and correct. You will get a slight benefit in retention from that. But if you are given a short answer question and can actively retrieve the answer, you will get even more benefit, because you have to reproduce the information instead of just recognizing it. Although both tests provide a benefit, research shows that more benefit accrues from a short answer test or quiz where you have to retrieve information than from a multiple choice or true/false one where you just have to recognize it.\nWould that apply to other kinds of recall questions like putting a number as your answer or filling in a blank in a question?\nYes, it does. Fill-in-blank questions do provide the benefit. I assume the same would be true in remembering numbers, but I do not know any research on that topic yet.\nWhat about with multiple response questions or matching questions?\nWe haven’t done the research in these areas, but we believe that questions that stimulate recall are superior to those that use recognition, but all retrieval practice is useful.\nDoes it just apply to learning knowledge and facts or does it apply to learning concepts and higher levels of learning?\nIt definitely applies to concepts. Let me give one example.\nLarry Jacoby and his colleagues at Washington University study how people learn bird concepts like warbler or thrasher and so on. He had some people study examples of birds and which category they were in, and another group were given tests on birds and tried to guess which category they belonged in (and then they got feedback). So one group just studied birds with their category names whereas the other group learned them while being tested on the names. When he tested both groups a couple of days later, the people who’d had been tested while learning did better than those who’d just studied the examples and the categories. In the test, he showed novel examples that people hadn’t seen before, for instance a bird that belonged in the thrasher family but that had not been used in the practice phase, and the people who’d taken the tests did better. Answering the questions about the birds allowed them to grasp the concept better and generalize it to new examples.\nBy testing yourself, making mistakes and being corrected, you sharpen what you know about a concept.\nSo this sounds like a significant way that people can learn better that isn’t widely known. Why is that?\nI don’t know! In his essay on memory, Aristotle said, “Exercise in repeatedly recalling a thing strengthens the memory.” Sir Francis Bacon and William James also knew the benefits of retrieval practice (or recitation, as it used to be called) and wrote about them. They didn’t have evidence, of course, except from their own experience. But the technique has mostly been lost from education and training. In fact the idea of retrieval practice is pretty much derided in education because people in the U.S., at least, are so opposed to anything that smacks of testing.\nCertainly testing can be misused; in the old school days there was an emphasis on rote memorization –students had to remember poetry, say, by heart. Educators later decried what they called this “kill and drill” approach to education and they got away from these techniques. That is good in part, because the philosophy behind rote memorization was misguided. Some educators a hundred years ago considered “Memory” to be a faculty of mind and to operate like a muscle. The idea was if a student practiced memorizing poetry, “the Memory” would become stronger and would be better at learning and remembering other things, like algebra. However, the mind simply does not work that way. Practicing one topic helps that topic but does not usually spill over to learning unrelated topics.\nBut on the other hand, with the de-emphasis on memorization, the benefits of active retrieval should not be lost, because active retrieval is a potent memory enhancer. When you see how children learn multiplication tables, they use flash cards with 6×4 on one side and 24 on the other, and teachers say, “Practice until you think you really know it. Practice until it’s completely automatic.” So teachers use retrieval practice for multiplication tables, but the idea that you can use it for much for complex ideas is not widely appreciated.\nTesting has gotten a bad name in the educational community. Instead of thinking of testing as standardized testing to place people into groups, we need to see use of low-stakes quizzes in the classroom and self-testing outside the classroom as a study and learning strategy.\nNext week we’ll publish the second part of the interview, in which Professor Roediger gives practical advice for people seeking to use the retrieval practice effect to help people learn.']	['<urn:uuid:7682fd88-396f-4834-9f26-bdd1b64a538b>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	11	100	1740
65	explain transformation applied frequency counts text mining information systems	Term Frequency (TF) counts are transformed using the formula: TF = 1 + log(TF) if TF > 0, and 0 if TF = 0. This transformation is used because if a word occurs 1 time in document A and 10 times in document B, it's generally not true that the word is 10 times more relevant in B than in A. The actual relevance difference is usually less than the raw frequency ratio.	['Information Retrieval System explained in simple terms!\nWhile searching for things over internet, I always wondered, what kind of algorithms might be running behind these search engines which provide us with the most relevant information? How do they decide which result to show for which set of search keywords.\nThis might be a no brainer for a few people, but definitely an interesting problem for some of the best brains around the world. To find the answer, I read every guide, tutorial, learning material that came my way. Eventually, I learnt about the Information Retrieval System.\nWhat is Information Retrieval System?\nInformation retrieval system is a network of algorithms, which facilitate the search of relevant data / documents as per the user requirement. It not only provides the relevant information to the user but also tracks the utility of the displayed data as per user behaviour, i.e. Is the user finding the results useful or not?\nIn this article, I have explained the basic techniques used for Information Retrieval. The algorithms used by Yahoo and Google are much more complex compared to the ones mentioned in this article, but still you will get a sense of what goes on in the background when you make these searches.\nLet’s understand more about information retrieval system algorithm using the activity and a business case below:\nActivity – Information Retrieval in Web search:\nTry to search for the queries below and notice the differences in search engine results :\n- blogs on analytics\n- blogs analytics\n- blogs on analytic\n- books on analytics\n- blogs on big data\nInference: You will notice that the first 3 searches gave similar results while 4th and the 5th search result displayed a different result. This is expected because what we are asking in the first 3 queries is quite similar. Hence, the result.\nThat is interesting! But, the question remains:-\n“How does an algorithm catch the similarity and retrieve the right set of web pages for us?”\nThis was just one part of information retrieval (IR) . IR is no way limited to web searches. Below are the few more cases where IR is used in one form or the other:\n- Library / Online book store: where a simple query can match multiple books based on the match with the query.\n- E-Commerce store: where you can match multiple items using a query.\n- Search Tabs: Any search tab on different websites use IR to retrieve related pages.\n- Banks: Try to retrieve the right product, given a set of queries.\nLet’s take a simple example of an online library.We have more than 10,000 books from which we need to search for a book as per the query entered by customer. In addition, we need to create an information retrieval system which can call out all the books which resembles the customer query. Here are a few names of books :\n- Analytics and Big-Data\n- The Hanging Tree\n- Broken Dreams\n- Blessed kid\n- Girl with a Dragon Tattoo\nThe query entered by customer is : Book for Analytics newbie. Let’s solve this case.\nSolving the puzzle using Text Mining\nImagine if you were a librarian of 70’s and a customer comes to you to borrow a book. Given that you have been handling such queries for a long time, you can match the context of the query to the books in the rack. Now imagine, how would this process be, if done by an algorithm.\nObviously machines can handle much bigger data with higher accuracy. Let’s look at few techniques which will make the work of the machine easier:\nTerm Frequency (TF) Matrix :\nThis is the most obvious technique to find out the relevance of a word in a document. The more frequent a word is, the more relevance the word holds in the context. Here is a frequency count of a set of words in the 5 books :\nOne way to check Term Frequency (TF) is to just count the number of occurrence. But it has been observed that if a word X occurs in document A 1 time and in B 10 times, its generally not true that the word X is 10 times more relevant in B than in A. The difference is generally lesser as compared to the actual ratio. Hence it is good to apply following transformation on TF :\nTF = 1 + log (TF) if TF > 0\n0 if TF = 0\nLet’s do the same calculation here :\nNow to find the relevance of document in the query, you just need to sum up the values of words in the query.\nDocument 1 : 1.7 + 3.1 + 2.8 + 1 = 8.6\nDocument 2 :2.3 + 3.0 + 0 + 2 = 7.3\nDocument 3 : 2.5 + 3.0 + 0 + 2 = 7.5\nDocument 4 : 2.6 + 3.0 + 0 + 2.3 = 7.9\nDocument 5 : 2.3 + 3.0 + 0 + 2.5 = 7.8\nResult shows, Document 1 will be more relevant to display for the query, but we still make a concrete conclusion . Since, document 4 and 5 are not far away from Document 1. They might turn out to be relevant too. This is because of the stopwords which elevates all the scores with similar magnitude.\nInverse Document Frequency Matrix(IDF) :\nIDF is another parameter which helps us find out the relevance of words. It is based on the principle that less frequent words are generally more informative.\nIDF = log (N/DF)\nwhere N represents the number of documents and DF represents the number of documents in which we see the occurrence of this word.\nWe now can clearly see that the words like “The” “for” etc. are not really relevant as they occur in almost all the document. Whereas, words like honest, Analytics Big-Data are really niche words which should be kept in the analysis.\nTF-IDF Matrix :\nAs we now know the relevance of words (IDF) and the occurrence of words in the documents (TF), we now can multiply the two. Then, find the subject of the document and thereafter the similarity of query with the document.\nNow it clearly comes out that document 1 is most relevant to the query “Book for Analytics newbie”.\nThis article is an over simplified version of what really happens in an information retrieval system. In actual, we represent each document as a vector on an n-dimension plane, where n is the count of words in a dictionary built by relevant words in all target documents. Then the query is plotted on the same plane.\nThe document which makes the least angle with the query is given out as the most relevant document. We will cover this rule (cosine rule) and a simple solved example using Python in the next article.\nThinkpot: Can you think of more strategies to find the relevance of a query in a document? Share with us useful links of related video or article to do information retrieval.\nDid you find the article useful?

66	What features make a building eco-friendly during construction?	Eco-friendly buildings incorporate several key features during construction: they use materials that are non-toxic, responsibly harvested, recycled and sustainable; employ erosion control measures to prevent soil loss and protect topsoil; utilize standardized design components and simplified construction details; and consider proper disposal of site drainage onsite. Additionally, they focus on using locally available products, salvaged or refurbished materials, and encourage the recycling of surplus materials.	['Sustainability is a word that we encounter and read about on a daily basis. It thus becomes important to know more about the concept. Broadly, sustainability refers to meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. The broader concept refers to natural resources, social equity, and economic development. However, the primary driving force behind the concept of sustainability emanates from two of the most pressing issues of today: judicious use of scarce natural resources and environmentalism.\nExtending the concept to architecture, sustainable architecture seeks to limit the negative impact of buildings on the environment through efficiency and moderate use of materials, energy, development space, and the ecosystem at large. The main focus areas in sustainable architecture rest on a premise of conservation in energy consumption and building material use. The idea is to look at building design that is aimed at limiting the impact of humanity on the environment.\nSustainable architecture is a major consideration in building design as architects try to ensure that buildings generate minimal harmful effects to the ecosystem and the communities.\nSustainable architecture has its reflections in three major areas:\n- Materials. Building materials, construction methodology, and use of resources.\n- Operation. Sustainable operation during the building life cycle, including its ultimate disposal.\n- Energy efficiency. Construction with the goal of achieving long-term energy and resource efficiency as well as function.\nThe benefits in the implementation of sustainable architecture are multipronged, and positive impact can be derived in environmental, economic, and social space. Some of these are:\n- Conservation and restoration of natural resources,\n- Reduction in energy consumption and waste,\n- Reduction in continued dependence on traditional energy sources,\n- Improvement in productivity and performance, and\n- Reduced demands on local utility infrastructure.\nAs architects around the globe increase their focus on the unique challenge sustainability presents in architecture, a conscious shift has been made to buildings being sustainably designed. These buildings strive to reduce their impact on the environment through energy and resource efficiency, reduction in non-renewable resource consumption, and enhancing the natural environment.\nWhat Is A Green Building?\nSustainable architecture has resulted in the emergence of the “green” building. The World Green Building Council defines a Green building that, in its design, construction, or operation, reduces or eliminates negative impacts and can create positive impacts on our climate and natural environment. Green buildings preserve precious natural resources and improve our quality of life.\nThus sustainable architecture, or green architecture, or green design, is an approach to building structures that minimize harmful effects on humans and the environment.\nGreen buildings, thus created, may have several defining characteristics and features like:\n- Efficient use of energy, water, and other resources like use of water-saving plumbing fixtures, energy-efficient lighting, and ventilation systems designed for efficient heating and cooling.\n- Use of alternative or renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n- Reduction of waste and pollution and promotion of reuse and recycling.\n- Improved indoor environmental air quality.\n- Use of building materials that are non-toxic, non-synthetic, responsibly harvested, recycled, ethical, and sustainable.\n- Consideration of the environment in design, construction, and operation, e.g., efficient use of space, minimal harm to the natural habitat.\n- Consideration of the quality of life of occupants in design, construction, and operation.\n- A design that enables adaptation to a changing environment.\nWhile most green buildings may not have all these features, green components such as solar energy and rainwater harvesting bring multiple benefits and are effective means to addressing climate change, driving sustainability, and promoting economic growth and vibrant communities.\nSome key advantages in the adoption of green buildings are their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus safeguarding the environment; reduction in energy use, thereby cost savings on energy spending; reduced and efficient water use and recycling of waste water to minimize the detrimental effects of polluted water; community benefits through a lowered carbon footprint and conserved resources; and human benefits such as well-being, satisfaction, engagement, and productivity.\nBuildings that are healthier, cleaner, and greener do good not only for the planet, but also for the people.\nGreen Buildings and the Sustainable Development Goals\nGreen buildings contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals, and can truly catalyze and address some of the most pressing issues of the world.\n- COST-EFFECTIVE & CLEAN ENERGY (SDG 7). The most cost-effective energy is the through renewable energy sources that are not put to use. However, green buildings leverage renewable energy, which is cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. Renewable energy produces no carbon emissions, hence, limiting the impact on the planet is an additional benefit.\n- SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES & CITIES (SDG 11). Almost 60 percent of the world’s population will settle down in the urban areas by 2030; hence, ensuring their sustainability is of paramount importance. Buildings are the foundation of urban cities, and green buildings are key to their long-term sustainability. Be it homes, schools, shops, offices, or green spaces, the makeup of communities are the end result of the built environment that must be sustainable to ensure a high quality of life for all. In fact, in many countries, Green Building Councils have developed tools that encourage the formation of green neighborhoods and districts, and have helped cities like Mandaue in Philippines to create and implement policies that promote sustainability across cities.\n- LIFE ON LAND (SDG 15) – The materials used to construct a building play a major role in determining its sustainability. Hence the construction industry and its supply chains have a significant role to play in leveraging responsibly sourced materials such as timber. Green building certification tools also acknowledge the need to reduce the use of water; value the biodiversity, ensuring it is protected; and incorporate this into the area they build on during and after construction, minimizing the damage and design to enhance biodiversity, such as through landscaping with local flora.\nThe way homes and workspaces are designed have an impact on our health, our neighborhoods, and the planet. As a result, the concept of green buildings has started to make an impact in building design and architecture. While in the past some realty players were reluctant to make the switch to green buildings due to higher upfront costs, trends have started to change as people view the broader picture of larger investment returns, such as reduced emissions, lower utility costs, and increased social value.\nGreen buildings are not about fads and trends. They must be designed in a way that ensures their resilience and adaptability, keeping our changing global climate in mind. This is critical in developing countries, most of which are vulnerable to the effects of climate change. But it’s not solely about future proof buildings, the infrastructure must be equally sustainable and resilient to future risks.\nGreen Buildings and the Environment\nThe World Environment Day is celebrated across the globe on 5th June and is the principal platform of the United Nations to create awareness and action to protect the Earth’s fragile environment.\nBuildings are one of the largest consumers of resources such as water, energy, and other materials. Besides, they contribute wastes and pollutants during the three phases of their life cycle: construction, maintenance, and deconstruction. The rampant degradation of the environment across the globe has made it imperative to take measures to optimize the use of natural resources and reduce waste. The shift to green building construction and practices can address these concerns and help make a shift to a sustainable environment.\nBuildings Affect the Climate\nAccording to Architecture 2030, buildings account for almost 40 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Additionally, if we take into account the other activities, and infrastructure, such as transportation, and other buildings, the number jumps further. With green buildings, the impact our buildings have on climate change can be significantly reduced, while also building resilience into our homes and communities.\nGreen Buildings Generate Fewer Greenhouse Gases\nGreen buildings encompass a structure’s design, planning, construction, operations, and end-of-life recycling and renovation, while considering indoor environmental quality, energy, water, materials selection and location. Green buildings reduce landfill waste, enabling alternative transportation use, and encouraging retention and creation of vegetated land areas and roofs. High-performing green buildings, the LEED-certified buildings in specific, provide the means to reduce the climate impacts of buildings and their occupants.\nLEED rewards all the thoughtful decisions that encourage compact development and connection with transit and amenities, helping the lower GHGs in association with transportation. Additionally, less transport of materials to and from the buildings eliminates the associated fuel consumption. All this combined significantly reduces the carbon footprint of buildings and its occupants beyond what energy efficiency alone does. The inhabitants providing feedback, using systems that showcase a building’s environmental efforts and performance, can drive further reductions.\nWhat better than for the community, architects, policy makers, and users to come together to take a pledge to move toward green buildings and take a step to safeguard the habitat and environment.\nS M Sehgal Foundation (Sehgal Foundation), a rural development NGO in India, has constructed its headquarters building in Gurugram, Haryana, according to the Platinum Standards LEED set by U.S. Green Building Council and the Indian Green Building Council.\nThe founders of S M Sehgal Foundation, Dr. Suri Sehgal and Mrs. Edda Sehgal, conceptualized the “green” design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the building to be in keeping with the organization’s mission to promote sustainable rural development in India and reduce the building’s impact on human health and the environment.\nSehgal Foundation’s building includes green features like photo-voltaic solar panels on the rooftop generating 35 kW of electricity; solar water heaters; shading devices; a rainwater harvesting storage tank of 800,000 liters; onsite recycling of gray and black water; groundwater recharging (zero runoff site); courtyards maximizing natural light and ventilation; recycled wood; various endangered plant species; use of in-situ bricks; maintenance-free exteriors; insulated walls; use of rapidly renewable rubber wood and bamboo; double-glazed glass, and a highly reflective roof finish, among others.\nThe construction of the building is based more on common sense and only a small part uses sophisticated technology. With intelligent designs such as that of the S M Sehgal Foundation building, electricity cost can be brought down by almost 50 percent. The incorrect notion of the high cost of green buildings is a myth. S M Sehgal Foundation in line with their mission “to achieve positive social, economic, and environmental change” have constructed this ecofriendly building, taking a step toward sustainability.\nWatch a video on S M Sehgal Foundation’s green building in Gurugram, Haryana', 'Sustainability is the process applied to our quest to sustain economic growth while maintaining our long-term environmental health. Sustainability means designing structures that take advantage of technological advancements to create eco-friendly products. Inert-gas-filled insulated windows, engineered-wood products made from scrap wood shavings, sawdust and assorted wood fibers, and thermal break window frames that keep the cold and hot air out are all examples of sustainable products. These products provide the owner and occupants with the following benefits:\n- Reduced maintenance and replacement costs over the life of the building\n- Energy conservation\n- Improved occupant health\n- Productive working environment\nSustainable products incorporated into the building should follow these selection guidelines:\n- Recycled content\n- Natural, plentiful, or renewable materials\n- Products manufactured by a resource-efficient process\n- Locally available products\n- Salvaged, refurbished, or remanufactured products\n- Reusable or recyclable products\n- Durable products\nUsing sustainable materials can also improve the indoor working environment and save money. Consider these advantages:\n- Materials that emit few or no carcinogens or irritants, as demonstrated by the manufacturer’s long-term testing results\n- Minimal chemical emissions from volatile organic compounds (VOC) that out-gas (continue to emit chemical vapors after installation)\n- Moisture-resistant materials that are not easily susceptible to mold growth\n- Materials that are easily maintained and require simple nontoxic cleaners\n- Equipment systems that promote healthy indoor air quality (IAQ) by identifying indoor air pollutants\n- Products and systems that help reduce water consumption\nThe sustainable approach to design would include requirements to do the following:\n- Simplify construction details.\n- Utilize repetitive details and components.\n- Standardize design components.\n- Incorporate accurate dimensions in the design, as some product and material sizes many have been reduced.\n- Simplify building systems so future expansion projects can take advantage of simplified designs or components.\n- Consider occupant safety and worker productivity gains in the new design.\n- Investigate more efficient and environmentally sensitive ways to bring underground utilities into the site with the least disruption to the existing terrain.\n- Consider other ways of disposing of site drainage onsite rather than offsite.\n- Adjust new site contours to provide for a balanced site where no offsite fill or off-site disposal of surplus soils is required.\n- Optimize dimensions to utilize a standard product size.\n- Minimize plumbing pipe and HVAC ductwork bends to reduce liquid and air friction.\n- Select fittings and fasteners that permit quick assembly.\n- Select sealants with the least environmental impact and longest life.\n- Investigate ways to accumulate salvaged and waste materials for recycling.\n- Consider donating surplus materials to a nonprofit organization such as Habitat for Humanity.\n- Deconstruct all existing structures with substantial recoverable materials and dispose of them to recyclers.\nWhen designing a new green structure, a number of goals must be set. The site must meet or exceed standards for sedimentation control and erosion:\n- Prevent the loss of soil during excavation and construction due to surface water drainage; keep dust down and cover large stored piles of earth to prevent wind erosion.\n- Prevent the silting up of existing storm drains in the immediate area by constructing erosion and silt fence enclosures around areas to be excavated.\n- Prevent the siltation of existing nearby streams or waterways by installing erosion and silt fencing around those streams adjacent to areas to be excavated.\n- Protect topsoil piles for reuse. (Topsoil piles are generated early in the construction process as soil is stripped during rough grading operations; respreading is one of the last operations, commencing as landscaping is put in place.)\nThe site utilities should reduce soil erosion during excavation of trenches and contain storm water runoff:\n- Plan infiltration swales and basins during trenching operations to contain surface water.\n- Retain or recharge existing water tables by minimizing site disturbances; leave as many trees as possible; use existing vegetation and retain natural contours.\n- Consider a design to store roof runoff when the building has been completed; it can be used as gray water or reclaimed wastewater.\n- Investigate a small onsite, state-of-the-art treatment plant to recycle reclaimed water.\nAn open-space and landscaping program can accommodate the following:\n- Protect trees during construction; they enhance property values and lower cooling loads.\n- Consider indigenous landscaping; it supports natural wildlife and plantings and lowers the level of irrigation as well as the need to fertilize and apply chemical treatment.\n- Minimize pesticide use by installing weed cloth; use mulches and planting species that create dense planting beds.\nSite -circulation and transportation programs should meet these objectives:\n- Encourage carpooling.\n- Provide areas for people to store bicycles during working hours.\n- Encourage the use of public transportation by instituting a program of incentives.']	['<urn:uuid:4709d2ef-e688-4365-84ca-b7c15f89a7cb>', '<urn:uuid:87dc776d-1577-43c5-924a-15b33db12340>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	8	65	2548
67	appropriate nitrogen content ratio fertilizer lawn autumn time	During autumn, it is optimal to use a fertilizer with a higher concentration of nitrogen compared to what is typically applied during spring and summer seasons. A fertilizer containing a balanced combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium helps revitalize impaired areas by stimulating fresh growth.	['In the Northern Hemisphere, fall typically commences during the autumn solstice in September and concludes at the winter solstice in December. Precisely, the initial day of autumn falls on Saturday, September 23, 2023.\nIt’s a season of change and preparation for the winter ahead. So, your Summer eiderdown is over and done with for the year, but this is the season where you can put down some serious roots. Fall is actually the best season to garden because of the soil’s moist and mild texture. Autumn is the best time to begin transplanting shrubs or trees if they need to be moved from a shady or sunny spot, and it is also a great time to propagate new plants from cuttings. You can keep track of weather data regularly to be prepared for your plants in advance.\nClean up old residue\nOnly dead crops or trash are removed since they promote disease and pests. If your area does not experience frost, the moment you observe annual plants fading or dying is an excellent time to start your autumn cleanup.\nPamper your lawn\nNow is an opportune moment to nourish your lawn; however, it is optimal to utilize a fertilizer with a greater concentration of nitrogen compared to the one you typically apply during the spring and summer seasons. A fertilizer that contains a well-balanced combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium aids in revitalizing impaired areas by stimulating fresh growth. Maintaining your lawn taller will promote greater root development, which improves your grass’s ability to survive the winter.\nPruning trees can enhance their overall well-being and aesthetic appeal by eliminating decaying or dying branches. Additionally, it can potentially increase the productivity of fruit-bearing trees. The process of tree pruning requires specific tools, especially when dealing with larger trees.\nProtect your most tender plants\nAs fall approaches, cover delicate plants and newly established trees with fleece. It is preferable to do so before winter. Miniature plants can be transferred into a growing space, which should be cleansed to maximize the amount of light entering it. Mulch should be applied around tree roots in late October so as to safeguard them from winter frostbite.\nDrain the water\nPrior to the arrival of freezing temperatures, it is important to ensure that all water is drained from your garden hoses and irrigation tubing.\nPrevent from soil erosion\nIn order to prevent erosion, plant cover crops like mustard, peas, or clover in the fall. Then, in the spring, turn them over into the soil to add nutrients.\nKeeping containers in safe\nThe cycle of freezing and thawing can cause containers to break, especially those composed of clay and filled with potting soil. After cleaning them, keep your containers and planters in a dry, safe place, such as a garage or shed. Plant autumnal trees and bushes up until a month prior to the ground typically freezing.\nComposting is an excellent way to reuse fallen autumn leaves and plants that you’ve removed. Garden soils with compost have a better composition and are better able to hold moisture. You have the power to reduce the amount of solid waste deposited in landfills by recycling yard rubbish at home. These actions improve the quality of your own surroundings while also having a favorable effect on the area as a whole.\nPlant Flowering bulbs\nThe best season to plant bulbs flowers is in the fall, including tulips, daffodils, crocus, asiatic lilies, peonies, and iris. These spring-flowering bulbs should be seeded as soon as the nightly temperatures fall to 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Anywhere in the garden with soil that drains well is suitable for planting bulbs. You could choose to plant them to use as landscape edging or garden borders.\nWinterizing and tidying up your garden shed\nAdditionally, it’s important to prepare your shed by caulking any gaps or holes where animals like rats and birds may enter. If you’ve had a problem in the past, you might want to add some traps or insect control. Don’t forget to inspect your shed for structural harm and any ceiling leaks, and make any repairs that are required.\nHarvesting, maintenance, and year-ahead planning are the key focuses of fall gardening. This can help you make the most of the shades of fall while maintaining the structure of your area until spring. To ensure a successful fall vegetable garden, it is recommended to sow seeds approximately 90 days prior to the first frost. For those who prefer using transplants from a garden center, the timeframe is slightly shorter, but the plants are generally more manageable for novice gardeners.']	['<urn:uuid:58cdd312-2941-49cd-bdb8-4658b362b99b>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	8	45	766
68	safe operation tips manual vs powered lawn mower features and blade care	For safety, push-type manual reel mowers offer quiet, fuel-free operation but modern powered mowers include important safety features like auto-stopping blades when controls are released and rear-mounted rope pulls. Both types require proper blade maintenance - sharpen blades at least annually and ensure they're only as sharp as a butter knife, not razor-sharp. Additional safety practices include: wearing sturdy shoes, using earplugs with power mowers, pushing forward never backward, mowing across slopes not up/down, avoiding wet grass, and keeping spectators away during operation.	"['How Much Does a Lawn Mower Blade Sharpening Cost?\nLawn mower blade sharpening is an integral part of good lawn maintenance. Sharpening the blades of your lawn mower applies to everyone since all lawn mowers have blades, and is very important for a few different reasons. First, if the lawn mower’s blade is dull, it will pull on the grass rather than cutting through it smoothly. This can damage the grass rather than helping it grow fresh. Another reason that you should have your lawn mower blade sharpened is that the lawn mower itself will run more smoothly, therefore prolonging the life of the mower. Finally, have sharp mower blades will shorten the amount of time you spend working on your lawn since your machine will cut the grass flawlessly and quickly. The costs for lawn mower blade sharpening will depend on the size of your blade, whether you perform the job yourself or have it done for you, and the company performing the job.\nHow much does it cost?\n- If you want to sharpen the blade yourself, you will need a grinder which you can buy for $30-$50. This is a one time cost, and can therefore save you money over time.\n- If you want to choose a professional, lawn mower blade sharpening can cost $5-$15 per blade. If you remove the blade and bring it to them, the costs can be around $5 less.\n- According to Sharpeningshack.net, lawn mower sharpening services usually cost around $15 per blade.\nWhat is going to be included?\n- When sharpening your lawn mowers blade, you can either choose to sharpen it your own or you can hire a person to sharp it.\n- When bringing the blade into a professional shop, all they will ask if for you to remove the blade from the bottom of your lawn mower. This can be done by using the right sized wrench.\n- During the process, the blade will be placed against a grinder until the blade is shiny and sharp. It should look just like the blade did when you first purchased the lawn mower.\nWhat are the extra costs?\n- The cost of a sharpener is something to consider if you are going to do it on your own for the life of the lawn mower.\n- If your blade is too dull and old, you may need to buy a new one. New blades can cost anywhere from $15 to $25.\n- If the professional finds other problems that are wrong with the mower, you may need to have additional repairs done.\nFactors that influence the price:\n- Degree of dullness. If your blade is extremely dull, you may have to spend more.\n- Type of hired person. If you hire a professional person then you will be paying more than hiring a person that is not a professional.\nTips to know:\n- Always think about your safety if you to do the sharpening your own. Turn off the lawn mower before taking off its blade and make sure that there is no way for it to start up while you are taking the blade because you might have your fingers cut.\n- It is best to pay for a professional sharpener than to do it by yourself without the assistance of others. A proper blade sharpening will preserve the value of your lawn mower.\n- The blade should not be too sharp like a razor blade. It should only be as sharp as a “butter knife.”\n- You should sharpen your blades at least once a year. If you allow the build up of grass clippings and debris in the blades, the blade sharpening may not work and you may have to purchase new blades.\n- If your blades are beyond sharpening, do not let the salesman talk you into purchasing a new lawn mower. Your actual mower is probably perfectly fine and you just need to purchase a new blade or set of blades.\nHow can I save money?\n- You can probably save if you do the sharpening all by yourself. All you have to do is to further research about how to do it step by step. However, you can save more if you let it sharpened in a professional sharpener if you are a first timer with sharpening your blades. FamilyHandyMan.com has a nice step by step guide.\n- If you can, remove the blade ahead of time. Most companies offer discounts for those that do. If you bring in the entire lawn mower and ask the company to remove, sharpen, and put back on the blade, you will be charged much more.\n- There is probably a good chance that you have a neighbor or know someone that has a grinder. Rather than paying for your own, maybe ask if you can use someone else’s. You could even go in on one with a neighbor to save you both some money.\n- If you clean your lawn mower blade before taking it in for a sharpening, you will probably be charged the minimum since the company can do it in just a few minutes.', 'Choosing a mower\nThe two principal types of mowers available for use on home lawns include ""reel"" and ""rotary"" lawn mowers. Regardless which type is chosen, it is very important to keep the lawn mower blades as sharp as possible. Dull lawn mower blades tear grass blades rather than cutting them. This results in injured plants.\nRotary lawn mowers\nRotary lawn mowers have a whirling horizontal blade. Rotating blades have the potential for throwing stones or other small objects in the path of the mower. Therefore, rotary lawn mowers can be more dangerous to operate than reel lawn mowers.\nRotary lawn mowers cut the grass by impact, similar to the way a machete works. This causes a rougher, more uneven cut than reel lawn mowers. However, rotary lawn mowers do an acceptable job on virtually any lawn. In addition, they are easier to maintain then reel lawn mowers and can cut taller grass.\nMulching lawn mowers\nMulching or recycling lawn mowers are now available. A mulching lawn mower recuts grass clippings into smaller pieces and redistributes them uniformly back into the lawn for rapid decay. When the turf is wet, clumping is common with mulching lawn mowers because of the excess water present.\nPush-type reel lawn mowers\nThere is a growing movement among people with small, easily managed yards, back to ""old-fashioned"" push-type reel lawn mowers. Newer versions are smaller, lighter-weight, and easier to push than the old clunkers you may have used as a youngster. They have the advantage of quiet, fuel-free operation, and can provide good exercise at the same time.\nReel lawn mowers\nReel lawn mowers have a series of revolving blades that cut against a stationary bedknife, much like a scissors. While reel lawn mowers provide the finest quality of cut available, they are expensive, not easily adjusted, and require specialized equipment for sharpening. Also, they can\'t be used where stones, twigs, or other debris are a problem because of potential damage to the cutting units. They are also not well adapted for use in higher heights of cut.\nKeep all mowing equipment in good working condition. Consult lawn mower manual for annual routine maintenance practices.\nAs a general rule, sharpen and adjust lawn mower blades frequently to assure a clean cut. A dull rotary lawn mower blade frays the ends of grass blades and results in brown tips, which are unsightly and increase the plants\' susceptibility to certain plant diseases.\nModern lawn mowers are equipped with certain safety devices which should not be removed or tampered with. One safety feature is a blade that stops turning when the operator\'s hands are removed from the controls. Another is a rear-mounted rope pull for starting the mower. This reduces the chance of getting one\'s foot caught in the blades during starting.\nMany rotary lawn mowers have bagging attachments which affect mower safety. The manufacturer may have a special attachment which is required for safe mowing without a bag. Similarly, discharge chute shields on non-bagging lawn mowers should not be removed.\nSteep slopes are both difficult and dangerous to mow. These slopes are good candidates for alternative groundcovers or a no-mow grassed slope that will stabilize the bank and eliminate the need for routine maintenance such as mowing.\nAdditional mowing safety practices\n- Pick up rocks, wires, and sticks before mowing to prevent them from becoming dangerous projectiles.\n- Keep all spectators away from the lawn mower while it is in operation.\n- Children should not be allowed to operate lawn mowers until they can handle them safely and easily.\n- Always consult the owner’s manual for precautions and instructions on using lawn mowers safely.\n- Use earplugs when operating noisy power lawn mowers.\n- Wear sturdy shoes that protect the feet.\n- Always push the lawn mower forward. Never pull it backward in a motion where a slip will allow your foot under the mower deck.\n- Mow across a slope, not up and down as good footing is important in steep slopes.\n- Delay mowing when grass is wet. Dry grass is less apt to plug lawn mowers and footing is better on dry grass.\nReviewed in 2018']"	['<urn:uuid:26ef0063-bd39-43c0-a3bb-3c368d39e33b>', '<urn:uuid:de541514-8c05-4843-9abf-170dfd6dff6a>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	12	83	1553
69	How do scientists confirm dates using different dating methods?	Scientists use multiple radiometric dating techniques to cross-check and validate age calculations. When different methods are applied to the same rock, they can verify if the results are consistent. Additionally, scientists can compare radiocarbon dating results with other dating methods like tree rings to ensure accuracy. They also use modern standards such as oxalic acid and reference materials to calibrate their measurements in both radiometric dating and Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) techniques.	"[""The fission tracks produced by this process are recorded in the plastic film. The longest cores have helped to form a record of polar climate stretching hundreds of thousands of years back. These are the parent isotope that did not change during the first half life. So to date those, geologists look for layers like volcanic ash that might be sandwiched between the sedimentary layers, and that tend to have radioactive elements. Plotting an isochron is used to solve the age equation graphically and calculate the age of the sample and the original composition.\nJournal of African Earth Sciences. Students not only want to know how old a fossil is, but they want to know how that age was determined. The above equation makes use of information on the composition of parent and daughter isotopes at the time the material being tested cooled below its closure temperature. The task now for each team is to determine how many timed intervals that is, how many half-lives the set of pieces they are looking at has experienced.\nIn some areas of the world, it is possible to date wood back a few thousand years, or even many thousands. Tree Rings In regions outside the tropics, trees grow more quickly during the warm summer months than during the cooler winter. This makes the curve more useful, because it is easier to plot it more accurately. For example, hook up new orleans an overlying lava flow can give a reliable estimate of the age of a sedimentary rock formation in one location.\nThe half-life of a radioactive substance is the amount of time, on average, it takes for half of the atoms to decay. Ideally, several different radiometric techniques will be used to date the same rock. This causes induced fission of U, as opposed to the spontaneous fission of U.\nGeologic Age Dating Explained\nAs this process has been repeated all over the world, our estimates of rock and fossil ages has become more and more accurate. In general, radiometric dating works best for igneous rocks and is not very useful for determining the age of sedimentary rocks. With death, the uptake of carbon stops.\nAbsolute radiometric dating requires a measurable fraction of parent nucleus to remain in the sample rock. The rate of creation of carbon appears to be roughly constant, as cross-checks of carbon dating with other dating methods show it gives consistent results. The age that can be calculated by radiometric dating is thus the time at which the rock or mineral cooled to closure temperature. The teacher should tell the students that there are two basic principles used by geologists to determine the sequence of ages of rocks. Sedimentary rocks in particular are notoriously radioactive-free zones.\nThis scheme has application over a wide range of geologic dates. Geological history of Earth Timeline of geology. For most radioactive nuclides, the half-life depends solely on nuclear properties and is essentially a constant. Each of these unstable isotopes has its own characteristic half life. International Journal of Chemical Kinetics.\nRelative dating Science Learning Hub\nThis is well-established for most isotopic systems. All biological tissues contain amino acids. Another example of yearly layers is the deposition of sediments in lakes, especially the lakes that are located at the end of glaciers. Absolute dating is the process of determining an age on a specified chronology in archaeology and geology.\nSo what does this have to do with the age of Earth? Meteoritics and Planetary Science. For example, which is older, dating the bricks in a building or the building itself? Concepts Deep time Geological history of Earth Geological time units.\nMany rocks contain small amounts of unstable isotopes and the daughter isotopes into which they decay. Outline of geology Index of geology articles. Accuracy levels of within twenty million years in ages of two-and-a-half billion years are achievable. This field is known as thermochronology or thermochronometry.\n- To accomplish this, scientists use a variety of evidence, from tree rings to the amounts of radioactive materials in a rock.\n- Instead, they are a consequence of background radiation on certain minerals.\n- These thick layers alternate with thin, clay-rich layers deposited during the winter.\nThis means the atom will spontaneously change from an unstable form to a stable form. For example, an especially warm summer might result in a very thick layer of sediment deposited from the melting glacier. Agreement between these values indicates that the calculated age is accurate. The next part of this exercise shows how this is done.\nThe number of neutrons, however, is variable. As the mineral cools, the crystal structure begins to form and diffusion of isotopes is less easy. You might have noticed that many of the oldest age dates come from a mineral called zircon. Thus, measuring the ratio of D to L in a sample enables one to estimate how long ago the specimen died.\nStudents should be able to understand the principles and have that as a background so that age determinations by paleontologists and geologists don't seem like black magic. There are a couple catches, dating of course. Some nuclides are inherently unstable. This method works because some unstable radioactive isotopes of some elements decay at a known rate into daughter products.\n- Particular isotopes are suitable for different applications due to the types of atoms present in the mineral or other material and its approximate age.\n- Using several different isotopes helps scientists to check the accuracy of the ages that they calculate.\n- Are there repairs or cracks in the sidewalk that came after the sidewalk was built?\n- Also, an increase in the solar wind or the Earth's magnetic field above the current value would depress the amount of carbon created in the atmosphere.\n- Other radiometric dating techniques are available for earlier periods.\nThis technique relates changes in amino acid molecules to the time elapsed since they were formed. These temperatures are experimentally determined in the lab by artificially resetting sample minerals using a high-temperature furnace. In other words, you can use superposition to tell you that one rock layer is older than another. Students should write the age of the volcanic ash beside the shale, dating connections siltstone and basalt on the list below the block diagram.\nHe assumed that the Earth began as a ball of molten rock, which has steadily cooled over time. This transformation may be accomplished in a number of different ways, including alpha decay emission of alpha particles and beta decay electron emission, positron emission, or electron capture. For example, imagine a radioactive substance with a half-life of one year. This is a radiometric technique since it is based on radioactive decay.\nTherefore, the slate that contains the acritarch and bacteria is between million years and million years old, because the pegmatite is million years old and the granite is million years old. Uranium decays to form lead with a half-life of million years. This predictability allows the relative abundances of related nuclides to be used as a clock to measure the time from the incorporation of the original nuclides into a material to the present. However, local eruptions of volcanoes or other events that give off large amounts of carbon dioxide can reduce local concentrations of carbon and give inaccurate dates. American Journal of Science.\nSay for example that a volcanic dike, or a fault, cuts across several sedimentary layers, or maybe through another volcanic rock type. American Journal of Archaeology. This tree ring record has proven extremely useful in creating a record of climate change, and in finding the age of ancient structures. In the century since then the techniques have been greatly improved and expanded."", 'Apologise, but radiocarbon dating disadvantages confirm\nPosted in Dating\nTaking the necessary measures to maintain employees\' safety, we continue to operate and accept samples for analysis. There are two techniques in measuring radiocarbon in samples-through radiometric dating and by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry AMS. The two techniques are used primarily in determining carbon 14 content of archaeological artifacts and geological samples. These two radiocarbon dating methods use modern standards such as oxalic acid and other reference materials. Although both radiocarbon dating methods produce high-quality results, they are fundamentally different in principle.\nAdvantages of radiocarbon dating Useful for material from the last years. Can estimate relatively accurately when the organism died. dating different culture free dating sites global bay area dating site adult dating websites in the uk aa and dating dating website for single moms All dating methods have advantages and disadvantages. The trade-off between radiocarbon dating and other techniques is that we exchange precision for a wider geographical and temporal range. That is the true benefit of radiocarbon dating, that it can be employed anywhere in the world, and does have about a 60, year range. Its Limitations and Usefulness ""Combining the effects of these two trees, we see a site that was actually occupied for years (from to BCE) appearing - using conventional radiocarbon dating - to have been occupied for 30, years (from 40, to 9, BCE)."".\nWhen an organism dies, it contains a ratio of carbon 14 to carbon As the carbon 14 decays with no possibility of replenishment, the ratio decreases at a regular rate. This rate is known as half-life.\nRadiocarbon Dating By Lydia Thompson Timeline The progress of radicarbon dating is generally divided into 3 generations: First Generation ( - ) Third Generation ( - present) What is it? The calibration curve is refined. AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry) is used to. Though this has its disadvantages, it also is an extreme breakthrough in science to merge into the past without going there. Finally, though not a huge problem, Carbon and Radiocarbon Dating takes careful packaging and patience. If one step is performed incorrectly, you have to start all over again! Radiocarbon dating is therefore limited to objects that are younger than 50, to 60, years or so. (Since humans have only existed in the Americas for approximately 12, years, this is not a serious limitation to southwest archaeology.) Radiocarbon dating is also susceptible to contamination.\nThe measurement of carbon 14 decay provides an indication of the age of any carbon-based material. Dates may be expressed as either uncalibrated or calibrated years. A raw date cannot be used directly as a calendar date, because the level of atmospheric carbon 14 has not been constant during the span of time that can be radiocarbon dated.\nIn addition, there are substantial reservoirs of carbon in organic matter, the ocean, ocean sediments, and sedimentary rock. Finally, although radiocarbon dating is the most common and widely used chronometric technique in archaeology today, it is not unfailing. The technique is based on measuring the ratio of two isotopes of carbon.\nCarbon has an atomic number of 6, an atomic weight of The numbers 12, 13 and 14 refer to the total number of protons plus neutrons in the atom\'s nucleus. Thus carbon has six protons and eight neutrons. Carbon is by far the most abundant carbon isotope, and carbon and are both stable. But carbon is slightly radioactive: it will spontaneously decay into nitrogen by emitting an anti-neutrino and an electron, with a half-life of years.\nHi, my name is Radiocarbon Dating Disadvantages Nikita.

In , the lab starts to offer specialized isotope services for. Mar 31, What are the pros and cons of radioactive dating? Biology Origin of Life on Earth Radioactive Carbon Dating. 1 Answer David Drayer Mar 31, Pro radioactive dating gives an absolute age for the rocks dated. Con radioactive dating can only be used to date fossils older than approximately 50, years old.\nWhy doesn\'t the carbon in the air decay along with terrestrial carbon? It does. The trick is that radioactive carbon is continually replenished in a complex reaction that involves high-energy cosmic rays striking the upper atmosphere. In this process, nitrogen 7 protons and 7 neutrons gains a neutron and loses a proton, producing carbon 6 protons and 8 neutrons.\nThe proportion of carbon to carbon in the atmosphere therefore remains relatively stable at about 1.

70	jaw pain tmj treatment physical therapy dental options which better	Both physical therapy and dental treatments can be effective for TMJ pain. Physical therapy treatment includes postural correction, body mechanics instruction, pulsed ultrasound, and stretching exercises for the masseter and pterygoid muscles, which can resolve pain and restore normal function. From the dental perspective, treatments include Night Guards, Bite Guards, and Bite Adjustments. The choice of treatment depends on the specific cause, which can include genetics, hormones, low-level infections, auto-immune diseases, trauma, or teeth grinding.	"['Oral Facial Pain\nA different approach to solving oral facial pain\nPhysical Therapy for Temporomandibular Dysfunction\nA Case Study of Myofascial Pain Dysfunction\nOBJECTIVE: To describe the use of physical therapy to resolve oral-facial pain of non-tooth origin\nBACKGROUND: The patient was a 65 yr old female who presented with intense, intermittent pain radiating from the right ear to the mid-chin of four months duration. Tooth pathology had been ruled out by two dentists.\nMETHODS: Physical therapy evaluation to identify causative factors; military posture, occipital hyperextension, active trigger points of the pterygoids and the masseter were primary findings. A mild right joint click was noted with jaw opening. Treatment consisted of postural correction, body mechanics instruction, pulsed ultrasound over the right temporomandibular joint and exercise instruction. Stretching of the masseter and pterygoids along with inhibitory icing were the interventions chosen to resolve the trigger points. TMJ self-mobilization instruction was given to resolve the joint click.\nRESULTS : This patient had complete resolution of her lateral jaw pain and was able to resume brushing her teeth, flossing and eating normally, without symptoms.\nCONCLUSION: The physical therapy treatment provided to this patient resulted in complete resolution of her symptoms.\nAlternatives to Surgery\nPostural correction helped resolve chronic repetitive stress injuries resulting from hyperextension of the occiput. Gentle joint manipulation stretched tightened joint ligaments. Most importantly, correct stretching of the pterygoid and masseter muscles eliminated active trigger points, the primary cause of pain.\nFaulty postural habits are often the contributing factors in oral-facial pain. In this case occipital hyperextension related to military posture was a precipitating factor. Palpation of the masseter and medial pterygoid revealed exquisitely tender trigger points and taut bands. These trigger points referred pain towards the ear and jaw. Illustrations A, B and C indicate the referral patterns of these muscles as interpreted by Janet G. Travel, MD and David G. Simmons, MD in Myofascial pain and dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual, Vol. 1, The Upper Extremities (© 1983, Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins.)\nAs noted, these pain patterns could easily appear to originate in the teeth. The patient was afraid to brush or floss her teeth as movement, including talking, could trigger excruciating pain. Once the patient understood the mechanism causing her pain she could initiate stretching at onset and shorten the length of the pain episode. Upon discharge, the patient was pain free and had returned to normal activity.\nInitially the patient was seen for nine sessions with good resolution of symptoms. Six weeks later the patient called with complaints of a recurrence of symptoms. Upon evaluation it was noted that the patient was stretching much too aggressively. Exercises were reviewed with careful instruction as to force and frequency. the patient was discharged after four additional sessions pain free. The patient, a retired nurse enjoys writing as a hobby. Her abridged account of treatment follows.\n“My right jaw was acting like a cavity. My home dentist said “no cavity!” Arriving in Florida, the pain now radiated from the right ear to mid-chin. This brought instant tears. A local dentist agreed, “no cavity” and referred me to Greene Rehab Services as the source of pain was likely in the muscle. After ultrasound, exercises and ice therapy, the pain left completely. I can brush my teeth comfortably, floss and put pressure in my cheek. Thanks to Greene Rehab Services I’m pain free! ” . . . Kay Harnish.', ""A crown (cap) is a restoration that is placed on teeth that have lost a lot of their structure. There are various types of crowns, ranging from full porcelain to full metal crowns. Your dentist will explain the advantages and disadvantages of each kind for you.\nCrowns may also be used to securely attach a bridge if the structure of the surrounding teeth is inadequate. A bridge is a dental appliance that is used to replace one or more missing teeth. They are designed to be cosmetically appealing and to restore proper occlusion. Like crowns, bridges are fully customizable and made of various materials, including porcelain and metals. Although not as permanent as a cap, bridges are bonded to the surrounding teeth and only removable by your dentist.\nBoth crowns and bridges are created to match the color, height, texture, and overall appearance of your teeth. Most crowns and bridges will last for life, eliminating the need to replace them unless they fall out or become loose. You may prolong the durability of your crowns and bridges by practicing good oral hygiene and visiting your dentist for regular check-ups and cleanings.\nIf you live in or around NYC, give us a call today to schedule your appointment.\nTeeth stains are inevitable due to our consumption of a variety of foods and drinks (soda, spicy food, coffee, etc.). However, advanced teeth whitening technology has enabled dentists to whiten teeth without adversely affecting the tooth structure.\nAlmost all whitening methods are similar in concept, but some are much more effective because of the way the whitening material is delivered to the teeth. Another contributing factor is the concentration of the material, which is why less potent over-the-counter whitening systems usually donít give patients the results they are hoping for.\nThe two main methods of professional whitening are tray whitening and in-office whitening. In tray whitening, an impression is taken and a custom tray is made for the patient. Then, a supply of whitening gel is given to the patient and he/she wears the tray for a few hours each day (techniques differ) for a period of time until an acceptable result is achieved. Sensitivity of the teeth is a normal side-effect of this whitening method and is almost always transitional.\nOn the other hand, in-office whitening is the most efficient means of whitening. There are a number of different types used, but the process is very similar for these methods; you can have your teeth whitened in one session and achieve significant results. Your dentist can give you more detailed information and help you decide which method is more suitable for you and your teeth.\nIf you have any questions about teeth whitening and cosmetic dentistry and you live in or around NYC, give us a call today!\nWhen considering tooth fillings, one of the options available is composite fillings which are made from durable plastics that are similar in color to natural teeth. Because the composite fillings are tooth-colored, they look more natural and are less noticeable compared to other types of fillings.\nAnother benefit of tooth-colored fillings is that they are compatible with sealants, allowing your dentist to perform both procedures in a single sitting and thus preventing further decay. There are other advantages to composite, tooth-colored fillings such as, most importantly, its ability to bond to tooth structures. Also, in many cases these fillings can be repaired by the addition of more composite material.\nSpeak with one of our doctors to find out which kind of filling is best for you.\nIf you live in or around NYC, call or schedule an appointment today.\nThis is one way to quickly get that beautiful smile. Veneers and Laminates are a thin shell of porcelain or resin that is bonded to the surface of the teeth. This can change their shape, shade, and position to improve the cosmetics of your teeth and smile. They are also used to replace and restore any lost tooth structure where indicated.\nYour dentist will do a complete examination of your teeth to determine if veneers are ideal for you. Veneers often provide the opportunity to dramatically transform the aesthetics of your teeth and smile.\nVeneers can enhance the shape of your teeth, make your teeth as white as you want, and give you the smile you have always desired. Additionally, Veneers are bonded to your tooth structure, which gives them strength.\nSince they are very thin, Veneers are considered one of the most conservative cosmetic treatments available. Most of the time, very little or no tooth structure is removed before placing veneers. Ask your dentist how veneers can improve your smile.\nIf you have any questions about cosmetic dentistry and dental veneers and you live in or around NYC, give us a call today!\nEvery tooth consists of three different layers. The outermost and hardest layer is enamel, and the second layer is dentin. The third is pulp, which is the cavernous space where the live tissue and nerve of each tooth is located.\nIf for any reason the pulp space is exposed to the outside, the tissue becomes contaminated and eventually infected. The exposure of pulp happens in many circumstances, such as when you have a large cavity or a fractured tooth. Your dentist can explain the exact reason for damage to this tissue. In these cases, the treatment is usually root canal treatment.\nRoot canal treatment is the process of going inside the pulp space and removing the infected, dead tissue. The space is then disinfected and sealed with special materials. Nowadays, root canal treatments are performed with advanced techniques and materials, making them far more comfortable and faster. After root canal treatment is complete, your restorative dentist will usually place a crown on your tooth to safeguard against fracture.\nIf you have any questions about root canal treatment and you live in or around NYC, give us a call today!\nInlays and Onlays are lab-made restorations that are placed on teeth when the cavity or lost tooth structure is too large to be restored by a simple filling. The process of making an inlay is very similar to a crown. After the tooth is prepared, it is cemented or bonded to the tooth.\nThere are different materials that inlays are made of, including gold, porcelain, and composite resins. Porcelain and composite inlays and onlays are cosmetic alternatives to fillings and are very strong compared to regular white fillings. Gold inlays and onlays are also suitable alternatives, but their appearance makes them less popular.\nYour dentist will explain when an inlay or onlay is a viable treatment option for you. In general, inlays and onlays can replace most back teeth fillings and are sometimes cosmetically preferred over conventional fillings. At the same time, they are more conservative than crowns.\nAs far as cost is concerned, because the process of making an inlay or onlay is similar to a crown, its cost is also comparable. But when considering the longevity of inlays and onlays, they can end up costing less than traditional fillings.\nIf you have any questions about inlays and onlays and you live in or around NYC, give us a call today!\nTMJ is the joint that connects the lower and upper jaw. The term TMJ stands for Temporo-mandibular Joint. This is one of the most complex joints in the entire body, capable of forward and backward movement, rotations, and side-to-side movements. TMJ often refers to complications and problems with this joint. Some of the most common symptoms of TMJ problems are:\nSome potential causes of the disease include genetics, hormones, low-level infections, auto-immune diseases, trauma, and clenching or grinding of the teeth. Diagnosis and evaluation of such conditions are performed by dentists experienced in TMJ problems and treatments. Some common treatments are Night Guards, Bite Guards, and Bite Adjustments. Your dentist can guide you toward the best treatment for you.\nIf you experience any TMJ problems or symptoms and you live in or around NYC please let us know. The doctor will be happy to evaluate your situation and offer the best treatment possible.\nSealants are thin layers of resin that are placed on the pits, fissures, and grooves of molars to prevent decay on these surfaces.\nThe majority of decay on back teeth starts in the grooves and pits of chewing surfaces, especially during the first few years after their eruption. Sealing these surfaces with composite resins prevents this kind of decay.\nSealants are one of the most effective methods of preventing decay on the surfaces where they are placed. Although it is still a possibility that decay may develop on surfaces in between teeth, sealants significantly reduce the overall chance of having cavities.\nIf you have any questions about dental sealants and you live in or around NYC, give us a call today!\nThough many advances have been made in the field of dentistry, loss of teeth is still an ongoing problem. In the United States, 26% of adults between the ages of sixty-five and seventy-five have lost all of their teeth. Currently, there are a number of options available for people who have lost their teeth. One of the most versatile and affordable is a set of removable dentures.\nStandard Full Dentures\nStandard full dentures are dentures that comprise a full set of upper and lower teeth. This type of denture uses suction to stay in place. They are made of a pliable material which makes suction easy. However, it is for this reason that standard full dentures require routine visits to the dentist. Being pliable, the dentures are susceptible to shrinkage, thus creating an ill-fitting prosthetic that can result in the atrophy of the jawbone.\nPartial dentures are dentures that replace only a limited number of teeth, not an entire set. Partial dentures are a single piece fitting that is supported by the remaining teeth and gums. They are much more secure than standard full dentures and are more comfortable.\nCosmetic dentures, as you can imagine, are made to look as natural as possible. Unlike standard dentures that use a heat curing process which leads to dentures that become ill-fitting over time, cosmetic dentures are made from a special acrylic base that eliminates the possibility of the denture shrinking and warping.\nFurthermore, some cosmetic dentures achieve a natural appearance through the use of implants. Implants are installed in the mouth so that the dentures have something to hold onto. The cosmetic denture will either rest on or snap onto the implant. What this does is allow the denture to stay in place without the chance of it moving around, which makes the denture more comfortable than a standard one.\nLoss of teeth and expensive treatment options don't have to prevent you from continuing to lead a healthy and happy life. Removable dentures are a suitable course of treatment for many people. You deserve to give yourself the best treatment possible.

71	I'm looking into online construction safety courses and noticed some mention 10-hour and 30-hour options - can you explain what organizations offer these types of courses?	Several organizations offer 10-hour and 30-hour construction safety courses that are referenced by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration). These include AdvanceOnline, ClickSafety, PureSafety, Summit Training Source, Turner Construction, University of South Florida, and 360Training. The latter even offers courses in both English and Spanish to ensure Spanish-speaking construction workers can be properly trained.	['The Top Online Construction Safety Courses\nConstruction is one of the most hazardous professional occupations. Construction workers are exposed to risks that office, shop, or even manufacturing workers do not have to face. Health and lives are at stake. So, indirectly, is job security: the hidden costs of construction industry accidents can hurt a construction company financially and jeopardize its employment in general. Safety training and education are therefore of paramount importance. Online construction safety courses offer easy access at any time. Workers can pace their learning to suit their schedules.\nDoes the Course Meet the Right Standard?\nDifferent online courses vary in their content, course lengths and accreditations. If you are looking for overall safety training, start by considering the safety standards or regulations associated with the course. Certification to a government standard is a guarantee that the course covers essential safety aspects. Certifying organizations for different countries include:\n- USA. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which is an agency of the United States Department of Labor (DOL).\n- Canada. Construction Safety Training System (CSTS).\n- UK and internationally. The National Examination Board in Occupational Safety and Health (NEBOSH) and Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH). These are both independent organizations based in the UK with course providers in other countries too (33 additional other countries for NEBOSH.)\nCourse Certificates and Examinations Specializations\nOnline safety courses referenced by OSHA for the US may entitle the participants to receive the ‘DOL Wallet Card’ on completion. This card attests that the holder has followed the OSHA-referenced course. By comparison, a NEBOSH-certified online course prepares a participant for two exams needed to achieve the NEBOSH National Certificate in Construction Health and Safety. The exams must be booked separately from the online course.\nSafety Topic Specializations\nBesides general construction safety coverage, specialized online courses are also available. Specific topics covered include safety when working with concrete and masonry, confined space entry, excavations, fall protection, scaffolds, and electrical safety. They can be valuable in helping prevent accidents in environments where such risks are especially high.\nAnd Now the List!\nOur list of online construction safety course favors official certification while also taking independent user feedback into account. Some learning organizations may offer good quality courses that are not certified to government or industry standards. However, we played it safe in the first instance by looking for official compliance.\n- Alberta Safety Construction Association. Offers online courses leading to CSTS certification valid in Canada. Also offers specialized courses in roadbuilding and pipeline construction safety.\n- AdvanceOnline. Offers 10-hour and 30-hour construction safety courses referenced by OSHA with a learning management system (LMS) also suited for larger construction companies.\n- BC Construction Safety Alliance. Offers online courses leading to CSTS certification valid in Canada. The overall 15-module course covers a range of safety issues such as fall protection, use of mobile equipment, machinery and tools, and defensive driving.\n- British Safety Council. Offers NEBOSH National Certificate in Construction Health and Safety via an online course and separate exams. Participants may take up to 12 months to complete the online course if they wish.\n- ClickSafety. Offers 10-hour and 30-hour construction safety courses referenced by OSHA. ‘Toolbox Safety Talk’ videos help participants learn more about specific areas of interest too.\n- PureSafety. Offers 10-hour and 30-hour OSHA-compliant construction safety courses with pay-as-you-go purchase options.\n- Summit Training Source. Offers OSHA-referenced 10-hour and 30-hour online construction safety courses with more advanced education modules also available.\n- Turner Construction. For Turner Construction subcontractors and others, with OSHA-referenced 10-hour and 30-hour online construction safety training.\n- University of South Florida. Offers an extensive full range of OSHA-referenced online construction safety courses. Audio narration gives participants the choice of listening to or reading the material.\n- 360Training. Offers 10-hour and 30-hour construction safety courses referenced by OSHA. Construction safety courses are available in both English and Spanish to ensure Spanish-speaking construction workers are properly trained too.']	['<urn:uuid:f28a823a-8a3b-445b-b837-db9270ce814c>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	26	54	658
72	I'm looking to understand how young people engage with online museum content - what benefits did research find for their mental health, and what issues exist with museums' current digital catalogs?	Research found that young people benefited through mechanisms like improving perspective, reflection, learning, escapism, and creativity, which helped disrupt negative thought patterns and lift mood. Those using specialized cultural content experienced less negative emotion, particularly among non-white and male participants. However, museums' digital catalogs often have uneven representation - some collection areas may be 100% digitized while others have minimal or no digitization, creating an imbalanced online presence that doesn't accurately represent the full collection.	"['The Online Active Community Engagement (O-ACE) project\nAbout the O-ACE project\nMental health and wellbeing are among the major public health concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic, and increasing pressure on healthcare services demands sustainable alternatives to clinical methods of targeting mental health. These alternatives can include museums and cultural community assets (libraries, gardens, heritage sites), though strong empirical evidence of how such assets benefit mental health has been lacking. The extraordinary period of 2020-21 witnessed government-enforced ‘lockdowns’, the closure of museums and galleries all around the world, and the rapid pivot to online consumption across all industries. These circumstances afforded a unique opportunity for researchers at Oxford to investigate the impact and effectiveness specifically of online cultural resources for mental health and wellbeing.\nThis project harnesses world leading expertise in psychiatry, internet research and cultural organisations, with an interdisciplinary research team led by the University’s Department of Psychiatry, the Oxford Internet Institute and the Gardens, Libraries and Museums division. The material used in the development and testing phase of the project draws heavily on the internationally important collections of the Ashmolean Museum.\nO-ACE Project funders\nCOVID-19 Research Response Fund\nHuo Family Foundation\nO-ACE Project dates\nJune 2020-March 2022\nO-ACE Research aims\nThis project set out to advance collective knowledge around the use, benefits, and optimisation of online cultural content for mental health. The specific objectives were:\nTo conduct a rapid, systematic literature review of community assets for mental health and wellbeing;\nTo evaluate the type, benefits and audiences of online cultural content on offer;\nTo engage research participants throughout the project, with a particular focus on those vulnerable to mental health problems during the pandemic;\nTo develop and test content using experimental medicine methodologies and measure impacts on mental health and wellbeing;\nTo generate pilot data that can be used for longer-term enquiry and development.\nO-ACE Research methods\nThe project was grounded in rigorous qualitative and quantitative methodologies enacted over several phases, each informing the next. As this project was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic all research was remote. For example, surveys were distributed and completed online, and focus groups took place via video-conferencing software. The findings from Phase 1 shaped the focus for phase 2, namely to create a testable online intervention with and for young people aged 16-24.\nSystematic literature review of community based interventions for mental health and wellbeing\nGlobal case studies of online cultural content\nOnline baseline survey to gain an understanding of the use of online culture and potential mental health benefits, socio-demographic characteristics and self-reported health status.\nFollow-on free-text survey to help identify how online arts and culture are used for mental health and wellbeing.\n1-2-1 qualitative interviews with young people aged 16-24.\nConsultation with people with lived experience to advise on potential usefulness of arts and culture for mental health and direction of research\nWorkshops with young adults to co-produce an online cultural intervention\n12 young people\nExperiment (randomised control trial) to test and measure the intervention against a standard museum website experience.\n463 young people\nO-ACE Activities and Findings\nThis short video summarises the approaches to the research and the co-production process behind the creation of the online cultural intervention, \'Ways of Being\'.\nThe literature review aimed to describe studies of community interventions delivered to adults and/or young people, either in person or online, evaluated in randomised controlled trials and provide an indication as to their effectiveness, acceptability, quality of data and where possible, mechanisms of action. We included interventions delivered at and/or by museums, art galleries, libraries, gardens, music groups/choirs and sports clubs. The study only fond 31 eligible examples concluding that, while community engagement is a promising area for wide-reaching interventions to be implemented and evaluated, more high-quality trials are needed.\nThe summary of the cultural heritage sector response to the pandemic and its significance for health and wellbeing looked at the ways organisations sought to bring content online, either through repurposing existing digital assets, digitising events or exhibitions or piloting something new. The studies, from Europe, the US, and New Zealand showed an enthusiasm for the need to address mental health and wellbeing but a lack of empirical evidence to ascertain how and if something is effective. The initiatives were overwhelmingly aimed at existing users rather than new or underserved audiences.\nThe in-depth surveys and interviews with young people aged 18-24 (who were socio-demographically diverse, had a range of mental health experiences, and varied in their use of online arts and culture) allowed us to map out helped us map out how online cultural content could be helpful. Six themes emerged:\nCharacteristics of other activities\nMechanisms of impact\nMental health outcomes\nParticipants said online engagement had some advantages over in-person engagement and benefits were greater with familiarity and regular use\nHaving a \'human connection\' was identified as the feature of online arts and culture that was most likely to benefit mental health\nParticipants emphasised the importance of representation\nThe mechanisms by which online arts and culture could help mental health included improving perspective, reflection, learning, escapism, creativity, exploration and discovery, which might help disrupt negative thought patterns, lift mood and encourage feelings of calm and proactivity.\nConnections map showing the components and weighting participants gave to the ways online cultural content could be helpful for their mental health and wellbeing\nOver four months we worked intensively with the target group to identify collections, stories and do new historical research that would underpin content that aimed to activate some of those mechanisms. The co-producers were highly active in thinking through the ways stories should be presented and the importance of representation:\n""The overall production process was a great experience, with lockdown having its impact on a range of people, speaking to and hearing from those who are in a similar situation made it easier to talk about personal experiences and how art had its part to play. We would spend time discussing the impact of either the art pieces themselves and what they evoked or the artists’ and their lives, this created a sense of relatability, a reflection of sorts. The production also allowed for our backgrounds to be a crucial aspect, having the opportunity to show sensitivity to certain people (whether it be their gender, ethnicity, sexuality or disability) led to us creating a more inclusive resource."" Co-producer, SB\nConceptual framework of the mental health benefits of online arts and culture for young people\nThe development sprints were led by interactive experience experts Imagineear to co-design the intervention. Ways of Being was a web experience that required users to login (to capture their dwell time and activity) and featured highly visual navigation and content with image, text and audio, and options for users to leave their own comments and perspectives The video below provides a walkthrough experience of using Ways of Being, demonstrating the content but also the specific features which respond to requirements outlined in the research and which differentiate it from many \'standard\' museum websites\nOnce ready, we recruited more than 400 young people from a range of backgrounds to take part in a randomised control trial. Many were from groups that were unlikely to access online culture, or access clinical services for mental health support. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or a generic museum website experience and were asked to access their resource over the period of a few days whilst taking measures before, during and after exposure for mood, distress, anxiety, learning, flourishing and loneliness, as well as providing qualitative responses afterwards.\nThe results showed that those in the intervention group experienced less negative emotion (NA in the diagram below), particularly during the intervention period. Sub-group analyses indicated that the effect was marked in non-white and male participants.\nSubgroups analysis for mood and mental distress. (a) shows average differences across both groups (Ashmolean and Ways of Being) during intervention and at week 6 follow-up for negative (left) and positive affect (middle), and K10 (right). (b) Group differences as (a) for different subgroups, but during intervention only.\nSyed Sheriff, Bergin L, Bonsaver L, et al.

The evolution of museum collections management software, digitization technology, and issues such as digital preservation and storage have all contributed to an uneven approach to publishing digital collections online.\nShifting priorities, lack of stable funding, and the absence of a uniform methodology from the outset have further added to the lopsided appearance of digital collections.\nPeriodic evaluation of a museum collection’s digital presence should be undertaken in order to ensure that the museum’s mission and goals are supported by the quantity and quality of the objects available through the collections management system (CMS). If the museum doesn’t already have a system of evaluation in place, the following four questions should be considered:\n1. Is the quality of the digital files acceptable?\nThis is usually the first, noticeable issue with digital surrogates of museum objects. Due to the improvement, availability, and decreasing cost of digitization equipment, museums today are better outfitted to capture high-quality digital object files. Digital capturing that took place 5, 10, 15 or more years ago will not hold up nearly as well in terms of quality and should be considered for a re-shoot. Many museums follow a set of quality standards dependent upon the type of digital file being created (.jpeg, .tif, .pdf, .mp4, etc.) and these standards should be considered when reviewing older digital images. It is important for digital files to be of high-quality since optimum quality files will encourage more digital user interaction, and will provide the best possible files for future digital migration and preservation.\n2. Is the cataloging information correct and does it meet industry standards?\nCatalog information—the quantity and the quality—is perhaps the most varied aspect when considering a museum’s digital collection. Different projects, staff transitions, availability of information, and the structure of the museum collections management system can all impact the way a museum object is cataloged. The museum’s set of cataloging guidelines should be up-to-date with industry standards and any internal standards the museum has elected to follow. Catalog records of collection objects should be compared with the guidelines in order to determine whether they meet the museum’s standards. Catalog records that fail to meet the minimum requirements should be updated.\n3. Does the CMS contain an accurate, representative sample across all areas of the museum collection?\nA museum with an even representation of the collection within the collections management system is rare. Changing priorities, staff transition, unstable funding, and exhibits of any given year can lead to imbalanced creation of the museum digital collection. For example, one area of the museum collection can have 100% of its objects digitized and cataloged online, while other areas only receive a minimal level of digitization or none at all. This is a common scenario and one that museum staff should strive to rectify in order to create a more accurate and representative account of the museum collections online.\n4.

73	how do spontaneous fermentation batch distillation and heads hearts tails affect spirit making process	The spirit-making process involves several key elements. In spontaneous fermentation, local organisms naturally convert sugars to alcohol, commonly used in Armagnacs, Cognacs, rums, cachaças and tequilas. Batch (pot) distillation is required for specific spirits like Scotch malt whisky and Cognac. During distillation, the spirit stream is separated into fractions: heads (strongest but toxic), hearts (good tasting alcohol), and tails (less alcoholic with funky flavors). Distillers use experience and intuition to determine when to make these cuts, which significantly impact the final flavor profile.	['The global diversity of distilled spirits\n14 October 2016 • Author(s): Paul Hughes, Assistant Professor of Distilling, Oregon State University\nPaul Hughes, Assistant Professor of Distilling, Oregon State University gives us an excellent insight into the diffusion and diversity of spirits.\nThe inception of alcoholic drinks was invariably driven by the availability of local raw materials that could be effectively converted into fermentable substrate. In this way, wine therefore developed in regions where grapes were plentiful – particularly around the Mediterranean Sea – whilst beer made from barley was relatively widespread, being brewed both in Northern Europe and in sunnier climes, reflecting the broad range of climates in which barley can thrive. Fast-forward from the edges of prehistory and, with the increasing movement of agricultural commodities and final products globally, we can see examples of previously regional spirits (e.g. brandies, whiskies) being produced in non-traditional locations. Indeed to protect these various spirit categories, Scotch whisky, French brandies and tequila, in particular, are clearly defined in terms of their production, with regulations also clearly identifying restrictions as to the locations where such products can be made.\nThe production of distilled spirit-based drinks can be broken down into three broad operations: the preparation of a fermented extract; distillation; and downstream elaboration (Figure 1). Nevertheless, the diversity of raw materials used and the desired characteristics of the final products mean that there are many process variations across the distilled spirits sector. Here we review the global diversity of distilled spirits and compare and contrast methods of production.\nFigure 1: Routes to the production of distilled spirit drinks. Pre-distillation stages are dictated by raw materials required and the micro-organisms used to perform the fermentation, whilst post-distillation, there is considerable diversity depending on the final drinks style and market positioning.\nIn principle any raw material of agricultural origin that yields a source of fermentable sugars can be fermented and then distilled into a final spirit. This is broadly equivalent to the sugar/carbohydrate-bearing foods that have been consumed for millennia by populations across the globe (Figure 2, page 8). The raw materials used can be classified according to the complexity of the sugars contained. This is useful as most fermentation organisms work much more quickly on simple sugars. Indeed, most yeasts are unable to process complex carbohydrates and so need to be processed to break down complex carbohydrates into simpler, fer – mentable sugars.\nThe simple sugars are usually sucrose, glucose and fructose, all of which can be assimilated by a broad range of fermentation organisms to produce alcohol. The main complex carbohydrates used for alcohol fermentation are starch and inulin. Starch is made up of polymers of glucose whilst inulin – found principally in Agave for tequila production – is essentially a fructose polymer. So, for these to be effectively converted into alcohol they need to be hydrolysed. In the case of starch, amylase enzymes efficiently reduce starch to a range of simple sugars, including maltose, glucose and maltotriose.\nFor whiskies and brandies, in particular, strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are popular…\nThese enzymes can be sourced from the raw materials themselves – which is a mandatory requirement, for instance, for the production of Scotch whisky – or added exogenously. Interestingly, during Scotch whisky production the amylase enzymes continue to be active and further degrade residual dextrins, thereby increasing actual alcohol yields. Inulin, the carbohydrate source from Agave used in tequila production, is a little more tractable, and is partially hydrolysed into fructose by heating either in ovens or autoclaves. Additionally, residual fructans (i.e. fructose oligomers), which find use as soluble fibre, can be broken down by certain yeast strains.\nHistorically fermentations generally relied on infections by local fermentative organisms, allowing for the serendipitous conversion of sugars into alcohol. Even today this so-called spontaneous fermentation approach is still used by some companies to produce products, such as the French Armagnacs and Cognacs, facilitated by the grape-borne microflora, as well as a range of rums, cachaças and tequilas, fermented by plant-borne and adventitious micro-organisms. Whilst this may seem to add an unpredictable element to the fermentation process, in practice the potential variations are less than might be expected, for two reasons. Firstly, the indigenous microflora in and around the production plants and, in the case of sugar cane based fermentations, in the field, should be relatively stable. Secondly, and arguably of more practical significance, is that batches of distillates are often blended, so that variability is evened out to some extent. Nevertheless, it is prudent to check the sensory qualities of fermentations and subsequent distillates for any substantial deviations from the expected flavour performance.\nFigure 2: Diversity of raw materials used for the production of distilled spirit drinks. Note that all of the raw materials are of plant origin\nThe use of cultured organisms for fermentations is preferable where production volumes are larger and to reduce the risk of variability in the time taken for fermentations to complete. There is also a half-way house approach, whereby spontaneous fermentations can be supplemented by cultured yeasts to ensure their timely completion.\nThe organisms used for spirit production are diverse. For whiskies and brandies, in particular, strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are popular; not least for their alcohol tolerance. Certain strains can also tolerate higher temperatures, up to 36°C, which encourages faster fermentations. However, other organisms, such as lactic acid bacteria and even Zymomonas, also play a role in fermentations for distillate production. There are suggestions, though, that some spirit producers need to use antibiotics to suppress bacteria and allow spontaneous yeast fermentations to perform adequately.\nAnother variable in the fermentation process that provokes discussion is the material of construction for the fermentation vessels themselves. Traditionally constructed from one of various species of wood, many spirit manufacturers have turned to stainless steel instead. The latter does have advantages as it is easier to clean and sterilise, but some distillers are adamant that wooden fermentation vessels are superior, despite the cleaning issues. Indeed, wood is a much better insulator, allowing fermentation temperatures to rise more effectively.\nThe origins of distillation are not clear, but there is evidence to suggest that it has deep roots both in China and the Middle East. Under Paracelsian philosophy, distillation soon became associated with the creation of an elixir, the essence of a crude fermentation. (This notion was also evident in 17th century England where brewers were advised that boiling and evaporative losses from the boil were to be avoided as the essence of the beer was lost).\nThere are two broad design philosophies of a distillation process, based on batch or continuous processes. The former, often referred to as pot distillation, is generally used for smaller batch distillations. Legislation for Scotch malt whisky, Cognac, mezcal and rhum agricole insist that the spirit is made batch-wise from pot stills. For many other spirits it is up to the spirit distiller whether batch or continuous distillation is used. There is also some blurring at the edges. For instance, a doubler or thumper can be used as a second distillation step, containing the discarded liquids from previous distillations. This is a common approach for bourbon production.\nIn any case the role of the distillation process is to separate an alcohol-rich liquid from a base fermentation. Generally, the strength of the spirit leaving the still is dependent not only on the original strength of the fermented broth, but also the amount of contact that vapour has with the inside of the still. Introducing vapour restrictions – such as a more convoluted still design or putting plates or baffles into the still – helps to increase the alcohol concentration in the distilled spirits. This refinement also helps to tune out other fermentation flavours, so helping to create a more neutral flavour. Indeed, using columns with a large number of plates can be used to create neutral spirit, required for products such as gin and vodka.\nIn many cases what exits the still is not exactly what is sold. Rather it requires some form of downstream processing to create the product for sale. This can be as simple as filtration followed by dilution to sales strength before bottling, in the case of, say, the production of some vodkas. The main downstream elaborations applied before finishing (i.e. optional colour adjustment, filtration, dilution and packaging) are maturation, often in the presence of wood, re-distillation with botanicals, maceration with botanicals, compounding and, occasionally, carbon filtration for the removal of minor flavour components from, for example, vodkas.\nABF Ingredients ANDEROL EUROPE BV Avantes Berndorf Band GmbH BIOTECON Diagnostics GmbH Bruker BioSpin Cargo Oil AB Elea GmbH Engilico FUCHS LUBRITECH GmbH GLOBALG.A.P.

But what is distillation, exactly? What’s going on inside those sculpted pots or complicated columns? And what role does distillation play in developing the ultimate character of distilled spirits?\nDistillation hinges on a simple principle: Different molecules have different boiling points. Ethanol, for instance, boils at around 172 degrees Fahrenheit, while water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. If you have a solution made up of different molecules with different boiling points, you can use distillation to separate those components by capturing the vapor produced by boiling the liquid.\nTake Scotch whisky, for instance. The wash (that’s the fermented liquid made with barley, water, and yeast) loaded into the still is only about 8% alcohol, give or take–not much stronger than your after-work beer. But whisky, of course, is much stronger than that.\nTo concentrate the alcohol, distillers start to heat the wash in the pot of their stills. Eventually, the wash begins to steam. Because alcohol boils at a lower temperature than water, that steam is much stronger in alcohol concentration than the wash. In the case of Scotch and Irish whiskey (or any pot-distilled whiskey) the vapor travels up into the swan neck (or lyne arm) of the still, where it passes over the top and encounters a condenser. That condenser returns it to a liquid, called a distillate, at which point it exits the still through the spirit safe.\nThat’s the basic principle, and it applies to other kinds of distilled spirits as well, such as rum, brandy, and tequila. But things get more complicated depending on the distillation process, the distilling method, and, of course, the art of distilling itself.\nHEADS, HEARTS, AND TAILS\nIt’s important to remember that the amount of alcohol in the vapor isn’t a fixed concentration. Instead, it’s a gradient. The first vapors to emerge from the wash have the highest alcohol content. Over time, that content slowly diminishes, until it reaches zero.\nTo accommodate that gradient, distillers separate the spirit stream into fractions by making cuts. The first part of the run–the heads–is the strongest. But along with ethyl alcohol (the good kind), the heads also contain toxic, volatile compounds like methanol and acetone. Plus, they smell like nail polish remover. So distillers separate the heads, and usually redirect them into the next batch to be re-distilled.\nNext comes the good part of the run: the hearts. This section is still full of alcohol, but it also tastes good, often with a strong character of the raw ingredient being distilled. The hearts are captured in a special tank to be filled into barrels later on.\nEventually, the alcoholic strength drops further, and the run enters the tails. This last part of the run is less alcoholic by volume, plus it starts to develop heavy, funky flavors like wet cardboard and old towels. But, just like the heads, most distillers redirect it to the next batch for redistillation so as not to waste any alcohol.\nWhen exactly to make the cuts is one of the most critical decisions a distiller makes. While there are guidelines, there’s no hard-and-fast rule, and distillers rely on their past experience, their senses, their artistry, and their intuition to make the right cuts that will form the foundation for the final flavor profile.\nMost American whiskeys like bourbon and rye, as well as many rums, vodkas, and tequilas, are actually made on column stills, a style of equipment most famously associated with the Irish inventor Aeneas Coffey, who patented a version of it in 1830. Instead of the batch system of pot still distillation, his Coffey still could be run continuously, making it more efficient.\nModern large scale bourbon stills operate in much the same manner, relying on steam heat to separate a fermented mash into fractions continuously. They consist of a column filled with multiple chambers filled with porous barriers (either sieve trays or bubble cap trays, depending on the style and location within the column. Fermented wash is piped into the column about two thirds of the way up, while steam is piped into the bottom.\nAs the steam passes through the wash, the wash begins to boil. The alcoholic vapor then rises through the column, condensing and re-vaporising every time it encounters one of the trays, and becoming more alcoholic in each chamber. Instead of making cuts over time, the still lets distillers extract their desired fraction from the column, while eliminating the spent mash.\nMost of Barrell Craft Spirits’ whiskeys, like our Small Batch Bourbons and Small Batch Ryes, are made on column stills, simply because that’s the most common type in the United States. But we love a good pot-still whiskey, too, and many of our rums are made on pot stills. They’re just two different ways to make great spirits.']	['<urn:uuid:710049b4-79ca-424f-b21f-730ae1e00b6d>', '<urn:uuid:9f3aa6b7-225f-4144-902a-38fd035fd70d>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	14	83	2312
74	I study geology and wonder what makes Moon craters special and what affects their age estimates?	Moon craters are special because they help determine surface ages through crater counting - more cratered surfaces are older, dating back to the Heavy Bombardment period, while fewer craters indicate newer surfaces reshaped by volcanism. However, accurate age estimation is complicated by several factors: Different terrain features and varied surface composition affect crater formation, and highly porous surfaces like those found in areas with magmatic foam (a frothy combination of lava and gas) can significantly distort age calculations. This is because porous targets create much smaller craters than normal, and many craters may not even be visible. For example, an impact that would create a 100-foot crater in lunar basalt bedrock would only form a 30-foot crater in magmatic foam deposits.	['I’ve spent my morning sitting in talks at the EPSC meeting (location in attached image) on new lunar results from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. At this stage, my brain is full (does that make my loony?) so I think it’s time to blog it all out. (sadly, not enough bandwidth for pictures).\nFirst though, I have a confession to make. Yesterday I played hooky. During the opening session a friendly woman on the organizing committee admonished us all to go out and see Rome. Being one to (often but not always) do as I’m told, I set out with another colleague to explore. With a certain amount of brownian motion, we wended our way from the conference site (near the Foro Romano) all the way to the Vatican. While we did go into St Peter’s Basilica (which was overwhelming), the lines were too long to get into the Sistine Chapel or the Vatican Museum.\nHaving walked myself out, getting one set of blisters from one pair of shoes on Sunday and getting a second set of blisters from a second pair of shoes yesterday, I have officially walked my feet off and I’m prepared to sit through today’s LRO talks, tomorrow’s MESSENGER talks, and Thursday’s Education and Public Outreach talks.\nThis mornings LRO talks spanned both instrumentation and geophysics. In my head, the overall theme seemed to be, how do we better understand the geophysics of the moon through impacts, and how does this relate to past, resent and future lunar exploration.\nLRO is perhaps uniquely designed to address these themes. It possesses cameras that are taking the highest resolution lunar images ever achieved. From its low (50km, I believe) orbital altitude, the LRO’s Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) can obtain images with 50cm per pixel resolution. This means that an average sized person like me, sprawled out on the surface of the moon, would show up as a couple pixel blip. In addition to this super hi-res capability, the Wide Angle Camera (WAC) possesses 7 different filters, allowing it to sample the Moon’s reflected light all across the UV and visible light wavelengths. Since different minerals reflect different colors of light, by looking at maps made by comparing light in two different wavelengths (for those of you wanting numbers, they use maps of 321nm/689nm & 415nm/689nm) they are able to map out different minerals. While this may sound like a lot of boring geochemistry, the reality is they’re able to overlay the reflectance ratios on the high resolution images and show how impacts reveal a variety of different minerals and the dig through the lunar strata, how lunar melt transported minerals of a given composition, and the overall variation of the surrounding plains. While these images aren’t a replacement for actually going and picking up rocks, they are a start to understanding the point by point composition of the moon and they do help us find places of interest.\nIn addition to revealing hints at mineralogy through color, the NAC images just flat out reveal amazing detail simply by being really amazing images. From expansion lines in the crust on the highlands on the far side of the moon (called extension features), to melt flows and land slides, to the fine details in craters, the images reveal a whole new moon. And they reveal the moon in stereo. The NAC images are actually done in pairs, and done over and over in different lighting conditions. From the left and right (technically east and west) pairs, we can get a 3d view of the moon. By comparing the moon under different lighting you can reveal different features. With the sun near zenith, different minerals are easier to discern from their reflectance. If the sun is near the horizon in an image, shadows will be long, allowing boulders and spacecraft to more easily be found by following long shadows to their source. By registering the stereo images with lunar laser altimetry data from LOLA it is possible to get a fine grained understanding of lunar topography.\nOne of the frustrations of this meeting is that fabulous images are being shown that aren’t public or published yet (there is a strict NO PHOTOGRAPHY rule). The most amazing images they showed this morning were actually slope maps. I know, sounds boring, but loop rather like modern art (googling for examples will occur when I have real Internet. We’ve all probably seen topographic maps of the moon where the bottoms of craters are one color, and the lunar highlands are another, with a rainbow connecting these extremes. What is obscured in these images is the slopes from one altitude to another. In slope maps, the floor of craters are seen as flat (with sometimes a cusp in the center), and the highlands, again, are shown as flat, with the slope from one extreme to the next showing up as a variety of colors. No where else have I seen the terraced nature of some impact basins so clearly delineated.\nIn the vocabulary of geophysics, craters come with many names. The largest of the splotches on a surface are actually called impact basins, and due to their size and the energy they impart to the surface they’re hitting, they often create a series of concentric rings, like shock waves solidifying in the lunar surface. Smaller impacts, simply called impact craters, may sometimes have a central hump, but are more generally conical walled with a single rim.\nTo understand what type of craters and basins are formed thru what types of impacts, various nations have thrown things at the moon. The soviets did this largely by accident, landing some of their Luna missions a bit harder than intended. The Americans purposely impacted the top stage of the Saturn rockets (the SIVB impacts) into the lunar surface. Since each of these missions had a mostly understand angle of impact and velocity (errors were enough that not all landing locations were where we thought), we’re able to look at each impact and say, If X hits a surface composed of Y with a velocity V, then we get an impact that looks like Z. Such impacts provide calibration information, helping to put larger and smaller craters in a known context.\nUnderstanding craters is important for a lot of reasons. To first order, craters are important because by counting them we can sort the ages of different surfaces. Highly cratered surfaces are very old, showing evidence of the age of Heavy Bombardment that impacted the early solar system. Newer surfaces have few or no craters, and have been resurfaced by volcanism or other techtonic events. Since different size crateres are created at different rates (and at nonlinearly changing rates over time), craters of all sizes are counted, and the overall distribution is used to get point to point ages. This technique would work easy easy if only the moon had a smooth surface made of just one type of material. Since the real moon has all sorts of terrain features and a varied surface composition this actually is fairly complicated. For instance, in counting craters on the three landslide segments around the Apollo 17 landing site, different ages are determined for each of these segments, even though they should have formed at the same time. These variations may come from differences in slope or sheltering from impacts by the topography. Similar odd discrepancies in age are also seen when comparing ages of the melt pools and ejecta blankets of the Tycho and Copernicus craters. Here, the differences are believed to come from surface differences in hardness between these two features. Craters that span regions are seen to have different depths where they overlap each surface.\nThe more we look at the moon, the more it is clear we have a lot to learn. One of the things that keeps coming up is the need for more rocks – for more tangible ways to calibrate our crater mapping to get accurate surface ages. While robots are nice, people are more versatile, and in looking at craters, notes are also being made on where craters stay in constant shadow (with potential ice and where we can build safer human habitats out of direct solar view and with fewer temperature variations to deal with), and where polar surfaces are almost in constant light (which is good for solar panels). It is clear, the more we learn, the more we want to just go and again dig in the lunar dirt. While robots are capable (and the Lunokhod 2 lander certainly showed a rover can rove all the heck over the place if it wants to), people still just want to fly away to the moon.', 'Liars In Public Places: How A Lying Lunar Volcano Hides Its True Age\nBy Judith E Braffman-Miller\n“The truth does not change because it is, or is not, believed by a majority of the people,” said the Italian Dominican friar, philosopher, mathematician, poet, and cosmological theorist, Giordano Bruno (1548-1600)–who was ultimately martyred for his beliefs. Some lies, of course, are worse than others and lying about one’s age is not considered to be a particularly sinister lie. Indeed, while orbiting Earth’s Moon in 1971, the astronauts aboard Apollo 15 photographed a bewitching, bothersome, and bewildering geological feature–a strange, bumpy, D-shaped depression approximately two miles long and a mile wide, that has sung a sirens’ song of tantalizing mystery to scientists ever since. Some scientists have proposed that the bizarre feature, named Ina, is evidence of a volcanic eruption on Earth’s Moon within the past 100 million years–a billion years or so after most volcanic activity on the Moon is thought to have come to an end. However, new research released by geologists in March 2017, indicates that Ina may be deceiving scientists about its age, and is really not so young after all.\nThe new research, published in the journal Geology, concludes that the strange feature was really formed by an eruption around 3.5 billion years ago, making it approximately the same age as the dark volcanic deposits streaking the Moon’s near-side. It’s this very same peculiar form of lava that erupted from Ina that helps hide its real age, the planetary scientists propose.\n“As interesting as it would be for Ina to have formed in the recent geologic past, we just don’t think that’s the case. The model we’ve developed for Ina’s formation puts it firmly within the period of peak volcanic activity on the Moon several billion years ago,” explained Dr. Jim Head in a March 28, 2017, Brown University Press Release. Dr. Head is co-author of the paper and a professor in Brown University’s Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences in Providence, Rhode Island.\nFootprints Left In Lunar Dust\nEarth’s Moon is the only body beyond Earth that we have walked upon, leaving our footprints behind in the lunar dust–a silent testimony that we were once there. Earth’s companion Moon-world has been with us almost from the very beginning, when our Solar System was still forming, approximately 4.5 billion years ago.\nAs human beings, we apparently have a need to understand and explain our origins. The universal drama of natural phenomena cannot be explained entirely as exclusively scientific–it is, instead, something generally human. Through magical, bewitching myths and remarkable, lovely tales that involve superhuman heroes and heroines, as well as gods and goddesses, ancient pre-scientific civilizations tried to understand the mysterious, elusive complexities of the Cosmos. Earth’s Moon has always presented humanity with a special fascination, long inspiring our very human imaginations to transcend some very frustrating limitations and–as we hunt for that which may exist beyond our Earth-bound lives–help us to progress towards an understanding of who we really are, in the Cosmic scheme of things, in all our bewildering human complexity. The fabrication of ancient gods and goddesses mimics our lovely Moon’s gentle tug on human life existing on our planet. In this particular context, it may be lacking in wisdom to completely dismiss ancient, wild myths–tossing them aside as merely the inventions of those who lived in an unsophisticated, long-forgotten, and long-lost past.\nThere are more than 100 moons orbiting the eight major planets of our Solar System. The majority of them are icy, small worldlets, that contain only a relatively sparse amount of rocky material–and most of these frozen little objects do their mesmerizing dance around the quartet of gaseous, giant planets inhabiting the distant regions of the outer Solar System–Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. In dramatic contrast, the warm and well-lit inner region of our Solar System–where are own Earth is situated–is almost moonless. Of the small, solid quartet of relatively tiny terrestrial planets–Mercury, Venus, our Earth, and Mars–only Earth can boast the existence of a large and significant Moon. Mercury and Venus are entirely without a companion moon, and Mars is circled by an interesting, but small, duo of lumpy, misshapen moons, dubbed Phobos and Deimos. The two potato-shaped moons of Mars are frequently considered to be asteroids that escaped from the Main Asteroid Belt, situated between Mars and Jupiter, that were ultimately captured by the gravitational embrace of their adopted planet very long ago.\nA moon is a natural satellite in orbit around a larger body–such as a planet–that, in turn, orbits a star. The moon is kept in place both by the gravity of the object that it orbits, as well as by its own gravity. Some planets have moons; some do not. Some dwarf planets–such as Pluto–possess moons. Indeed, one of Pluto’s quintet of moons, Charon, is almost 50% the size of Pluto itself, and some planetary scientists think that Charon is actually a big chunk of Pluto that was ripped away in a monumental, disastrous collision with another object when our Solar System was much younger. Also, some asteroids are circled by very tiny moons of their own!\nVolcanism On Earth’s Moon\nVast plains of basaltic lava coat much of the lunar surface. Early astronomers, using primitive instruments, erroneously thought that these plains were seas of water on the Moon. Therefore, these dark regions were named mare (pronounced mahr-ay), which is Latin for “sea”. Furthermore, other volcanic features also appear within the lunar mare–such as sinuous rilles, dark mantle deposits, and small volcanic cones and domes. However, the majority of these volcanic features are somewhat small, and they account for only an insignificant percentage of the volcanic record left to scar the surface of the Moon.\nVolcanism on the Moon is different in several ways from volcanism on Earth. First, there is the matter of age. Volcanism on our own planet is a continuing process, and many of Earth’s volcanoes are actually quite youthful on geologic timescales–frequently less than a few hundred thousand years old. In dramatic contrast, most of the volcanism on the Moon appears to have occurred between 3 and 4 billion years ago. Mare samples usually are about 3,500,000,000 years old.\nEven the most youthful mare flows have approximate ages of almost 1 billion years. These “young” rocks have not been sampled directly or dated. Therefore, the age of these rocks has not been precisely determined. By comparison, the oldest rock on Earth has been dated at about 3.9 billion years old. The most ancient sea floor basalts on our planet are a “mere” 200 million years old–a brief span on geologic timescales. Because the Moon shows no sign of recent volcanic or geologic activity, it is sometimes referred to as a “dead” object.\nThe locations of mare volcanism show yet another significant difference from the volcanism that occurs on our planet. Earth’s volcanoes primarily are situated within long linear mountain chains, such as the Andes, that mark the edge of a lithospheric plate. Mountain chains such as the Hawaiian Islands trace out past plate movements over a hotspot on Earth’s mantle.\nBut the lunar mare usually occur at the bottom of ancient, large impact craters. Therefore, most mare are almost circular in shape. In addition, lunar mountain chains form the edges of these impact basins and have a tendency to encircle the lunar mare. There is also no evidence that plate tectonics ever occurred on the Moon.\nThe lunar mare are most frequently found on only one side of the Moon–covering almost one-third of the lunar near-side–but a mere 2% of the far-side. However, the lunar surface is much higher on the far-side, and the crust is usually much thicker there as well. Therefore, the most important factors controlling volcanism on the Moon appear to be surface elevation and crustal thickness.\nThere are some major physical differences between volcanism on our planet and its lunar companion. First, lunar gravity is only one-sixth that of Earth’s. This causes the forces that are driving the lava flows to be significantly weaker on the Moon than on Earth. The flat, smooth mare surfaces suggest that the lavas that formed them were rather runny. They could flow easily and spread out over large areas of the lunar surface. In addition, the comparatively weak gravity could be responsible for explosive eruptions that can hurl debris on the Moon further than on the Earth. Eruptions on the Moon, therefore, should smear lavas out into a broad flat layer, in contrast to the cone-shaped features on our planet. Second, Earth’s dry Moon has essentially no dissolved water. In fact, the so-called “seas” are dry as bone. In dramatic contrast, water is one of the starring players in Earth’s lavas. Water also is important in driving violent volcanic eruptions on Earth. Therefore, the lack of water on the Moon should significantly affect lunar volcanism. This is because, without water, explosive and violent volcanic eruptions are much less likely to occur on Earth’s Moon than on Earth. Indeed, lunar lava should flow quietly, smoothly, and even gently on the Moon’s surface.\nIna: A Lying Lunar Volcano\nIna is situated near the summit of a gently sloped mound of basaltic rock. This location has caused many planetary scientists to propose that it was probably the caldera of an ancient volcano on the Moon. However, it has been difficult to determine just how ancient Ina really is. While the flanks of the volcano appear to be billions of years old, the Ina caldera itself looks considerably younger. One misleading sign of Ina’s so-called “youth” is its bright appearance relative to its environment. The brightness indicates that Ina is of tender years, and has not had sufficient time to accumulate a great quantity regolith. Regolith is the layer of loose rock and dust that builds up on the surface as time goes by.\nIn addition, there are about 80 distinctive mounds found on Ina. These mounds are smooth hills composed of rock, with some reaching as high as 100 feet, dominating the landscape within the caldera. The mounds show far fewer impact craters when compared to the surrounding area–another sign of relative youth. Old surfaces are scarred by more craters than younger surfaces. This is because, over time, it’s expected that a surface should accumulate more and more craters, as a result of impacting objects. The craters should be of various sizes and accumulate at fairly constant rates. Planetary scientists, knowing this, use the number and size of craters to calculate the relative age of a given surface. In 2014, a team of planetary scientists performed a very careful crater-count on Ina’s mounds, and came to the conclusion that they must have been formed by lava that erupted to the surface within the last 50 to 100 million years–thus indicating youth.\n“That was a really puzzling finding. I think most people agree that the volcano Ina sits on was formed billions of years ago, which means there would have been a pause in volcanic activity for a billion years or more before the activity that formed Ina. We wanted to see if there might be something about geologic structure within Ina that throws off our estimation of its age,” Dr. Head explained in the March 28, 2017 Brown University Press Release.\nIn order to solve the mystery of Ina’s true age, the team of scientists looked at well-studied volcanoes on Earth that were similar to Ina. Ina is a pit crater on a shield volcano, a gently sloping mountain that is comparable to Kilauea volcano in Hawaii. Kilauea displays a pit crater similar to Ina that has been named the Kilauea Iki crater, which erupted back in 1959.\nThe lava that was shot out from that eruption solidified. As it did so, it formed a very porous layer of rock inside the pit, with subsurface vesicles reaching three feet in diameter, as well as surface void space two feet deep. Dr. Head and his colleagues propose the porous surface is formed by the type of lava erupted during the later stages of events like this particular eruption. As the subsurface lava supply began to diminish, it erupted what has been called “magmatic foam”, which is a frothy combination of lava and gas. As it cools off, magmatic foam turns into a solid, and as it does so it creates the highly porous surface.\nDr. Head and his team propose that an Ina eruption would also have manufactured magmatic foam. Furthermore, because of the Moon’s comparatively weak gravitational grasp, and almost nonexistent atmosphere, the lunar magmatic foam would have been fluffier than that seen on Earth. As a result, the scientists suspect that the structures hidden within Ina are even more porous than on Earth.\nIt’s the high porosity of those surfaces that presents problems in respect to date estimates for Ina, both by hiding the buildup of regolith and by throwing off crater counts.\nA very porous surface, according to Dr. Head and his colleagues, would cause dust and loose rock to invade the surface void space. This would make it appear as though less regolith has accumulated. That process would be perpetuated by seismic jostling in the area, much of which is the result of continuing meteor impacts. “It’s like banging on the side of a sieve to make the flour go through. Regolith is jostled into holes rather than sitting on the surface, which makes Ina look a lot younger,” Dr. Head explained in the March 28, 2017 Brown University Press Release.\nThis high porosity would also affect crater counts. Laboratory experiments using a high-speed projectile cannon have demonstrated that impacts pelting porous targets create much tinier craters. Because of Ina’s high porosity, the planetary scientists propose, its craters are considerably smaller than they would normally be. Furthermore, many of the craters might not be visible at all. This would drastically alter the age estimate derived from crater counts.\nThe team of planetary scientists then went on to estimate that this highly porous surface would diminish, by a factor of three, the size of craters pockmarking Ina’s mounds. This is because an impactor, that would excavate a 100-foot-diameter crater in lunar basalt bedrock, would form a crater of only a little over 30 feet in the magmatic foam deposit. Taking this crater-size-reduction into consideration, the planetary scientists arrived at a revised age for the Ina mounds of approximately 3.5 billion years. This age is similar to the surface age of the volcanic shield that surrounds Ina–and also places the Ina activity within the time frame of calculated volcanism on the Moon.\nThe planetary scientists think that this research presents a plausible explanation for Ina’s formation without having to resort to the mysterious billion-year absence of volcanic activity.\nLe Qiao, a doctoral student visitng Brown University from the Chinese University of Geosciences, is the lead author of the research.\nDr. Head said in the March 28, 2017 Brown University Press Release that “We think the young-looking features in Ina are the natural consequence of magmatic foam eruptions on the Moon. These landforms created by these foams simply look a lot younger than they are.”\nJudith E.

75	I've noticed holes in the leaves of my tomato plants every morning. Can you tell me what could be eating them and what I should look for to confirm my suspicions?	Based on the damage pattern you're describing, slugs are likely the culprits. To confirm a slug infestation, look for these specific signs: irregular holes or jagged edges on leaves, slimy trails on plants or the ground, and the presence of the slugs themselves, particularly during early morning hours or after rainfall. Common slug species you might encounter include the gray garden slug, the black slug, and the leopard slug.	['Gardening is a fulfilling and rewarding hobby, but it can become frustrating when slugs start invading your garden and wreaking havoc on your precious plants. These slimy creatures have a knack for devouring foliage, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. However, with the right knowledge and strategies, you can effectively get rid of slugs and protect your garden oasis. In this article, we will explore various methods to eliminate slugs from your garden, from natural remedies to cultural practices and integrated pest management.\nMaintaining a slug-free garden is essential for the health and vitality of your plants. Slugs can cause significant damage to both ornamental and edible plants, ruining months of hard work and dedication. Their feeding habits can lead to unsightly holes in leaves, seedlings being decimated overnight, and the frustration of seeing your favorite flowers and vegetables being devoured. To ensure the success of your garden and preserve its beauty, it is crucial to take proactive measures to control and eliminate slugs.\nBefore diving into the methods of slug control, let’s take a moment to understand these slimy intruders. Slugs are soft-bodied mollusks belonging to the class Gastropoda. They have long, muscular bodies and move by gliding on a slimy trail produced by their foot. Slugs thrive in moist environments and are particularly active during damp and cool weather conditions. They are hermaphrodites, meaning they possess both male and female reproductive organs. Slugs lay clusters of gelatinous eggs in damp soil or hidden crevices, which eventually hatch into tiny slug larvae.\nIdentifying Slug Infestation\nTo effectively combat slug infestation, it is important to identify their presence in your garden. There are several signs that indicate a slug infestation. Look out for chewed leaves with irregular holes or jagged edges, slimy trails on plants or the ground, and the presence of slugs during early morning or after rainfall. Additionally, you may come across the slugs themselves, which can vary in size, color, and pattern. Common slug species include the gray garden slug, the black slug, and the leopard slug. By familiarizing yourself with these signs and species, you can take appropriate action to control the slug population.\nPreventing slug infestation is key to maintaining a healthy garden. Here are some effective prevention methods to consider:\na. Creating physical barriers to deter slugs: Install barriers such as copper tape or wire around the edges of garden beds, pots, or raised planters. Slugs dislike the electrical charge created by copper and are deterred from crossing the barrier.\nb. Choosing slug-resistant plants for your garden: Select plants that are less appealing to slugs. Varieties such as lavender, rosemary, geraniums, and begonias are known to be less attractive to slugs.\nc. Implementing proper garden hygiene practices: Keep your garden clean and free of debris, as slugs tend to hide in dark, damp areas. Regularly remove fallen leaves, mulch, and weeds that can provide hiding spots for slugs.\nIf slugs have already invaded your garden, you can employ various natural remedies to deter and control them:\na. Using copper tape or wire to repel slugs: As mentioned earlier, copper creates an unpleasant sensation for slugs. Encircle pots, raised beds, or specific areas with copper tape or wire to prevent slugs from reaching your plants.\nb. Applying diatomaceous earth as a barrier: Diatomaceous earth is a natural substance made from fossilized remains of aquatic organisms. Sprinkle a thin layer of diatomaceous earth around your plants. Its sharp particles will deter slugs as they crawl across it.\nc. Making beer traps to catch slugs: Bury a container, such as a shallow dish or jar, partially filled with beer in the ground. Slugs are attracted to the scent of beer and will crawl into the container and drown. Empty and refill the traps regularly.\nOrganic Slug Control Products\nIf natural remedies alone aren’t sufficient, you can explore organic slug control products that are safe for both your plants and the environment. Some effective options include:\na. Iron phosphate-based baits: Iron phosphate baits are organic and pose no harm to humans, pets, or wildlife. Scatter the pellets around your garden, following the instructions on the packaging. The slugs will consume the bait, which will eventually cause their demise.\nb. Nematodes as a biological control method: Nematodes are microscopic worms that naturally occur in soil. Certain species of nematodes, such as Steinernema carpocapsae, are effective in controlling slugs. Apply nematodes to the soil according to the instructions to target slug larvae and adults.\nModifying the environment in your garden can create conditions that are unfavorable for slugs. Consider the following methods:\na. Creating a dry environment to discourage slugs: Slugs thrive in moist conditions, so ensuring your garden has good drainage can make the environment less appealing to them. Avoid overwatering and provide adequate airflow to keep the soil relatively dry.\nb. Using companion planting to repel slugs: Certain plants, such as garlic, fennel, and mint, have natural repellent properties against slugs. Interplanting these repellent plants among your vulnerable plants can help deter slugs. Additionally, planting slug-resistant flowers like marigolds can act as a natural barrier.\nNon-Toxic Chemical Solutions\nIf natural and organic methods are not achieving the desired results, you can consider non-toxic chemical solutions for slug control. It’s important to choose products that are safe for the environment, beneficial insects, and other wildlife. Follow these guidelines for safe and effective use:\na. Safe chemical options for slug control: Look for products containing iron phosphate or ferric sodium EDTA as active ingredients. These substances are considered safe for use in gardens and pose minimal risk to non-target organisms.\nb. Understanding the proper application of chemical solutions: Read and follow the instructions provided with the chemical product carefully. Apply the solution as directed, focusing on slug-prone areas of your garden. Avoid over-application and use chemical control methods as a last resort.\nImplementing certain cultural practices can help minimize slug infestation in your garden. Consider the following techniques:\na. Using mulch to deter slugs: Apply a layer of coarse mulch, such as straw or wood chips, around your plants. This creates a barrier that slugs find difficult to cross. Avoid using fine or moist mulch, as it can provide a favorable environment for slugs.\nb. Regularly removing hiding places for slugs: Inspect your garden regularly and remove potential hiding spots for slugs, such as boards, rocks, and plant debris. By eliminating these hiding places, you make your garden less inviting to slugs.\nMaintenance and Monitoring\nMaintaining a slug-free garden requires consistent effort and monitoring. Follow these tips for ongoing maintenance:\na. Regularly inspecting the garden for signs of slugs: Check your plants and the surrounding area for slug damage, slime trails, and the presence of slugs. Early detection allows for prompt intervention and prevents further damage.\nb. Maintaining slug control methods throughout the season: Continuously apply preventive measures and monitor slug activity throughout the gardening season. Regularly replenish barriers, refresh baits, and adjust cultural practices as needed.\nIntegrated Pest Management (IPM)\nAdopting an integrated pest management approach is crucial for effective slug control. Integrated pest management combines multiple strategies to minimize pest damage while minimizing the use of harmful chemicals. Incorporate the following practices:\na. Adopting an integrated approach to slug control: Combine various methods discussed in this article, such as physical barriers, natural remedies, cultural practices, and organic slug control products. By using multiple techniques, you create a comprehensive and effective defense against slugs.\nb. Combining multiple methods for effective results: Implement a combination of slug prevention, natural remedies, environmental modifications, and other strategies tailored to your specific garden. This holistic approach increases your chances of successful slug control while maintaining a healthy and balanced garden ecosystem.\nImportance of Early Intervention\nTaking prompt action at the first sign of slug infestation is crucial to prevent their population from multiplying and causing significant damage. By addressing the issue early on, you can minimize the impact on your garden and ensure the well-being of your plants.\nDealing with slugs in the garden can be a challenging task, but with the right strategies, you can effectively control and minimize their presence. By implementing preventive measures, utilizing natural remedies, considering organic slug control products, modifying the garden environment, and practicing integrated pest management, you can create a slug-free haven for your plants. Remember to monitor your garden regularly, adjust your methods as needed, and take action at the first sign of slug infestation. With perseverance and proactive care, you can enjoy a flourishing and beautiful garden, free from the nuisance of slugs.\n1. Are slugs harmful to my plants? Yes, slugs can cause significant damage to plants by feeding on leaves, stems, and even fruits. Their feeding can lead to stunted growth, unsightly holes, and in severe cases, plant death.\n2. How can I attract slug predators to my garden? Encouraging natural slug predators like birds, frogs, toads, and certain beneficial insects can help control slug populations. Providing bird feeders, creating water sources, and incorporating native plants can attract these natural predators to your garden.\n3. Can I use salt to get rid of slugs? While salt can effectively kill slugs, it is not recommended as a control method. Salt can also harm plants and soil, so it’s best to use alternative slug control strategies that are safe for your garden ecosystem.\n4. Should I use chemical pesticides to eliminate slugs? Chemical pesticides should be used as a last resort and only if they are specifically labeled for slug control. Opt for non-toxic options like iron phosphate-based baits and follow the instructions carefully to minimize environmental impact.\n5. How often should I check my garden for slug activity? Regular monitoring is essential to catch slug infestations early. Check your garden at least once a week, especially after rainfall or during periods of high slug activity, and take necessary measures to control them.']	['<urn:uuid:f053d7ca-5ab1-46ba-b62f-0e44ed1e297a>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	31	69	1641
76	I'm looking to brew beer during summer but worried about fermentation temperatures - which yeast strains would perform well in warmer conditions?	For warm fermentation conditions, several yeast strains perform well: Wyeast's 1028 London Ale or 1968 Special London Ale, BrewTek CL-160 British Draft Ale, Yeast Culture Kit A17, and Yeast Lab A03 London Ale. Wyeast 1056 American Chico and 1338 European Ale also do well at higher temperatures. For dry yeast options, Cooper's has a good reputation for performing well at higher temperatures.	['It’s 200 degrees outside. In the shade. Humidity is a million percent. Inside, it’s 250 degrees. All the windows are open, but there’s no breeze and nightfall brings no relief. When you finally fall asleep, after flipping the pillow to the cool side for the hundredth time, the cicadas wake you up.\nThe Weather Channel says tomorrow will be another record breaker, and now you are stuck to your naugahyde Barcolounger.\nToo hot to brew, right?\nIf you can peel yourself from the cheap chair and don’t mind standing over a pot of boiling brew, you can brew in the summer. All it takes is some good old-fashioned Yankee Homebrew Ingenuity and a little planning.\nYou have probably heard about the problems associated with too-warm beer fermentation: yeast run wild, infection leading to butter, and other nasties. Too-warm fermenting conditions can produce weird flavors in your beer, such as ethyl acetate (nail polish remover), fusel alcohols, and even rotten egg aromas. This is not a technical article, so we can skip the figures and equations. Suffice to say that if your ferment temperature is too high, your beer flavor may suffer.\nWarm fermentation can also spur production of fusel alcohols and other compounds that can cause a blockbuster katzenjammer the morning after.\nBut armed with that knowledge, you can choose a brew that won’t mind the heat of the kitchen.\nChoose the Right Brew\nFor summer brewing it’s best to shelve plans to make a light Czech pilsner or American lawnmower beer. The basic rule is by the time it’s hot enough for you to crave icy-cold light lager, it’s too late to make it.\nIt’s better to choose a gutsy ale, stout, or porter. These brews are more forgiving of esters and excess fruitiness spurred by the warm ferment. You should also choose a yeast strain that can handle the heat.\nAssuming you have mastered the art of liquid yeast cultures, choose a forgiving strain of ale yeast. (See BYO’s premier edition if you need a brush-up on handling liquid yeast cultures).\nWyeast’s 1028 London Ale or 1968 Special London Ale are good choices. They will perform at higher temperatures and will leave a butterscotch note, completely appropriate in English ale. The same goes for BrewTek CL-160 British Draft Ale, Yeast Culture Kit A17, and Yeast Lab A03 London Ale. Wyeast 1056 American Chico and 1338 European Ale will also do well at higher temperatures.\nIf you crave the riot of diabolically complex flavors in Belgian beer, now is the time to experiment with an abbey, trappist, or white (wit) style. The heat will maximize production of fruit notes for which those styles are famous. Try any of BrewTek’s Belgian ale series, Wyeast 1214, Yeast Culture Kit A16, or Yeast Lab A08. For wit, try Wyeast 3944 or Yeast Culture Kit M01.\nIf you are using dry yeast, Cooper’s has gotten some good press for performing well at higher temps.\nChill Out, Carboy\nSo how do you keep that fermenting barrel cool when the rest of the house is about to burst into flames from the summer heat? As you can imagine, there are as many techniques as there are homebrewers.\nAbout the lowest low-tech option (and the least expensive) is the old towel-around-the-carboy trick.\nEverybody knows that as a liquid evaporates, its temperature drops. Why? Philadelphia refrigeration engineer Ike Ehrlich explained it this way: “Liquid evaporates in the presence of heat. But as it evaporates, it takes energy—in the form of heat—away from the surroundings. So the area very close to the evaporation will be cooler than the surrounding area.”\nIt’s why we get cold when we are wet. And why we sweat when it’s hot. As the sweat evaporates, it uses this trick of nature to cool the surface of the body. You can use nature’s tricks to keep your beer cool, too.\nYou will need a basin, bathtub, or even your brewpot, if it’s big enough for your carboy to fit inside. Put a few inches of water in the basin, wrap the carboy in a big beach towel, place it in the basin, wet the towel, and let nature take its course. It helps to tie or rubber-band the towel in place around the neck of the carboy to keep it from slipping off.\nThe towel wicks the water up from the basin and it evaporates, lowering the temperature of your fermenting brew, depending on the relative humidity at the time.\nThat’s probably this system’s biggest limitation: If you live in a really muggy place, evaporation comes close to a standstill during the humid “dog days” of summer.\nYou can help it along, though. As homebrewer Rick Theiner of Memphis discovered, an electric fan will accentuate the effect of evaporation. “I put a box fan next to the whole setup with a timer switch. The fan runs for about four hours a day. The evaporation rate is increased, and the towel stays damp since the fan does not run all the time,” Theiner says.\nThe towel system is low maintenance. You need only to keep an eye on the water level during the fermentation.\nThe Icebox Method\nDo you remember iceboxes? Or maybe you heard about them from your parents. Lots of folks still call the refrigerator an icebox. And the icebox was central to the life of Ralph and Alice Kramden (Norton was always foraging there).\nIn the old days everybody’s kitchen had a tightly insulated box with convenient compartments and doors. Every so often you bought a block of ice from the ice man and put it in the top compartment. This kept the food inside relatively cool.\nHomebrewer and equipment designer Dan Listermann of Norwood, Ohio, employs a variation on the icebox theme. “We have a broken refrigerator, the kind the tenants defrosted with a sharp knife. This is my icebox. I freeze milk jugs filled three-quarters full of water in my good fridge and each day place a few inside the old fridge with the fermenter.\n“I can depress the temperature up to 15° C (59° F). Perfect for ale in the summer, lager in the winter,” Listermann says.\nHe rotates the milk jugs, refreezing them as needed. He says the inside of the box gets rather damp, so he wipes it down with bleach solution every few days to prevent mildew.\nIf you don’t have a dead fridge, you could use a very large picnic cooler, standing on one end, or a wooden or cardboard box lined with Styrofoam as your icebox.\nStealing Cold Air\nIf you have air conditioning, either window units or central, another way to beat the heat is to route the cold air outflow to your fermenter before the air fills the room.\nJones Rutledge of Memphis uses this method: “I park the carboy as close as possible to the air conditioner. I made some cardboard deflectors to ensure the carboy gets plenty of cold air. This prevents having to run the AC full force, freezing everyone out.”\nA High-Tech Chicken Coop\nFridge-techie Ehrlich says if you can get your hands on a small window air conditioner, you can build an air-conditioned “chicken-coop.”\n“Stud it out, use plywood or paneling for the walls, and insulate every inch of the interior. Weather strip the door. Cut a hole and frame it out for the air conditioner, put on a pitched roof with some tar paper, and you’re in business,” he says.\nEhrlich uses a window AC unit to successfully cool to between 65 and 70° F. Lower than that and the unit’s coils will start to freeze. So don’t go this route if you have authentic lager in mind. But this idea is perfect for ale.\nGoing All the Way\nIf you really want to take control and thumb your nose at the summer heat, you will need a working refrigerator.\n“What’s the problem?” asks Ed McNierney of Groton, Massachusetts. “My brew fridge stays 44° F, even in the middle of July!”\nMcNierney admits he would rather brew light lager in the summer instead of stocking up on it in the spring. “I just can’t seem to let good beer sit around for months, waiting for the right drinking season. I recommend getting the spare fridge, assuming you have someplace to put it.\n“Mine came from a yard sale. A nearly new 21-cubic-foot box, with freezer, for $100. I ferment in the fridge section, store my hops and other goodies in the freezer section,” he says. In addition to yard sales, cheap fridges can be found at large apartment buildings because they often update their appliances.\nGoing the fridge route offers obvious advantages. You can brew whatever style you like whenever you like, without having to be concerned about overheated fermenters and fruit-salad aftertaste.\nTo really, really take control, you will need to invest in an external thermostat for your brew fridge. The thermostats installed in most refrigerators and freezers operate in a narrow range, around 35° to 45° F. Okay for lager but too cold for ale.\nThe best option here is the “plug ’n’ play” thermostat. You plug it into the electrical socket, then plug your fridge or freezer’s power cord into it. A temperature probe goes inside the box, and you simply set your desired temperature. Ready to rock ’n’ roll in 60 seconds. These run between $40 and $60 and are available at many well-equipped homebrew supply stores.\nBut as McNierney discovered, you might not need any help from an external device. “I don’t use any fancy auxiliary thermostat. I bought a $5 fridge thermometer from the kitchen store and fiddled with the temperature dials until I got it right. It’s good enough for me!” he explains.\nSo what are you waiting for? Scrape yourself from that Barcolounger and get brewing.']	['<urn:uuid:c6e0152b-0973-4776-8910-91309577a879>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	22	62	1638
77	john scofield guitar equipment used	John Scofield uses an Ibanez AS200 guitar and a Vox AC30 amp from the '90s.	"[""Guitarist John Scofield's new album Uberjam Deux (Decca) is a fascinating and energetic amalgam of jazz, R&B, soul and rock. Finding novel ways to merge music styles has long been a way of life for John. He was at the heart of the jazz-fusion movement in the early '80s, playing with Miles Davis, Pat Metheny, Billy Cobham and others. John is intensely curious, and his musical taste is eclectic and diverse. As a result, his compositions are often a dynamic braid of concepts, unified by his signature, metallic-meowing jazz-rock guitar style.\nUberjam Deux's beat-driven hybrids range from funk (Boogie Stupid), romantic soul (Al Green Song), Jamaican rocksteady (Camelus) and a Philly soul cover (Just Don't Want to Be Lonely). The beauty of John's music is that it combines influences and always stretches the form without losing the listener. In this regard, songs on his new album emerge as steel sculptures, with pieces affixed here and there—some rotating, some swinging.\nI asked John, 61, about his approach...\nJazzWax: Your new album is highly eclectic with a range of intriguing beats. How does it compare with your earlier jazz-R&B albums?\nJohn Scofield: It was so much fun to get together with these guys after 10 years. I think we all played well because of the lift of our reunion. On the previous records—Uberjam and Up All Night—the songs were either tunes I composed or tunes that came out of group jam sessions. [Photo above of Uberjam]\nJW: And on the new one?\nJS: On Uberjam Deux, most of the tunes are composed by Avi Bortnick (rhythm guitar and samples) and myself. When we decided to do the recording, Avi gave me free reign to take some things he'd composed and change them and add sections that I composed. I think the writing is stronger on the new CD than on the other ones. [Photo above of Avi Bortnick]\nJW: Do you hunt for beats and then play them back for the band?\nJS: A lot of these tunes started with grooves that Avi came up with and had demoed. The bass and drums work out parts to fit with the sampled percussion grooves. On the tunes I wrote alone, I made primitive home demos with my cheapo Zoom recorder just to give everybody an idea. I compose with the players in mind, and the band members always modify their parts to fit their own personal style.\nJW: Are you on a mission to jazzify today's musical language?\nJS: I like to think I'm still improving as an improviser, increasing my musical vocabulary. I continue to love the stuff I loved before I started studying modern jazz—blues, R&B and all the great stuff we heard on the radio in the ‘60's. I guess I “jazzify” stuff unconsciously because that's just what I do. I’m not on a mission, just always in a moment.\nJW: How do you strike a balance—not leaning too far into R&B and holding too firm to jazz?\nJS: I think it's all instinct. That's what tells me if I’ve crossed the line. I’ve seen the connections between R&B, soul and jazz since I started playing guitar. They’re all branches on the same tree. I saw in an interview that B.B. King [pictured] objected to being called a “blues” artist and preferred being called a “jazz” guitarist. That's interesting, coming from the King of the Blues, right? I continue to learn about and practice straight jazz as well as the dreaded back-beat music.\nJW: Did you introduce Miles to the contemporary pop tunes featured on You're Under Arrest in 1985?\nJS: Oh not at all. Miles was always very familiar with current pop stuff and checked it out on his own. I think he always had—even in the '50s and before. He actually discouraged us from listening to old music so we remained current and cutting edge.\nJW: Why did he choose Human Nature and Time After Time?\nJS: We recorded a bunch of pop tunes at the time, but Miles believed he could only do one take on them before he got stale. Human Nature and Time After Time were the only ones where he liked his playing, I guess. I remember he wanted to try Life Begins With You by DeBarge. He had me write up a lead sheet and he played it beautifully, but we never got around to it.\nJW: You've always had a bold, distinct sound that takes listeners back to the 70s and yet propels them forward. How is the Scofield sound created?\nJS: I think all guitarists get their sound through their fingers. Equipment choice matters some, too. I mostly use my trusty Ibanez AS200 guitar and a Vox AC30 amp from the ‘90s—the new ones are different. I like to bend notes and play with vibrato and expressive articulation. I think that can be missing in the orthodox jazz guitar approach.\nJazzWax tracks: Uberjam features John Scofield on guitars, Avi Bortnick on rhythm guitar and samples, Andy Hess on bass, Adam Deitch and Louis Cato on drums (different tracks) and special guest John Medeski on organ, Wurlitzer and Mellotron. You'll find John Scofield's Uberjam Deux (Decca) here.\nJazzWax clip: Here's John's Al Green Song...""]"	['<urn:uuid:8fddfcaa-bbb9-44a4-99cd-f13de97a6548>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	5	15	872

79	cloud computing delivery models advantages disadvantages edge computing	Cloud computing offers three main delivery models: IaaS (providing compute resources like virtual machines), PaaS (offering development environments without infrastructure concerns), and SaaS (delivering complete application software). While these traditional cloud models offer scalability and abundant storage, they face challenges with IoT data volume. Edge computing has emerged as an alternative approach where computations are performed near the data source rather than in centralized data centers. This reduces network strain and provides faster response times, as only relevant results are transmitted back to data centers rather than raw data. However, edge computing requires investment in endpoint device hardware and may not be suitable for highly secure data that benefits from centralization.

With conservative estimates of as many as 22 billion connected devices by the end of the decade—all constantly generating semi-structured or unstructured data in real time—conventional methods of processing, analyzing, and deriving action from that data will be markedly different than that deployed by most centralized data centers.\nTraditionally, copious amounts of big data have been best managed in the cloud where organizations can take advantage of its numerous advantages including scalability, abundant storage, flexible pricing, reduced physical infrastructure, and elastic computing capabilities. Nonetheless, the sheer amounts of disparate data facilitated by the IoT are projected to considerably exacerbate that approach by creating immense strain on organizational bandwidth and network availability, which can create instances of failure and delay on time-sensitive data.\nIn the wake of such predictions, a new paradigm has emerged to account for the massive amounts of data that mobile computing, the IoT, and big data are producing. By utilizing a decentralized cloud model referred to as fog computing or edge computing, organizations can eschew the aforementioned complications in favor of boons including decreased time to action, reduced costs, infrastructure and bandwidth, as well as greater availability and access to data.\nThe advantages of the decentralized method of edge computing and IoT analytics extend to both the enterprise and end users. The benefits to organizations and those operating in data centers are based on the principle that the majority of the computations required are actually performed at the edge of the cloud and closer to the mobile device. What is transmitted back to data centers is the results of those computations or analytics. The difference between this decentralized paradigm and the conventional one are staggering. Instead of, for instance, the massive amounts of big data produced by an equipment asset in the industrial internet being continuously transmitted to a data center, which requires enormous quantities of data, edge computing enables only the results of that data that pertain to asset management to be transmitted to the center.\nThus, 90 percent of the data that is transmitted and indicates that the asset is functioning properly is processed at the source and does not require any movement. The 10 percent that reveals that an asset is malfunctioning or in need of preventative maintenance, however, is all that is transmitted—which greatly decreases network strain and time to action. This way, organizations do not need to increase their physical infrastructure and network capacity, and can still maintain sufficient network availability even with analytics for the IoT.\nEnd User Benefits\nThe boons associated with this approach provide a win-win model both for those monitoring data transmitted by the IoT and mobile computing methods, and for those depending on that data. By facilitating computations near the edge of the cloud and closer to the source of the data, fog computing enables the devices and end users that need the results of those calculations to get them much more hastily than they otherwise could. There is no need to wait for untold amounts of data to first travel across the country (or even across the world), to perform analytics at a centralized data center, or to hope the network’s availability remains consistently operable. Instead, the results of analytics undergo that process or, in certain instances, everything is processed to produce action at the edge of the cloud by the device itself. The decreased time to action and greater availability of this paradigm can reinforce the trends of mobile computing and the IoT, helping them both to gain further traction while satisfying end users in a way that is much more expensive and tenuous to do with centralized cloud approaches.\nEdge computing, however, is far from a panacea. One of the immediate costs associated with this method pertains to equipping end devices with the necessary hardware to perform calculations remotely and independent of centralized data centers. Some vendors, however, are in the process of perfecting technologies for just such purposes. The tradeoff is that by investing in such solutions immediately organizations will avoid the alternative—frequently updating their infrastructure and networks to deal with ever increasing data amounts as the IoT expands. Although cloud security has made considerable strides in the past years, organizations and service providers will have to adjust those models to focus more on end point devices with fog computing.\nAdditionally, there are certain data types that actually benefit from centralized models. Data that has the utmost security concerns, for instance, will want the secure advantages of a centralized approach or one that continues to rely solely on physical infrastructure. According to MapR Chief Marketing Officer Jack Norris, “One of the benefits of centralization is that you can focus your efforts and understand where data is and who has access to it. So in a way, it can simplify some of the aspects of protecting that information.” Data that requires a high degree of complexity for its queries would also benefit from the traditional centralized model. In general, data that merely requires network availability and celerity is best suited for the decentralized paradigm.\nResource Allocation for the IoT\nThe Internet of Things is already a reality. The forthcoming aspect of this application of big data is that it is in the process of broadening and continually incorporating new devices to generate ever more amounts of data. Edge computing is a way of accounting for the future of the IoT and the cloud so that organizations take a more prudent approach to resource allocations. The centralized paradigm can still work, yet will constantly require additional resources, upgrades, networking investments, etc. The decentralized method, however, is better aligned with the flexibility and agility that tends to characterize the more prevalent data management trends and applications today. Ultimately, the latter is much more sustainable than the former. Perhaps the most cogent way in which the agility of edge computing is demonstrated is via cyberforaging, the fog computing phenomenon in which mobile end devices share computational resources with one another.']"	['<urn:uuid:e8f0dfe3-84a6-498c-9f7f-969f2dd9eda6>', '<urn:uuid:08edaca8-9207-40cf-b9ce-4ed8e8f239b6>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	8	111	1963
80	difference between traditional japanese kimono and maya huipil construction and social meaning	The Kimono and huipil had different construction methods and social significance. Kimonos were cut in eight sections from one roll of cloth about 36 cm wide and 11 meters long, with straight seams and standardized width regardless of wearer size. They could be sewn within a day. The huipil, on the other hand, was individually woven on a backstrap loom and could take months to complete, with no two being identical. Socially, both garments indicated status - Kimono's fabric type, color, and sleeve length indicated marriage status and social class, with silk reserved for upper classes by law. Similarly, Mayan huipils' colors and designs identified the wearer's village of origin, representing a deep cultural tie to their ancestors.	"[""Cultural Dress of the Maya\n|Mayan Women's Dress\nMayan women have been weaving for centuries. When the Spaniards arrived, they were astounded by the brightly colored dress of the Mayas. Mayan women traditionally wear traje, which is a combination of a skillfully woven, multicolored blouse called a huipil of a corte, a woven wraparound skirt that reaches to the ankles, and is held together by faja (sash) at the waist. Women also wear some form of headdress, such as pa˝uelo, on their heads, or cintas, four- or five-foot-long colorful ribbons that are braided into their shiny, long, black hair. A lengthy rectangular rebozo (shawl) and a decorated delantal (apron) are also part of traje. There are also small, silver or gold, round hoops for earrings and, in some areas, necklaces made from glass beads.\nThe huipil is a distinct work of art, woven or embroidered, that may take months to complete. It is distinguished by its design, style, pattern and concept. It varies according to region and individual creativity or taste. The corte, which is woven on a treadle or footloom, is composed of about five yards of material that is wrapped several times around a woman's lower body. Although there are certain colors and designs that are traditionally associated with a particular Mayan village, each huipil is woven individually on a backstrap loom. No two huipiles are identical. The cortes, however, generally are not distinctive. When the conquistadors arrived, men also wore colorfully woven apparel, but this is true only in certain areas today.\nTraditionally, one could guess the village of origin by the colors and design of the huipil that a Mayan woman wore. For instance, a bright huipil of predominantly orange and red, interwoven with various minor colors such as green and blue, with a specific geometric pattern, identifies the wearer as a woman from San Antonio Aguascalientes. There is proof through pre-Columbian representations that this was a tradition in place long before the conquistadors ever set foot in the Americas.\nTraje, or traditional clothing, has deep cultural significance for the Mayas. It represents a tie to the past and to their ancestors. For historic, political and economic reasons, it is mostly women who are the bearers of this tradition. The daily lives of Mayan women of Guatemala represent the continuance of the customs and traditions of the ancestors. They also represent new survival strategies as they face challenges brought on by shifting political, economic, social and natural factors. One may say that they adopt from their ancestors what is necessary for survival while looking for alternative ways to adapt to changing circumstances. Their lives vary greatly, depending on their particular socioeconomic or political status, the regions in which they live, the time period, their religion, the personal decisions that they make and other factors. However, speaking in general terms, Mayan women's everyday lives are a struggle for survival against poverty, hunger, discrimination and violence from within and without. They are on their feet daily from dawn to dusk, tending to a multitude of domestic tasks. However, they also keep their eyes on the future. At times, however, their traditional ways come into conflict with modern Ladino society, and Mayas are obliged to make difficult choices.\nSee some beautiful examples of huipiles and traje at the Nim Po't Maya Textile Collection.\nSource: Culture and Customs of Guatemala"", 'Traditional Japanese Clothing\nThe clothing of\nthe Edo Period (1601-1867 A.D.) is what the modern person would think of when asked about traditional Japanese clothing. Consisting of basic pieces such as the Kimono, Obi, and Hakama, Japanese clothing is as remarkably simple as it is complex and elegant.\nUshered in by Tokugawa Ieyasus appointment as Shogun or military leader by the Emperor, the Edo period reflects a socially stable and economically prosperous time for Japan. Tokugawa shoguns held control of Japan for over 250 years during which they enforced isolation from the rest of the world by forbidding foreign literature and art and outgoing travel to western countries. Japanese fashion developed independently of other countries which is apparent as their traditional clothing remained in widespread use until post World War II.\nThe building block for all traditional Japanese clothing, regardless of class, begins with the Kimono. By the Edo Period, this had become an outer garment and was made of all types of fabric from plain, solid cotton to heavily embroidered silk. Prior to and during the Edo Period, fabric use was very class orientated. Silk was, by law, reserved for the upper classes (Samurai) while hemp, ramie and other plant derived fibers were used by the common person. During the 18th century, cotton cultivation became widespread making this a choice fabric as well. Weaving fabric from these textiles was a craft passed down from mother to daughter. It wasnt uncommon for every house to have at least one weaving loom. Fabric was decorated via woven patterns such as damask or satin or by using dyed yarns, stenciling and embroidery. In some cases the yarns used to make fabric were dyed over 40 times to achieve the intensity and quality of color needed for a final garment. Decorative motifs included family crests, animals symbolic of Japanese folklore and natural elements like bamboo branches and flowers.\nThe construction of Kimono were the same for either gender, regardless of the fabric used. All adults kimono are cut in eight sections from one roll of cloth about 36 cm. (14 inches) wide and 11 meters (12 yards) long. As the seams are cut straight and always the same width regardless of the wearers size, no cloth is left over. Any extra length was tucked under or over the Obi (belt) depending on gender. Kimono are relatively simple in design and could be sewn together within a day. There were no fasteners used to hold the Kimono closed; rather the left side would be folded over the right and then an Obi would be tied around the waist.\nAge, social status and gender all played a part in the appearance of the Kimono. For example, a married woman would wear a Kimono made out of darker fabric and with shorter sleeves than a young unmarried girl. Children wore brighter colors than their adult counterparts. Fashion practices, based on rigid social hierarchy, were reinforced by law.\nUnder the Kimono, lighter Kimono called Nagajuban in coordinating colors would be layered. An Han-eri, or scarf-like collar would be worn between the Kimono and the neck. Laws regarding excessive expenditures on womens Kimono caused some to spend their money on extravagant undergarments instead of a more obvious outer Kimono. Yukatabira, light and loose-fitting robes, were also worn as an alternative to the Kimono by both sexes in a relaxed or casual setting.\nThe working classes wore simpler garments based on the Kimono. The Happi was a short coat, similar in construction and wear to a Kimono, that both genders wore. The Happi was combined with either somewhat fitted pants for men or very loose pants and aprons for women. Cording, sashes and Obi were used to close these jackets. Under this, for men, would be worn a loincloth, a piece of fabric wrapped around the groin, held on using cord as a belt or tied like a diaper. In cold weather, a Hanten (quilted jacket) would be worn over the Kimono or Happi. All classes wore coats and hats made of straw in rainy weather.\nThree types of footwear were prevalent. Waraji and Zori (thong sandles) made of straw and Geta (platformed thongs) made of wood. The Zori and Waraji were simple, practical shoes for working. Geta were wooden platforms, made to avoid mud during inclement weather. The height of Geta were flexible and some examples show platforms of nearly a foot. Tabi (split-toed socks) made out of silk, cotton or leather could be worn with any of these shoes. Zori, Geta or Tabi were not made for wearing indoors and thus easy to remove. During the Edo Period all formal occasions required bare feet.\nAdditionally, the Samurai, or fighting class, had garments they would wear in conjunction with the Kimono. The Kamishimo was a two-piece costume worn over a kimono. It resembled an apron or backwards pinafore. The upper piece, the Kataginu, was a sleeveless vest with exaggerated shoulders. This was worn over the Hakama, which were wide, flowing pants. The Hakama has significant meaning applied to the design of the garment. The seven folds in these pants represent seven virtues of the Samurai Yuki (courage), Jin (humility), Gi (justice), Rei (chivalry), Makoto (honesty), Chugi (loyalty), and Meiyo (prestige).\n(Definitions from www.e-budostore.com\nBesides being required to hold together Kimono, the Obi, a sash or belt, is ornamental and expressive of class, age or marital status. There are several ways to tie the Obi, including a butterfly fold with a large bow shaped like an insects wingspan. In the early part of the Edo Period, the Obi was tied either at the front or to the side. By the mid 1770s, the Obi was tied in the back due to fashion and ease of dealing with an ever increasing width. (source 6) The fabrics used for Obi vary from simple leather cording to highly decorated bands of fabric.\nOther accessory items include fans which both genders used. Called Sensu, the folding fan was used to cool as well as communicate. Samurais used Tessen or iron fans as a weapon when necessary.']"	['<urn:uuid:dcbbb584-c89f-4849-a758-5d44f63f41d5>', '<urn:uuid:5b3720db-1e2d-4f80-8b32-f2dcb3c62621>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	12	118	1573
81	My wife and I are thinking about getting life insurance for the first time. What are the different types of life insurance available and how do they work?	Life insurance is available in two basic forms: term insurance and whole-life insurance. Term insurance provides coverage during a specified time period and only pays off when you die. Whole-life insurance, on the other hand, offers both savings and insurance coverage, allowing you to accumulate funds before death. You have the option to choose either type or both types of life insurance, and you can maintain your policy for as long as you want. The purpose of life insurance is to protect you and your beneficiaries in case of your death.	['While risk monitoring actions are essential to safeguard the business from threats, insurance policy is the most effective as well as economical choice. Moreover, no threat management step can make certain complete safety. Yet, without insurance, the business can not function. Insurance coverage converts the variable expenses of risk right into fixed ones. Insurance works by merging funds from several parties. When a business endures an accident, every one of the insured parties cooperate the repair service costs. Hence, insurance is advantageous for both business as well as customers.\nThe insurance coverage market has actually advanced with time. While it utilized to be required to purchase different plans, it is now available in a single bundle or policy. These plans cover one of the most common threats, as well as are commonly described as multiperil plans. Every company in the United States requires insurance coverage, even if it is not based in that state. Social Security, Medicare, and disability insurance are examples of public insurance policy, while there are numerous personal insurance coverage alternatives. Private insurance coverage include health care, residential or commercial property insurance coverage, as well as liability insurance coverage.\nLife insurance policies were first obtained in the very early eighteenth century. Sir Thomas Allen and also William Talbot started the Amicable Culture for a Continuous Guarantee Office in London in 1706. After that, in 1762, Edward Rowe Mores developed the Culture for Equitable Assurances on Lives and also Survivorship. Accident insurance coverage only ended up being common in the late 19th century. The Train Passengers Guarantee Company was developed in 1848 in reaction to the rising number of deaths on the nascent railway network.\nThe procedure of picking a plan is called underwriting. Insurance provider use actuarial scientific research to establish the possible prices of different risks. They then established costs based upon their price quotes. Since the prices of guaranteeing differ between urban and backwoods, there is no factor for a city driver to pay greater than a rural motorist. However, insurance companies sometimes prevent particular kinds of clients as a result of high danger. For example, people with HIV are unlikely to be guaranteed by any type of insurance firm.\nWhen establishing the price of insurance coverage, business consider the risks connected with the insurance policy holder. For example, young people that drive high-powered cars might pay higher costs than fully grown, knowledgeable motorists. However while this might hold true, just a tiny portion of insurance holders will certainly make a case, insurance deductible amounts differ from year to year. As a result, it is crucial to look into the costs of insurance coverage prior to enrolling in a plan. If you are unsure regarding what sort of insurance is right for you, contact an insurance agent. They will certainly be happy to address your questions.\nMany insurers have become unbelievably lucrative due to their crooked details. They have the advantage of knowing even more regarding the dangers related to certain threats, while possible buyers have little or no knowledge regarding those dangers. Therefore, those with details that prefers them are more likely to purchase an insurance plan. Similarly, an insurance firm that has reduced mortality prices would expect to recover cost by charging $12 per thousand bucks for insurance policy, while an insurance firm with high death rates would certainly be more probable to buy it.\nIn the case of an accident, the insurance company should assess the possibility of the occurrence of the accident. A pure loss is one that is simply because of the threat of event. This sort of loss is not covered by the insurer if it consists of speculative components. Insurer can utilize various methods to approximate the likelihood of a mishap taking place. If there are numerous aspects that influence threat, a multivariate evaluation may be used.\nNormally, an insurance plan includes an agreement between the insurance company and also the insured. The contract outlines the problems under which the insurer will certainly compensate the guaranteed for a protected occasion. A plan normally covers expenditures such as car mishaps, clinical expenses, and damages to a house. The policy limits will certainly likewise identify the quantity of coverage that will certainly be available for the occasion. When the plan restrictions are satisfied, the insured will certainly be repaid for any kind of losses or damages.\nIn the United States, insurance regulation is mostly left to state authorities. The McCarran-Ferguson Act, as an example, excuses state insurance provider from federal antitrust regulations. Insurance coverage divisions are a key part of every state’s regulatory system, but they are criticized for inefficient policy. Large insurance companies are present in fifty various states as well as hence have to compete with a variety of governing schemes. But these agencies can additionally help secure customers by ensuring that insurance coverage companies continue to be affordable and also give the level of defense they need.\nWhile medical insurance is generally one of the most comprehensive form of insurance policy, it likewise carries a number of restrictions as well as deductibles. The insurance company will certainly examine the risk that you are likely to deal with by being unwell or injured. They will set their premiums based on this analysis. When the deductible amount is met, insurance policy protection will begin to pay. Nonetheless, the insurance company can still make you pay a section of the prices yourself. That’s why it’s best to inspect whether your employer offers any type of type of protection prior to making a decision.\nLife insurance policy shields you and your beneficiaries in case of your fatality. It’s offered in two basic forms: term insurance policy and whole-life insurance. The former supplies insurance coverage during a specified time as well as pays off just when you pass away. Whole-life insurance policy, on the other hand, offers you financial savings along with insurance coverage, and also the last permits you to collect your funds before you pass away. You can also choose both sorts of life insurance policy and have your plan for as long as you want. Click here for more\nMedical insurance gives peace of mind. Unexpected occasions can arise any time. Medical emergency situations, death, as well as residential or commercial property damage are all possible factors to look for therapy. Unforeseen expenses can diminish financial savings as well as household funds. Fortunately, insurance policy supplies a choice. In the case of medical emergency situations, insurance policy can give the financial support required for recuperation. In such a situation, health insurance policies been available in useful. It’s a sound financial plan that safeguards your future and your family.\nWhile insurance policy companies have many alternatives for policy limitations, the deductible is one of the most typical and also most expensive. A higher insurance deductible indicates a reduced costs, yet a greater insurance deductible ways less cases. Insurance companies will normally ask for an insurance deductible prior to paying out an insurance claim, however this is not always the instance. If you make an insurance claim, the insurer will not pay as a lot, so it is very important to comprehend the different alternatives for insurance policy coverage.']	['<urn:uuid:0de18baf-5e4a-429b-a6a1-334d830c4940>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	28	91	1198
82	What similarities exist between the methods Kevin Mitnick used to access computer systems and how modern rootkits infiltrate networks, and what kinds of damage can both cause?	Both Mitnick and rootkits rely heavily on social engineering tactics to gain access to systems. Mitnick used social engineering to obtain information like usernames and passwords, while rootkits often trick users into giving permission for installation through phishing attacks. In terms of damage, Mitnick's activities involved copying proprietary software, intercepting private emails, and altering computer networks. Similarly, rootkits can steal sensitive data, remove files, intercept personal information through keyloggers, and modify system configurations. Both approaches can lead to significant system compromise - Mitnick gained unauthorized access to dozens of networks, while rootkits can provide ongoing backdoor access to cybercriminals and spread malware throughout systems.	"['Freedom Downtime - The Story of Kevin Mitnick (2001)\nFreedom Downtime is a 2001 documentary film sympathetic to the convicted computer hacker Kevin Mitnick, directed by Emmanuel Goldstein and produced by 2600 Films.\nThe documentary centers on the fate of Mitnick, whom is claimed to have been misrepresented in the feature film Takedown (2000) produced by Miramax and adapted from the book by the same name by Tsutomu Shimomura and John Markoff, which is based on real events. As well as documenting a number of computer enthusiasts who drive across the United States searching for Miramax representatives and demonstrating their discontent with certain aspects of the bootleg script of Takedown they had acquired. One major point of criticism by them of Takedown was that it ended with Mitnick being convicted to serve a long-term prison sentence. While in reality, at the time the film\'s production, Mitnick had not yet been in front of a court; although nevertheless, was to be incarcerated for five years without bail in high-security facility. Freedom Downtime also touches on what happened to other hackers after being sentenced. The development of the Free Kevin movement is also covered.\nSeveral notable and iconic figures from the hacking community appear in the movie, including Phiber Optik (Mark Abene), Bernie S (Ed Cummings), Alex Kasper, and (director) Emmanuel Goldstein (Eric Corley). Freedom Downtime tries to communicate a different view of the hacker community than that usually shown by the mainstream media, with hackers being depicted as curious people who rarely intend to cause damage, driven by a desire to explore and conduct pranks. The film goes on to question the rationality of placing computer hackers who went ""over the line"" in the same environment as serious felons.\nIt also contains interviews with people related to Mitnick and hacker culture in general. The authors of Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier, ex-couple Katie Hafner and John Markoff, appear in very different roles. While Hafner\'s empathy for Mitnick is shown to have grown, Markoff continues to defend his critical book and articles in The New York Times newspaper about the hacker. Markoff is ridiculed, as the narrator, director Goldstein (a hacker himself), points out his factual errors in the interview given. Reba Vartanian, Mitnick\'s grandmother, also appears in a number of interview segments. Furthermore, lawyers, friends and libertarians give their view of the story. Footage and interviews from the DEF CON and Hackers on Planet Earth conventions try to dispel some hacker myths and confirm others.\nThe film premiered at H2K, the 2000 H.O.P.E. convention. After that the film saw a limited independent theatrical release, and was shown at film festivals. It was released on VHS and sold from the 2600 web site.\nIn June 2004, after years in production, a DVD was released. The DVD includes a wealth of extra material spread over two discs, including three hours of extra footage, an interview with Kevin Mitnick in January 2003 (shortly after his supervised release ended,) and various DVD eggs.  It also included subtitles in 20 languages, provided by volunteers.\nFrom the original website:\nFREEDOM DOWNTIME is the story of computer hacker Kevin Mitnick, imprisoned without bail for nearly five years. The film tries to uncover the reasons why the authorities are so scared of Mitnick as well as define what exactly he did. As word of a new Hollywood movie portraying Mitnick as a terrorist becomes known, hackers begin to turn to activism to get their message out. Through interviews with relatives, friends, lawyers, and experts in the computer and civil liberties arena, a picture of a great injustice becomes apparent. A cross country journey uncovers some realities of the hacker culture as well as the sobering reality that so many technically adept young people seem destined for prison.\nWinner of the Audience Award for Documentaries at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival, 2002\nKevin David Mitnick (born August 6, 1963) is a computer security consultant and author. He was a world-famous controversial computer hacker in the late 20th century, who was, at the time of his arrest, the most wanted computer criminal in United States history.\nArrest, Conviction, and Incarceration\nAfter a well-publicized pursuit, the FBI arrested Kevin Mitnick on February 15, 1995 at his apartment in Raleigh, North Carolina, on federal offenses related to a 2½-year computer hacking spree.\nIn 1999, Mitnick confessed to four counts of wire fraud, two counts of computer fraud and one count of illegally intercepting a wire communication, as part of a plea agreement before the United States District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles. He was sentenced to 46 months in prison in addition to 22 months for violating the terms of his 1989 supervised release sentence for computer fraud. He admitted to violating the terms of supervised release by hacking into PacBell voicemail and other systems and to associating with known computer hackers, in this case co-defendant Louis De Payne.\nMitnick served five years in prison, four and a half years pre-trial and eight months in solitary confinement, because law enforcement officials convinced a judge that he had the ability to ""start a nuclear war by whistling into a pay phone"". He was released on January 21, 2000. During his supervised release, which ended on January 21, 2003, he was initially restricted from using any communications technology other than a landline telephone. Mitnick fought this decision in court, eventually winning a ruling in his favor, allowing him to access the Internet.\nAs per the plea deal, Mitnick was also prohibited from profiting from films or books that are based on his criminal activity for a period of seven years.\nMitnick now runs Mitnick Security Consulting LLC, a computer security consultancy.\nAt the age of twelve Kevin Mitnick used social engineering to bypass the punchcard system used in the Los Angeles bus system. After a friendly bus driver told him where he could buy his own punch, he could ride any bus in the greater LA area using unused transfer slips he found in the trash. Social engineering became his primary method of obtaining information, whether it be user names and passwords, modem phone numbers or any number of other pieces of data.\nIn high school, he was introduced by ""Petronix"" to phone phreaking, a method of manipulating telephones, which he often used to evade long distance charges. Mitnick also became handy with amateur radios; using radio equipment, Mitnick reportedly managed to gain unauthorized access to the speaker systems of nearby fast food restaurants.\nMitnick gained unauthorized access to his first computer network in 1979, at the age of sixteen, when a friend gave him the phone number for the Ark, the computer system Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) used for developing their RSTS/E operating system software. He broke into DEC\'s computer network and copied DEC\'s software, a crime he was charged and convicted for in 1988. He was sentenced to twelve months in prison followed by a three year period of supervised release. Near the end of his supervised release, Mitnick hacked into Pacific Bell voice mail computers. Mitnick fled after a warrant was issued for his arrest, becoming a fugitive for the next two and a half years.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice while a fugitive Mitnick gained unauthorized access to dozens of computer networks. He used cloned cellular phones to hide his location and, among other things, copied valuable proprietary software from some of the country’s largest cellular telephone and computer companies. Mitnick also intercepted and stole computer passwords, altered computer networks, and broke into and read private e-mail. Mitnick was apprehended in February 1995 in North Carolina. When arrested he was found with cloned cellular phones, over one hundred clone cellular phone codes, and multiple pieces of false identification.\nConfirmed Criminal Acts\n* Using the Los Angeles bus transfer system to get free rides\n* Evading the FBI\n* Hacking into DEC system(s) to view VMS source code (DEC reportedly spent $160,000 in cleanup costs)\n* Gaining full admin privileges to an IBM minicomputer at the Computer Learning Center in LA in order to win a bet\n* Hacking Motorola, NEC, Nokia, Sun Microsystems and Fujitsu Siemens systems\nAlleged Criminal Acts\n* Stole computer manuals from a Pacific Bell telephone switching center in Los Angeles\n* Read the e-mail of computer security officials at MCI Communications and Digital\n* Wiretapped the California DMV\n* Made free cell phone calls\n* Hacked SCO, PacBell, FBI, Pentagon, Novell, CA DMV, USC and Los Angeles Unified School District systems.\n* Wiretapped FBI agents according to John Markoff, although denied by Kevin Mitnick.\nKevin Mitnick\'s criminal activities, arrest, and trial, along with the associated journalism were all controversial.\nThough Mitnick has been convicted of copying software unlawfully and possession of several forged identification documents, his supporters argue that his punishment was excessive. In his 2002 book, The Art of Deception, Mitnick states that he compromised computers solely by using passwords and codes that he gained by social engineering. He claims he did not use software programs or hacking tools for cracking passwords or otherwise exploiting computer or phone security.\nThis controversy is highlighted by the differing views offered in two books: John Markoff and Tsutomu Shimomura\'s Takedown, and Jonathan Littman\'s The Fugitive Game. Littman made four notable allegations:\n* journalistic impropriety by Markoff, who had covered the case for the New York Times based on rumor and government claims, while never interviewing Kevin himself.\n* overzealous prosecution of Mitnick by the government\n* mainstream media over-hyping Mitnick\'s actual crimes\n* Shimomura\'s involvement in the matter being unclear or of dubious legality\nThe case against Mitnick tested the newly enacted laws that had been enacted for dealing with computer crime, and it raised public awareness of security issues involving networked computers. The controversy remains, however, and Mitnick is often used today as an example of the quintessential computer criminal.\nSupporters of Mitnick have asserted that many of the charges against him were fraudulent and not based on actual losses.\nIn 2000, Skeet Ulrich and Russell Wong portrayed Kevin Mitnick and Tsutomu Shimomura in the movie Track Down, which was based on the book Takedown by John Markoff and Tsutomu Shimomura. The DVD was released in September of 2004.\nFurther controversy came over the release of the movie, with Littman alleging that portions of the film were taken from his book without permission.\nA fan-based documentary named Freedom Downtime was created in response to Track Down.\nMitnick is the author of two computer security books:\n* The Art of Intrusion: The Real Stories Behind the Exploits of Hackers, Intruders & Deceivers\n* The Art of Deception\n- United States Attorney\'s Office, Central District of California (9 August 1999).

Although this type of software has some legitimate uses, such as providing remote end-user support, most rootkits open a backdoor on victims' systems to introduce malicious software -- including viruses, ransomware, keylogger programs or other types of malware -- or to use the system for further network security attacks. Rootkits often attempt to prevent detection of malicious software by deactivating endpoint antimalware and antivirus software.\nRootkits, which can be purchased on the dark web, can be installed during phishing attacks or employed as a social engineering tactic to trick users into giving the rootkits permission to be installed on their systems, often giving remote cybercriminals administrator access to the system. Once installed, a rootkit gives the remote actor access to and control over almost every aspect of the operating system (OS). Older antivirus programs often struggled to detect rootkits, but today, most antimalware programs can scan for and remove rootkits hiding within a system.\nHow rootkits work\nSince rootkits cannot spread by themselves, they depend on clandestine methods to infect computers. When unsuspecting users give rootkit installer programs permission to be installed on their systems, the rootkits install and conceal themselves until hackers activate them. Rootkits contain malicious tools, including banking credential stealers, password stealers, keyloggers, antivirus disablers and bots for distributed denial-of-service attacks.\nRootkits are installed through the same common vectors as any malicious software, including by email phishing campaigns, executable malicious files, crafted malicious PDF files or Microsoft Word documents, connecting to shared drives that have been compromised or downloading software infected with the rootkit from risky websites.\nWhat can be compromised during a rootkit attack?\nThe following are some of the potential results of a rootkit attack:\n- Causes a malware infection. A rootkit can install malicious software on a computer, system or network that contains viruses, Trojans, worms, ransomware, spyware, adware and other deleterious software that compromise performance of the device or system or the privacy of its information.\n- Removes files. Rootkits install themselves through a backdoor into a system, network or device. This can happen during login or be the result of a vulnerability in security or OS software. Once in, the rootkit can automatically execute software that steals or deletes files.\n- Intercepts personal information. Rootkits known as payload rootkits often use keyloggers, which capture keystrokes without a user's consent. In other cases, these rootkits issue spam emails that install the rootkits when users open the emails. In both cases, the rootkit steals personal information, such as credit card numbers and online banking data, that is passed on to cybercriminals.\n- Steals sensitive data. By entering systems, networks and computers, rootkits can install malware that seeks sensitive and proprietary information, usually with the goal of monetizing that data or passing it to unauthorized sources. Keyloggers, screen scrapers, spyware, adware, backdoors and bots are all methods that rootkits use to steal sensitive data.\n- Changes system configurations. Once inside a system, network or computer, a rootkit can modify system configurations. It can establish a stealth mode that makes detection by standard security software difficult. Rootkits can also create a persistent state of presence that makes it difficult or impossible to shut them down, even with a system reboot. A rootkit can provide an attacker with ongoing access or change security authorization privileges to facilitate access.\nSymptoms of rootkit infection\nA primary goal of a rootkit is to avoid detection to remain installed and accessible on the victim's system. Although rootkit developers aim to keep their malware undetectable and there are not many easily identifiable symptoms that flag a rootkit infection, here are four indicators that a system has been compromised:\n- Antimalware stops running. An antimalware application that just stops running indicates an active rootkit infection.\n- Windows settings change by themselves. If Windows settings change without any apparent action by the user, the cause may be a rootkit infection. Other unusual behavior, such as background images changing or disappearing in the lock screen or pinned items changing on the taskbar, could also indicate a rootkit infection.\n- Performance issues. Unusually slow performance or high central processing unit usage and browser redirects may also point to the presence of a rootkit infection.\n- Computer lockups. These occur when users cannot access their computer or the computer fails to respond to input from a mouse or keyboard.\nTypes of rootkits\nRootkits are classified based on how they infect, operate or persist on the target system:\n- Kernel mode rootkit. This type of rootkit is designed to change the functionality of an OS. The rootkit typically adds its own code -- and, sometimes, its own data structures -- to parts of the OS core, known as the kernel. Many kernel mode rootkits exploit the fact that OSes allow device drivers or loadable modules to execute with the same level of system privileges as the OS kernel, so the rootkits are packaged as device drivers or modules to avoid detection by antivirus software.\n- User mode rootkit. Also known as an application rootkit, a user mode rootkit executes in the same way as an ordinary user program. User mode rootkits may be initialized like other ordinary programs during system startup, or they may be injected into the system by a dropper. The method depends on the OS. For example, a Windows rootkit typically focuses on manipulating the basic functionality of Windows dynamic link library files, but in a Unix system, the rootkit may replace an entire application.\n- Bootkit or bootloader rootkit. This type of rootkit infects the Master Boot Record of a hard drive or other storage device connected to the target system. Bootkits can subvert the boot process and maintain control over the system after booting and, as a result, have been used successfully to attack systems that use full disk encryption.\n- Firmware rootkit. This takes advantage of software embedded in system firmware and installs itself in firmware images used by network cards, basic input/output systems, routers, or other peripherals or devices.\n- Memory rootkit. Most types of rootkit infections can persist in systems for long periods because they install themselves on permanent system storage devices, but memory rootkits load themselves into computer memory or RAM. Memory rootkits persist only until the system RAM is cleared, usually after the computer is restarted.\n- Virtualized rootkit. These rootkits operate as malware that executes as a hypervisor controlling one or many virtual machines (VMs). Rootkits operate differently in a hypervisor-VM environment than they do on a physical machine. In a VM environment, the VMs controlled by the master hypervisor machine appear to function normally, without noticeable degradation to service or performance on the VMs that are linked to the hypervisor. This enables the rootkit to do its malicious work with less chance of being detected since all VMs linked to the hypervisor appear to be functioning normally.\nTips for preventing a rootkit attack\nAlthough it is difficult to detect a rootkit attack, an organization can build its defense strategy in the following ways:\n- Use strong antivirus and antimalware software. Typically, rootkit detection requires specific add-ons to antimalware packages or special-purpose antirootkit scanner software.\n- Keep software up to date. Rootkit users continually probe OSes and other systems for security vulnerabilities. OS and system software vendors are aware of this, so whenever they discover vulnerabilities to their products, they immediately issue a security update to eliminate them. As a best practice, IT should immediately update software whenever a new release is issued.\n- Monitor the network. Network monitoring and observability software can alert IT immediately if there is an unusually high level of activity at any point along the network, if network nodes suddenly start going offline or if there is any other sign of network activity that can be construed as an anomaly.\n- Analyze behavior. Companies that develop strong security permission policies and continually monitor for compliance can reduce the threat of rootkits. For example, if a user who normally accesses a system during the daytime in San Jose, Calif., shows up suddenly as an active user in Europe during nighttime hours, a threat alert could be sent to IT for investigation.\nRootkit detection and removal\nOnce a rootkit compromises a system, the potential for malicious activity is high, but organizations can take steps to remediate a compromised system.\nRootkit removal can be difficult, especially for rootkits that have been incorporated into OS kernels, into firmware or on storage device boot sectors. While some antirootkit software can detect and remove some rootkits, this type of malware can be difficult to remove entirely.\nOne approach to rootkit removal is to reinstall the OS, which, in many cases, eliminates the infection. Removing bootloader rootkits may require using a clean system running a secure OS to access the infected storage device.\nRebooting a system infected with a memory rootkit removes the infection, but further work may be required to eliminate the source of the infection, which may be linked to command-and-control networks with presence in the local network or on the public internet.\nExamples of rootkit attacks\nPhishing and social engineering attacks. Rootkits can enter computers when users open spam emails and inadvertently download malicious software. Rootkits also use keyloggers that capture user login information. Once installed, a rootkit can give hackers access to sensitive user information and take control of computer OSes.\nApplication rootkit attacks. Rootkits can install themselves on commonly used applications, such as spreadsheet and word processing software. The hackers use application rootkits to gain access to users' information whenever they open the infected applications.\nNetwork and internet of things (IoT) attacks. Significant security threats come in with IoT devices and edge computing that lack the security measures other systems and centralized computers have. Hackers find and exploit these vulnerabilities by inserting rootkits through edge points of entry. This can enable a rootkit to spread throughout a network, taking over computers and workstations and rendering them as zombie computers under outside control.\nOS attacks. After entering a system, a kernel mode rootkit can attack the system's OS. The attack can include modifying the functionality of the OS, slowing system performance, and even accessing and deleting files. Kernel mode rootkits usually enter systems when a user inadvertently opens a malicious email or executes a download from an unreliable source.\nCredit card swipe and scan attacks. Criminals have used rootkits to infect credit card swipers and scanners. The rootkits are programmed to record credit card information and to send the information to servers controlled by hackers. To prevent this, credit card companies have adopted chip-embedded cards, which are more impervious to attack.\nMalware continues to become more sophisticated, creating a gap in current network defenses. Learn how to avert malware using a modern approach that provides protection against both known and unknown threats.""]"	['<urn:uuid:1ddcc930-55ca-4277-b568-d9fdd64d50ce>', '<urn:uuid:675744f9-c1bc-4fb9-960c-25d3e152f5b5>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	27	104	4009

Enfuvirtide (T20) binds to HR1 along the coiled-coil HR1 grooves during conformational changes to form a peptide-gp41 6HB-like structure that interferes with viral gp41 6HB formation.	['Human immunodeficiency pathogen (HIV) entrance into cells is mediated with the envelope (Env) proteins which includes the gp120 surface area subunit as well as the noncovalently linked gp41 transmembrane subunit. entrance into cells by interfering with HR1 and HR2 connections to create the 6HB. Peptide fusion inhibitors related to HR2 sequences for example enfuvirtide (also referred to as T20 or DP-178) have proven to be potent inhibitors of HIV illness both in vitro and in vivo (32 79 From genetic studies biochemical studies with peptides and recombinant proteins and structural studies of HR1 and HR2 peptides that self-assemble into a thermostable 6HB (10 11 20 33 36 46 50 62 63 74 75 it is believed that T20 binds to HR1 along the coiled-coil HR1 grooves during conformational 1715-30-6 IC50 changes to form a peptide-gp41 6HB-like structure that interferes with formation of the viral (endogenous) gp41 6HB inside a dominating negative manner. However there are also data indicating that T20 potentially interacts with additional regions of Env for example regions of gp41 that are near or within the membrane (35 40 48 and the coreceptor binding site on gp120 probably through electrostatic relationships (3 83 Much like additional antiretrovirals T20 regrettably faces the problem of growing viral resistance. A large database of viruses resistant to T20 has been generated from medical and laboratory studies. It will consequently be important to develop fusion inhibitors that bind to gp41 in different ways to offset the potential for cross-resistance among providers in the fusion inhibitor class. Peptide fusion inhibitors related to HR1 for example DP-107 (78) N36 (18) and 5-helix (64) also inhibit HIV fusion. It is likely that HR1 peptides in an analogous manner to HR2 peptides interact with HR2 to form a peptide-gp41 6HB-like structure that interferes with formation from the endogenous 6HB (18 26 64 HR1 peptides additionally may connect to the HR1 of gp41 within a prominent negative system to create a heterologous peptide-gp41 coiled coil that inhibits the endogenous coiled coil and prevents development from the gp41 6HB (7 77 78 Since HR1 and HR2 peptides can focus on different sites and residues in gp41 HR1 peptides possibly signify different subclasses of fusion inhibitors with different level of resistance profiles.

84	how did baseball card distribution methods change from vending machines to retail stores and what are current buying options	Baseball card distribution has evolved significantly over time. Initially, the Exhibit Supply Company pioneered distribution through vending machines in arcades, stores, and high-traffic venues, selling cards for a penny to a dime each. When they later tried selling cards directly in celluloid packages in the 1960s, collectors were skeptical about their value. Today, baseball cards can be purchased through multiple channels: card shops, hobby stores, retail chains, and Internet dealers. There are now different types of packs - 'Hobby' packs containing more autograph, memorabilia and insert cards at higher prices, and 'Retail' packs. Cards can also be purchased directly from manufacturers' websites, though pricing is comparable to other outlets.	"['|09-22-2009, 07:54 AM||#1 (permalink)|\nJoin Date: Jun 2007\nVintage Baseball Exhibit Cards Paved Way\nVintage Baseball Exhibit Cards Paved Way\nA simple concept became a long-running series of baseball cards when the Exhibit Supply Company began cranking up the presses.\nExhibit Supply Company was the first organization to ever distribute sports cards that were not tied to peripheral products. Previously, sports cards were often part of a promotion or even had coupons that one could clip out of the card itself. The cards produced by the Chicago-based company were sold merely for the novelty of collecting them and reading the biographies or information for the subject of the card.\nThe novelty of Exhibit Supply Company’s product did not end with its new product though. The delivery method was also an innovation for its time. Exhibit advertised to arcade owners, store owners, bar owners, and basically everyone that owned a high traffic venue, their ‘amusement machines’. The idea was that Exhibit Supply Company would sell an amusement device, such as a fortune teller, scale, etc. This device would bring the venue more customers and Exhibit Supply Company would profit from refilling and maintaining the device. This method was employed as the primary method of ESC\'s distribution of their cards through the sale of card vending machines. Some collectors refer to them rightfully as ""arcade cards"".\nThough the company did profit from the sale of the machines, its real profit was realized by selling the refills for these devices, due to the extreme popularity of the cards, and the sheer volume that each machine went through. The cards were originally sold for a penny apiece, but after their popularity was realized, the price steadily climbed as high as a dime, requiring a purchase of a new vending machine for the venue.\nThe company’s foray into card manufacture and distribution began in 1921 and saw enormous growth from the outset of the venture. They produced cards featuring nearly everything imaginable: sports stars, Hollywood starlets, fighter jets, and television stars. By far, the most popular cards were those of the baseball stars. By the 19th century, professional baseball was solidified as the national pastime, and there were few icons that embodied American idealism more than the rugged, powerful, and precise men of professional baseball. As the baseball cards took off, this prompted the company to produce even more cards, and when the popularity finally peaked in the early 1960’s, they even opted to sell the cards directly in celluloid packages, bypassing the need for the vending machines. The vending machines were so entrenched in the consumer mindset though, and the collectibility of the vending machine cards was so well established, that patrons were very leery about the value and quality of the packaged cards. This shift in focus eventually led to Exhibit Supply Company going out of business in 1971.\nThough they are no longer producing their famed cards, the fact that the company no longer exists has made its products into sought after collector’s items. The vending machines themselves are very popular when they come up in major sports memorabilia auctions. The advertising equipment that accompanied each machine has become highly desirable as well, especially those portraying baseball stars. A 1920s Exhibit vending machine sold at auction in June of this year for $1022.\nThe cards themselves though, are the most universally sought after commodity from this venture. Much less rugged than the machines and advertising peripherals, very few cards survived in pristine quality; after all, they were primarily the fare of school kids in arcades, and very few had the good sense to keep them locked away to preserve them.\nThe baseball cards are by far the most valuable from this collection though. Due in part to their popularity during the era of Exhibit Supply Company, but due mostly to the popularity of baseball cards today. ESC inspired a great number of other companies to begin producing their own cards when their product was performing so admirably. Those who chose to follow Exhibit Supply Company’s example chose to base their business model on the most profitable aspect of the company, its baseball card production. The initial foray into supplying baseball cards in celluloid packages helped to ease collectors into the notion that this was entirely acceptable, and this paved the way for the brands that still exist today.\nMany of the game\'s greatest stars are pictured on Exhibit cards--many of whom have multiple cards within the various series. During World War II, Exhibit cards remained among the few widely distributed trading card products despite a paper conservation effort, although its sets remained smaller during the War years. The \'42-45 series are more difficult to find that many of the other series.\nMany Exhibit cards are difficult to connect to a certain season because of the lack of statistics or a manufacture date on the back, but tireless research by collectors has established checklists that are generally accurate. Exhibit cards are generally exceptionally affordable except for certain issues, like those made in the 1920s. Two years ago, a 1925 Lou Gehrig \'rookie\' card graded PSA 5, sold on eBay for a ""best offer"" price of $14,000.\nThe baseball cards that Exhibit Supply Company produced primarily derive their value from their position near the beginning of the great baseball card legacy and their extreme cultural value, capturing players from the golden age of professional baseball.\n-Story from Sports Collectors Daily', 'Baseball fans fall into categories – 1) card collectors…2) former card collectors…3) wannabe card collectors…4) or as George Carlin once said, “Grow up, these are just pictures of grown men”. For those of you in the first three groups, maybe a primer on the basics of collecting would enhance your experience or motivate you to get back into the hobby. For this exercise, we’ll stick to new products as opposed to secondary markets that sell older cards.\nQ. Where do I buy cards\nA. Card shops, hobby stores, retail chains and Internet dealers.\nQ. Are the products from these outlets all the same?\nA. No, there are “Hobby” packs and “Retail” packs. A hobby pack will have more autograph, memorabilia and insert cards…and will have a higher price.\nQ. Huh, what are autograph, memorabilia and insert cards?\nA. When the card manufacturers re-invented themselves about 15 years ago, they created interest in new products by inserting cards autographed by players or including a piece of memorabilia in the card (jersey, bat, etc.). Insert cards include parallel versions of the regular card or a special set highlighting certain players.\nQ. Can cards be purchased directly from card companies?\nA.Yes…some manufacturers sell on their websites, but the pricing will be comparable to other outlets\nQ. What is the configuration of today’s cards?\nA.Baseball cards still come in packs which have a certain number of cards (depending on the product). A sealed box of cards will include a specific number of packs. For example, Topps Heritage brand arrives from the factory in a case of 12 boxes, each box has 24 packs, each pack has 8 cards.\nQ. What size are cards?\nA. Today’s standard is 2.5 inches by 3.5 inches.\nQ. What is a rookie card?\nA. Usually, the first regular issue card of a player in his major league uniform.\nQ. What is a short-print card?\nA. This goes back all the way to the 50’s and is a card made in smaller quantities than others. Again, using Topps Heritage as an example, the 500 card set has #’s 426-500 made in lesser quantities.\nQ. Sometimes when I open a pack, there’s a blank card inserted – why is that done?\nA. Companies insert them to discourage people from trying to “search” unopened packs for thicker memorabilia cards. If they weren’t used, a buyer could just buy the one thick pack in a box to acquire a more valuable card.\nQ. What is a “common” card?\nA. The Beckett price guide only lists certain star players in each set. The remaining cards are listed as commons or semi-stars are have equal value.\nQ. What is a “redemption” card?\nA. When card companies contract with players for autographs, the timing doesn’t always allow for those cards to be in the original production run. So, the manufacturer puts an insert in the pack that describes the card and gives the collector guidelines to redeem the insert for the real item at a later date.\nQ. When were the first cards made?\nA. Baseball cards first appeared in the late 1800’s when they were inserted into packs of cigarettes and tobacco. The modern era of baseball cards really began with the 1952 Topps set.\nQ. When I was kid, there was a piece of bubble gum in the packs…when did that end?\nA. As collectors became more aware of card condition, they complained about the gum staining or damaging the cards. Topps removed gum from the cards in the early 1990’s.\nQ. How can I protect my cards?\nA. For newer cards, many collectors still use albums and nine-pocket pages…especially for sets. For loose cards of any value, always use “penny sleeves” (a clear plastic sleeve that covers the card) and then a “top-loader” (a more rigid holder). Never use rubber bands!\nQ. What about really valuable cards?\nA. Utilize a “screw-down” holder (two pieces of hard plastic screwed together) or a “one-touch” holder (the same concept but held together by a magnet)\nQ. What is grading?\nA. Third-party companies will inspect your card, give it a grade (from 1-to-10), encapsulate it and include a serial number on the case. This is the best way to protect valuable older cards and enhance their marketability. The two major vendors in this field are PSA & Beckett.\nQ. What is an error card?\nA. A mistake on the card such as the player’s name spelled incorrectly or his position missing. If the mistake was never corrected by the manufacturer, it is listed in guides as “UER” (uncorrected error). However, if the mistake was corrected, these cards become variations and can be more valuable.\nQ. I see some cards referred to as “Refractors”…what does that mean?\nA. A Refractor is a card manufactured by Topps using a technology that creates a shiny version of their “Chrome” cards. It reflects light and can be found in a number of colors. These are always made in limited quantities.\nQ. What is a rack pack?\nA. Not as prevalent as in the past, it was a pack of cards made from clear cellophane that usually had cards in three separate compartments. Today, they are primarily found at retail outlets.\nQ. Who should I collect?\nA. The most difficult question of all. Think about your own personal history involving baseball and go from there. Your favorite player(s), your favorite team or maybe your favorite year. Above all, create a collection you can enjoy and share.\nQuestions are welcomed…']"	['<urn:uuid:ff674429-07d9-49dd-80bb-d0274f286a31>', '<urn:uuid:41bce32b-c667-4f67-afe0-d4f0a411a073>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	19	109	1823

Both defend their treatment of the scrolls (detailed below).\nBut first, the criticisms. Rabin and Hahn argue in the Restaurator that:\n1. The Dead Sea Scrolls are being exhibited far too much, and that the consequent travel and handling is seriously accelerating their degradation. The authors show that there’s been a substantial increase in international exhibitions in the past two decades.\n2. No scientifically sophisticated system is yet in place to monitor the degradation state of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The authors argue that all exhibitions should be stopped until a rigorous analytical monitoring system is established and can prove that the frequent traveling is not unduly exacerbating the fragile state of these documents.\n3. Current strategies to conserve the scrolls may, in some cases, be worsening their state. In particular the authors take issue with the reinforcement of the scrolls with Japanese tissue paper. This process requires the use of an adhesive called methyl cellulose.\nRabin and Hahn argue that use of the adhesive brings the scrolls in contact with unnecessary moisture. They say this wetness is causing collagen in the animal skin parchment to unravel irreversibly from its triple helix formation into an amorphous gelatin. They include an image of this gelatinization to make their point.\nThe article’s first author, Rabin, worked as a consultant at the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) from 2005-2006. From multiple accounts, Rabin and the IAA did not part on congenial terms. In 2007, Rabin received a letter from the IAA’s lawyers (seen by Artful Science) threatening legal action if she presented work from her time at the IAA at a conference or in a publication, based on an employment contract she had once signed.\nAs such, the criticism in the current Restaurator article is based on publically available information, the authors’ research on Dead Sea Scrolls from the Israel Museum in Jerusalem (some of which underwent conservation treatments at the IAA), and the authors’ research on a Dead Sea Scroll collection housed at the University of Manchester. The Manchester collection contains small fragments of the scrolls that don’t go on tour and are primarily used for research purposes, Rabin says.\nIn the past year, Rabin and Hahn have also published two scientific papers (here and here) on their Dead Sea Scroll research at Manchester. (They are developing an X-ray fluorescence technique to help resolve a long standing debate about where and how the scrolls were produced.)\nAnd now the responses:\nThe Israel Museum’s press officer sent a short email noting that the organization’s curators and conservators “adopt the best available tools to ensure the safekeeping of these works” and “ascribe to the highest standards” but she did not provide any further explanation about the tools or the standards. She also noted that the scrolls’ condition is “assessed on an ongoing basis” and that they are only allowed to travel “when the Museum can be satisfied regarding the conditions for transport, handling, and display.” No specifics were given.\nIn a phone conversation, the IAA’s head scroll conservator, Pnina Shor, said that the IAA’s conservation strategies were developed in collaboration with the Library of Congress and the Getty Conservation Institute. She also defended the exhibitions. When the scrolls are on the road, Shor said the IAA ensures that “the environmental conditions in display cases are exactly the same as the conditions in the vault” except for the amount of illumination the scrolls get.\nMuseums spend a lot of effort evaluating what acceptable light levels are, given that light damage is a prime culprit in the destruction of many kinds of art and artifacts, from Van Gogh pigments to plastic sculptures.\nShor said that the IAA has set a maximum amount of illumination the scrolls can receive to 15,000 lux per year. “The scrolls are made of organic material [animal skin]. We know they deteriorate no matter what we do or do not do. It is part of our duty to both ensure the safety of our heritage and to share it with the public.”\nShe acknowledged that an analytical monitoring system that could systematically evaluate degradation was not yet in place. However she pointed out that the IAA is working on a high tech multispectral imaging system, with collaborator Greg Bearman who has developed similar systems for NASA’s jet propulsion lab.\nLast year Bearman, Shor and their colleagues published two proof-of-principle articles (here and here) about how the monitoring system might work. The articles showed data for artificially-aged parchments, but not the Dead Sea Scrolls. Rabin and Hahn criticize the technique in the Restaurator article, saying that they don’t think it is going to work for the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nBearman told Artful Science in an email that Rabin and Hahn don’t fully understand the technique being developed and he added that his team has been collecting data on the scrolls for eight months. He also noted that experiments are ongoing this summer but he did not know when they would be publishing the results. He added that the team was also considering a whole battery of other analytical techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy.\nPresented with this rebuttal, Rabin responded that she’ll need to see a peer-reviewed article that shows a monitoring technique that works on the Dead Sea Scrolls before she’ll be convinced. She added that even if a fully functioning monitoring system is on the horizon, the scrolls should not be traveling until such a watchdog system is in place.\nAs for the article’s third point, that using Japanese tissue paper and methyl cellulose to reinforce the fragile scrolls is causing harm in some cases: The IAA’s Shor pointed out that this is a well-accepted strategy in the document conservation world, citing the Library of Congress as an institution that uses the method.\nIrene Brückle, an editor of the Restaurator who has written books on document conservation, said the Japanese tissue technique is indeed industry standard, but she also added that there’s no one-size-fits-all strategy for document conservation. Decisions are often made on a case-by-case basis.\nThe current controversy is actually just one of many that have swarmed around the scrolls. Discovered by nomads in desert caves starting from 1947, the Dead Sea Scrolls then found themselves in a new humid environment that kick-started their degradation.\nIll-fated conservation strategies of the 1950s and 60s only made things worse. As the IAA’s Shor has written:\n- The scrolls were at first unknowingly handled inappropriately and kept in an uncontrolled environment. Moreover, in the first years, adhesive tape used to join fragments and seal cracks caused irreversible damage. The scrolls were then moistened and flattened loosely between plates of window glass and sealed with adhesive tape. The ageing of the adhesives and the pressure of the glass caused the skins to darken – to the extent that some of the texts are no longer legible – and the edges to gelatinize.\nConservators started the herculean task of removing the tape in the 1970s and by 1991 they were placed in a climate-controlled storeroom. Conservators also began reinforcing the scrolls with various strategies, including with Japanese tissue paper. And then, as the Restaurator article points out, exhibitions of the scrolls increased substantially.\nIn the end, the current debate boils down to the precautionary principle. Rabin and Hahn think all exhibitions should be stopped until it can be scientifically proven that the traveling isn’t further harming the scrolls. The IAA and Israel Museum says they have the situation under control and that the benefits of exhibition outweigh the possible risks.\nAs it always does, time will tell which approach is wisest.']"	['<urn:uuid:1e38a2f0-9445-4a7e-8efc-c80a162cca95>', '<urn:uuid:80570ddf-0cd7-4d77-b63c-9f4362b421db>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	7	72	3683
86	How did ancient trade routes impact culture, and what remains today?	The ancient Silk Roads facilitated extensive cultural exchange, enabling people of different ethnicities and beliefs to live together peacefully while exchanging knowledge, ideas, and beliefs. This cultural impact is preserved in numerous historical sites, particularly exemplified by the Kizil Grottoes in Xinjiang. These grottoes, built between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD, contain about 236 caves with nearly 10,000 square meters of preserved murals, representing the largest such complex in China. These archaeological remains provide rich evidence of historical processes, cultural traditions, religious art, ethnic folklore, and the development of music and dance, serving as tangible proof of the cultural interactions that occurred along the Silk Roads.	"['The UNESCO Tehran Cluster Office, the Iranian National Commission for UNESCO, Ministry of Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicraft, Bu-Ali Sina University and the Iranian Research Center for the Silk Roads cooperated to hold the International Conference on “Intercultural and Interfaith Dialogue along the Ancient Silk Roads: Religious Influences on Cultural Heritage Sites” on 28-29 September in Hamedan, hosted by the Municipality of Hamedan and Bu Ali Sina University of Hamedan.\nThe event brought together experts on the Silk Roads and Religious Heritages from both Iranian and international background and embodied participatory academic lectures and discussions. Experts from Russia, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Turkey, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, China, Switzerland and France have all gathered in Hamedan to share their professional knowledge and experience evolving around the theme of the conference.\nThe conference turned to be a key activity in reference of the International Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures, in which UNESCO was appointed as lead agency: it was born of the need for new articulations between cultural diversity and universal values. The International Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures calls for Member States’ commitment to furthering interreligious and intercultural dialogue and the promotion of mutual understanding and cooperation for peace.\nIn the opening session, Dr. Hojatollah Ayoubi, the Secretary General of the Iranian National Commission for UNESCO emphasised the importance of intercultural and interreligious dialogue and called upon all the audiences to build mutual understanding and tolerance between peoples from the region.\nIn his speech, Mr. Cvetan Cvetkovski, Officer in Charge of the UNESCO Tehran Cluster Office, emphasized the great value of the ancient Silk Roads in terms of its role of promoting communication and peace among the societies: “To tackle with the turbulence and unrest of our time, people have to look back to our history for an answer of peace and sustainability. The numerous splendid historical and cultural heritage sites along Silk Roads left by our ancestors have demonstrated perfectly that there is a way for people of different ethnicities, with different beliefs, to live together peacefully and prosperously. By looking into the development and history of the Silk Roads, we would learn how people once exchanged knowledge, ideas and beliefs while also living and interacting in a harmonious way”. Mr. Cvetkovski also stressed the role of the religious heritages played in regards to improve the peaceful communication between people, as he mentioned: “Each of these sites or monuments not only represents the religions of local communities, but also bears witness to the cultural interaction and disseminations of religion that took place in or around them, revealing the influence of religions from around the world, brought into contact via the historic silk routes”.\nThe deputy minister of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts, Dr. Mohammad Hasan Talebian, gave his remarks on the tight relation between the Silk Roads and the different believes. He pointed out that our modern society should learn from the people who lived along the ancient Silk Roads to live with each other peacefully. He also called upon the society not only to focus on the differences between the religions but also the common points existed among them, for these common points are the cornerstone of mutual understanding and respect.\nDr. Gholam Ali Haddad Adel, President of Academy of Persian Language and Literature, emphasised the importance of the historical Silk Roads and its role of connecting knowledge and beliefs between the west and the east. Speaking of the modern Silk Roads, he also expressed his high appreciation for the new international Silk Roads initiative and its role of promoting international peace and communication.\nAyatollah Sa’bani, the Imam Jom’eh of Hamedan, also expressed his wish of letting people abandon prejudice on religions. He stressed that no matter what religion one might believe in --- Islam, Christianity or Judaism, people should respect the difference of each other because all the religions ask their followers to show the benevolence and kindness.\nAfter the opening speeches, the two-day long expert panels kicked off at Bu-Ali Sina University and then at Baba Taher hotel. International and national experts on the Silk Roads shared their knowledge regarding themes such as “Shared values among religions and their reflections on the cultural heritage sites”, “Protection and sustainable development of religion-related cultural heritage sites” and “Fostering peace and mutual understanding from a religious point of view”. In the presentations and discussions, religious influences on the sites along the Silk Roads were elaborated and the understanding about the relation between religion and heritage were emphasized.\nOn the closing session of the event on the second day, the mayor of Hamedan, Mr. Abbas Soufi delivered his remarks by thanking all the contributions made by the experts in the conference. He also highlighted the significant role that Hamedan played in the historical Silk Roads and expressed the will of keeping Hamedan in the loop of promoting the peaceful development of culture.\nAfter his speech, Mr. Cvetkovski concluded the international conference by reiterating the significance of the historical value of the Silk Roads and the effort of preserving the shared value of respect and tolerance along the Silk Roads made by different parties, as he said: “It is my hope that from the two day’s conference, we can genuinely improve our understanding about the importance of embracing cultural diversity and respecting different beliefs …it is not exaggerating to attribute what we have achieved today to our ancestor’s benevolence and generosity to others, and to their selfless sharing with each other.”\nIn addition to the panels of the conference, the Municipality of Hamedan has also arranged a series of cultural field trips for the experts. Participants took the chance to explore some famous historical and natural sites such as the Tomb of Esther and Mordechai, Imam Khomeini square and the Alisadr Cave.\nIt is expected that a publication reflecting the outcomes of the Conference will be prepared and co-published in the near future by UNESCO and the Iranian Research Center for the Silk Roads at Shahid Beheshti University.', 'Kyzil Grottoes – Primitive Buddhist art on the Silk Road\nThe Kyzil Grottoes – Primitive Buddhist art on the Silk Road\nThe Kizil Grottoes are located on the cliffs of Minya Dag Mountain facing the Muzhati River, 7 km southeast of Kizil Township, Baicheng County, and about forty-three kilometers west of present-day Kucha, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. There is a large ditch between the water-filled Minya Dag Mountain that in front of the grottoes forms a fan-shaped oasis filled with acacia, poplar, and fruit trees. The general direction of the grottoes is from east to west and extends for about 3 kilometers. There are 236 numbered caves, with almost 10,000 square meters of preserved mural surface. Of these, some 135 are still relatively intact. It is one of the most important monuments of Xinjiang and the Silk Road.\nThe earliest Kizil Grottoes were built around the 3rd century A.D. and the latest around the 8th century A.D. They are the first large grotto complex in China. The Kizil Grottoes are also the largest grottoes, with the largest area of preserved murals. They show the entire process of creation, development, prosperity, and decline of the Grottoes from the 3rd to the 9th century A.D. They also provide rich evidence of specific historical processes, cultural traditions, religious art, ethnic folklore, and the development and evolution of music and dance.\nIn particular, it provides important information from sites, scattered in a desert area of the Xinjiang region, that played an essential role in the transmission of Buddhism from India to East Asia. Among them, Kizil stands out for its size and abundant murals, which provide invaluable information about the culture of the Kucha Kingdom, an important center of Buddhist culture from the 3rd to the 7th century. Centuries later, the cave temples were abandoned and their artistic content was forgotten.\nSince they were built, the caves have suffered successive deteriorations, some caused by natural phenomena and others by the hand of man. The sculptures that survive are scarce, while the most numerous and well-preserved murals have become the most precious relics. Its most important aggression was when the German expeditions of Le Coq and Grunwedel took hundreds of wall paintings to Germany, some of them later sold on the international market.\nThe Kizil caves served as Buddhist temples and as monks’ domiciles. The simpler, usually one-room caves were used as monks’ residences and were not decorated. Larger ones, with a square chamber may have been used for communal religious activities, in which some eminent monks would expound aspects of Buddhist doctrine. Many of these were furnished with altars and decorated with statues and murals.\nThe larger caves, with a large square pillar in the center of the main chamber, were used for liturgical purposes. Most of these share a similar iconography and layout, with a large niche for a statue at the front of the pillar, and a mural depicting Buddha preaching. The side walls were usually covered with preaching scenes, and the ceiling with episodes from the jātaka (accounts of Buddha’s previous lives). The back wall, decorated with a nirvāṇa scene, featured a painted or sculpted image of the reclining Buddha. The side aisles and entrance wall of the cave were also painted.\nPortrait of a Mandarin in 1800\nPortrait of a Mandarin in 1800 This was the year in which a very interesting book was published, which through 60 portraits, tried to show some aspects of life in China to the western public.

87	teen drivers statistics cause of death and why teenagers make poor decisions	Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for young Americans aged 5-24, with approximately 2,100 teens aged 16-19 dying every year from vehicle crashes - about six teens daily. The high crash rate is linked to how teenagers' brains work - studies show their brains have difficulty paying attention to mistakes compared to adult brains, and they struggle with planning and thinking about consequences due to their brain's excitement center being very active. This makes it harder for them to make good decisions, especially in emotional situations.	['The prom season approaches. High-school students get excited; parents get fearful. The issue of drinking and driving becomes the topic of discussion among parents and teens. It’s a scenario that plays out every year. It should. The subject is that important.\nDespite progress with teen drinking and driving – the percentage of high-school teens who drink and drive has decreased by more than half since 1991 – motor vehicle crashes are still the leading cause of death for teens in the U.S. In fact, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for young Americans age 5 to 24, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\nIf we dig deeper into the statistics, however, the picture gets even worse. The risk of motor vehicle crashes is higher among 16-19-year-olds than for any other age group. Research further shows that teens don’t use seat belts enough, are more likely to speed, and are more likely to underestimate dangerous situations. Such conditions can – and too often do - lead to tragedy.\nHere’s a few more statistics to consider. Approximately 2,100 teens age 16-19 die and 243,000 are treated in emergency departments for injuries from motor vehicle crashes every year. That means six teens die from motor vehicle injuries every day.\nAlcohol, of course, is now just one part of the problem. Today’s technology, while certainly making cars safer in many ways, has also increased the risks of driving by talking and texting on cell phones.\nParents have a critical part to play in reducing the risks of motor vehicle crashes by teen drivers. The CDC campaign, Parents are the Key to Safe Teen Drivers, is designed to help keep teens driver safe, and the information is something every parent should learn.\nThe CDC identifies eight “danger zones” that raise the risk of crashes by teen drivers and offers suggestions about what parents can do to lower the risk.\nDanger Zone 1: Driver Inexperience. Crash risk is highest in the first year of having a license. Parents can provide supervised practice over several months, on a variety of roads, at different times of day, and in different weather conditions.\nDanger Zone 2: Driving with Teen Passengers. This also raises the risk of a crash. Limit the number of passengers your teen can have in the car for at least six months.\nDanger Zone 3: Driving at Night. Fatal crashes are more likely at night for all ages, but particularly for teenagers. Practice night-time driving with your teen.\nDanger Zone 4: Not Using Seat Belts. Teens have the lowest rate of seatbelt use compared to other groups. Seat belt use is a proven way to prevent deaths from car crashes, so require your teen to wear the belt on every trip.\nDanger Zone 5: Distracted Driving. Operating a motor vehicle requires paying strict attention to driving as well as to other drivers around you and being ready to react quickly to fast-changing conditions. Talking on a cell phone, texting, eating, or playing with the radio significantly raises the risk of crashes.\nDanger Zone 6: Drowsy Driving. Research shows that most teens don’t get enough sleep. Make sure your son or daughter is well rested before driving, especially at night.\nDanger Zone 7: Reckless Driving. Most teenagers lack the experience, judgement, and maturity to assess situations and may take risks behind the wheel.\nDanger Zone 8: Impaired Driving. Even one alcoholic drink can impair a teenager’s ability to drive, raising the risk of a crash. Remember the purpose and value of a “designated driver.”\nThe risk of a crash, of course, increases significantly when the above dangers occur in combination.\nTalking with your teen about the above hazards, practice driving under controlled conditions, and being a role model are important steps to help your teen make smart decisions about driving.\nHere’s one more recommended step: create a Parent-Teen Driving Agreement. This puts parental rules in writing and sets expectations and limits on your teen as a motor vehicle operator. It can be updated periodically, as your teen gains experience behind the wheel.\nThe CDC’s message to parents is clear: “One of the most important safety features for your teen driver is you.” So take some time to learn about teen driving. You can think of it as an investment in your child’s future.\nFor more information, and a model Parent-Teen Driving Agreement, visit the CDC at www.cdc.gov/parentsarethekey.\nMichael Guidi, D.O., is a board-certified family physician practicing in Haverhill, Mass., and chairman of the Massachusetts Medical Society’s Committee on Student Health and Sports Medicine.

Send comments to PhysicianFocus@mms.org', 'Many parents look at their teenagers and ask themselves, “What happened to the sweet child we once knew?” They are now hard to communicate with and always want to be out with their friends. In many ways, teenagers seem able to make reasonable decisions. But, the next thing you know, they and their friends have gone to the wrong place at the wrong time and made some surprising decisions.\nThis is normal adolescence. Adolescence is a period of life when changes happen throughout the body that affect the way teens interact with the world. Hormones are racing. They affect what motivates teenagers’ behaviors. During this time, the brain changes a lot. This causes teens to act in ways they find engaging and motivating.\nResearch studies show that the parts of the brain in charge of making decisions and controlling actions change as a child becomes a teenager. The front of the brain becomes stronger and more involved in adolescents’ decision making. However, although teenagers can make “adult” kinds of decisions, the new brain changes are not yet perfect and can easily result in teenagers making poor decisions. In addition, research being conducted at the University of Pittsburgh’s Laboratory of Neurocognitive Development has found that adolescent brains have a harder time paying attention to mistakes than adult brains. This means that teens might continue to make the same mistakes.\nResearch studies have also found that teens might struggle with planning and thinking about consequences. This is because the part of the brain that is in charge of excitement is very active and much more sensitive to emotional situations. Decision making becomes especially difficult when friends are around because they influence behavior. This may be why studies have found that when teens get in trouble with the law it is usually when they are in a group. For example, one brain study found that when teens are told they are being watched by other teens during a driving video game, they suddenly start making mistakes as the part of the brain that cares about excitement “lights up” (their brain activity shows up in an image during the study). This shows that being around their friends makes teens act more impulsively.\nAlthough adolescents can act irresponsibly and get into trouble, scientists understand that this time of the lifespan has a special purpose. Having a brain that is driven to explore new places and experiences, create new circles of friends and find a partner are very important for succeeding as an adult. It is a process that helps with the transition from being in the protective care of parents to an independent life. It is also important to recognize that the same part of the brain that cares about excitement also cares about learning. So, while adolescents do a lot of things that are impulsive and meant to get rewards, this is also a time when they can learn the best ways to interact with those around them. It’s important that parents and teachers not be discouraged if their teens appear not to care or listen; teens actually are listening and affected by what adults say. We can’t stop guiding and giving advice to the teens in our lives, but we need to do so with a calm tone as they are hypersensitive to emotions.']	['<urn:uuid:addccb0e-1471-4a7e-817e-3db1b40f3146>', '<urn:uuid:235c6a27-f142-462a-ba45-621d6545c53e>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	12	89	1345
88	hormone clock genes balding mechanisms	Male pattern baldness is primarily caused by hormones, particularly dihydrotestosterone (DHT) which is derived from testosterone and causes hair follicle shrinkage. This hormonal process can begin as early as the twenties, leading to receding hairlines and crown hair loss. Additionally, the hair growth cycle is regulated by clock genes, specifically BMAL1 and PER1, which control hair stem cell activity and determine the duration of growth phases. These clock genes produce signals that terminate the growth phase (anagen). Disrupting these genes can actually prolong the hair growth cycle. The process is also influenced by thyroid hormones, which regulate clock activity in hair follicles. Patients with thyroid dysfunction may experience disordered circadian clock function affecting their hair growth.	"[""One common misconception about hats is that they cause hair loss in men. While this fallacy has been around for years, it is actually impossible. A hat would have to be worn extremely tight in order to cut off circulation and damage the follicles. Even if this occurred, you would experience other troubling signs from the pressure well before any hair started to fall out.\nSome Hair Styles May Cause Damage\nGuys who think hair loss from wearing hats is an issue are probably confusing the practice with traction alopecia. This condition mainly afflicts women and occurs when the hair is constantly pulled too tightly. When hair bands in braids and ponytails cause extreme pressure, this force may result in gradual hair loss. Unless you're wearing Mohawk braids or a man bun tucked under the hat, the probability of losing your locks is near zero.\nDo Hats Cause Hair Loss?\nWhen it comes to men's hair loss, hormones are the main culprit. Male pattern baldness, which causes a receding hairline and hair loss at the crown, is a common result of hormone imbalances. For some unfortunate men, this process may occur as early as their twenties.\nAs the condition progresses, follicles eventually shrink, hair strands become shorter, and their texture changes. Guys who once had thick locks may discover their hair is now a finer texture. Although hair growth may eventually cease, regrowth is possible in some instances since the follicles remain.\nAlthough many people link baldness to testosterone levels, dihydrotestosterone is actually the guilty party. DHT is derived from testosterone and the main cause of hair follicle shrinkage. In order to stop or reverse hair loss patterns, men have to control their DHT levels. Until guys better understand how hormones affect hair growth, the myth of men's hair loss from hats will continue.\nProper Hat Maintenance\nWhile you can't encourage baldness from wearing hats, you may get an unpleasant smell if caps are not properly cleaned. Besides being a fashion accessory, hats are designed to keep our heads warm and dry. The downside to this extra warmth is it creates an environment that is bacteria friendly.\nEvery time you put on a hat, the inside absorbs any sweat, oil, or hair product residue present on the scalp. Over time, this can lead to a hat that smells quite unpleasant. By cleaning your hats on a regular basis, you can keep your head and nose happy.\nCan Wearing a Hat Cause Hair Loss?\nIt is ironic that many people still believe the myth of hat hair loss. Hats conceal hair loss; they do not cause it. For guys who are balding or have thinning hair, hats are an excellent way to provide warmth outdoors while covering any imperfections.\nIn earlier times, hats were always removed once indoors, but this custom has somewhat changed. Today, it is completely acceptable in many casual settings to wear your cap while inside. Unless you are at a funeral, church, or formal business gathering, chances are wearing a hat is OK. While some hats are too heavy for indoor wear, there are a number of lightweight styles appropriate for year-round wear at home or around the city.\nFor guys who are completely bald, men's hats are essential for protection from sun, wind, and precipitation wide brim hats are especially good for this purpose. In warmer climates, skin cancer from UV rays is a common issue among residents. While most forms of skin cancer are easily treatable, why not sport a stylish hat and avoid the hassle altogether? Additionally, men with little or no hair are more likely to become cold when outdoors.\nShow Your Fashionable Side in a New Hat\nNow that you know hats are safe for everyday wear, there is no need to sacrifice when it comes to style. It doesn't matter if your locks are thinning or you have a lush mane of hair. Hats are a terrific way to stay warm, protected, and fashionable all at the same time. From a thick leather trapper hat to a straw outback design, the right hat adds a nice, stylish touch to any outfit."", 'Hair growth is a vital part of our lives. If you think about it, scalp, facial, and body hairs are some of the few body parts one can manipulate. In addition to piercing and tattooing skin, hair grooming allows an individual to uniquely present themselves. Mature hair undergo several phases in the hair growth cycle including anagen, catagen, telogen, and exogen. Anagen is the phase of active growth. During this time, factors outside of your body may affect hair growth. For instance, hair usually grows faster in the summer months as compared to the winter. The catagen phase begins when anagen ends. It is a shorter transitional phase where hair stops growing. Telogen is a resting phase that transitions into the exogen phase where old hairs are shed. After the hair falls out, the follicle is inactive for some time before the hair’s biological clock restarts. Each hair follicle is independent from the others and undergoes its own hair growth cycle at different times from each other. This is what prevents your hair from falling out all at once.\nTable 1 - Hair Growth Phases\nHair Growth Phase\nTransition from growth phase to resting phase\nPhase where resting hair is shed from the body\nCircadian Rhythm and Circadian Genes\nThe circadian rhythm is described as a biological clock that affects how the body functions over a 24 hour cycle. The circadian rhythm is affected by the environment, such as light and darkness. This biological clock is regularly matched to a 24 hour day through exposures to light and dark. The circadian clock is centered in parts of our brain that can receive signals from light and temperature. Clock genes are genes that help contribute to our body’s circadian rhythm, also known as the molecular gears of circadian clocks. Therefore, for our circadian clock to be able to respond to the environment, our clock genes also rely on both the internal biology of the body as well as factors outside of the body that work together to affect the hair’s biological clock.\nThe Hair Growth Biological Clock\nThere is evidence that the circadian clock, which adjusts the body’s biology to the day’s natural cycle, regulates skin functions. For each hair growth cycle, hair follicles make new hair. The ability to regenerate hairs throughout life is from the hair stem cells in the hair follicle and the influence of the circadian rhythm.\nOnce growth is complete during the anagen phase, clock genes are expressed in the hair cells at the bottom of the hair follicle. Thus, the circadian clock differs among the phases of the hair growth cycle. The circadian clock can adjust how the hair stem cells are turned off or on, which controls the hair growth cycles. For instance, through a clock gene called BMAL1, stem cell genes can be affected to become more or less active. If mutations arise in clock genes, such as deleting BMAL1, stem cells may become inactive leading to poor hair growth.\nDisturbing the Hair’s Biological Clock\nStudies have shown that disrupting the circadian clock can prolong the phase of active hair growth. BMAL1 and PER1 are core clock genes in the human hair cycle. Because the circadian clock influences cell activity at different stages of the hair cycle, clock gene mutations can result in subtle hair cycle variations. These clock gene dysfunctions may cause certain disorders. The BMAL1 and PER1 clock genes produce signals that terminate the growth phase, anagen. Silencing both of these genes can prolong the hair growth cycle and lead to longer hair.\nWhile disrupting clock genes (BMAL1 and PER1) and prolonging the anagen phase of active hair growth supports the idea that the hair follicles exhibit a biological clock based activity, other hormones are important too. For example, thyroid hormones also prolong anagen in hair follicles. Thyroid hormones are one of the main regulators of the hair growth cycle. Thyroxine (T4) also regulates clock activity of hair follicles and patients with thyroid dysfunction may also show a disordered circadian clock.\nSleep and its Effects on Hair Growth\nSome sleep disorders are related to our circadian rhythms. In some sleep disorder, sleep occurs abnormally early or late. Studies have shown that these disorders often correlate to mutations in clock genes that then lead to an irregular biological clock. On the other hand, sleep deprivation could alter clock gene expression. The mechanism of this is due to the decreased binding of certain clock genes that have been associated with lack of sleep. Our sleep and wake cycles are then affected so that we may not be as alert as we would like to be in the morning or as tired as we hope to be when it is time to sleep.\nSleep deprivation affects the circadian rhythm which may affect hair growth cycles. One study showed that sleep deprivation resulted in decreased beard-hair growth. The study attributed these effects to lower protein synthesis during sleep deprivation as well as less growth hormone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) release. On the contrary, there is research in twin studies that found associations with sleeping more to correlate with more hair loss in both the front and side parts of their head. However, the researchers cautioned to not simply conclude that prolonged sleep is what causes baldness. Instead, they were concerned that antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications could also lead to prolonged sleep hours, indicating more of a connection between excessive stress, depression, and hair loss.\nThere are still questions as to whether or not more sleep allows your hair to grow lusher and longer. Regardless, there is good evidence that the hair follicle has a biological clock and it may be connected to the body’s circadian rhythm.\nPER1 and BMAL1 are potential targets for therapy in modulating hair growth by avoiding undesired effects on the central clock. By blocking the activity of such genes, future therapies may prevent hair loss (alopecia). By promoting activity of these target genes, therapy may suppress unwanted hair growth (hirsutism).\nMelatonin is commonly used to try to regulate the sleep-wake cycles and it may influence the hair growth cycle as well. Topical application of melatonin may be a treatment option for those with female and male pattern hair loss.\n* This Website is for general skin beauty, wellness, and health information only.

89	I've noticed my garden soil isn't very good for growing plants. What makes soil healthy for plants to grow in, and what tiny creatures help maintain soil health?	Healthy soil needs to provide three key things for plants: a firm substrate for roots to anchor, a supply of minerals, and consistent water availability. The soil's texture, determined by particle size, affects all these factors. Beyond the basic structure, soil health is maintained by countless microscopic organisms. These include bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and protozoa, which decompose organic matter and release nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi form special partnerships with plant roots, helping them absorb nutrients and water. Protozoa eat bacteria and release nitrogen that plants can use. Arthropods like mites and springtails shred organic matter and compete with disease organisms, while earthworms create channels for roots and increase the soil's water-holding capacity. All these organisms work together in what scientists call the soil food web.	['Any time of the year is a good time to improve garden soil. But what makes good soil? It must meet the basic needs of any growing plant — first, a firm substrate that roots can use to anchor the aerial plant body; second, a supply of minerals for growth; and, most importantly, a consistent supply of available water.\nThe anchoring part is sort of a slam dunk. Anything falling between the two extremes of solid rock and a liquid will support a root structure to some extent. Of course, there is a gradient; dense clay won’t allow roots as easy an entry as loose sand. Here’s where the rest of the soil’s attributes come into play. Mainly, these have to do with the size of the mineral particles that define its texture. Extremely small particles are found in clay soils, and relatively large particles, in sandy soils, with every possible gradation in between. Clay soils also bind essential nutrients more closely than sandy soils. The water-carrying capacity of soils is also directly tied to the average size of the mineral particles; clay soils have little space between their particles, so less is available for water; sand, with its large, irregularly shaped particles, can sequester much more water.\nBeyond the mineral structure of soil, organic matter is also absolutely key to good soil. The fertility of soil depends on the activities of a myriad of organisms (that can also contribute in many ways to soil structure). Organic matter provides microscopic organisms, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and more with a suitable habitat. Most of these organisms are engaged in the decomposition of such organic matter. In this digestive process, they alter the organics and contribute various exudates. Humic acid is one such addition and is important for the overall health of the soil. Along with some of the larger fauna that inhabit the soil, like earthworms, these critters function as mini-shredders, leaving behind uniformly sized particles.\nThese organic bits act as wedges between the clay particles, allowing for water and air penetration. In sandy soil (with large pores between particles that can fill up with lots of water), organic particles increase the water-holding ability of the soil. Add organic matter to feed the soil dwellers, and get soil with a better texture. If the soil supports a healthy mix of these organisms and an adequate supply of organic matter, there should be little need for additional fertilizer. Nitrifying organisms transform this stored material to nitrate available for use by plants. The more organic matter in the soil, the more nitrogen there is that can be converted into plant nutrients.\nWhile almost any organic material incorporated into the soil will help, well-made compost will also have many of the beneficial soil organisms already in place and thriving, so it would always be a good first choice. Well-rotted animal manures and forestry by-products like ground fir bark are good but should not be added in great quantity unless composted first. Once the system nutrient cycling is up and running, maintaining a layer of mulch on the soil surface will give these friendly microorganisms a constant source of food.\nNow is a good time to get down and dirty; take stock of the state of the soil, and make a plan to improve its fertility and water-holding capacity. This subterranean stratum is just as fascinating and important as any other.\nVirginia Hayes, curator of Ganna Walska Lotusland, will answer your gardening questions.

Send email to firstname.lastname@example.org.', 'In your garden, you can look around and easily see life: a bird singing, a beautiful flower, a ripening tomato. Life abounds, and it doesn’t require a magnifying glass to see. Or does it?\nIn the soil beneath your feet, there’s an invisible world filled with life-and-death drama. Scientists call this world the soil food web. This web features a diversity of creatures, from microscopic bacteria, fungi, and algae, to mites and nematodes, to earthworms, ants, spiders, and plant roots.\nThese organisms spend at least part of their lives in soil, enriching and enhancing it as they live their daily lives. Some soil food web members decompose organic matter, such as plant debris or manure. Others convert nitrogen, a basic plant nutrient, into forms plants can readily use. When you apply fertilizer, the soil food web makes that fertilizer available to plant roots. When too much nitrogen is present, the soil food web can hold much of that nitrogen in soil in forms that aren’t readily available to plants, providing a microscopic fertilizer storage facility.\nWhen the soil food web is healthy and active, it changes soil structure. These changes create soil that can hold water and allow air to penetrate to plant roots. Some members of the soil food web also break down pollutants that make their way into soil.\nSoil food web components live throughout soil, but they’re typically concentrated where organic matter is—usually in the top few inches of soil around the tips of plant roots. Roots release proteins and sugars, which feed bacteria in the soil. Other creatures, nematodes and protozoa, feed on the bacteria. This part of the soil food web that takes place near plant roots actually helps feed plants and strengthens them to resist disease.\nOne easy way to add organic matter to your garden is to mix Miracle-Gro® Performance Organics™ All Purpose In-Ground Soil, which is enriched with aged compost, in with the top layer of soil.\nThere’s a Fungus Among Us!\nSeveral different types of organisms make up the soil food web. Bacteria don’t move far in soil and tend to digest green matter. Fungi, on the other hand, migrate in the soil. As fungi grow, they create threads that are thousandths of an inch thick. These threads extend through soil, creating channels for water and air. When threads bind together to form a large mass, they increase the soil’s ability to hold water. Some fungi are decomposers, breaking down brown, coarse organic material into forms that other soil organisms can use. This action enhances soil with humic acid-rich organic matter, which resists breakdown and helps soil retain water.\nMycorrhizal fungi grow around or in plant roots, drawing carbon and sugars from the plant and pumping various nutrients and water directly into plant roots. The result is that plants with mycorrhizal colonies grow faster, bigger, and stand up to stress better. Mycorrhizal fungi form specific partnerships with plants, so that there are particular fungi that colonize specific tree, vegetable, or perennial roots. You can buy mycorrhizal fungi in a dry form to mix into soil to increase plant growth and productivity. Typically you add the fungi to planting holes. It is an easy way to jump-start your garden’s soil food web and improve soil health. It’ll be 4 to 6 weeks before you’ll see results in plant growth.\nCreatures in Your Soil\nProtozoa are single-celled organisms that eat bacteria. As protozoa digest bacteria, the process releases nitrogen in a form plants can use. Nematodes are non-segmented worms that feast on plants, algae, bacteria, fungi, and other nematodes. Their role in the soil food web enriches soil and helps control disease organisms. (These are not the same as root-knot nematodes, which feed on plant roots.)\nAnother group of soil creatures, arthropods, includes many insects or close relatives such as tiny invisible mites, springtails, and bigger, easily visible centipedes, spiders, beetles, and millipedes. They shred organic matter in soil so good bacteria can break it down so it releases nutrients for roots to absorb. These bacteria, which don’t move far in soil, tend to attach to insects and other related creatures that are highly mobile and often transport bacteria to their food source.\nAs arthropods feed on organic matter, they make almost invisible little pellets of poop that enrich soil. Arthropods also compete with disease organisms for food. For instance, some disease organisms feed on plant roots. When arthropods are present, they prey upon those disease organisms, devouring them before they can infect roots.\nEarthworms break down organic matter in soil. As organic matter passes through a worm’s gut, it’s enriched with nutrients and minerals. Worm poop, or castings, is sold as a rich fertilizer. When earthworms are active, they increase soil’s ability to hold water, create channels for roots to grow in, and increase microorganism concentrations in soil.']	['<urn:uuid:a0621eb3-ccdc-44b2-ac5a-1ff9f3a76547>', '<urn:uuid:f0b8d96c-96f0-4974-abb0-3d907129ac60>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	28	124	1400
90	How is climate change hurting crops, and can technology help farmers?	Climate change is already reducing crop yields of major staple crops, with an average reduction of around 1% of consumable food calories for the top ten crops, particularly affecting food-insecure countries. However, satellite imagery analytics and green technologies can help farmers through smart decision-making, timely reaction to weather threats, and efficient resource management. These technologies enable crop health tracking, moisture level monitoring, and better farm management while increasing sustainability.	['Climate change may already be reducing crop yields of some of the world’s most important crops and food-insecure countries are being affected the most, according to a new study published on 31 May in PLOS One (1).\nJust ten crops —barley, cassava, maize, oil palm, rapeseed, rice, sorghum, soybean, sugarcane and wheat — supply around 83 per cent of the total calories produced by croplands. Therefore, future food security hinges on the ability to maintain these staple crops. However, crop yields are expected to decrease under future climate change projections.\nAccording to the authors, previous assessments based on climate change and crop yield predictions provide important insight — higher estimates of global warming will likely result in strong yield losses in lower latitudes, particularly maize and wheat crops — but are typically only estimated for a limited number of crops in the long-term, 2050 and later.\nTo complement existing long-term forecasts, the researchers sought to identify crops and regions already at higher risk. The study carried out by researchers from the Institute of the Environment at the University of Minnesota, in collaboration with the University of Copenhagen, established so-called linear regression relationships between weather and crop yield data to assess the potential impacts of climate change on crop productivity.\nThe relationship between weather and crop yields is significant, around 54–88 per cent. As the authors write, “climate change has potentially already affected global production of the ten largest crops and the production of consumable food calories in specific countries and globally”.\nIn particular, the researchers found the impact of global climate change on yields of different crops from climate trends ranged from a decrease of 13.4 per cent for oil palm to an increase of 3.5 per cent for soybean. Overall, they estimate an average reduction of around one per cent (-3.5 x10e13 kcal/year) of consumable food calories for the top ten crops.\nThe impacts were mostly negative in Europe, Southern Africa, and Australia but positive in Latin America. Moreover, half of the food-insecure countries are currently experiencing decreases in crop yields. In contrast, global warming increased crop productivity in some regions, for example, the upper Midwest of the US.\nThe findings are important since they identify which geographical regions and crops are most at risk from climate change right now. Furthermore, it seems those in already food-insecure countries fare far worse. The authors suggest further studies are still needed to fully understand the implications of mean climate change on food security at the local scale.\nNonetheless, the results will be useful for policymakers and others working towards strategies aimed at helping to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals of ending hunger and mitigating the effects of climate change.\nThe global population is expected to reach at least 9 billion by 2050. Models previously developed by the Institute on the Environment’s Global Landscapes Initiative have provided crucial for the UN, World Bank, and Brookings for evaluating global food security and environmental challenges associated with feeding the growing population. And the recent findings are no exception.\n(1) Ray, D.K. et al. Climate change has likely already affected global food production. PLoS One (2019). DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0217148', 'Green Technology Can Foster a New Era in the Agricultural SectorJune 3, 2022\nDue to climate change and growing food demand, modern agriculture inevitably moves towards sustainability via green technologies implementation. Sustainable development implies, among other things, the efficient use of natural resources and energy. The conditions of food production are increasingly attracting the attention of consumers. And we are talking not only about the introduction of new technologies in the production process, improving the quality of raw materials and products, but also about reducing the negative impact on nature. In particular, selection in crop production, improvement of mineral fertilizers, development of new green technologies to improve soil fertility, biologization of intensive agriculture, switching to alternative energy sources, the use of geospatial data, and more can become key tools for the sustainable development of the agricultural sector and help producers compete in the international arena. In this article, we will focus specifically on two of the biggest pillars of green tech implementation in agriculture — satellite imagery analytics and alternative energy use.\nSatellites Improving Agricultural Sustainability\nThe use of geospatial technology, satellite imagery analytics in particular, for monitoring agricultural land was considered a promising direction decades ago. Back then, to get one image of the Landsat satellite, it was necessary to analyze the data contained on four magnetic tapes. Three months could have gone only for pre-processing, after which one could finally see a satellite photograph.\nToday, thanks to geospatial solutions development, you can get an image ready for analysis within 24 hours after shooting. More so, the market is overflowing with digital solutions for fast, effective and all-in-one farm management tools like one by https://eos.com/. With the help of such instruments, farmers can benefit from the following environmental and operational advantages:\n- Smart, data-driven decision-making to detect problem areas timely and prevent yield losses\n- Timely reaction to weather related threats thanks to forecast, historical and current weather data\n- Smart crop rotation planning based on reliable field productivity data\n- Selection of the most productive seed varieties\n- Resources preservation and costs saving thanks to the ability of implementing VRA approach based on each field zone’s needs\nGeospatial data is imperative to the enhancement of farm management. Accurate crop mapping, crop health tracking, moisture level change detection, and smart field activities planning are only some of the opportunities satellite imagery analysis provides to agriculture. Combined with weather information and field equipment data, growers get to manage their farm in the most efficient way while increasing yields, preserving resources, and being sustainable.\nFarm Equipment Running on Alternative Energy\nInnovative alternative energy sources are no longer projects for the long term, they are already actively entering the life of various sectors of the economy and compete with diesel and gasoline. This is especially true for agriculture, where diesel fuel is the base for almost all self-propelled models of tractors, combines, sprayers and trucks. Farmers and agrarians understand the value of saving resources and optimizing costs. That is why more and more world-famous brands have recently announced their new products based on new types of fuel that can significantly reduce the costs of agricultural producers, while reducing the environmental impact.\nCompressed or liquefied natural gas, methane, has become the most popular alternative fuel, which has received the greatest distribution and practical application in agriculture. The main advantage of this type of fuel is a high level of efficiency, since the price of gas is almost three times lower than that of oil fuel. The technology also minimizes environmental damage and atmospheric pollution with harmful toxic elements.\nThe second most popular, not even a type of fuel, but an innovative source of energy in the market of agricultural machinery and machinery is electricity. For example, technologies for the use of solar energy for the agro-industrial complex solve a wide range of tasks in the field of farm activity. Can be implemented in any of its branches. The presence of free territories and a significant area of roofs and walls of houses and outbuildings makes it possible to receive and accumulate large amounts of free electricity.\nInstallation of photovoltaic systems is carried out for the production of electricity, which can be used to operate pumps, electric knives and other equipment, as well as to provide electricity to residential buildings. Air collectors are used for heating and ventilation of premises, creating a comfortable living environment for people, farm animals and maintaining temperature and humidity at a necessary level. Hotbeds and greenhouses equipped with solar panels not only retain heat and accumulate it, but also provide the necessary microclimate for plants.\nThe use of green technology enables making any process faster, more convenient and of higher quality. Thanks to the use of various innovative platforms in agriculture, there is not only an increase in the quantity of products, but also an improvement in its quality.']	['<urn:uuid:0b1f4c38-124e-421c-9b80-5a1ad462b1f3>', '<urn:uuid:73ddaa37-33c0-4b7f-80e3-1172c3f4aa8a>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	11	69	1334
91	dollar amount funding doe research climate biogeographic shifts appalachian trail	The Department of Energy's National Institute of Climatic Change Research provided $125,000 for research on climate-induced biogeographic shifts along the Appalachian Trail.	"['Director of Landscape Ecology at Penn State (LEAPS)\nI work at the interface of landscape and ecosystem ecology, focusing on the influence of spatial patterns on ecosystem function. I am specifically interesting in the role of fire patterns (e.g., “pyrogeography”) on soil biogeochemistry and carbon storage. Fire reflects trends in both land use and ecosystem dynamics, thus requiring interdisciplinary scientific approaches. Fire also drives carbon flux dynamics between the biosphere and the atmosphere, thus requiring understanding of coupled climate-vegetation changes at multiple scales. In the face of increasing concern about fire in human-dominated landscapes, the understanding of the causes and ecological consequences of fire is critical to local and landscape level management. As such, my research is relevant to landscape-level conservation management as well as global change biology.\nTheoretically, I am interested in how scale and spatial patterns of disturbance processes can be better modeled – so that forecasts of climate change can better incorporate dominant fire dynamics. Current models in my laboratory include Century, MC1, and Fire-BGC. However, I also integrate both laboratory and experimental studies on soil and ecosystem biogeochemistry, and am increasingly interested in spatial statistics (geostatistics), network theory, and Bayesian approaches for understanding and scaling ecosystem complexity.\nI primarily work in three geographic locations: Africa (Ghana and South Africa), The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (Wyoming – USA), and the Northeast. A majority of my research occurs in natural reserves or parks (Yellowstone, Appalachian Trail, Eastern Cape Parks Board - South Africa), which can serve as benchmarks for ecosystem function and coupled human-nature interactions.\nCurrent research interests and activities\nConsequences of Novel Disturbance Regimes on Climate-Induced Biogeographic Shifts along the Appalachian Trail\nDepartment of Energy, National Institute of Climatic Change Research, $ 125,000\nNorthward biogeographical shifts are expected in the Eastern US with more southerly species (e.g., oak, hickory, pine) replacing northern hardwoods (e.g., maple, beech, birch). The AT MEGA-Transect, an ecological monitoring program along this vector, provides an exceptional opportunity to test scientific hypotheses of disturbance-vegetation-climate interactions between southeast and northeast regions. Fire is an extensive disturbance agent in the southeastern US but has a disputed historical role in the northeast. In this project, we hypothesize that under future climate, fire risk may be enhanced, resulting in positive feedbacks and sustaining northward migration of fire-prone vegetation. Alternatively, in the absence of these fire-climate conditions, niche-based projections of northerly migration of fire-prone habitat may be overestimated. This research will clarify how climate-induced shifts in species may interact with or produce novel disturbance regimes. To explore this, we are developing a multi-scaled modeling approach that links a biogeographical model (MC1) with a species-specific model of potential suitable habitat called DISTRIB (Iverson et al., 2008). Model simulations will test fire-climate-vegetation feedbacks, allowing the dynamically generated fires of MC1 to influence the species composition predictions of DISTRIB and the species composition predictions of DISTRIB to influence the fuel load in MC1. Models will be driven with new downscaled 4 km2 resolution climate datasets (historical PRISM baseline, 3 GCMs, 3 emission scenarios) to test fine-scale fire-climate-vegetation interactions along the AT.\nDominique Bachelet - Oregon State University\nLouis Iverson - USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station\nAnantha Prasad - USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station\nClimate, Fire and Carbon: Tipping Points and Landscape Vulnerability in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem\nUSDI / Joint Fire Science Program, $140,653\nCurrent model projections suggest that, by the end of the 21st C, climate conditions like those of 1988 (the year of the well-known Yellowstone Fires) will represent close to the average year rather than an extreme year. The consequences of a climate shift of this magnitude for the fire regime, post-fire succession and carbon (C) balance of western forest ecosystems are well beyond what scientists have explored to date, and may fundamentally change the potential of western forests to sequester atmospheric C. In this project, we hypothesize that vegetation communities will contribute differentially to future landscape C flux because of different sensitivities to future climate and fire combinations, and the net result could qualitatively change the C dynamics of western forests. To explore this idea, we are focusing on the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) to address three overarching questions that are broadly relevant for many Rocky Mountain forests: (1) How great a change in climate and fire regime would be required to shift each of the dominant vegetation communities in the GYE from a net C sink to a net C source? (2) Do current projections indicate that changes of this magnitude are likely to occur in the next century, and if so, where in the GYE do they occur? (3) What are the integrated effects of changing climate, vegetation, and fire on spatial patterns of carbon flux across the GYE landscape as a whole? To answer these questions, we are using observed relationships between climate and fire occurrence and downscaled climate data from general circulation models (GCMs) to determine future climate and fire regimes and develop spatially explicit maps of landscape C flux based on individual contributions of vegetation types to future climate and fire – determined from the CENTURY ecosystem model.\nMonica G. Turner - University of Wisconsin, Madison\nAnthony Westerling - Sierra Nevada Research Institute and UC-Merced\nWilliam H. Romme - Colorado State University\nMichael G. Ryan - USDA Forest Service RMRS\nCollaborative Research: Climatic Extremes, Mining, and Mycobacterium ulcerans: A Coupled Systems Approach\nNSF-Coupled Natural Human Systems, $1,421,997\nIn this project, we are working in Ghana to explore the emergence of Buruli ulcer (BU) at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Our project considers BU emergence as a function of climatic changes that interact with human-modified landscapes, resulting in increases in flooding and stagnant water. We expect that human knowledge and behavior, which differ by occupation, age, location, and the degree of marginality people occupy in society, govern the resultant exposure to stagnant water bodies that may house the bacterium causing BU. We believe that the transmission of BU is due to previously unidentified thresholds in these coupled human-natural patterns that interact across spatial and temporal scales. We aim to make concrete recommendations about the conditions under which landscape rehabilitation would enhance human-ecosystem health and resilience. In addition, a key element of our project is the development of a sister-school approach, linking elementary, intermediate, and high schools from Penns Valley Area School District with partner schools in Tarkwa, Asankragwa, Deaso, and Dunkwa. Through collaborative activities, the students and teachers aim to understand human-modified landscapes and disease patterns in Pennsylvania and in Africa.\nPetra Tschakert (PI) Penn State University, USA\nJoseph Oppong - University of North Texas, USA\nRichard Amankwah - University of Mines and Technology, Ghana\nEdith Parker - University of Iowa, USA\nSimon Gawu, KNUST, Ghana\nKamini Singha - Penn State University, USA\nHeidi Hausermann - Penn State University, USA\nErasmus Klutse - Ghana Health Directorate, Ghana\nRay Voegborlo - KNUST, Ghana\nFrank Nyame - University of Ghana, Ghana\nAnnmarie Ward- Penn State University, USA\nGK-12: Carbon Education and Research Together for Humanity (Carbon EARTH)\nCarbonEARTH uses the interdisciplinary theme of carbon, broadly construed, as a unifying platform for investigation, discovery, training and education. Carbon is a ubiquitous element in our world, featured highly in a broad spectrum of basic and applied research areas, including materials science, energy science, geosciences, and life sciences. Many challenges facing society today involve carbon, including global warming, waste disposal, renewable energy, and nanoelectronics and these issues are frequently addressed in the media, with varying degrees of scientific accuracy. The majority of K-12 student achievement standards for science relate to these issues. CarbonEARTH will provide teachers and students from a wide range of disciplines with science learning experiences that not only teach the concepts, but also develop the skills with scientific inquiry for approaching these problems scientifically. Specifically, CarbonEARTH teams STEM graduate students with upper elementary and middle school science teachers from rural and urban school districts to teach PA standards-based science topics related to the themes of Energy, Matter & Materials, Earth Processes, and Ecosystems, focusing on inquiry-based teaching strategies. Recent government reports describe the severity of our nation’s need to increase the STEM pipeline and the multitude of underlying problems, such as lack of interest and retention in STEM by women, minorities, and low socioeconomic populations. CarbonEARTH aims to increase representation of women, minorities, and low-socioeconomic populations by promoting STEM education and careers of underrepresented groups at all levels; enhancing graduate students’ research and other non-research skills needed for successful careers, working with upper elementary and middle school teachers and students to promote deeper understanding of STEM concepts and skills in scientific inquiry, and providing experiences for upper elementary and middle school students that reflect the excitement and importance of STEM careers through interactions with graduate student role models.\nPI and Co-PI(s)\nRenee Diehl - Physics (PI)\nAngela Lueking - Energy and Mineral Engineering\nErica Smithwick - Geography\nElizabeth Boyer - Forest Hydrology\nAnnmarie Ward - Education (CoPIs)\nFaculty and Departments: Rachel Brennan (Environmental Engineering); Nicole Brown (Wood Chem); Craig Cameron (Biochem and Molecular Bio); Kristen Fichthorn (Chem Engineering); Katherine Freeman (Geosciences); Heather Karsten (Crop Production and Ecology); Margot Kaye, (Forest Ecology); Jennifer Macalady (Geosciences); Erin Sheets (Chem); Jorge Sofo (Physics); Jun Zhu (Physics)\nSpatial patterns of nutrient limitation and carbon storage in South African coastal lowland landscapes\nNational Science Foundation: EAGER, $150,000\nGeorge H. Deike, Jr. Research Grant, College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, $50,000\nGeographically, Africa is one of the weakest links in the understanding of land-atmosphere carbon exchange. The objectives of this research are to (1) employ a novel experimental design to determine how variation in nutrient availability determines spatial patterns in grassland carbon productivity and (2) provide the first-ever quantification of carbon storage in coastal and dune forests within two priority nature reserves in the southeastern coast of South Africa. Contrasting fire and vegetation patterns within each reserve will allow for the development of new pyrogeographic perspectives on African carbon storage at landscape scales. By studying carbon storage in priority conservation areas in coastal South Africa, this research will establish a deeper understanding of the role of African landscapes in conservation management and global ecosystem science.\nA current lack of understanding of complex interactions among fire, climate, and nutrient cycling hinders broad-scale modeling of ecosystem response to climate change. This issue is particularly acute for Africa, which represents the largest source of fire-derived carbon emissions and for which carbon storage estimates are scarce. Direct measurement of carbon storage in new locations and identification of its limiting factors across multiple scales, as explored in this project, is critical for the development of future diagnostic modeling efforts. Understanding how fire and soil nutrients govern these patterns will contribute to landscape and conservation management in the region and globally.\nThis research is run in parallel with an education abroad program at Penn State, Parks and People, focused on interdisciplinary training of undergraduate students in collaborative international science.

92	arabica vs robusta coffee differences	Arabica coffee contains less caffeine but more fat and sugar making it tastier, while Robusta has almost double the caffeine content giving it a bitter, burnt taste. Arabica provides over 75% of world's coffee and is easier to grow.	['Glasgow’s Magic Beans\nIt can be hard not to take coffee for granted these days. Most of us drink a mug first thing in the morning and continue throughout the day. At this time of year, as winter recedes and exams approach, many of us are rarely seen without one. Whether we drink it for taste, for warmth or for concentration, we rely on the stuff!\nYour breakfast mug of Nescafé began life as the seeds of a coffea plant. These plants grow best in competitive, elevated tropical regions, and over time have evolved a highly specific mechanism of self-preservation. Young and vulnerable coffee seeds produce massive amounts of the endogenous neurotoxin caffeine in order to paralyse and kill insects that are looking for a quick buzz.\nThe two most important varieties of coffea seeds are coffea arabica (arabica coffees) and coffea caniphora robusta (robusta coffees). Arabica beans provide over three quarters of the world’s coffee. Arabica plants are significantly easier to grow and though they contain less caffeine than the Robusta variety, Arabica beans contain more fat and more sugar, which makes them tastier. Robusta, on the other hand has almost double the caffeine content, which gives it a very bitter, burnt taste. At the base of every coffee are about 50 beans, roasted and ground 1.\nThe fate of the coffea plant’s would-be predators may suggest that caffeine has the potential to harm, but fortunately for us, it would take roughly 70 cups of coffee to have similar effects on humans. 2 Caffeine is part of a chemical group called xanthines. Xanthines are produced naturally in the body, and have the ability to change the way in which some of the proteins in our bodies work, depending on their concentration. The main effect of xanthines is to block adenosine receptors. Adenosine is a protein found throughout the body which is responsible for some of the ‘downstream’ effects of the “fight or flight” hormone adrenaline. In the heart, adenosine can bind to receptors to slow your heart rate. In the brain, adenosine binding to other receptors can reduce the release of important neurotransmitters, reducing brain activity and slowing us down. On the other hand, when xanthines such as caffeine block adenosine receptors in these cell types, the opposite effect is observed, e.g. increasing heart rate and flooding the brain with the exciting and rewarding neurotransmitters glutamate and dopamine.\nHowever, despite the beneficial few hours of heightened concentration, consumption of “the devil’s brew” has been extensively linked to almost every major disease known to man. Furthermore, large doses of caffeine can be fatal, causing cardiac arrest. At the same time there are claims that caffeine will reduce your risk of diabetes, stroke, dementia and cancer. Both sides of this heated argument have been considered extensively by policy makers around the world, most of whom have reached the conclusion that caffeine in moderation is okay and probably even helps protect against diabetes and some cancers. Moderation is defined as a maximum of 200 mg of caffeine in one sitting, and no more than 400 mg daily.\nBack in 2011, the US company Dunkin’ Donuts performed a survey to assess which professions were most dependent on coffee 4, published in the Food and Function journal, compared the content and concentrations of caffeine and CQAs (a polyphenol also found in coffee) between a variety of coffee types and coffee shops in the West End of Glasgow, Italy and Spain. Espressos served in Spain contained the most caffeine, and those poured in Scotland contained the least. (A comparison of concentrations and content of Glaswegian coffee shops is shown in the picture below.)\nThe researchers also compared the effects of both roasting the beans differently and using different barista techniques on the caffeine and CQA concentrations. Finally, they compared different types of commercially available instant coffee. Plain old Nescafé Classic contains more caffeine than more exotic alternatives such as Alta Rica or Gold Blend. This may be due to an increased Arabica to Robusta ratio in the more expensive, tastier coffees.\nThe take-home message from the study is that the caffeine concentrations and content of coffees vary hugely between countries, coffee houses and even baristas. These variations mean that it would be remarkably easy for those who frequent coffee shops to unwittingly consume more caffeine than their recommended daily allowance. Whilst we may rely on it, we need to be wary of our caffeine intake, and remember that caffeine can be found in other products besides coffee (for example, in teas, energy drinks and chocolate). However, as exams loom, there is a more practical message to be taken from this study: the next time you need that concentration boost, the West End’s best buzz-for-buck is to be found in the University Café on Byres Road!\nThis article was specialist edited by Debbie Nicol and copy edited by Manda Rasa Tamosauskaite.\n- Bond, TJ.

Many of our readers will be unsurprised to find that scientists and lab workers were the number one coffee consumers. Most scientific researchers can relax in ignorance of recommended caffeine limits, but please spare a thought for the Human Nutrition department at the University of Glasgow, who must be acutely aware of how much caffeine they should be consuming. The group performed a study in 2014 to assess the caffeine content of drinks from a variety of Glaswegian coffee shops. It wouldn’t be hard to imagine that this study was inspired by concerns about their personal caffeine intakes.\nThe study 3Ludwig, I. A., Mena, P., Calani, L., Cid, C., Rio, D. D., Lean, M.

93	best ways prevent nitrogen deficiency organic mulch garden soil without chemical fertilizers	When using organic mulch, there's a risk of temporary nitrogen deficiency as decomposing organisms consume nitrogen from the soil. To prevent this without chemical fertilizers, you can apply organic fertilizer with at least 2% nitrogen content, such as manure or fish meal. Additionally, maintaining proper soil conditions for mycorrhizal fungi is crucial, as these fungi help break down existing nitrogen in the soil and transport it to plant roots in exchange for sugars from the plants. The fungi work best in dark, moist conditions under mulch. Over time, as decomposers die off, nitrogen availability to plants naturally increases. Furthermore, chopping and dropping plant matter directly onto the mulch layer allows it to decay and return nutrients to the soil, creating a self-sustaining system.	['Springtime gardens turn into summertime weed lots. Does this happen to you? You till and dig, bring in dirt or compost, broadcast fertilizer, and perhaps even lime or calcium in an attempt to make soil for the perfect bed for your garden. It’s a sight to behold! You plant your seeds and your delicate little plants with great care, watering and watching over them.\nYour little plants grow quickly and beautifully for a time, then they are chased by the dreaded weeds. Weeds, weeds everywhere, growing like grass on a golf course, thick and full, tall, and happy. By late June, if you’re like I used to be, you’ve all but given up even trying to keep them at bay. Once the real heat of summer hits, you surrender and end up harvesting whatever vegetables have fought their way through the jungle of weeds.\nWhy does it always happen the same way every year? Yes, those who love to work at pulling and hoeing weeds might keep their gardens in the green, but the rest of us give up after we’ve sweated through our first pair of gardening gloves.\nThe answer is that you haven’t cast the right SPELL on your garden before you ever planted it. It’s a magic spell—a witches’ spell, if you like—that protects your garden from weeds, makes fertilizing completely unnecessary, and banishes many a bad nematode or blight from your shiny summer squashes.\nWould you like to know the secret to a weed-free garden?\nHere is the spell that will solve all your gardening woes this year:\n“Dirt plus Darkness and Moisture, too… We will make SOIL out of you!”\nWhy do I say that this is a “witches’ spell”? Because the secret to the weed-free garden is a fungus amongus. It’s not a toadstool or a mushroom, but it’s a fungus none-the-less. What has been lost to modern gardeners who use chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides in order to fight all the ills of the garden, and even to many organic gardeners, is that simple fungi can do all the hard work for you.\nLet’s talk DIRT!\nDirt is just rocks. It’s minerals (which are rock) that have been ground up to a small size. The largest particles of dirt are called sand. The next smaller size is called loam. The smallest-sized dirt is clay. All dirt is some combination of different sized rock particles: sand, loam, and clay. But dirt is NOT the same as soil.\nThe only plants dirt grows are weeds. You need SOIL to grow vegetables, fruits, bushes, and trees. What’s the difference between dirt and soil? Organic matter. Often, gardeners bring organic matter into their gardens by introducing compost, peat, or even humus. While these elements add some life (and water-holding capacity) to dirt, they don’t make true soil. To make true soil— magic soil that will make your garden sing under the midnight moon—you need FUNGI.\nLet’s go back to the spell that makes soil… “Dirt plus Darkness and Moisture too…” The best soil is made in darkness.\nYou can turn a straight-up suburban lawn into good garden soil over just a few short months with nothing more than newspapers and mulch. Soil is made from aerobic bacteria and fungi called mycorrhizae. This happens in darkness and moisture. If you cover the ground with something that blocks out the light but allows water to pass through, such as newspaper, cardboard, or contractor’s paper, then you will block the light to your dirt while still allowing water to reach it. This is step number one. This step will kill the grass and smother the weeds.\nStep #2 is to keep the ground moist and cool. You do this by adding mulch on top of the paper; about 6 inches will do just fine and any mulch will do. You can use hay, straw, or wood chips. Try to get your wood chips from a tree service company, not from bags at Walmart or Home Depot. It’s best to have real wood chips and not the junk that they sell in bags. But if you must use the bags, it’s better than nothing.\nQuick Note: If you want a raised row garden then make your raised rows before you apply the newspaper (or cover) and the mulch. Rest assured, the spell works with raised rows or with just flat land.\nUnder this dark, moist, cool layer, magic will happen. Aerobic bacteria will grow; fungi will grow; worms and bugs will arrive. Ground that was once hard, dry, dead dirt will transform itself into good, fertile, fluffy soil ready for planting. Just give it a few months.\nStep #3: Don’t Disturb It! After a few months of letting nature do its work, you can plant directly into this soil. It will be lighter, softer, more aerated. It will be alive. If you till it, turn it, or disturb it any more than is absolutely necessary, you will kill it. Fungi grow in thin webs that create a nutrient-carrying structure. They trade nitrogen with plant roots in exchange for sugar that the plant makes. Don’t disturb the soil any more than you absolutely need in order to plant your little seed or seedling. Don’t break the web of life created by the fungi.\nStep #4 is to keep adding mulch as the plants grow. Keep adding straw, torn-up newspapers, shredded wood, or whatever you can. Build up the layer of compost as the plants grow. This will keep the weeds out. This will make the nitrogen in the soil conducive to vegetable and fruit plants and poisonous to weeds. Without going into detail there are different types of nitrogen. The type of nitrogen created by fungi, darkness, and moisture is good for soil but bad for weeds. Keep your soil dark, cool, and moist for a weed-free garden.\nWhy the Witches’ Spell Works for Making Soil\nThe problem with how people are taught to garden is that it destroys beneficial fungi (mycorrhizae) which are thin spiderweb-like strands of life that live in dark, moist soil. The fungi break down nitrogen that already exists in the soil and they transport that nitrogen to the roots of plants to trade it for sugars that plants make through photosynthesis.\nIn modern gardening, people are taught to hoe, rake, heap, and pile raw dirt. That process kills the fungi required for proper nutrition to good plants. That process literally MAKES proper nutrition for BAD plants, i.e. weeds! Dirt does not grow vegetables, fruits, and trees. Dirt is just ground up rocks. Soil grows the vegetables we like. Soil is the enemy of weeds. Soil exists on forest floors beneath inches of decaying matter. Soil exists in moist, cool places. Soil exists because dark, cool, moist dirt grows the bacteria and fungi required to turn sterile dirt into rich, healthy soil.\nPlease allow me to repeat one last time for emphasis. If you hoe, you will kill the fungi. If you rake, you will kill the fungi. If you cultivate, you will kill the fungi. If you turn the soil, you will kill the fungi.\nIf, instead, you trust nature and follow the Witches’ Spell for a perfect weed-free garden then your great gardeners’ fortune will arrive on the midnight moonbeams and the morning dew. That fortune is the spreading of fine, filaments of fungi all through the soil under your deep layers of mulch and newspaper.\nTry it! Remember. “Dirt plus darkness and moisture too… We will make SOIL out of you!”\nFinal Benefit of Making Soil for a Weed-Free Garden\nAs you are done with your garden plants just chop and drop the plant matter from your plants right on top of your thick mulch layer. It will decay and descend into the soil. There is no reason to ever take anything out of your garden again. Just chop and drop the plants when they are done. There is no need to ever bring anything into your garden again. The mulch will turn to compost. The compost will turn to food for next year’s garden. The fungi will make sure of it.\nIf you just keep your garden dark and moist then it will make more and more rich soil for the following year. The true secret to growing a weed-free garden and the perfect garden plants is to focus on making the perfect garden soil. Once you do that the rest is easy year after year after year. Guaranteed!', 'This week, Master Gardener, Fred Hoffman teaches us about different varieties of mulch that you can use in your garden. There are several types of mulch that you can use to protect your plants and keep your garden growing.\nALL ABOUT MULCH\nWhat is mulch?\nMulch is any material placed on the soil to cover and protect it. Organic mulches come from plants. They include wood chips, sawdust, leaves, clippings, and bark chips or nuggets. Inorganic mulches include materials such as sand, gravel and pebbles and are generally more expensive and less widely used. See Pests of Landscape Trees and Shrubs for a complete list of organic and inorganic mulches.\n• creates topsoil\n• feeds beneficial microbes such as mycorrhizae\n• conserves water\n• weed control\n• cools the soil in summer and warms the soil in winter\n• protects plants roots\n• builds healthier lawns and gardens\n• may help de-toxify pesticides\nAdding a four inch layer of mulch now beneath shrubs and trees, out to the drip line, can help stop weeds, keeps the ground more moist and feeds the plant as well. But which mulch is best?\nPros and Cons:\nBark lasts a long time, looks nice, feeds the soil, suppresses weeds.\nBeware of finely shredded redwood bark: the hairs can easily ignite if someone tosses in a cigarette butt.\nCocoa shells look nice, last a long time, but may be toxic to dogs.\nChipped/Shredded tree trimmings: inexpensive, feeds the soil, suppresses weeds, but needs to be replaced yearly.\nPine needles: best spread at least three inches deep around acid loving plants.\nCompost: Inexpensive, provides soil nutrients and improves soil structure. But weed seeds can germinate in it.\nGrass Clippings: inexpensive, but should be applied when thoroughly dried. Also, clippings from weed-like grasses, such as bermuda grass, may get established in other areas.\nWeed Cloth: inorganic, suppresses weeds while allowing air and water to pass through. Needs a layer of bark on top to keep it from disintegrating from sunlight. May keep soil too moist.\nNewspapers: inexpensive, must be replaced often, needs to be secured in place.\nPlastic: suppresses weeds, but does not allow air or water to pass through. In the summer, it may raise soil temperatures too high. Hold in place with bark.\nRock: Looks good, provides no nutrients, may raise soil temperatures too high for the plant.\nProper Use of Mulch\nIn order for mulch to be effective it must be applied correctly. One of the two most common mistakes people make is applying mulch too deeply or too thinly. A two to four inch layer of mulch keeps down most weeds and retains moisture in the soil. Applying mulch too thinly may not help prevent the suppression of annual weeds.\nIt is prudent to be cautious of using very thick layers of fine mulch. Too much mulch can reduce the oxygen levels in the soil, which is already a problem in heavy, wet soils. Save the finer, smaller material for use around flowers and vegetables. Excess mulch, particularly if applied right against the stem or trunk of landscape plants leads to constantly wet bark and conditions favorable for root and crown rot diseases. A mulch that is too thick may severely reduce or eliminate drying and lead to water-logged soil, particularly during wet seasons or in heavy clay soil.\nDrawbacks to Organic Mulch\nThere is risk of potential short term nitrogen deficiencies when using green or non-decomposed mulch. Both garden plants and soil microorganisms need carbon and nitrogen to grow. The decomposers (fungi and bacteria) feed on the nitrogen in the organic mulch material. This robs the soil of nitrogen so that the nitrogen in the soil available to plants is reduced. The result is poor plant growth and pale green leaves. Applying organic fertilizer with at least two percent nitrogen such as manure or fish meal should remedy this short time nitrogen depletion. As the decomposers die off nitrogen availability to plants increases.\nOrganic mulches gradually decompose. Mulch must be periodically added to maintain a sufficiently deep layer to provide good weed control. Furthermore, mulches rarely provide 100 per cent weed control. It may be desirable to apply a pre-emergent herbicide to the soil surface prior to applying the mulch. Supplemental hand-weeding or herbicide applications might also be needed.\nSome bark, wood, and foliage contain naturally occurring toxic compounds (allelochemicals) that may damage young plants. Before applying uncomposted mulch around young plants leach the organic mulch with a heavy irrigation. Do not allow the leachate to run off or drain into surface water or storm sewers.\nThe benefits of mulching outweigh the drawbacks. If you want to keep the weeds down, conserve moisture, use less pesticides, have healthier plants, save money, recycle…MULCH!']	['<urn:uuid:d1f3774c-cdd5-4416-8b3b-247c45283c72>', '<urn:uuid:bdce89ed-50cc-4035-9243-da874234d0ec>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	12	123	2205

These are succeeded by the Labang and Kuamut Formations (Kinabatangan Group) which are deep water turbidites deposited between the Late Eocene to Early Miocene. The Labang Formation shows evidence of several deformation events. There are abundant syn-depositional and syn-diagenetic extensional faults, but also evidence of several phases of folding. The Kuamut Formation includes deep-water sedimentary rocks which are chaotically deformed mud-rich blocky melanges and mudstone-dominated brittle faulted rocks. The two formations are interpreted to include subduction-related tectonic melanges, olistostromes and mud-rich diapirs representing different structural positions in an accretionary wedge. Much of the deformation of the Labang and Kuamut Formations is interpreted to have occurred in a forearc region.\nThere is an important unconformity between the Labang/Kuamut Formations and younger rocks which represents a period of deformation, major uplift and erosion, followed by subsidence and sedimentation of the Serudong Group. The deformation event corresponds to the Sabah Orogeny of Hutchison (1996) and is Early Miocene (NN2-NN3). The unconformity is well dated by nannofossils and foraminifera and is older than previously suggested; it is interpreted to correlate with the deep regional unconformity (DRU) of offshore NW Sabah.\nThe Serudong Group includes local Burdigalian marine carbonates, and the Tanjong, Kalabakan, Kapilit and Simengaris Formations which were deposited in a large fluvio-deltaic system prograding towards the ENE. The Tanjong and Kalabakan Formations were deposited in the Late Early to Middle Miocene and are succeeded by the Middle to Upper Miocene Kapilit Formation. The Tanjong and Kapilit Formations each contain two upwardly coarsening megasequences, which comprise a lower mudstone and siltstone dominated sequence (Unit I), overlain by a sandstone and mudstone dominated sequence with some coal beds (Unit II). The Kalabakan Formation is dominated by shallow marine to shelf mudstones and is the distal equivalent of the Tanjong Formation. The Kapilit Formation was deposited above the Tanjong Formation after a major transgressive event; an important deeply incised erosional surface marks the boundary between them. This is correlated with the Intermediate Regional Unconformity (IRU) of offshore Sabah. The Simengaris Formation is unconformable upon the older formations and was deposited during the latest Miocene to early Pliocene, and this unconformity is correlated with the Shallow Regional Unconformity (SRU) of offshore Sabah.\nSyndepositional structures in the Miocene sediments indicate subsidence and regional extension in a NW-SE direction. The Tanjong and Kapilit Formations are deformed by broad NW-SE-trending synclines separated by narrow anticlines. The anticlines are sub-parallel to major faults and associated with high angle reverse faults, and positive flower structures. Secondary fold-faults formed oblique to the major faults. The structural style suggests that the NW-SE trending faults acted as major left-lateral transpressional zones. The faults may in part be reactivated basement structures.\nThe Early Miocene unconformity is interpreted to be the result of deformation and uplift following underthrusting of continental crust of the South China Sea which terminated Paleogene subduction beneath North Borneo. Renewed subsidence is related here to rifting in the Sulu Sea which led to the development of a major Miocene depocentre above the older forearc accretionary complex. The major transpressional deformation. probably occurred during the Late Pliocene, and is possibly related to propagation of deformation from Sulawesi towards NW Sabah. This strike-slip deformation which uplifted the area is termed here the Meliau Orogeny. Renewed extension during the Quaternary has caused some sequence repetition. The ‘circular basins’ of the Meliau, Malibau and Tidung areas, are interpreted as remnants of a single large basin, deformed in the NW-SE trending transpressional fault zones.']	['<urn:uuid:efbe6582-b506-494c-842e-83c51f7e59a1>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	9	30	686
95	compare type 1 slow twitch muscle fibers vs type 2 fast twitch effects on cycling and stamina training	Type I (slow twitch) and Type II (fast twitch) muscle fibers have distinct roles in cycling and stamina performance. Type I fibers, recruited more when cycling at higher cadences around 90 RPM, utilize aerobic energy and enable longer exercise periods with less fatigue. Type II fibers, activated more when pushing heavy gears at lower cadences (60-80 RPM), are larger and more powerful but rely on anaerobic energy, making them better for short bursts of speed. Through endurance training, Type II fibers can be converted into more fatigue-resistant forms, with highly-fatigable Type IIX fibers becoming Type IIA, and some Type IIA potentially converting to the more fatigue-resistant Type I fibers. This adaptation improves overall stamina and enables better performance in prolonged exercise.	"['BIKE TECHNIQUE 101: HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR BIKE TIME USING CADENCE\nWhat is CADENCE? Cadence in cycling refers to the number of revolutions of the crank per minute (RPM). Roughly speaking, this is the speed at which a cyclist is pedaling/turning the pedals. Most bicycle computers are able to measure cadence. The sensor is usually at the end of the crank, and the reading is relayed to the cyclist via an LCD display, typically mounted on the bicycle\'s handlebars.\nCyclists typically have a preferred cadence at which they feel most comfortable. Recreational cyclists typically cycle around 60–80 RPM; racing cyclists around 80–120 RPM and sprinters up to 170 RPM for short bursts. The professional racing cyclist and Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong is known for his technique of keeping up high cadences of around 120 RPM for hours on end; a testimony to his efficiency.\nWhy should you be using a higher cadence? Cadence influences the number and range of gears that are appropriate for particular cycling conditions. The recommended cadence for a triathlete is between 90 and 105 RPM’s.\nWhy such a high turnover rate? Well, it has a lot to do with muscle fiber type and how those fiber types are recruited during exercise. When utilizing a cadence of 90 RPM\'s, you are recruiting more of your Type I muscle fibers or ""slow twitch"" fibers. These fibers utilize aerobic (oxygen) forms of energy, which allow you to run or cycle for long periods of time without fatiguing as quickly depending on your level of conditioning. When pushing the “big gear” with a lower cadence of lets say 60 to 80 RPM\'s, you are likely recruiting more of your Type II or ""fast twitch"" fibers, which are larger and more powerful. The downside is that these fibers utilize mostly anaerobic (little to no oxygen) forms of energy, which are great for short powerful bursts of speed. Think hard track workout (Type II) vs. endurance training for a marathon (Type I).\nYour body does use both fiber types during exercise, but at a higher RPM you will use a higher ratio of your Type I vs. Type II fibers because muscle fibers are recruited smallest (Type I) to largest (Type II) according to workload. Plus you don’t want to hurt your knees by overloading the joint with too much pressure.\nOne of the biggest reasons to utilize a cadence of 90-105 RPM\'s is that as a triathlete, you still have to run once you get off the bike. Running isn\'t going to be very easy or fun if your muscles are already extremely fatigued from pushing a heavier gear at a lower cadence. At the higher cadence, you will not be as fatigued, and your run will be much easier.\nHow can I improve my cadence? Using a higher cadence seems hard at first. Like a good golf swing, it takes time and practice to adapt your self to this style of riding.\nHere are some training tips for those seeking to improve their cadence: • Firstly, shoot for 2-3 sessions of cycling per week, 3 being the most ideal - it will help your body to adapt faster • Make sure you are warmed up at your current RPM for 5-10 minutes before beginning an interval at a higher RPM • Start at the lower end of the range, @ 90 RPM’s • During a 1-hour workout perform 5-10 minute intervals @ 90 RPM’s mixed in with 5 minute intervals at your normal RPM to help you adapt • Focus on using proper stroke technique, driving downward with your heel • Spinning at a higher rate initially is going to be taxing on your cardiovascular system - you will most likely need several sessions to adapt • You may want to utilize a HR monitor to track your cardiovascular progression - initially your HR will most likely increase, maybe even near maximum, but as you progress and become more conditioned it will drop to a more acceptable level • As your body adapts to 90 RPM, you should find it easier to do an even higher RPM like 95 or 100 if you choose to\nBy following these training tips, you should feel better after your bike ride. Switching from bike to run is difficult regardless, but your run should feel better to you.\nContributors: Brought to you by VBS TriTEAM members: Wayne Brown Cory Bultman Terence Reuben, PT, CPT, CSC Joe Manning', ""Stamina in endurance sports is the ability (both physically and mentally) to keep performing for a long period of time. All endurance sports require stamina, although some—such as Ironman distance triathlons, marathon running, and long endurance events—require more stamina than others. Developing peak physical condition results in endurance athletes having a high degree of stamina because their hearts, lungs, and muscles all function at a high level of efficiency.\nWKO4 Stamina Defined\nFor use in WKO4, the metric is defined as follows:\nStamina: a measure of resistance to fatigue during prolonged-duration, moderate-intensity (i.e., sub-FTP) exercise. Units are percent of maximum, i.e., 0-100%, although most individuals will fall in the 75 to 85 percent range.\nStamina represents time periods beyond 1 hour of performance, scoring your resistance to fatigue over such longer efforts. On the power duration curve, this is typically the “flat tail” of the extended curve beyond about one hour.\nThe Basis and Purpose of Stamina in WKO4\nStamina is a power-duration-derived metric that takes into account all points of an athlete’s power data to quantify resistance to fatigue during prolonged exercise. As a simple example, a stamina score of 100 percent would represent complete fatigue resistance, and the power duration curve beyond one hour(ish) would be completely flat, whereas a 50 percent stamina score would show significant decline of the tail. If fatigue is what causes you to slow down, then being more resistance to fatigue means that you won’t have to slow down as soon or as much.\nThe purpose of the metric is to track and analyze an athlete’s endurance fitness over time in an effort to understand:\n- Response to training stimuli in increasing performance in prolonged duration exercise\n- Effectiveness of training regime on increasing stamina\n- Athlete’s readiness to perform\nPhysiological Factors Behind Stamina\nWhile there are many factors that impact our stamina, the most important is our muscular metabolic fitness. Endurance training induces major adaptations in skeletal muscle. These include increases in the mitochondrial content and respiratory capacity of the muscle fibers. As a consequence of the increase in mitochondria, exercise of the same intensity produces less metabolic strain than in untrained muscles. Additionally, endurance training has consistently shown a fast-to-slow conversion in response to such training. That is, highly-fatigable fast-twitch type IIX fibers are converted into the more fatigue-resistant type IIA fibers, and some type IIA fibers may even be converted into the slower contracting, less powerful, but highly fatigue-resistant type slow twitch type I fibers. The major metabolic results of these adaptations are a slower utilization of muscle glycogen and blood glucose, a greater reliance on fat oxidation, and less lactate production during exercise of a given intensity. These adaptations therefore play an important role in the large increase of the ability to perform prolonged strenuous exercise that occurs in response to endurance exercise training.\nThe adaptations described above result in an increase in functional threshold power (FTP), which is the highest exercise intensity at which aerobic ATP production balances ATP demand, such that a steady-state (or quasi-steady-state) of physiological responses (e.g., blood lactate levels) can be maintained. If cardiovascular fitness, i.e., VO2Max, sets the upper limit for aerobic exercise, it is one’s muscular metabolic fitness, as reflected by FTP, that determines how much of that aerobic upper limit can be used. Thus, FTP and stamina are closely related, with the former describing the level at which the power-duration relationship tends to plateau and the latter describing the rate of decline once past that point in time. Even with the same FTP, however, there can be subtle differences between individuals in stamina, depending in part on genetically-influenced fiber type distribution, training specificity, habitual diet, etc.\nBuilding Stamina in the Endurance Athlete\nStamina is a metric that assigns a score to a specific adaptation to training stimuli (or lack thereof). As stamina increases, one could expect an improvement in longer, steady-state endurance events such as triathlons, endurance cycling, and even marathons. Understanding the basis of stamina as described in this article gives us insight into the types of training that can best increase it.\nPROGRESS TRAINING DURATION\nWhatever your present endurance conditioning, build it slowly but steadily to begin to increase your stamina. This increase in duration needs to occur at two levels: first, in total training duration, and second, in the length and pace of your longer rides.\nOverall duration increase is the simplest way to increase your base fitness and increase stamina (assuming it occurs in the appropriate training zones). The strategy of increasing total training duration at a steady 10 percent per week has been around for a long time for a reason: it is a smart way to build stamina. It’s important to note that just building time should not be the focus; building time at the appropriate effort is imperative to success. As duration increases the athlete should ensure the progression of time in Zone 2, Zone 3, and Sweet Spot to maximize aerobic conditioning and base.\nExtending individual ride duration is a highly effective way to not only increase overall duration but also specifically develop stamina by mimicking the stress of longer endurance events. This means extending at least one ride (two is better) a week to a longer duration based on your target events. To further improve stamina results, these rides should be completed in Zone 2 and Zone 3 efforts.\nFOCUS ON BUILDING FUNCTIONING THRESHOLD POWER\nPhysiologically, FTP is most related to stamina. The introduction of at least 3 to 5 workouts per training macrocycle (2 to 5 weeks) focused specifically on raising threshold performance will pay dividends in the development of stamina. These workouts should focus on training intensities in the Coggan iLevels’ Zone 4a, also known as Sweet Spot Training. This allows an athlete to push threshold up from below, increasing such threshold while still focusing on aerobic efforts.\nBUILD AEROBIC CAPACITY\nAs noted, increasing aerobic capacity is measured by VO2Max. Some training focus should be placed on workouts that maintain and build this capacity in the endurance athlete. With the new iLevels, athletes can maximize results by completing specific intervals in the Coggan iLevel Zones 5 and 6. These intervals should be completed when fresh so the athlete can get maximal effort and time in the training zones. Add 2 to 4 of these style of workouts per training cycling to best maximize results.\nStamina is an effective metric for tracking the increase (or decrease) in fatigue resistance to prolonged efforts. This puts another tool in the coaches' and athletes' hands to better track the effectiveness of training strategies and predict performance results.\nThis article was written by Tim Cusick with contributions from Dr. Andrew Coggan.

They can be cleaned simply with water, soap and a soft cloth. For quartz backsplash, the cost ranges between $600-$4,500 installed, averaging $70-$100 per square foot installed. Quartz is also stain resistant, doesn't require sealing, and cleans easily while protecting walls from moisture.	"['PHOTO ID #: 6173\nAre you planning to do some remodeling to your kitchen or bathroom and would like to get the best backsplash idea that will create enthusiasm for your project? Well, glass tile backsplash is one of the best ideas that you should consider. Glass tiles are unique in appearance and offer matchless results compared plastic and ceramic and therefore ideal when thinking of an aesthetic and stylish project. Glass tiles are not only aesthetic but also impermeable which makes them easy to clean and maintain. Taking into account that backsplash tiles normally accumulate a lot of soap scum and stains, you will love the ease with which you can clean the glass backsplash tiles leaving them sparkling clean.\nAdvantage of glass backsplash tiles\nWhen choosing any material for use in your home remodeling, considering its pros and cons is always important. This will help you understand how user friendly the materials could be as you use install and use them in your home on a daily basis. Glass tiles provide you with many advantages when used for backsplash. As aforementioned, glass is permeable like ceramic tiles and therefore resistant to mildew, stains and mold. The fact that you can care for these tiles stress-free makes them ideal for any project. Glass tiles are also appreciated for their reflective characteristics and therefore useful in rooms where there is no much lighting. Glass tiles tap into the little natural light entering the room making it look brighter and bigger as well.\nAnother ingenious feature for glass tiles is that they come in a wide selection of colors and combinations that allows you to choose the best based on your project imaginations and preference. There is no better way to express your personality during the remodeling process like when using glass tile backsplash as you can play around with the different colors, combining the best designs with other features for a harmonious blend. When using glass tile subway backsplash, you will enjoy major installation advantages that cannot be compared with any other tile. Glass tiles is easy to install even for beginners.\nPHOTO ID #: 6174\nGlass tile backsplash ideas\nAs aforementioned, glass tiles are the best and the easiest to use during your remodeling projects. This is because they can easily be match with other installations giving a harmonious match that you will enjoy. When thinking of the best glass tile backsplash ideas, it would be good to consider choosing your other installations first and then pick your glass tiles last. This will give you an easy project idea as you will manage to select the right colors and designs that will complement the cabinets, countertops, and the tiles as well. Glass tile backsplash can be very helpful when it comes to the pulling together of your project and making it work.\nYou do not have to use glass tiles entirely in your project. Instead, you can make use of smaller tiles to create a borderline for other different types of tiles and this becomes a great way of inexpensively incorporating glass tiles into your project. Some of the great glass tile backsplash ideas that you will find stunning and cost effective include the following:\n- White glass mosaic tiles have a propensity of appearing slightly green. Nevertheless, their luminosity can help transform a small kitchen appear incredible and very appealing.\n- Another great idea is in the use of round glass tile insert. This idea has a natural look that is both silky and eye-catching. The tiles are ideal for an aesthetic home as they create a visual texture in the room making the design realistic and perfect.\nPHOTO ID #: 6175\nChoosing the best glass tiles\nAs mentioned earlier, there are hundreds of glass tile designs, which you can apply for your backsplash. Taking time to look at most of them will help in coming up with something spectacular and long lasting. You make glass tile mosaic backsplashes in a number of shapes with each shape offering you an extensive selection of color combinations ranging from translucent tiles to solid colored tiles. In addition, other tiles have every color shade that you can imagine. You can check at the different samples available before settling on one specific color and shape with the help of your cabinet and countertop color combinations. Additionally, the process can be easier using 3D design tools available from the tile dealer.\nGlass subway tile backsplash styles\nApart from making kitchens and bathrooms more functionally, glass subway backsplashes normally help in transforming dull and old homes giving them a new face. These tiles are ideal for the kitchen’s sink areas, giving the kitchen a modern look. This is doable in a wide selection of colors including opaque, which gives the room a feel of being larger that it is. The opaque looking glass tiles are suitable mostly in small rooms where you would want to create an impression or space. Additionally, you can use a different style mixing glass subway tiles in an assortment of colors to give the kitchen a more eclectic modern look. This style is suitable for large and loft kitchens. The choice of the right glass tiles is important and wall glass tiles are normally thinner than those used on the floor.\nGlass tile backsplash colors\nAs aforementioned, glass tiles come in a wide range of beautiful colors that make it easy for you to design your project without hassles. However, some of these colors are more popular compared to others and knowing the right color for your project is always important for the project outcome. Some of the most popular colors include black, brown, cream, green, gray, clear, blue, yellow, and white. The awesome thing with glass tiles is that you can combine different colors to come up with your desired style. For example, many homeowners easily combine black and white tiles and this creates a nicely looking effect on the walls unlike it is the case when using a single color. However, your other installations will help you design your own project for a harmonious outlook.\nInstalling glass tile backsplash\nTo install your backsplash, you will need to have the right tools and materials including thin-set, polyurethane, un-sanded grout, and speed square. Start by planning your tile layout, taking the measurements depending with the desired size of the backsplash. Once you do this, mix the thin set mortar, and apply according to the directions given by the manufacturers. Make sure that mixture is as thick as creamy peanut butter. Apply thin-set on the marked wall space using a trowel and maintain the right depth. Start putting the glass tiles on the thin-set, covering 2-square-foot area at-a-time. Make sure that you have a wet sponge to clean the tiles as you go on.\nDuring the installation, make sure that you have the necessary list of friendly adhesives and sealants to avoid any backfiring of the project. Always make sure that you tiles are level as you apply them to the thin-set, keeping the desired space between then as you continue. Ensure that the excess mortar is cleaned before drying up. Apply the grout consistently according to the manufacturer’s recommendations making sure that you do not apply pressure. Allow the drying process to complete and then wipe your tiles with a wet sponge. While doing this, make sure that you do not indent the grout lines. Once the grout is dry, clean the haze off with a wipe with a soft sponge\nPHOTO ID #: 6176\nHow to care for glass tile backsplash\nSurprisingly, glass tiles are very popular for kitchen and bathroom backsplash designs due to their versatility, durability, and easy maintenance. Glass does not disfigure or scratch easily contrary to common perceptions and therefore is a very suitable material for the regularly utilized spaces. This however does not mean you should use highly abrasive materials or exert severe pressure, as this will damage even the toughest of materials. Taking proper care of the tiles is therefore important, as this will help ensure that they last for long and in a perfect condition.\nThe tiles do not require much special attention and materials to clean and you can easily achieve a sparkling look by using a simple soft cloth, water and some soap. It is important to avoid abrasive fabrics and cleaners and instead employ the use of sponges and other ordinary multi-use kitchen cleaners. This helps in retaining your tiles in their natural color while at the same time preventing scratches, which might mess up with your mosaic. Keeping the tiles shining is fortunately easy and you can do it by following the guidelines given below:\n- Mix some water and soap in a spray bottle. You can also mix water and vinegar if you like as this is good in killing bacteria that could easily grow in damp places like on the backsplash and also allow vinegar to break soap scum and hard water buildups.\n- Saturate the backsplash with the mixture by spraying it evenly. Once this is done, use a soft bristle brush or sponge to clean the grout.\n- Splash clean water on the glass tiles backsplash to rinse them well and then wipe with a dry and clean soft piece of cloth. This will help avoid any streaks or water spots.\nIt is that simple to clean and maintain and does not give you headache and this is what has made glass tiles a favorite for many people in backsplash installation. With these few steps, you enjoy a truly appealing focal point in your room as you also enhance the functionality of your kitchen. Always remember, choosing the right kind of glass tiles will guarantee you a highly appealing kitchen backsplash and a harmonious blend with other choice installations.\nLook for Glass tile Backsplash', ""On average, both quartz and marble slab backsplashes will cost an average of $90 per square foot. A granite backsplash will cost an average of $50 per square foot but can range up to $75 per square foot.\nEntry-level granite costs around $40 to $60 per square foot, so low-level granite backsplash designs can be cheaper than quartz. Nonetheless, higher-end granite is rare and will usually be much more expensive, so it depends on how much budget you're working with and whether you want high-end or entry-level material.\nIs A Solid Slab Quartz Backsplash Expensive? It depends on your definition of expensive but generally speaking the answer is no. The material is a lot cheaper per square foot than buying tile but since there's really no installation charge it ends up being about the same.\nQuartz offers a number of benefits that are ideal for backsplashes. Not only does the larger piece do a better job at protecting the wall from moisture, but this man-made, non-porous material also is stain resistant, doesn't require sealing, and cleans easily.\nThe cost of an installed quartz backsplash averages between $600 for a quartz tile backsplash and $4,500 for a slab backsplash that matches your countertop. The material ranges from $300 to $3,000.\nQuartz and granite countertops are priced similarly per square foot, with granite counters having the wider variation in price. Granite can be more expensive than quartz at times, based on the availability of a color and pattern.\nQuartz is generally less expensive.\nBut with the exception of the cheapest granite, quartz is generally less expensive—$70 to $100 per square foot installed compared with granite's price range of $60 to $270 per square foot installed.\nQuartz Backsplash Thickness\nThe average thickness of a backsplash of any kind in tile is about 3/16 to ¼ inches. Once you start considering using slabs, though, this thickness increases. The average quartz slab is about 1-¼ inches (or 3 centimeters) thick which is what is often used in a quartz slab backsplash.\nOne of the biggest cons of a 4-inch backsplash over a full-tile backsplash is that the design is a little outdated. Though still a popular design, many kitchen designers tout the more modern and trendier full-tile design.\nAverage Cost to Install a Backsplash\nOn average, expect to spend around $1,500 on your new backsplash. According to Fixr, the price range for this project is $900 to $2,500, with the price largely dependent on the type of tile you use. If you install your backsplash yourself, you can save money on labor costs.\nWhen you coordinate your design elements and architectural features, colors don't have to match, but they should coordinate. Your backsplash tile doesn't have to mirror the color of your countertops, but it should blend, harmonize and support the rest of the features in the room.\nA traditional quartz backsplash is usually milled to 3cm thickness (or 1 1/4″).\nGranite has been used on kitchen countertops and backsplashes for decades now. Unlike glass tiles and subway tile backsplash, this timeless material still has a fresh look.\nSo long as you keep it clean and as dry as possible, you can use any color quartz slab for a backsplash without issues. But if your backsplash is going behind a stove and you do a lot of cooking, granite is probably the better choice.\nMost tile options range from 3/16 to ¼ inch thick, but with the addition of mortar, you can expect an average thickness of ½ inch.\nAn acrylic resin composite that can be created in countless alluring colors, Corian complements natural stone, making it a coveted backsplash selection for homeowners with granite, quartz and other countertop surfaces.\nSubway tile is the most enduring choice for a backsplash. Avoid bold, trendy colors, and instead look for white or neutrals. Keep it simple, and bring in color elsewhere in the kitchen, with more easily replaced items, such as dish towels, art, bowls of fruit and rugs.\nThe design should be used to balance out the light and dark shades of the other elements, so if you have light cabinets and countertops, you may want to choose a dark backsplash to bring more depth to the kitchen. If you have very dark cabinets or countertops, a light backsplash will help the kitchen feel fresh.\nFor years now, the 4-inch backsplash has been standard in most spec homes and continues to be a popular choice.\nAs an answer to the actual question, there's nothing wrong from a design point with using a 3 cm backsplash with a 3 cm counter. The exception may be around your sink area, as some sinks are larger in front to back depth, as well as some faucets.\nA standard backsplash measures 4 inches from the top of the countertop surface. Full-height backsplashes, also called slab or panel backsplashes, can stretch from the top of the countertop to the bottom of upper cabinets or all the way to the ceiling.\nSome quartz makers sell exclusively through big-box stores; other slabs are available only through independent kitchen and bath showrooms.\nNo, you can't use disinfecting wipes on quartz countertops. Disinfecting wipes contain citric acid as their primary ingredient and are not diluted in any way. When you use these wipes to clean your countertop, they will weaken the seal on your countertop's surface leaving them vulnerable to discoloration.\nThe main downsides of quartz countertops are their price, appearance (if you desire the look of natural stone), and lack of resistance against heat damage.\nQuartz's clarity earns it a raw price of around $0.01/carat and a gem price of $1-$7/carat. Amethyst, or purple quartz, is the most valuable variety (can reach $15/carat), but pink, rose, and smokey quartz is also valuable. Clearer, more vibrant, and unbroken specimens are the most valuable quartz.""]"	['<urn:uuid:33869f5e-aa73-4576-9ec3-5af6d78f0397>', '<urn:uuid:eb0562d0-6ec0-4bfe-b488-a36c2fe46937>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	9	62	2610
97	flying airplanes managing costs fuel maintenance staff which biggest expense ways reduce	According to the documents, fuel costs represent the largest share of variable operation costs, accounting for approximately one third of all airlines' expenses. The three major cost items in flight operations are flight crew staffing, maintenance/upkeep, and fuel costs. To reduce these expenses, operators can implement several strategies: joining fuel programs for guaranteed lower prices, using fuel price trackers, optimizing routes, considering fuel tankering, and flying at maximum-range cruise speed. For maintenance costs, which comprise about 40% of MRO expenses specifically for engines, airlines can work with independent experts to save up to 20% on maintenance services. These experts can help manage overhaul processes and identify reliable repair companies offering optimal solutions.	"['The discussions among aviation experts in western media regarding the potential winner in the A320 NEO engine race are rapidly gaining acceleration. There seems to be two major competitors that are currently closest to the finishing line: the Pratt & Whitney produced PW1100G GTF and the markedly improved new generation CFMI (CFMI-Leap-X). With respect to the declared fuel characteristics and operating efficiency, Avia Solutions Group experts point out, that the present aircraft technical maintenance and support market is 5-6 times larger than the newly-delivered engine market. They also maintain that most of the expenses associated with the overall A320 NEO – operational costs will be related to engine technical maintenance, repair and fuel costs. Hence choosing the right engine requires a thorough analysis encompassing all aspects of airline activities.\nGenerally speaking, both engine manufacturers claim to offer exceptionally high fuel consumption effectiveness. However, with regards to the fact that new engines, as compared to the existing generation ones (CFM56-5B/7B, V2500-A5), are significantly much more efficient; therefore, the difference between prices of running an aircraft with any type of the new generation engine is relatively minor. This also applies to the MRO-related expenses. Under such circumstances, regardless of the engine type an airline selects for its aircraft, it must focus on achieving the right balance between fuel and maintenance costs. The decision making process should involve a detailed airline activity analysis covering financial options, opportunities to fuel its aircraft in the countries where fuel prices are lower, different ways of paying for technical support and maintenance services (Pay-by-the-Hour, engine maintenance lease reserves, Pay as you go, etc), aircraft fleet phase-in and phase-out plans, etc.\nAccording to the IATA, fuel costs amount to approximately one third of all airlines’ expenses. It is very hard to arrive at more accurate estimates since oil prices constantly fluctuate. Airlines can seek ways to optimize fuel expenses by finding a reliable fuel supplier, optimizing routes and choosing the best destinations for fuelling. However, applying such strategies in practice can prove quite a challenge since the sluggish efforts to de-monopolize fuelling industry in airports.\nMoreover, all declared fuel efficiency characteristics are based on estimates and depend on many factors. When seeking to optimize fuel expenses, airlines should focus on creating a highly efficient and consistent strategy: set explicit management goals, establish reliable partnership with all route network airports, select reliable partners and refuelling companies, regularly monitor and track the technical condition of all engines and APUs as well as optimize MRO processes. A systemized implementation of the following measures will help to decrease fuel expenses by 5-8%:\nThere is also a number of ways to manage fuel expenses. An aircraft operator should conduct a thorough inspection of its A320/B737NG fleet and to analyze the business experience with its MRO-providers as well as spare parts suppliers. One of the ways to reduce the CFMI-Leap-X maintenance cost is the unification of the upcoming fleet with the existing CFM56-5B/7B engines. For example, Southwest is the first buyer of the B737 MAX generation aircraft with a powered Leap-X engine. The current airline fleet consists of B737 CL and B737 NG type of aircraft. The airline has already started replacing the B737 CL aircraft to the NG ones and in the future they are planning on replacing the NG to the MAX type of aircraft and to keep the same airframe as well as engine manufacturer. Despite substantial modifications, these two engine generations will still share common maintenance principles. Therefore, engineers and technicians won’t have to ‘switch over’ to the innovative Pratt & Whitney product, which has been unavailable for these types of aircraft till now. Choosing the Leap-X will also provide an operator with the opportunity to strengthen and develop further relations with the CFMI manufacturer. However, if a fleet contains regional ATR42/72, Dash Q-series aircraft or the long-range Boeing 767/777/747/757s, equipped with Pratt & Whitney engines, the operator should consider opting for the PW1100G. It will help to optimize maintenance costs for the entire PW engine line operated in the company’s fleet. This especially applies to the wide-body aircraft ‘large’ engines, which require expensive overhauls.\nA thorough fleet analysis and proper aircraft distribution within the company’s flight network will also help to reduce costs. However, integrating new types of aircraft into an existing fleet cannot be done rashly. Before making an acquisition, airlines, with the help of independent aircraft, engine and network optimization experts and consultants, should conduct a thorough analysis of new types of engines and aircraft. Sometimes carriers should consider outsourcing marketing research. Carefully applied, these measures will help operators to avoid negative consequences of a hasty choice based on provided theoretical characteristics of an airplane or an engine.\nThe cost of engine MRO-costs amounts to approx. 40% of all MRO expenses.\nHence a well-considered engine maintenance approach may also help to lower the overall expenses, primarily, by optimizing fuel consumption.\nModern engines require an overhaul every 8-12 years. That is why an air carrier with a modern fleet has no need for a large team of highly qualified personnel. Though it is obviously a very cost-effective policy, sooner or later engines will still require maintenance. This is a delicate issue with its advantages and disadvantages that all need to be taken into consideration prior to choosing the most cost-efficient approach.\nIn the new generation A320 NEO engines the manufacturers have preserved the best technical solutions found during operation of the previous engine generation and have implemented innovative technologies as well as highly sophisticated overhaul solutions. Organizations, developing OEM alternatives, will also find a niche in this market by offering DER repairs and PMA parts solutions. The secondary spare parts market will emerge shortly after airlines start operating the new A320 NEO engines. If some of the life-limited parts keep the same part numbers (which is typical for the CFM56 family), secondary materials will be available on the market almost immediately. Either way, in order to evaluate every offer and possibility, an operator needs to have sufficient experience and production capacities.\nUsually airlines cannot accurately estimate the total cost of engine maintenance services such as hospital repairs or engine overhaul. As a result, they end up being unpleasantly surprised by the invoices they receive from MRO companies. Independent market experts have calculated that the annual losses the CIS-based airlines suffer from A320, B737CL, B737NG engines’ MRO services amount to USD60 million. The largest portion of these expenses falls to modern CFM56-5B/7B and V2500-A5 engines’ overhaul as the majority of aircraft operators face the need to repair these engines for the first time since starting their exploitation. An average price for repairing a single narrow-body airplane CFM56 or V2500 engine is USD2.5-3 million. Working along with independent MRO experts may save an airline up to USD300-600 thousand, i.e. almost 20% of the final cost.\nSince experts from MRO organizations possess the necessary experience and knowledge they may both manage the overhaul process and participate in it. They are well aware of the reputable and reliable engine repair companies in the market. Such organizations can weigh all the advantages and disadvantages thus arriving at a well–informed decision regarding the best spare parts supplier and component overhaul company that offers the most optimum maintenance solutions. Moreover, managing a large scale of engine overhauls means that independent organizations gain access to way cheaper spare parts pricelist and may offer lower-priced components’ overhaul services. This allows to significantly decrease the overall cost of MRO engine services and to switch suppliers, should their conditions intersect with customer demands.\nThe way the modern Western engines (including PW1100G and CFMI-Leap-X) are manufactured allows maintenance specialists to conduct partial engine repairs or restore only certain components without fully dismantling the entire engine or performing its full overhaul. Such approach doesn’t counteract with the agreements made between airlines, aircraft lessors and financiers. After inspecting an engine, independent experts offer their client only such MRO services, which are truly required in accordance with the engine exploitation plan and aircraft return conditions.\nTherefore, in order to make the right decision regarding the A320 NEO engine selection airlines should take into consideration the following: company’s past and current cooperation experience with engine manufacturers, aircraft fleet phase-in and phase-out plans and general strategy, route network optimization, fuel suppliers, MRO providers and independent engine maintenance experts. Proper combination of these factors will help airlines to achieve the best possible balance between operational reliability, fuel efficiency and exploitation expenses, regardless which type of a new generation engine they choose.', ""It forms a big part of your annual operating budget, but how can operators better control their fuel purchase practices? Dave Higdon offers tips…\nFew are better placed to understand the relationship between cold hard cash and high-speed flight than those who pay the bills for your Flight Department. In these days of increasing costs, skilled managers add value to their flight operations by controlling all three major cost items: Flight crew staffing, maintenance and upkeep, and fuel costs.\nSetting an operating budget demands a working knowledge of all three items and how those factors interact. For example, budgeting for ‘X’ hours flying per year sets the bar for maintenance (based on hourly costs) and a concomitant estimate of fuel costs.\nThat’s simple enough, providing the person developing the budget recognizes that changing any one of those three factors automatically brings a related change to the other numbers.\nIn reality, plenty of people put tremendous effort into controlling their fuel spending. Though consumers lack any way to influence pump prices, they enjoy total control over when, how much and where they choose to fill their tanks.\nSince fuel costs account for the largest share of variable operation costs, managing fuel use and fuel purchases greatly influence the department’s budget.\nWithin this article, we’ll consider the steps needed to keep your operation on – or under – your fuel-budget estimate. Following are some of the best tips and practices…\nTip #1: Join a Fuel Program\nThe Business Aviation community includes numerous vendors and program operators offering fuel cost control tools for those who enroll with them and use their systems. By contracting with vendors, these tools guarantee a lower price than the posted pump price in exchange for a minimum commitment.\nDo check that a particular program (e.g., a card arrangement) is accepted among the FBOs and airports your operation typically frequents. You may find some adjustments are needed, dependent on the airports you use.\nBy taking these precautions, you will avoid penalizing your operation by paying for a fuel club membership that's not usable at the majority of the airports you visit.\nMost of these programs offer guidance to help you use their cards. Once you have one, use the tool even if it doesn't always get you the lowest price.\nTip #2: Use Fuel Price Trackers\nVarious tools and programs exist solely to track and report fuel prices at airports around the country and across the globe. The better of these trackers update daily, while the best update even more frequently.\nBy entering a route or point of origin and destination, these programs typically will produce a list of airports along the route as well as their fuel prices at the time of the last check. A quick internet check or phone call can then confirm whether the posted prices remain in effect.\nAs an added bonus, making an advanced reservation can get you an additional discount at some airports.\nTip #3: Consider the Most Efficient Route\nFlight planning for fuel costs may not be an everyday occurrence, but on occasion a slight change in the route flown can yield big savings without appreciably adding to the trip length (thereby offsetting any fuel savings).\nChecking route fuel prices – through programs like those noted above – may reveal potential savings by landing at a different airport for the meeting, without refueling, then, by refueling somewhere else.\nAs an example, a trip last fall required us to make a technical stop that yielded a saving of $1.40 per gallon. On a 280-gallon uplift of jet fuel, that $1.40 of per-gallon savings translated to spending $392 less! Imagine savings like that multiple times a year. The habit could almost become a profit center of its own.\nTip #4: How About Fuel Tankering?\nWhere weight-and-balance considerations allow, some benefit may come from uplifting more fuel than a trip requires. Yes, it will slow your climb and could limit what's carried in the cabin, but the chances are that it won't.\nMany pilots like to fly with the fuel level suggested by flight planning; that is, fuel needed plus reserves for weather and a diversion. Carrying the least called-for saves fuel, helps climb performance and gives cruise speed a bit of an edge.\nBut if home field fuel costs are the lowest – and the aircraft is capable – tankering extra fuel can reduce total fuel expenses for a trip.\nThat is especially the case when the fuel capacity allows for a round-trip flight without refueling. Even when an airplane can't tanker round-trip fuel, the destination fuel price may be less – which is an incentive to fully top off before returning to home base.\nTip #5: Slow Down, You Fly Too Fast…\nAll aircraft offer a published maximum cruise speed. Why do we fly if we don't want to go as fast as possible? The answer involves another book speed: Maximum-range cruise speed.\nThrottling back isn't solely for ‘tailwind days’. Flying at maximum-range speed (even though you're flying a much shorter trip) will provide a measurable decline in fuel costs, with only a small increase in the en route time.\nThe vast majority of our trips are between 350-500nm. Sacrificing 40 knots on a 500nm trip may add 15-20 minutes to the trip – with a savings of 15-20% in fuel not used.\nPutting these fuel-saving steps into effect this January brings the potential of a full year of fuel savings compared to posted prices – because fuel costs show little sign of declining as we saw earlier in the decade.\nDemand increases and supply adjustments have largely ended any semblance of a glut in petroleum supplies. The business turbine fleet continues to grow, and flight hours are up in many parts of the world.\nEven as OEMs continue to advance the fuel efficiency of their engines and aircraft, the changes fall short of offsetting the higher prices expected in the next decade. Start practicing fuel-saving habits today and help your bottom line tomorrow.""]"	['<urn:uuid:fdd2499c-6167-4b51-8bb7-319d67b6591c>', '<urn:uuid:820d32d5-a456-447b-a4e9-3cd0705f23a6>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	12	112	2417
98	What are 3 key ways to show cultural competence when working with others?	There are three essential ways to show cultural competence when working with others: 1) Being respectful by recognizing and valuing cultural differences, including health beliefs, practices, and linguistic needs, 2) Being responsive by knowing about the cultural group, customizing approaches to fit their culture, and involving people from that group in planning and implementation, and 3) Creating a positive environment through honest communication, offering translation services when needed, and avoiding assumptions since cultures may vary internally.	"['Supporting Effective Decision Making\nThis module focuses on equipping you in supporting youth and families in making effective decisions. You will learn how to assess the level of support a youth and their family may need, as well as practical strategies for ensuring informed choice.\nMaterials in this module were excerpted with permission from the NYS PROMISE Case Management Field Guide v.3.\nThe Role of Self-Determination in Supporting Informed Choice\nSelf-determination is the process by which someone controls their own life—referring to a characteristic of a person that leads them to make choices and decisions based on their own preferences and interests, to monitor and regulate their own actions and to be goal-oriented and self-directing.1 There is a growing body of research about self-determination and its effects on youth with disabilities and their post-educational outcomes. Having more self-determination has been shown to lead to positive outcomes for youth with disabilities. Self-determination is important for individuals from all cultures and of all ability levels. Even individuals with the most severe disabilities are able to make choices about their own lives, with assistance.\nSelf-determination for those with disabilities includes an acknowledgement of their right and capapcity to have control over and direct their own lives.\nSelf-determination should be integrated at the intersection of vocational rehabilitation counseling and benefits and work incentives planning with youth and their families. Across these two processes, you should promote individual accountability and continuous engagement of the youth, exploring the youth’s goals, motivations, and values. When using self-determination theory in the field of counseling for young people with disabilities, you should examine how the family, school, service providers, and community context can assist the youth to:\nIdentify what they want to do and assist them in making their own goals\nDetermine what motivates them to make changes, grow, and try new things\nLearn how to solve problems and take responsibility\nYou should build on opportunities for youth to meet these needs by providing opportunities to:\n- discuss preferences\n- identify options\n- examine potential outcomes (positive and negative)\n- set goals\n- outline intermediary steps\n- identify supports\nYour goals should focus on helping youth and their families to understand:\nAutonomy – an individual’s freedom to make their own choices\nCompetence - an individual’s ability to be successful\nRelatedness - how an individual’s choices are connected\nThese three needs are seen as a natural part of the development of all individuals, and an important part of the human experience.\nCultural Competency and Decision Making\nCultural competency has been identified as a predictor of vocational rehabilitation success. Cultural competency is a set of skills that help you adapt your approaches to a wide variety of cultural environments. Culture itself can embrace race, ethnicity, religion, gender and many other personal characteristics. Individuals may be members of many different cultures simultaneously. Situational context impacts which cultural affiliations are ‘active’ and influencing the perspective of the youth and their family. For example, a youth a school may identify more strongly with a different set of cultures (i.e. student with a disability, athlete, high-school senior, Latino-American) than those that rise to prominence at home or in their community (i.e. oldest sister, grandchild of immigrants, Puerto Rican, Catholic).\nCultural competence includes four essential components: awareness, attitude, knowledge and skills. Effective cultural competence does not mean that you have to become an expert in your client’s cultures. However, it does mean that you are able to be aware that others may have different reactions to the world than oneself and conscious of your own reactions to others differences—this includes being cautious regarding your own attitudes, beliefs and values.\nIt is critical to be respectful and curious, willing and open to learning more and yet patient, understanding that it may be challenging to understand a culture without time, immersion and personal experience. Practicing and growing skills in cultural competence is a life-long professional development activity.\nTips for practicing cultural competence:\n- Focus on building a trusting relationship.\n- Communicate honestly and respectfully.\n- Help bridge communications and language barriers, offer appropriate translation services in advance where appropriate.\n- Be sensitive to youth and family preferences, culture, and religion.\n- Learn more. Ask youth and families the values they embrace, how their family functions, and what their priorities are.\n- Don\'t assume. Cultures may vary internally, and what you have previously learned may not always be transferrable to other situations.\nEmployment Decision Making and Supporting Choice\nUnderstanding the impact of earnings on disability benefits and public entitlements is critical to supporting youth and their families in advancing toward positive employment outcomes and creating pathways out of poverty. Wikipedia defines decision making as:\n""An outcome of mental processes leading to the selection of a course of action among several alternatives. Every decision- making process produces a final choice. The output can be an action or an opinion of choice.""\nImmediately, one can see how an individual can make a decision but still not take action. Making sure that specific next steps are integrated into the individual plan for employment (IPE) is critical, with each action step being assigned to a responsible person—this individual should most often be the individual returning to work but can also be other support persons. Finally, a due date should be assigned to each action step so the progress can be made, documented, and measured.\nWhile information may support individuals in making informed choices about work, making a choice does not always translate into taking action.\nDecision making is a complex process. An individual’s decision to try work, return to work or advance in work isn\'t as simple as just deciding ""to work or not to work."" Decisions must be made regarding the individual’s quality criterion (level of work, career type, support needed, etc.), approaches to securing and/or advancing in a job, choice of service provider, and other variables around conditions of work. All these choices facing the individual make the development of IEP a multi-dimensional process—with supports from you needed to move from each level of decision.\nThe Types of Decisions People Often Make\nThe youth and families you serve are going to be faced with four main types of decisions. You need to be ready to support them on all fronts. These include:\n- Decisions Whether are simply binary choices... ""to work or not to work."" These types of decisions are made by weighing pros and cons. You should be well-positioned to support recipients in making these types of decisions and should press for decisions and the reasoning behind a decision. You may discover that the individuals have a void in the information that has been provided that you may need to fill to help support individuals in making informed choices.\nDecisions Which are decisions that involve a choice of one or more alternatives from among a set of possibilities and, sometimes, can be based on the ""decision whether."" For example, ""to work part-time or full-time."" The choice is often based on how well each alternative measures up to a set of predefined criteria. Presenting scenarios to recipients in reports and during advisement are your best tools for supporting recipients in making these types of decisions. You can assist individuals in laying out options so that they can consider the option from various angles. Showing the youth and their family the financial outcome of each scenario presented will help to give a clear idea of the amounts of money involved in each possibility.\nContingent Decisions are decisions that have been made but are put on hold until some other condition is met. ""We would like our child to go to work but we have got to figure out how we will replace the SSI check with other income first"". It is critical for you to understand contingencies that a youth and/or their family may have before moving to action. This will help you in identifying subsequent supports, referrals and assistance that an individual may need to have in place to aid in moving to action.\nDecisions How. The difficulty at this stage is that questions involve the ""doing"" step. ""How will I get a job?"" ""Who will help me find a job?"" This type of decision-making requires active support from you, not passive observance. Making connections to subsequent support providers is critical and will provide necessary linkages to ensure continuity of supports resulting in positive work outcomes. The best way to help individuals is to know your community resources!\nCreating a Positive Decision Environment\nEach type of decision described above will be made within a decision environment, which is defined as the collection of information, alternatives, resources, values and preferences available at the time of the decision. Of course the ideal decision environment would include all possible information, all of it accurate and every possible alternative. Creating an ideal and positive environment is your number one priority, and several steps can be taken to help ensure it is developed:\nGather as much accurate and comprehensive information on the individual and their benefits portfolio as possible.\nVerify information collected to ensure accuracy and reliability of the alternatives and scenarios generated.\nUnderstand the specific goal(s) the youth and their family are interested in.\nIdentify the reservations and reluctance the individual may have pertaining to the choice(s) they need to make—this will possibly inform you regarding contingencies that will need to be in place.\nEstablish the criteria, characteristics or requirements that each alternative must possess to a greater or lesser extent—remember that alternatives will be rated on how well they deal with each criterion.\nUnderstand the individual and their values—this will help you gauge how desirable a particular outcome or alternative might be.\nIdentify the individual\'s preferences providing some insight into the philosophy and moral hierarchy of the youth and family making the decision.\nMost importantly, create an environment that supports work as a positive outcome and sets expectations regarding its value and worth.\nSupporting A Work Outcome\nRegardless of the strategy employed by the youth and their family making a choice to work, your role is critical. You possess the ability to create the environment and provide information that will support a youth’s choice to work. you can create the most exquisite and comprehensive advice report, but if that report ignores the youth and family’s reluctance and reservations, values, preferences and stated goals the utility of the document is negated and the chances of individuals making the better decision is minimized.\nWhile a decision to work may not always be in every youth’s best interest, you should approach each case with an eye toward work and what approaches would be most conducive to supporting this particular individual in making a choice to work. Your role in the decision making process is not just to provide information. Without understanding the youth’s final decision, you cannot begin to prescribe needed services and resources to support further movement toward work.\nAnother critical role for you is understanding why a youth made a certain decision. If a youth chooses not to opt for any of the scenarios created, it is important for you to process with the individual how they came to that choice. It is equally important when a youth makes a positive choice to work to understand what led them to that decision. This will give you better insights into the decision-making processes of individuals they are serving as well as showing what you can learn about the services provided that might produce more positive outcomes.\nSupporting a youth and their family in moving from ""knowing"" to ""doing"" is the critical action step. Even in cases where a youth makes a decision to not work, there should be ""next steps"" involved. Perhaps, now wasn\'t the right time. Perhaps, there were extenuating circumstances that led to that particular decision that may change in the future. Regardless of the reason, you should come away from every consultation with a youth and a family having an idea of what they need to do next to support the youth\'s movement toward work.\n- Was the information provied helpful in assisting you in making a decision?\n- Did you feel you had all the information you needed to make an informed choice?\n- If not, what additional information would be helpful?\n- Is your decision final? If not, is there any additional supported I can provide you?\n- What factors contributed to your decision?\n- Is there something I can do to assist you in putting your choice into action?\nGauging The Needs for Support in Decision Making\nAnother important tool for you to assist you in supporting not only effective decision making, but also moving to “doing” and “action”, is gauging the needs for support a youth and their family may have. To conduct this assessment you need to understand two critical dimensions—the youth and their families knowledge of benefits and work incentives as well as their ability to independently take action. The illustration provided plots these two dimensions along a vertical and horizontal axis establishing a scale of level of sufficiency of knowledge, as well as level of dependence. This plotting creates four dimensions that will assist you in gauging the level of support a youth and their family may need. These dimensions include:\n- Knowing / Doing Gap: Youth and their families who may have sufficient levels of knowledge but low levels of ability to act independent of supports.\n- Youth with insufficient levels of knowledge and low levels of ability to act independent of supports.\n- Youth with sufficient levels of knowledge and ability to act independently.\n- Youth with insufficient levels of knowledge, but high ability to act independent of supports.\nMotivational Interviewing As A Strategy to Support Effective Decision Making\nMotivational Interviewing (MI) is a style of interacting with individuals that sets a tone of empathy and compassion. It is a partnership and a commitment to walk “with” a person on his/her journey towards change. The spirit of MI is based on acceptance, and that acceptance can be broken into four parts:\n- Valuing the inherent worth and potential of every human being.\n- Providing accurate empathy by taking an interest in and making an effort to understand life through the other person’s eyes.\n- Supporting autonomy by honoring the person’s right for self-direction.\n- Affirming the individual by communicating and acknowledging the person’s strengths and efforts.\nIn contrast to the common approach in the human service profession of focusing on problem behavior, the spirit of MI involves a focus on strengths. The MI philosophy asserts that individuals hold the wisdom and strengths to come up with their own reasons for change and overcome their ambivalence. Your goal in the MI relationship is to evoke or “bring out” the individual’s own internal motivations for change and then assist the youth in creating a plan of action. Sometimes after individuals work through their feelings of ambivalence, they make changes on their own with very little need for assistance from others.', 'Applying cultural competence to every step of the Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) should result in a positive relationship with the community you serve.\nPrevention practitioners who apply cultural competence to each step of SAMHSA’s Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) benefit from an increased awareness about the unique challenges and advantages within the communities they serve. Your relationship with members of the community also improves when you affirm cultural perspectives.\nPrevention practitioners who are culturally competent look inward. Aim to assess the influence of your own values, perceptions, opinions, knowledge, and social position on interactions with others. Understand that cultural competence is not theoretical, but must be reflected in everyday attitudes and interactions. Infuse cultural competence into SPF Step 1: Assess Needs by:\n- Identifying and using a culturally-competent program evaluator\n- Deciding how to measure cultural competence and collecting cultural competence-related information and data\n- Identifying change from a community perspective\n- Gaining community approval for data collection methods, analysis, and the final product\n- Creating a process for identifying culturally-relevant risk and protective factors and underlying conditions\nCulturally competent professionals learn how to be an ally to groups that experience prejudice and discrimination in the community. This, in turn, helps people learn how to be an ally within and outside of their own cultural groups. Encouraging cultural self-awareness and affirming other people’s cultural perspectives are key to building capacity. Infuse cultural competence into SPF Step 2: Build Capacity by:\n- Assessing community resources and readiness in the community\n- Providing a safe and supportive environment for all participants\n- Ensuring cultural representation (for example, language, gender, age)\n- Developing policies to improve cultural competence through staff recruitment, retention, and training\n- Seeking community input on problems and possible solutions\n- Identifying and mobilizing mutually acceptable program goals and objectives\nCulturally competent professionals make community representation in the planning process a priority. Along with these community stakeholders, consider how the program would fit into the community culture, what existing prevention efforts are in place, and the community’s past history when selecting programs and strategies.\nLearn how to embrace new and unpredictable situations. When misunderstandings arise, be persistent in keeping communication lines open. Encouraging skills-building in cross-cultural interactions and communication is important to program planning.\nLearn more about SPF Step 3: Plan.\nA culturally competent professional understands that people may choose to participate in different ways, and that they may also have different learning styles when it comes to understanding the program. Build on community members’ strengths and draw upon their diverse perspectives and experiences. Encourage community involvement in the implementation of the strategic plan.\nLearn more about SPF Step 4: Implement.\nCulturally competent professionals understand that large related studies or surveys can often serve as a starting place for community comparison research. However, if these studies do not have a diverse participant pool or represent members of your target population, the results may not be accurate or reflective of the outcomes of your excluded or underrepresented target group. Understand that all cultures have their own integrity, validity, and coherence and deserve respect.\nLearn more about SPF Step 5: Evaluation.\nPrevention practitioners are culturally competent when they can function effectively within the context of a community’s cultural beliefs, behaviors, and needs. Being respectful and being responsive are two ways you can show cultural competence.\nBeing respectful means recognizing and valuing cultural differences, such as the health beliefs, practices, and linguistic needs of diverse populations.\nBeing responsive means:\n- Knowing something about the culture of the group that the interventions focus on\n- Customizing prevention and promotion in a way that respects and fits within the group’s culture\n- Involving people from the targeted cultural group in assessing needs, developing resources, planning and implementing interventions, and evaluating their effectiveness\nIn the context of a prevention program, being respectful and responsive can help bring about positive health outcomes.\nDeveloping cultural competence is an evolving, dynamic process that takes time and occurs along a continuum. The National Center for Cultural Competence at Georgetown University’s Center for Child and Human Development describes the six stages of this continuum in Infusing Cultural and Linguistic Competence in Health Promotion Training: Group Activity – Understanding the Cultural Competence Continuum – 2005 (PDF | 88 KB):\n- Cultural destructiveness. This stage is characterized by attitudes and practices (as well as policies and structures in organizations) that are destructive to a cultural group.\n- Culture incapacity. This stage reflects the lack of capacity systems and organizations necessary to effectively respond to the needs and interests of diverse groups. This can include institutional or systemic bias, practices that may result in discrimination in hiring and promotion, or disproportionate allocation of resources that may benefit one group over another. This can also include subtle messages that certain groups aren’t valued or welcomed.\n- Cultural blindness. This stage describes a philosophy of “fairness” that views and treats all people as the same. This philosophy, however, can be problematic because people are different and have different needs. People deserve approaches that acknowledge and celebrate differences, while addressing these needs. Cultural blindness can in fact, negatively influence system policies by encouraging assimilation, ignoring cultural strengths, fostering institutional attitudes that blame consumers for their circumstances, and failing to hire a diverse workforce.\n- Cultural pre-competence. This stage highlights the growing awareness of strengths (and areas for improvement) to respond effectively to culturally and linguistically diverse populations.\n- Cultural competence. In this stage, acceptance and respect for culture becomes consistently demonstrated in policies, structures, practices, and attitudes. This can include an organization’s commitment to human and civil rights, hiring practices that reflect a diverse workforce, and increased efforts to improve service delivery for racial, ethnic, or cultural groups.\n- Cultural proficiency. In stage six, culture is held in high esteem and used as a foundation to guide all endeavors. Organizations that do this successfully continue to add to their knowledge base. They support and mentor other organizations seeking to improve their cultural competence and they advocate with and on behalf of populations who are traditionally underserved or not served at all. They also partner with other diverse constituency groups to help reduce and eventually eliminate racial and ethnic disparities.\n- Checking Our Assumptions: Family Involvement in the Latino Community Video – 2012\n- Elements of a Culturally Competent Prevention System – 2010\n- Needs Assessment and Cultural Competence: Questions to Ask – 2010\n- Understanding Cultural Conditions Video – 2012']"	['<urn:uuid:29055094-24cf-4a3f-8f54-96b68928a43f>', '<urn:uuid:7fbd0b4e-7356-4a00-9594-7120e1c514ef>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	13	76	3566
99	What's the typical weight range for adult muskrats?	Muskrats weigh between 1½ to 4 pounds.	['Muskrats are large, aquatic rodents, 16 to 25 inches in length, including the long tail. They weigh 1½ to 4 pounds. Their fur is typically dark brown, with the underside considerably lighter than the back. Muskrats are sometimes confused with beaver, but the two species are easy to tell apart by looking at the tail. Muskrats have thin, nearly hairless tails that are flattened vertically, while beavers have broad tails that are flattened horizontally. Muskrats weigh two to four pounds, and are much smaller than beavers (25 to 90 pounds). Muskrats have small eyes and ears and short front legs with longer hind legs. They have five clawed toes on each foot, and the back feet are partially webbed. Muskrats are highly specialized for living in the water.\nMuskrat tracks are found near water. Although they have five toes on the front feet, the inner toe is so small that it does not usually show up in a track. The tracks of the hind feet will be larger than those of the front feet. There may also be tail drag marks with the tracks.\nMuskrats inhabit aquatic areas of still or slow moving water. They can be found living in ponds, lakes, streams, swamps, marshes, storm water management ponds, and drainage ditches. Those that live in swamps and marshes or other areas with a low water table often build lodges of aquatic, herbaceous vegetation. These lodges can be quite large measuring four to six feet in diameter. They will also construct smaller feeding houses or feeding platforms. Muskrats that live in deeper water often dig out burrows in the bank of ponds or drainage ditches. Muskrats enter both lodges and burrows through openings under the water. Bank dwelling muskrats are probably more common than lodge builders in Illinois.\nMuskrats can be found in every county in Illinois, but are most abundant in the northern part of the state. While habitat loss due to drainage of Illinois wetlands caused a decline in the population, creation of ponds and drainage ditches has kept the muskrat common throughout the state. Researchers have documented populations of more than eight muskrats per acre in marshes and 60 muskrats per mile of drainage ditch. Drought, flooding, and harsh winters all effect muskrat populations, and their numbers can fluctuate drastically from year to year.\nMuskrats breed from March to September, but most young are born between April and June. Gestation is 25 to 30 days. Females have two or three litters per year, producing an average of three to six young per litter. Females care for young on their own without the assistance of the male. Young are capable of swimming at three weeks of age and will be weaned by the time they are a month old. Females may have a new litter of young in a different nest chamber before the previous litter has dispersed to new habitat. If food is scarce, the older litter may eat the younger litter.\nMuskrats eat a variety of aquatic plants such as cattails, pickerelweed, bulrush, marsh smartweed, waterlily, sedges, American lotus, duck potato, reed cane, wild rice, water milfoil, and pondweed. They also eat black willow, sweet clover, goldenrod, rose, nightshade, and corn. Muskrats will sometimes eat crayfish, clams, fish, and turtles. Animal matter is likely more important in the diet during the winter when vegetation is not as available.\nMuskrats are typically nocturnal (active at night) but may be seen during the day, especially on overcast days. They are also more active during the day in spring and early summer. Muskrats forage for food near their dens and tend not to travel far. Young are the exception since they may have to travel to find their own territory. This search may take them over land, and during this time they are susceptible to being killed by vehicles or predators. Muskrats typically live alone, although in fairly close proximity to one another. They may den together during the winter months. If food becomes a limiting factor, muskrats will become aggressive toward each other. Muskrats do not hibernate and typically do not store much food for the winter.\nMuskrats have a short lifespan. It is estimated that two thirds of the young born each year do not make it through their first winter. Flooding is a major cause of mortality among young muskrats. Mink (Mustela vison) is the main predator, and take both adult and young muskrats. Hawks, owls, coyotes, foxes, raccoons, large snakes, and snapping turtles also prey upon muskrats. The oldest known wild muskrat lived four years.\nMuskrats are most likely to cause problems by burrowing into pond and lake shorelines, dams, and water control structures.\nWhen constructing new ponds use the following specifications: The inside face of the dam should be built at a three-to-one slope and the outer face at a two-to-one slope. The top of the dam should be at least eight feet wide. The water level should be kept three feet or more below the top of the dam.\nStone rip-rap can be used to prevent muskrats from burrowing into pond dams. Bury chain link or welded wire fencing six to twelve inches below the soil surface and a minimum of several feet above and below the normal water level all along the shoreline or earthen structure.\nTrapping is the most effective way of dealing with nuisance muskrats. You will need an animal control permit from an Illinois Department of Natural Resources District Wildlife Biologist before trapping muskrats. The biologist will assist you with a removal strategy. Typically No. 110 Conibear® traps or No. 1, 1½, or 2 leghold traps are used to trap muskrats. All traps must be completely submerged so that non-target animals are not trapped. The traps should be placed in known muskrat runs to be most effective, and the trap should be positioned next to the den opening. All traps should be checked at least once a day. A nuisance wildlife control operator can be hired if you wish to have someone remove the muskrats for you.\nMuskrats can be carriers of tularemia, a disease caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis. People can contract the disease by handling infected carcasses or consuming contaminated food or water. Symptoms typically appear three to five days after exposure and include fever, chills, headaches, muscle, and joint pain, and diarrhea. The disease can be treated with antibiotics. This disease is not spread from person to person.\nMuskrats are susceptible to other diseases and parasites, but these are not of concern to public health.\nMuskrats are an important food source for many predators. Minks are particularly dependent upon muskrat populations. Additionally, abandoned muskrat burrows provide homes for several other species.\nIn Illinois, muskrats are protected as Furbearers. If a muskrat in an urban area is causing a problem, it may be trapped and removed if an animal removal permit is issued by an Illinois Department of Natural Resources District Wildlife Biologist.\nIn rural areas, a trapping license is needed to harvest a muskrat. Muskrats may be trapped November through January. There is no limit to the number of muskrats an individual with a trapping license may take during season.

100	What are the traditional uses of Tamarindus indica in medicine, and how do modern herbalists ensure the quality and safety of herbal preparations in general?	Tamarindus indica is traditionally used to treat cold, fever, stomach disorders, diarrhea, jaundice, indigestion, constipation, and as a skin cleanser. It's also used as a gargle for sore throat and mixed with salt for rheumatism. Regarding quality and safety of herbal preparations in general, they depend on multiple factors including growing environment, harvesting timing, processing, and manufacturing. Quality control is maintained through standardization and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), which ensure proper identity, purity, strength and composition of herbal products.	"[""The orthodox medicine, as currently made available today in Nigeria (as in most African countries), so long as every nook and corner of our rural populations in Africa cannot yet be provided with basic health care needs including full-time resident medical personnel and readily available and affordable drugs, has failed woefully (Elujoba et al., 2005). Although wherever, modern health facilities exist, traditional medicine is incomparable. Therefore, the most workable health agenda for Africa is the institutionalization of traditional medicine in parallel (not in complete fusion) with orthodox medicine, within the national health care scheme in order to move the health agenda forward. Effective health agenda for the African continent can never be achieved by orthodox medicine alone unless it is complemented by traditional medicine practice (Elujoba et al., 2005).\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates, about 80% of the\nworld population today relies chiefly on traditional medicines for their primary\nhealth care needs and that over 30% of the world plant species have at one time\nor the other been used for one medicinal purpose or the other for our primary\ncare needs (Akerele et al., 1991). Moreover, the increasing use of plant\nextracts in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries demands toxicity risk\nassessment of various indigenous plant preparations used in the treatment of\ndiseases (Yakubu et al., 2005) and suggests that a systemic study of\nmedicinal plants is very important (Nostro et al., 2005).\nTamarindus indica pulp is being used among the food ingredients of a popular Hausa food in the northwestern part of Nigeria. The plant has also been reported to be among the recipe in hausa folk-loric medicine in treatments of cold, fever, stomach disorder, diarrhea and jaundice and as skin cleanser (Doughari, 2006). It is popularly employed on a daily base in the general traditional medicine practice as a drug conveyor, in combination with other herb for treatment of various diseases such as indigestion, constipation. In the native practice, Tamarindus indica is applied on inflammations, used as a gargle for sore throat and mixed with salt as a liniment for rheumatism, accelerate expulsion, relieve pains, reduce secondary bacterial infections and promote healing (Fabiyi et al., 1993).\nThe extensive use of this medicinal plant in treatment of various ailments has made it necessary to investigate its toxicity. The present study was therefore undertaken to evaluate, using biochemical and toxicity test, the risk assessments of the aqueous pulp extract of Tamarindus indica.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCollection of Plant Material\nTamarindus indica pulp was obtained around the wild of Sokoto south\nlocal government area of Sokoto state, Nigeria. The pulp was identified by the\nherbarium and a voucher specimen was deposited in the Department of Botany of\nthe Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto-Nigeria.\nPreparation of Extract\nThe aqueous pulp extract of Tamarindus indica was prepared by extraction\nwith hot water in order to simulate the local procedure as described by Akinyole\nand Olorede (2000). T. indica pulp (400 g) was soaked in 2 L of distilled\nwater and boiled for 5 min. This hot decoction was shaken for 10 min and allowed\nto cool then filtered using Whatman filter paper No. 1. The filtrate was then\nevaporated under vacuo to a brownish gummy residue and stored at 4°C\nuntil used. The percentage yield was 25.2% w/w. This portion is referred to\nas the extract.\nExperimental Animal Model\nAdult albino rats weighing 201.6±65 g body weight (b.w) were obtained\nfrom the Animal Farmhouse of the Zoology Department of Usmanu Danfodiyo University,\nSokoto, Nigeria. The animals were allowed acclimatize for seven days having\naccess to water and food ad libitum. They were randomized to one of the\nfollowing experimental groups, with five animals per group:\n|| Normal rats chow and distilled water only\n||Normal rats chow and 900 mg kg-1 body weight\nof the extract.\n||Normal rats chow and 1800 mg kg-1 body weight\nof the extract.\n||Normal rats chow and 2700 mg kg-1 body weight\nof the extract.\n||Normal rats chow and 3600 mg kg-1 body weight\nof the extract.\n|| Normal rats chow and 4500 mg kg-1 body weight\nof the extract.\nThis research was carried out in the Small Animal Laboratory of Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto, Nigeria in June/July 2006.\nSub-Acute Toxicity Studies\nThe rats were treated orally with pulp extract with the aid of a blunt end cannula\ndaily for 28 days. The control group was given distilled water of corresponding\nvolume with the largest volume of the extract administered. They were allowed\nfree access to feed and water. They were observed for acute toxicity signs like\nbehavioral changes and death over 24 h period.\nBlood samples were collected via cardiac punctured and transferred into\ntwo sample bottles one with anticoagulant for haematological analysis and the\nother in plain labeled dry sample bottles for biochemical analysis.\nMarkers/Indices of Toxicity\nAspartate Amino Transferase (AST)\nAST was measured according to the method of Reitman and Frankel (1957) as\ndescribed by Sini et al. (2006) by monitoring the concentration of oxaloacetate\nhydrazone formed with 2, 4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine. The maximum absorbance at\n546 nm is proportional to the concentration of AST in the sample.\nAlanine Amino Transferase (ALT)\nALT was measured according to the method of Reitman and Frankel (1957) as\ndescribed by Sini et al. (2006) by monitoring the concentration of pyruvate\nhydrazone formed with 2, 4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine which absorbs maximally at\n546 nm with the absorbance proportional to the concentration of ALT in the sample.\nAlkaline Phosphatase Determination\nAlkaline phosphatase was determined according to the method of King and\nArmstrong (1980). Alkaline phosphatase is measured by monitoring the concentration\nof phosphate formed with p-nitro phenyl phosphate that absorbs maximally at\nThe colorimetric method of Sini et al. (2006) was adopted. Direct\n(conjugated) Bilirubin reacts with diazotised sulphanic acid in alkaline medium\nto form a blue color complex with maximum absorbtion at 546 nm. The intensity\nof the color is proportional to the conjugated Bilirubin in the sample. The\ntotal Bilirubin is determined in the presence of caffeine, which releases albumin\nbound bilirubin by the reaction with diazotised sulphanic acid that absorbs\nmaximally at 578 nm. The absorbance is proportional to the concentration of\ntotal bilirubin in the sample.\nThis was determined according to the method of Grant (1987) based on the\nquantitative binding to the indicator bromocresol (BCG). The albumin-BCG-complex\nabsorbs maximally at 578 nm the absorbance is directly proportional to the concentration\nof albumin in the sample.\nTotal Protein Determination\nThis was determined using the method of Kumar et al. (2004). Cupric\nion reacts with proteins in alkaline solution to form a purple complex. The\nabsorbance of this complex is proportional to the protein in the sample.\nHaematological Parameters Determination\nThe determination of Pack Cell Volume (PCV) was by the micro-hematocrit\nmethod, Whole Blood Count (WBC), lymphocytes, nuetrophils, monocytes, eosinophils\nand basophils were determined using improved Neubauer hemocytometer counting\nchamber as described by Dacie and Lewis (1991).\nHistopathology examinations were carried out on the liver (site for biotransformation)\nand kidney (site for excretion) from the rats. They were fixed in 10% formalin\nsolution. Thin cryostat sections were stained and examined under light microscope\nat high (x 400 objective) power magnification.\nData collected in the study were expressed as means±SEM and subjected\nto analysis of variance (ANOVA) for accessing statistical significance.\nEffects of Aqueous Pulp Extract of T. indica on Hematological Indices\nTable1 shows the effects of the pulp extract haematological\nindices. There was no significant difference in the haematological parameters\nof the treated such as PCV, WBC, Lymphocytes and Monocytes of all the different\nconcentrations of the extract administered as compared with the control. Although\nthere was a significant increase in nuetrophils in group 3 (p<0.05) and group\n4 (p<0.01) while decrease in eosinophils at group 4 (p<0.05) and group\nEffects of Aqueous Pulp Extract of T. indica on Toxicity Markers\nThe results of the sub-acute toxicity study of Tamarindus indica pulp extract shown in Table 2 indicates no fatality in the acute toxicity tests in animals given 900-4500 mg kg-1 body weight of the extract, although the rats given higher doses (2700-4500 mg kg-1 body weight) exhibited some behavioral changes such as scratching of the body, mouth and head parts, anorexia, sensitive to slight sound and restlessness about 10-15 min after oral administration of the extract. The total protein, Albumin, Serum bilirubin, AST and ALT were not significantly different from that of the control. Serum alkaline phosphate increased in treated groups though not significantly compared to the control.\nEffects of Aqueous Pulp Extract of T. indica on Histopathology\nHistopathological examinations of liver and kidney in Fig.\n1-4 revealed no visible changes on the liver and kidney\nof the rats administered between 900-4500 mg kg-1 body weight orally\nof aqueous pulp extract of T. indica.\n|| Effects of aqueous pulp extract of T. indica extract\non hematological indices\n|*: p<0.05 when compared with control, **: p<0.01 when\ncompared with the control, NP: Not Present\n|| Effect of T. indica pulp extract on the blood chemistry\n||Histopathological slides 1 (liver of control)\n||Histopathological slides 2 (liver of group\n6 given 4500 mg kg-1 of extract orally) (x 400)\n||Histopathological slides 3 (kidney of control) (x 400)\n||Histopathological slides 4 (kidney of group\n6 given 4500 mg kg-1 of extract orally) (x 400)\nPhysical examination of the intestines shows no apparent congestion or hemorrhage\nin the gastro intestinal tract.\nThe PCV is used as an index of anemia and measures the rates at which red cells are added to and withdrawn from circulation by synthesis and breakdown respectively. Simultaneous measurement of the total and differential leukocyte counts, are of value in confirming or eliminating a tentative diagnosis and aid in making a more accurate prognosis (Coles, 1986). In the present study, there was no significant difference in the haematological parameters of the treated groups such as PCV, WBC, Lymphocytes and Monocytes as compared with the control, however there were significant differences in nuetrophils and eosinophils of some groups as compared to control.\nIn tissues, the principle function of nuetrophilic granulocytes is phagicytosis of small particle. These functions are primarily that of matured segmented nuetrophils (although metamyelocyte and band nuetrophils have some phagocytic ability) and are associated with inflammatory conditions found in large numbers in tissue infected with pyogenic microorganisms such as staphylococci, streptococci and corynebacteria. In addition to their phagocytic capabilities, nuetrophils elaborate powerful proteolytic enzymes that react within the cell to destroy phagocytosed particles or may be liberated and function outside the cell body (Coles, 1986). Significant increase in nuetrophils in group 3 (p<0.05) and group 4 (p<0.01) may be attributed to the changes in the number of circulating nuetrophils as a result of systemic infection, localized infection or non infectious disease usually those that stimulate a stress reaction (included in this category are metabolic disturbance, drugs and toxic chemicals). Also tissue destruction, irrespective of its cause, will produce an increased in number of circulating nuetrophils (Coles, 1986).\nEosinophils plays a role in fighting viral infections (which is evident from the abundance of RNAses they contain within their granules), helminth (worm) colonization, allergic response, fibrin removal in inflammation, disease severity and are considered the main effector cells in asthma pathogenesis. Eosinophils may be slightly elevated in the presence of certain parasites (Lee and Lee, 2005). An increase in eosinophils (eosinophilia) is typical with parasitic infestation of the intestines, a collagen vascular disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis), malignant diseases such as Hodgkin's Disease, extensive skin diseases (such as exfoliative dermatitis), Addison's Disease and with the use of certain drugs such as penicillin (Wills and Karp, 2004). Eosinophilia in the control group could be a reflection of hypersensitivity in parasitic conditions or allergic reactions (such as asthma, urticaria, dermatitis and food allergies etc.) or in the recovery stage of some acute infection. Since there was no apparent disorder such as dermatitis or asthma, this increase in eosinophils can be attributed to parasitic infection especially as there was no initial antihelmentic medication prior to the start of the experiment. Decrease in eosinophils of the pulp extract treated groups especially at group 4 (p<0.05) and group 5 (p<0.01) could be the result of the anti allergic properties of the plant extract as compared to that of the control. Another possible cause of eosinopenia in these treated groups could be stress (Coles, 1986; Lee and Lee, 2005).\nPlasma proteins are the most readily obtainable protein available in the animal and also occupy a central and dominant position in the metabolism of protein because of their intimate relation to metabolism in the liver and their interactions with other tissues in the body (Coles, 1986). This close relationship of plasma proteins can be used to examine specific biochemical functions and the general status of the bodys protein metabolism. The result of this study indicated that there was no significant (p<0.05) alteration in both serum total protein and albumin of the pulp extract treated group as compared to the control respectively.\nSerum ALP and Bilirubin level on other hand are related to the function of hepatic cell. Increase in serum level of ALP is due to increased synthesis, in presence of increasing biliary pressure (Coles, 1986; Murugesh et al., 2005). Effective control of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin levels points towards improved secretory mechanism of the hepatic cell. The result of the effect of this extract on serum ALP and Bilirubin (Conjugated and Total) revealed no significant difference (p<0.05) between the treated and control group. This can also be supported by the report that T. indica is used in the treatment of bile disorders (Doughari, 2006). Slight elevated of serum ALP as shown in the treated groups could be as a result of cholestasis, regardless of the cause (Coles, 1986).\nThe determination of enzyme levels such as AST and ALT is largely used in the assessment of liver damage. Necrosis or membrane damage releases these enzymes into circulation and therefore can be measured in serum. High levels of AST indicate liver damage, such as that due to viral infection as well as cardiac infarction and muscle injury. ALT catalyses the conversion of alanine to pyruvate and glutamate and is released in a similar manner. Therefore, ALT is more specific to the liver and is thus a better parameter for detecting liver injury. Elevated levels of serum enzymes are indicative of cellular leakage and loss of functional integrity of cell membrane in the liver (Murugesh et al., 2005). In the present study, there was no significant difference (p<0.05) in the serum AST and ALT of the pulp extract treated groups as compared to that of the control though slight increase in the enzymes were seen in the control. Histopathological studies (Figure 1) showed no signs of visible lesion and physical examination of the intestines revealed there was no apparent congestion or any sign of hemorrhage. Conclusively, this might imply that the pulp extract of T. indica does not have effect on hepatic secretions, biochemical functions and enzyme activity respectively. This can also be supported by the report that T. indica is used in the treatment of bile disorders (Morton, 1987).\nThis is to our knowledge the first report on the effects of Tamarindus indica aqueous pulp extract on some hematological and toxicological indices. The absence of death at the highest dose of 4500 mg kg-1 could be an indication of some margin of safety."", 'Herbalism is probably the oldest, most tried and tested form of medicine in the world. The use of plants for medicinal purposes is an integral element of all cultures and has played a significant role in healing since prehistoric times.\nAlso known as phytomedicine or botanical medicine, herbalism refers to the use of a plant’s seeds, berries, roots, leaves, bark, fruits or flowers for therapeutic purposes. Not only is herbal medicine the science of using plants for treating the sick and managing various conditions from minor health complaints to serious illnesses, it is also the art of utilising nature’s medicine to protect and augment health and prolong life. Herbal lore is like a priceless treasure chest and knowledge of the healing power inherent in plants has been passed down by word of mouth from generation to generation.\nHerbs have a long and illustrious history. They were used extensively for healing by the ancient Greeks, Chinese, Indians, and Egyptians. There is some evidence of the Chinese use of herbs during the Shang dynasty circa 1 600 BC and the first known written record of herbal medicines was also found in China, dating back to 2 700 BC. Furthermore, ancient Egyptian papyrus writings described medicinal uses for plants, the Assyrian and Babylonian scribes wrote herbal recipes on clay tablets and indigenous African and Native American cultures have always been renowned for their herbal wisdom.\nWestern herbal medicine has its roots in the homespun practices of the British, Greek, and Roman traditions and can be traced back to the prominent physicians Hippocrates and Galen. The former, who lived 469 -377 BC in ancient Greece, is regarded as the Father of Modern Medicine. He wrote about 70 books on herbs, healing and holistic health, including a list of 400 herbs for common use and a book of 600 herbs that became the basis for many later books on this subject.\nIn the first century AD the Greek physician Dioscorides wrote the first comprehensive, illustrated book on herbal medicine – De Materia Medica – which included information on the preparation, properties and testing of herbs and became the basis for pharmaceutical and herbal writings until the 16th century. Herbal medicine spread rapidly throughout the Roman Empire and in 200 AD the herbal practitioner and surgeon, Galen, created a system for classifying illnesses and remedies. In the following centuries herbal medicine became largely the domain of monks who took on the task of translating Arabic and Roman herbal scripts and cultivating medicinal herb-gardens. In 1500 AD herbal medicine began to go mainstream when it was promoted by Henry VII, who initiated the introduction of Acts of Parliament that allowed herbalists to practise. One of the most famous herbalists of the time was Nicholas Culpepper, who wrote the herbal book for the layperson, The English Physician. He later wrote Complete Herbal – a highly popular, informative and comprehensive book that is still available and quoted today.\nA PARTIAL ECLIPSE\nIn the 19th century chemical analysis evolved, and scientists began extracting and modifying ingredients found in plants and identifying individual active constituents. This heralded the transition from raw herbs to synthetic pharmaceuticals. The discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in the 1930s ushered in the dawn of the antibiotic age. As developments in chemistry and fast-acting orthodox drugs increased in popularity, interest in herbs began to wane and herbal medicine faded into the background.\nThe pharmaceutical industry got under way in earnest from the 1950s. Pharmaceutical companies identified the active therapeutic principles of many plants, synthesised commercial analogues and patented new drugs. Many well-known pharmaceutical medications were originally derived from plants: for example, morphine comes from poppies, aspirin from willow bark and digoxin from foxglove. Today, approximately 25 percent of modern pharmaceuticals are derived from plants.\nHerbal medicine may have been temporarily eclipsed by the advent of modern pharmaceuticals, but it has recently experienced a resurgence in popularity and is again one of the fastest-growing health trends. The World Health Organisation estimates that 80 percent of the global population uses herbal medicine for some aspect of primary health care. While herbal medicine has always been widespread in developing countries, its popularity is now increasing in the West.\nAlthough the active ingredients of many plants have been isolated, imitated, refined and marketed as drugs, it is often the whole plant, not just the active ingredient, which has the beneficial action. This is because the plant’s constituents work synergistically to stimulate the body’s natural healing capacity.\nThe whole plant is often better than an isolated extract as the delicate balance of compounds within the plant is needed for best effect, as well as to reduce potential side-effects. Herbs work with the body instead of against the disease. Plants act in a variety of ways. They can be used for cleansing, eliminating and detoxifying, as well as for stimulating the body’s self-healing capacity and to boost immunity and resistance to disease.\nHerbal medicine involves the preparation of specific parts of various plants and the individual actions of these herbs range from mild to potent. Mild herbs have subtle effects and may have to be taken for weeks before their full effects are achieved. More potent herbs will have an immediate and powerful effect. The form and dose play important roles in action and safety.\nHerbs are available in many forms – as fresh or dried products, liquid or solid extracts, tablets, capsules, powders and tea bags. They are prepared either for consumption or for use on the skin in the form of creams, salves, oils, balms and ointments. Common preparations include teas, decoctions and tinctures. A tea, also known as an infusion, is made by adding boiling water to fresh or dried herbs and steeping them. Some roots, barks and berries need more forceful treatment to extract their ingredients and must be simmered into a decoction in boiling water for longer periods than teas. Tinctures are made by soaking a botanical in a solution of alcohol and water for some weeks and are used for concentrating and preserving plants.\nThe different forms have different strengths and different preparations vary in the relative amounts and concentrations of chemical extracted from the plant. For example, peppermint tea is safe to drink but peppermint oil is far more concentrated and can be toxic if used incorrectly. Whole herbs contain many ingredients that work together to produce a beneficial effect.\nHerbal medicine has been practised for healing. Many medicinal plants have highly beneficial therapeutic properties and can be used to treat a wide range of symptoms and diseases. While some people consult a trained medical herbalist or phytotherapist, most use herbal medicines to self-medicate for prevention or treatment of common ailments. A variety of herbal preparations is available over-the-counter in health shops, pharmacies and supermarkets.\nHerbs are ideal as a simple system of homecare for first aid, everyday ailments, the management of chronic conditions, strengthening the body and preventive treatment. There are many possible methods of using herbs for health. They can be taken internally as tablets, teas and tinctures or used externally in hand-baths, footbaths, skin washes, rubs, massage oils, eyebaths, compresses and fomentations. Local treatments allow the herb to act exactly where it is needed. Be aware that results from a particular plant will not necessarily be the same for everyone, as different herbs work for different people.\nNot all herbs are created equal and efficacy is based on quality. Quality depends on numerous factors, starting with the environment in which the plant is grown; climate, soil, rainfall, genetics, insects and the time of day and season of harvesting all play a part. Everything that happens to the plant after it is harvested – extraction, preparation, storage, processing, manufacture and packaging – will also affect the quality and therapeutic activity of the final product. If the herbal product contains specific chemical components it will work; if these essential constituents are absent or are present in insufficient amounts, it will not work as effectively.\nThere are good- and bad-quality herbal preparations available on the market. Some products are standardised – i.e. tested for certain chemicals to ensure the herbs are sufficiently potent. This process is not compulsory across the global industry, however, but pressure is mounting for all products to be compliant with Good Manufacturing Practises (GMPs) for dietary supplements. These are a set of requirements by which dietary supplements must be manufactured, prepared and stored to ensure quality. Manufacturers are expected to guarantee the identity, purity, strength and composition of their dietary supplements. For example, GMPs aim to prevent the inclusion of the wrong ingredients, the addition of too much or too little of a dietary ingredient or an illegal substance, the possibility of contamination (by pesticides, heavy metals, bacteria, etc.) and the improper packaging and labelling of a product.\nIt is difficult to determine the quality of a herbal product from its label, but it is a good rule of thumb to favour reputable brands. As herbal medicine becomes more mainstream, improvements in analysis and quality control – along with advances in clinical research – show the value of herbal medicine in the treatment and prevention of disease.\nHerbs must be recommended and taken with knowledge and responsibility. They are classified as dietary supplements and can be sold without being tested to prove that they are safe and effective. Many people believe that products labelled “natural” are safe, but this is not necessarily true because the safety of a herb depends on many things including its chemical makeup, how it works in the body, how it is prepared and the dose. The bioactivity of herbs is often underestimated.\nAlthough generally considered safe, it is important to be aware that herbal medicines contain active ingredients which can be toxic if taken in excess and can also interact with prescription medications. With the growing popularity of herbal products, more research is currently being conducted into their safety and efficacy. It is always important to follow the manufacturer’s suggested directions for using a herbal product and not exceed the recommended dose without the advice of a healthcare provider. It is important to talk to your doctor or an expert in herbal medicine about the recommended doses of any herbal products.\nConsumers need to be aware of the indications and contraindications of use for herbal products and specifically the interactions between herbal products and pharmaceutical medicines. However, herbs can be taken safely as long as a few simple rules are followed:\n- Consult a doctor or other healthcare provider if you have a disease or medical condition, take any medications, are pregnant or nursing, or are planning to have an operation.\n- Consult with a doctor or other healthcare provider before treating a child with herbal preparations.\n- Like drugs, herbal or botanical preparations have chemical and biological activity. They may have side-effects. They may interact with certain medications. These interactions can cause problems and can even be dangerous.\n- If you have any unexpected reactions to a herbal or botanical preparation, inform your doctor or other healthcare provider.\nUsed correctly, herbs can help treat a variety of conditions and in some cases may have fewer side-effects than some conventional medications.\nINTO THE FUTURE\nA worldwide renaissance in natural therapeutic systems is taking place and modern science is validating traditional practices. Renewed interest in herbs is being supported by a surge of scientific investigation into the use of plant-based medicines. These investigations are giving a greater understanding of how herbs work and greater credence to the ancient practise of herbal medicine.']"	['<urn:uuid:59515847-fd09-4360-81e0-ac70685e5c09>', '<urn:uuid:0523e373-587b-46f1-b9dd-b0647d934a0f>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T05:40:27.828877	25	79	4486
