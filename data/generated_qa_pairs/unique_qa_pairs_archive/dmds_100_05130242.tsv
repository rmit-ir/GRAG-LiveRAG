1	sustainable agriculture natural resources management methods importance describe	Sustainable agriculture relies heavily on proper management of natural resources, particularly soil and water. Critical aspects include the judicious use of manures and fertilizers to increase crop production per unit area, while maintaining soil health through organic matter that improves physical, chemical, and biological soil properties. Regular soil testing and analysis helps determine optimal nutrient levels and pH values. Protection measures include various biological, physical, and chemical approaches such as crop rotation, proper drainage, and appropriate irrigation systems. The importance of these practices is magnified by the need to protect natural resources for future generations while meeting current food production demands. These management methods help ensure optimal crop yields while preserving environmental sustainability and soil fertility for long-term agricultural success.	"[""India is a global player in coal mining, in order tosustain, it requires developing a Green miningtechnology. All mining operations in India involve continuous use of explosives, thereby generatinghigh noise level, vibration and shock and very highlevel of dust pollution. Today all-overs world minesare facing one of the major problems of dustpollutions which not only affects the health of theminers but also makes the condition quite explosivewhen the mine is degree-II or Degree-III in gassiness,The same concern has also been shown by The President of India in his Inaugural Address at the “19th World Mining Congress & Expo 2003, in New Delhi, India”. According to the Pocket Book of Labour Statistics 2006, Ministry of Labour, Government of India it has been found that number of industrial injuries in coal mines are much more than the total injuries of other mines. It is also observed that the fatalities rate is much higher in underground mines than that of open cast mines. Out of the many factors one of the major causes of the accident is the fire. This book deals with the feasibility study and development of waterjet cutting technology for Indian coal mines.\nIndian banking system has well developed organization in the country. Entrepreneurs and creative thinker were established the most of the banks in India. In the pre –independence era, they provided financial support to the farmers, business community, traders and industrialists in India. At present, largest commercial bank in the country is State Bank of India. . Banking sector in India has seen lots of positive developments in the last decade. The policy makers in India have made lot of efforts to improve the regulation in the banking sector. The banking sector evaluates positive results in growth, profitability, non- performing assets, credit risk and funds management. In this scenario, some of the banks have recognized innovation and growth aspects. Banking industry in India has to strengthen them to support to the Indian economy.\nThe book caters to educators and students of economics in broad and to energy economics in specific. Those interested in understanding the role of energy chain must read this work for assessing the future of natural gas in developing nations like India. Natural gas being relatively clean form of energy never got its due in the developing economies energy literature. The fuel plays a vital role in this transitional era from coal-oil to green energy.\nAn agro-climatic study was conducted to assess the vulnerability of winter rice (boro) production in Bangladesh to potential climate change. Effect of climate change on yield of two varieties of boro rice has been assessed using the DSSAT (v4) modeling system. The yield of BR3 and BR14 boro varieties for the years 2008, 2030, 2050 and 2070 have been simulated for 12 locations of Bangladesh, which were selected from among the major rice growing areas in different regions of Bangladesh. Available data on soil and hydrologic characteristics of these locations, and typical crop management practice for boro rice were used in the simulations. The weather data required for the model (daily maximum and minimum temperatures, daily solar radiation and daily precipitation) were generated for the selected years and for the selected locations using the regional climate model PRECIS. The model predicted significant reduction in yield of both varieties of boro rice due to climate change; yield reductions of over 20% and 50% have been predicted for both rice varieties for the years 2050 and 2070, respectively.\nThe poor quality groundwater may prove a valuable natural resource in arid and semi-arid regions, if used with suitable technologies. This book provides an ample technique and up-to-date references about the response of wheat to organic and inorganic soil amendments under irrigation with high residual sodium carbonate water. This book will be useful to the students and researchers of crop production and environmental sciences as well as to the natural resource planners and managers, especially of developing nations.\nSocial ecology is basically a manifestation of social system funtion comprising of structural characteristics and functional disposition. Tea gardens in India are representing unique social-ecologial behaviour and it has been more conspicuous with the advent of global warming and climate change. This unique social ecology has been a subject to withdrawl of biodiversity, erosion of physical natural bases and relentless anthropogenic activities. The book is a rare academic cultivation in the area of ecological networking by statistically designing the spill and grid effect of intra and inter ecological performances.It is unique to observe that with the change in rainfall pattern, as perceived by different tea garden stakeholders,the pattern of livelihood generation and other economic activities pertaining to this social ecology have been affected.The general social science researches are mainly confined to analysing and estimating socio-economic variables and,on contrary,this book retains a well readable research document on combined effect of socio-economic interaction with the bio-physical counterpart of the same ecological setup.Thus the book is a great creation in Social Ecology.\nOur nature is provided with lot of natural sources which is beneficial to the human kind. Protecting these natural sources is very much important and is also necessary to pass for the next generations.The book covers 147 plant species which are available freely in the surroundings. In the System(s) of medicine, these medicinal plants apart from Ayurveda can be also used in Folk, Siddha, Homeopathy and Unani, as a natural and permanent cure against human diseases. Much research has to be conducted in future such as Isolation of compounds, Medicinal chemistry, Biodiversity, PhytoInformatics, PalynoInformatics, antimicrobial studies, Tissue culture, Design of Markers, DNA fingerprinting, Metabolic studies, Genetics, Genomic and Proteomic studies, Phylogenetic analysis, Formulation of media, Food Science and Technology, Bionanotechnology, Biodiesel and Biofuels, Biofouling, Bioremediation, Biopesticides, Data mining, Quality and resistant food products, etc. These technologies should focus on developing human health and living habits of other living species that can be transformed to the future generations.\nAn Early Neolithic Village in the Jordan Valley Part II, the Fauna of Netiv Hagdud\nAmong the various practices, judicious use of manures and fertilizers as one of the important strategies for increasing production of rice per unit area. The integrated use of organic manures with inorganic fertilizers can help to maintain optimum crop yield and required soil nutrient pool on sustained basis. The contribution of organic manure is to be judged not only in terms of nutrient contribution, but also by their role in building up of nutrient reserves in soil and increasing organic matter level of soil which ultimately improves physical, chemical and biological properties of soil and it is most critical in the context of sustainable agriculture. General acceptance of organic farming is not only due to greater demand for pollution free food but also due to natural advantage of organic farming in supporting the sustainability in agriculture. The essence of practicing organic farming lies in the use of naturally available resources like organic wastes, predators, parasites in conjunction with natural processes like decomposition, biological fixation and resistance to achieve the needs of crop production.\nSix different agro-industrial waste residues (rice straw, rice bran, corn flakes, wheat bran, wheat flakes, and grinded wheat kernel) were procured from the local market. These substrates (10 g) were moistened (1:1) with different moistening agents (distilled water, tap water, mineral salts solution (FeSO4.7H2O 0.02, MgSO4.7H2O 1.0, (NH4)2SO4 4.0, KH2PO4 0.6, K2HPO4 1.4 mg/gds at pH 5), 0.1 N HCl, sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5) and screened for the production of 1,4-?- D-glucan glucohydrolase for 96 hours in static cultures. The substrate and moistening agent that gave maximum enzyme production were selected and their fermentation conditions were further optimized. The levels of selected solid substrate, moistening agent and fermentation conditions such as pH, temperature, time of incubation, inoculum size etc. were optimized by one variable at a time method. Aspergillus oryzae IIB-6 was found to be a good producer of 1,4-?-D-glucan glucohydrolase in wheat bran medium containing mineral salts as an additional trace elements so that it can be used for biotechnological purposes.\nThe Diversity and Distribution of Amphibian fauna in the Albertine Rift in the great lakes region of Africa is Dr. Behangana's attempt to put amphibian diversity on the map. It gives detailed account of amphibian distribution, abundance, endemism and richness in 15 forests for 73 out of 119 species documented in 26 sites of the Albertine Rift for which data has been compiled so far. Some aspects of amphibian ecology such as physical and biotic factors affecting amphibian distribution, habitat requirements and acoustics are also analysed. This book was written to give baseline information to herpetologists and other researchers intending do further research on amphibian fauna of the AR, for managers and other conservationists interested in knowing the current status of amphibians in the Albertine Rift.\nThe success of green revolution of 1960’s had resulted in India achieving self- sufficiency in food production system. Use of high yielding varieties, high analysis fertilizers, soil and water management practices had resulted in achievement of improved production and productivity. However, recent years had sow “plateauing of yield” in the agricultural production scenario. So with a raising population and fastly depleting natural resources, policy planners think of alternative production system which are eco-friendly, cheap, sustainable with improved productivity gains. Indigenous knowledge being evolved as age old treasures with a rich traditional wisdom remains as a best alternative. Keeping this in view a study was conducted to document the indigenous technical knowledge in coastal farming system of Tamil Nadu. The research was conducted in 12 coastal districts of Tamil Nadu. About 240 coastal farmers was selected using random sampling method. Pre-tested interview schedule was used for the data collection process. About 149 indigenous items of coastal areas were collected and rationalised.\nLeaf rust (Puccinia triticina Eriks and Henn.) is one of the most important diseases of wheat in Tigray region. Regular surveying,race analysis and searching resistant genes plays significant role to develop resistant varieties against leaf rust. Hence, this study was carried out to determine the distribution and intensity leaf rust, identify physiologic races and evaluate the reaction of commonly growing wheat varieties to virulent races of leaf rust. During the survey,108 farmers’ wheat fields and experimental plots were assessed in five districts of Southeastern Tigray, of which 95 (88%) of the fields were affected with leaf rust. The overall mean incidence and severity of the disease were 48.4 and 18.2%, respectively. According to the North American system of nomenclature for P.triticina, characterization of 40 mono pustules resulted in the identification of 22 races. The broadest virulence spectrum was recorded from TKTT race, making all Lr genes except Lr9 ineffective. The variety evaluation revealed that, Mekelle-3, Mekelle-4, Picaflor, Dashin and local showed susceptible reaction to TKTT, THTT and PHTT races.\nCredit is the lifeblood of modern economic system, in absence of which no system can survive. It acts as lubricating oil to swiftly move the wheels of economic development. In economic development of India, agriculture still forms the base, which is not away from the need of credit. Farmers need much more capital than they can afford to save. A number of policies have been made to infuse social responsibility in the formal financial institutions to extend credit to rural areas, and succeeded in establishing a vast network of financial institutions. But, quantitative progress at the cost of quality, high cost structure of operations in rural areas and mounting overdues became a threat to the viability of the financial institutions. Consequently, the policy of competitive financial system was adopted from 1991 onwards in the provision of agricultural credit to improve the viability of financial agencies which have positive as well as negative influences on the credit flow to agriculture. In this book an attempt has been made to examine the agricultural credit during pre and post-banking reforms in India."", 'The soil, as the primary resource for food production and the most important tool for every farmer, is crucial for farming. Successful farming begins with the quality soil, which provides water and essential nutrients to the crops. Rich and healthy soil, combined with the appropriate amount of water and sunlight can significantly contribute to global food production.\nProper soil management protects and enhances soil performance. It also reduces input costs, prevents pollution and improves yields and crop quality. Before planting, the soil should be in the best physical condition for the crop, to encourage rapid and successful root growth. Every farm and crop have different soil requirements, but there are a few common practices that could encourage healthy soil biology.\n1. Soil Analysis\nIn order to follow good practices for sustainable soil management, it’s essential that farmers regularly perform soil analysis. By testing their soil, farmers can see the exact amount of soil nutrients, humus content, and pH value. According to the content of nutrients in the soil and the crop requirements, it’s easy to determine the necessary amount of fertilizer, to achieve higher yields and fruit quality.\n2. Organic Fertilization\nOrganic matter consists of all living soil organisms and the previous living organisms in their various degrees of decomposition.\nThe formation and role of organic matter in the soil\nIt has a major role in soil management practices carried out before planting. Organic matter improves soil structure, enhances water and nutrient holding capacity, protects the soil from erosion and compaction, and supports a healthy community of soil organisms.\n3. Proper Tillage\nProper tillage practices and type can significantly improve the quality and performance of the crop. There are various tillage systems, depending on production type, soil condition, crop planted and farm practices. The following picture summarizes tillage operations for both conventional and conservation tillage.\nTillage systems used for crop production\nConventional tillage is full-width tillage which disturbs the whole soil structure and includes various tillage operations before and after crop planting. On the other hand, the reduced and no-till tillage systems minimize soil disturbance and maintains a high level of surface residue.\n4. Biological, Physical and Chemical Soil Protection Measures\nIn order to manage plant pests, farmers apply different protection measures: crop rotation, crop isolation, tillage, mixed farming, proper planting time, organic soil coverage and barriers, mulching, row maintenance in orchards, green manure, chemical and natural soil and plant treatments.\n5. Proper Drainage and Irrigation\nIt is important to ensure good soil drainage as well as optimum humidity for young plants. Soils with less drainage may accumulate higher amounts of water than is needed and thus negatively affect seeds or young plants. On fields where the water is insufficient, irrigation is required. Immediately after planting and during the first stages, irrigation is the crucial farm practice. By following these practices, farmers can adjust the water needs according to the crop requirements.\nWithout fertile and nutrient enriched soil, farmer’s efforts in farming would be futile. As a person involved in the food production process, a farmer needs to understand soil requirements and to follow good practices before planting. In addition to these five main practices, Agrivi software can also help farmers to get the best out of their fields. With Agrivi, farmers can plan their crop rotation, keep soil analysis records and follow all their tasks, including tillage, fertilization, pest protection and irrigation. The software also guides you on how to prepare the soil for planting by giving you best practice processes in the form of tasks for over 80 different crops, for all types of production.']"	['<urn:uuid:9c712e32-7e7f-440d-a928-59bfbe16a990>', '<urn:uuid:b5379e6f-1e60-4830-90bc-6735db2b25cb>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	8	120	2567
2	exercise benefits muscle loss women age fifty metabolism weight benefits	For women over 50, muscle loss becomes significant, with 15% loss per decade between 50-70. This affects metabolism, as each pound of lost muscle reduces calorie burning by 50 calories per day. However, regular strength training combined with aerobic exercises like walking can combat this, improving metabolism, increasing bone density, and promoting weight loss. Group fitness classes can help burn 400-650 calories per session while providing accountability and support.	['The Best Aerobic Exercises for Women for Weight Loss After 50\nFor women over 50, there are different needs and obstacles as compared to a woman who is in her 20s. These reasons affect the type of exercise you may be willing to participate in as an individual. Weight loss may be more challenging as a woman over 50, but not impossible. Changes in diet and portion control will compliment the weight loss effort. However, aerobic exercise activity is the best way to motivate weight loss.\nBy far one of the most popular forms of aerobic exercise, walking can be performed either indoors on a treadmill or outdoors. Walking is often preferred for women over 50 because of its low injury rate, simple style and ability to adapt into most schedules. Little or no equipment is needed to get started. Supportive and comfortable walking shoes and clothing appropriate for the weather conditions will make your walk more enjoyable and safe. Set your walk at a slower pace until you are ready to increase to the next level. As you develop more aerobic stamina and endurance, increase your pace with a longer stride in your walk. Depending on your pace, you can burn anywhere between 250 to 350 calories in a 60 minute walk. Known as a weight bearing exercise, walking can increase bone health for menopausal women over 50.\nGroup Fitness Classes\nWomen over 50 can enjoy the fun and support of being part of a group that exercises each week. There are several types of group fitness classes -- dance exercise, water aerobics, spinning, and chair exercise are some examples. Aerobic training in these classes help to promote weight loss. Depending upon the intensity and length of the class, you could possibly burn between 400 to 650 calories. As menopausal women over 50 tend to gain fat around their mid-sections, it can be good to have other women of the same age around for accountability and support. Participation in a group fitness class at least four times a week would generate weight loss for those women wanting to lose some extra pounds.\nInterval or Circuit Training\nLoss of bone mineral density can be an issue for some women over 50. Weight bearing exercises can increase bone mass, strengthen the body and promote weight loss. Interval or circuit training alternates periods of high intensity work with periods of low intensity work. Hand weights, resistance bands, medicine balls, weight equipment and other fitness accessories can be used for periods of interval or circuit training. The use of these fitness accessories can build muscle mass and increase the amount of calories burned during the day.\nBefore starting an exercise program, consult with your physician or health care provider. Stay well hydrated with water while exercising and drink plenty of water throughout your day. In addition to exercise for weight loss, eat less high fat foods and more fruits and vegetables with your meals. Eat five to six planned small meals throughout your day to combat hunger and avoid overeating. If you ever feel lightheaded or dizzy while exercising, stop and contact your physician.\n- American Council on Exercise Exercise for Older Adults: Physiology of Aging and Exercise: W.J. Chodzko-Zajko\n- American Council on Exercise Exercise for Older Adults: Older Adults Exercise Techniques: J. Clark\n- ACEFitness: Six Strategies for Losing the Spare Tire\n- ACEFitness: Is It True That Metabolism Decreases With Age?\n- Barry Austin/Digital Vision/Getty Images', '“She girds herself with strength, and strengthens her arms“. Proverbs 31:17\nAs we have seen in a previous post, a sedentary lifestyle is a health threat that worsens many medical conditions and leads to premature death in both men and women. Hopefully, this fact motivates you to start moving a little more. I have only become a regular exerciser in the last few years. I never really did it before, maybe off and on, because I just don’t like to exercise.😰 I now realize I was foolish in that respect. According to Vonda Wright, (an orthopedic surgeon and director of a program for senior athletes) it is a myth that we are destined to become frail as we age. However, being inactive will make it more likely to happen. Walking and doing cardio activities are great to get our hearts pumping and our bodies moving, but that’s not enough! We need to be strength training as well. Miriam Nelson states that adding strength to your cardio should be non-negotiable, especially if you are over 40.\nAccording to Marilyn Diamond, in her book Young for Life, after age 30, we start to lose muscle mass. This begins even earlier if we have a sedentary lifestyle. This is called sarcopenia. Dr. Wright states that we lose 15% of muscle mass each decade between 50-70 and 30% after age 70.\nThe loss of muscle is one factor that leads to premature aging. We feel weaker, our muscles stiffen, and we don’t have the endurance we once had. When our daily tasks become more difficult, we do less. Our bodies adjust to the lower activity and we become weaker.\nReduced muscle mass causes the joints to do most of the work risking damage to the joint.\nOur metabolism slows down, giving us less energy and more weight. We replace muscle with fat.\nOur muscles also become infiltrated with fat between our muscle fibers, like the marbling on beef. Nice on a steak, but not on us.\nOur posture becomes poor, because of weak neck and trunk muscles.\nWeaker leg muscles cause poorer balance, leading to falls.\nAs we age we also lose bone density, leading to osteoporosis. After age 40 women lose bone twice as fast as men. The most critical time is the first five years after menopause. Oh, by the way, men lose bone density too. Just not as fast as menopausal women.\nThe biggest influence on weight gain in menopause in not hormonal, it is the loss of muscle mass. According to Pamela Peeke, for every pound of muscle lost through disuse, a woman loses the ability to burn 50 calories per day. She state that a 1992 study showed that women who do not strength train lose 7 pounds of muscle every ten years and a reduced metabolism equal to 350 calories per day. Another study showed that this is NOT observed in women who exercise regularly.\nCardio and walking won’t make us strong. We need more.\nBENEFITS OF STRENGTH TRAINING\n- become stronger\n- improve balance\n- more energy\n- lose weight\n- boost metabolism\n- increased mobility\n- beneficial for high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease\n- increase bone density. Not many participating in weight bearing sports get osteoporosis\n- aerobic and strengthening exercises are effective for chronic arthritis\n- easier to move\n- lose inches not pounds\n- protects your joints- by strengthening muscles around them\n- make aerobic exercise more enjoyable, because stronger muscles make it easier to do\n- lift depression\n- sleep better\n- reduced risk of bone fractures\n- reduction of symptom severity in fibromyalgia\n- reduces arthritic knee pain\n- improved glucose control\n- increased self confidence\n- feel younger\nBUT I”M TOO OLD OR SICK TO START…\nNo you’re not.\nIt’s never too late to start exercising. Age doesn’t matter, you can improve at any age. Consider this- physical therapist, Marilyn Moffat, states in one study, men and woman over the age 90 achieved a 200% increase in strength after only 6 weeks on an exercise plan. The weaker you are the more you need it. You are not doomed to be weak and dependent as you age.\nA study by William Evans and Maria Fitatarone took 10 nursing home patients between the ages of 86-96 with a least two serious chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Most of them needed walkers or canes and some couldn’t get up from a chair without help. They were taken three times a week to lift weights (at an appropriate starting point and slowly increasing) for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks they increased their strength by 175%. Their walking speed improved by almost 50%. Two didn’t even need their canes anymore. Cool.😎\nRead that paragraph again. I don’t know who you are, but I would venture to say you are healthier than a 90 year old in a nursing home, no?\nResearch has shown that men and women with health conditions are often helped the most by exercise programs that include strength training. It is beneficial even if you are not in great health.\nAt age 95, Jack LaLanne, who was considered a crackpot for his views on fitness, stated that while he wasn’t as strong or nimble as his younger days, he didn’t feel any different than he did at 25. He was still working out everyday at 95. He was mocked for the idea that people would pay money to go exercise. His ideas aren’t so weird anymore. 😕\nYou don’t need to spend lots of money or even join a gym. Of course, you can if you want to. This is all my equipment above, just an assortment of dumbbells. You can do so much with them. I also have some DVDs which give me some variety to keep it interesting. As always, there are fun activities that build muscle as well, such as rock climbing, heavy gardening, certain yoga moves, anything that engages your muscles in a strenuous way.\nThe amount of weight to start with is a trial and error process. Use weights that are challenging. You might even have to start with just your body weight. Lift 70-80% of your maximum weight. Your maximum is the weight you can only do 8 repetitions of. Lifting more than that risks injury and less than that is not effective. If you are over 50, start with a weight that allows 20 reps. If it is not challenging, you will not receive any benefit from it. You need to graduate beyond soup cans.\nMuscles work in pairs, you must work both parts of the set, to avoid injury. Don’t work your biceps without working your triceps.\nLower your weights slowly for most development. We have fast and slow muscle fibers, for strength and endurance. For slow-twitch muscle fibers do lower weight with more repetitions. Abs are slow-twitch. For fast-twitch muscles use higher weight with less reps. Thighs are fast-twitch.\nUse safety measures to avoid injury. I discuss safety here.\nBe sure to check with your doctor before you start any exercise program. If you have an injury or pain, don’t avoid exercising, find out from a physical therapist how to exercise differently. Also keep in mind that soreness and pain aren’t same. You may experience soreness, but you shouldn’t experience pain.']	['<urn:uuid:4c825e58-cdee-404b-b238-d42ba638c363>', '<urn:uuid:261e7c2e-b928-4c88-be2a-3eefa8ec6b81>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	10	69	1798
3	smell of burning rubber alternator vs generator noise levels comparison	An alternator and a generator have different warning signs when they malfunction. For an alternator, a burning rubber smell can occur when it's overworked, caused by misaligned pulleys creating friction and heat. As for generators, their noise levels vary - conventional generators produce over 80 decibels, while modern inverter generators operate at much quieter levels between 47-70 decibels, with many models running at around 60 decibels, which is comparable to normal conversation.	['An alternator is a machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. It is found in every car, and most of the alternators use a magnetic field rotating with a stationary armature.\nIn a car, the alternator works with the battery to charge the car’s electrical systems. A bad alternative will have a lot of effects on the car in multiple ways.\nThere are many ways in which you can find out if your alternator is going bad, and the top signs of alternative problems are as follows:\nThe most obvious sign will be the warning light indicator built in the latest cars to signal an alternator issue. Some people might confuse this warning with a battery problem, but this is not really why the light is on. The light in the car system monitors the output of the alternator.\nThe dash light comes on as and when the alternator’s output goes above or below the preset limit. The light will remain and let till this output returns back to the range. In the early stages of the problem, light may flicker or light up only when the car’s accessories are activated. The alternator needs to work properly to meet the car’s needs. If the alternator is not working properly, it will not meet the other demands.\nThe alternator helps supply the electrical need of the car, and as and when it begins to lose its power, the accessories of the car also stop working properly. The car may start to experience symptoms like the dimming of the lights or, on the contrary, extremely bright headlights. The speedometer might also stop working for no reason.\nHowever, the working of the accessories depends on the priority list that is pre-programmed by the manufacturers. It might also happen that other accessories stop working before the dimming of the lights or vice versa. Such problems act as a clear indicator that your alternator is running poorly as your accessories are not getting the power they need to function properly.\nA car that is not starting is a definite sign that the system has a problem though it might not technically be an alternative problem. On turning the key, you can click on the start button. However, this won’t lead to the starting of the car. Even after the noise stops, the car cannot start, which indicates a dead battery.\nWhen the alternator begins to fail, the car’s battery acts as the capacitor for the system. But, no matter how good the battery is, it will eventually run down. Car batteries cannot last long as they are only designed to provide the car with enough power to start the motor. Hence, a dying alternator might lead to killing the car‘s battery even though there was nothing wrong with the battery in the first place. It is easier to detect a dead battery compared to a dead alternator. The battery can be tested with a voltmeter.\nIf you cannot detect a feeling alternator by looking, then the sound might act as a sign. There might often be complaints about hearing a whining noise before the alternator is dying. The alternator is driven by the help of an accessory belt in conjunction with the police.\nThe alternator pulley spins two or three times to produce the necessary power. If the pulley is not correctly aligned with the belt, then the bearings are worn out, which will lead to the growling noise that will help you detect the problem. If the alternator is so poor that it damages your engine, then that is the worst-case scenario that can be caused, and it is very difficult and inconvenient to keep the car going until the problem is fixed.\nSmell is also a very important sign that the alternator is in trouble. It often indicates that the alternator is working very hard that it reaches the point of overheating. An overworked alternator smells like an electrical fire. The scent can be caused by the overheated alternator that is pushing too much power. And also be through the burning rubber ducky the alternator going.\nA pulley that is not aligned will cause friction that will create heat and hence the smell. However, not all the bad smells are indicators of alternator trouble. Still, strange smells coming from the car indicate getting the car checked out to take precautions towards any problems that may arise.\nRegular Stalling or Difficulty in Starting the Car\nIf you are having difficulty starting the car, there might be other reasons why it’s happening. However, it is important to keep in mind that your alternator might be in trouble. If you experience stalling after the car has started, it means that the plugs might not be getting the power it needs from the alternator to keep the engine going. This can indicate that the battery is not entirely dead but might die soon.\nThe above indicators are important to find out if your alternator has gone bad. A car might run with a bad alternator but only for a short period, and hence it is safer to fix the problem at the earliest to avoid bigger problems in the future.', 'Generally speaking, the generator is a useful machine that provides a powerful source of energy. These machines have been around for more than one hundred years. Fortunately, the generator has gone through its own evolution of sorts, now available in a lighter, compact design that still packs the type of power the generator is known for.\nModern generators are also much quieter than they were just five or ten years ago. These newer models of generators are described as whisper quiet and can be used where loud, conventional generators cannot. But what is a quiet generator DB levels? Most inverter generators already have a reputation as the leading choice for RV’ing and camping, mainly because they’re much easier to haul and transport compared to conventional generators, and they’re more fuel efficient. But aside from the fact that these generators are cheaper to run and easier to use, they’re also considered the quietest generators around. If you plan on using a generator in a public space, then you need a model that’s designed for whisper-quiet operation. That’s where the camp generator comes in.\nWhat is quiet generator DB levels? Forty-seven up to seventy decibels. The inverter generator is known as the quietest generator on the market, known widely for its quiet operation and its ability to safely charge and power sensitive electronics including laptops and smartphones. Of course, the noise level of the inverter generator can depend on engine speed and what you’re powering or charging. But, ultimately, the inverter generator will provide a much quieter operation compared to conventional generators, which is why they’re such a popular choice for camping and RV’ing.\nA generator’s noise level can depend on many factors, which is why you have to pay close attention to a spec sheet to learn what a machine’s noise level rating is, based on power load. Most models of camp generators still have a much lower than average power rating, even with a full load.\nNow that you know what type of noise rating to look for when you’re shopping for a new generator, read on to learn more about why this generator offers a whisper-quiet operation, what makes the inverter generator so different than conventional generators, and what they’re commonly used for.\nHow Quiet is Quiet?\nWhat is a quiet generator? It’s a generator that you can switch on and still carry a conversation. It’s a model that won’t disrupt your environment, and a model you can use in public and not violate a noise ordinance. If you’ve ever camped at a federal campground, then you’ll notice they have strict rules regarding decibel ratings, which is why you can’t use a conventional generator in this type of environment.\nWith this in mind, many campers have turned to inverter generators as the perfect option for use in public places. But how powerful are these generators really, and what can they be used for?\nGenerators can be used as a back-up power source in the event of an emergency, they can supply power when no other power source is available, and they can be invaluable when you’re traveling across country or camping. These portable generators are often relied upon when disaster strikes. When an inverter generator is on hand, you can have electricity, anywhere, anytime, when it’s needed the most.\nFor years, the biggest complaint surrounding generators was how loud they are. The sound of the loud engine was enough to cause most types of generators to be prohibited from use in certain public spaces such as federal parks.\nFinding a quiet running generator is now easier than ever before, thanks to the rise of the inverter generator.\nA More Reliable Power Source\nHow does the inverter generator measure up to the conventional generator? Are inverter generators better?\nConventional generators have a bad rap for their fluctuating levels of power and power surges. Power surges can be harmful to certain types of devices, such as sensitive electronics. They can actually damage these devices beyond repair. Sensitive devices include smartphones, tablets, and laptops.\nOut of any type of generator, the camp generator provides the most stable power output. This is due to the generator’s inverter technology. Unlike a large, traditional generator, the camp generator is able to create more than three hundred sine waves per engine rotation. The AC power is then converted into DC power, then inverted back to AC power.\nSo, what does that mean exactly?\nThis process means you’ll enjoy consistent, pure power with no power surges. This is why it’s safe to charge and run sensitive electronics such as smartphones and laptops.\nThe quiet-running operation is one of the biggest benefits this type of generator offers. Because of the smaller engine combined with the generator’s compact design, it’s able to run at a much lower volume compared to any other type of generator on the market. The ability to run at varying output levels is another noise reduction feature. When you’re powering up a larger appliance, the power level can be increased. For smaller devices, the power level and engine speed can be decreased. This decrease in power results in a quieter operation. Most inverter generators are able to recognize when more power is needed and can actually increase or even decrease engine speed, automatically.\nThe inverter’s housing should take most of the credit for the generator’s quiet running operation. These generators are made out of sound attenuating, insulated materials that work to absorb most of the noise that’s produced by the generator’s engine. This is why the camp generator is the best power source for use in residential areas and campsites.\nAny generator with automatic voltage regulation technology will run at a low noise level. Most models with this feature will run at the seventy-decibel mark, which is why they’re a popular option for the workplace, or backup power, when running sensitive equipment is required.\nIf you’re familiar with inverter generators, then you’ve heard they’re the quietest type of generator on the market. Some of the leading models will have a decibel rating of just fifty-eight when at the lowest power setting and up to sixty-two to sixty-seven decibels at full rated output. Both decibel ratings are much quieter than the volume at a grocery store or a loud conversation. As an example, speech at a normal volume is around sixty decibels, while the average vacuum has a decibel rating of seventy. On a busy city street, the decibel rating is around eighty to one hundred.\nSo, even at full output, the inverter generator is incredibly quiet.\nThe decibel rating for generators can vary from model to model. You may come across a generator that only emits forty-seven decibels on the lowest setting and another model that has a seventy-five-decibel rating. The amount of noise a generator produces is heavily dependent on its housing design, engine power and even the conditions it’s used in.\nThese generators are currently the first choice for caravanning and camping. In fact, they’re often referred to as camp generators. Along with the fact that they’re compact and lightweight, they allow you to easily power all of your appliances, without causing a disruption on your quiet getaway.\nWhat About Conventional Generators?\nAs you can see, inverter generators are a better option if the noise level is more of a priority than overall power. That’s not to say the inverter generator isn’t powerful, but they’re not designed to handle major jobs like a conventional generator is.\nConventional style generators definitely still serve a purpose and work for a wide range of applications such as running power tools on a construction site or for the use of other types of industrial appliances. However, these generators tend to easily produce over eighty decibels of sound. Yet, they’re cost effective and low maintenance if you need a generator you can rely on to power up an entire house in the event of a power outage, while the inverter generator will only be able to power one large appliance or a few sensitive electronics.\nPower or Noise Rating\nIf you need a generator you can use for major jobs, such as running large equipment or power tools, or as a source for emergency power, then a conventional generator is the best choice.\nThe inverter generator shines in terms of portability and quiet running operation. These are the generators you can use in public places, campsites, federal campgrounds, and so on because they will not cause a disturbance during use like a conventional generator can. However, they aren’t powerful enough to rely on for big jobs. Instead, they’re a better option if you need a generator for use during a camping trip, caravanning, as an emergency power source that can keep your phones charged, or for use for public events when you’re far away from traditional power sources.\nThe Pulsar 2,000W Portable Gas-Powered Quiet Inverter Generator has a noise rating of just fifty-nine decibels. It also weighs just under forty-seven pounds and features a compact suitcase design that makes it easy to transport.\nWhy We Love it:\n- Low noise rating\n- Two thousand peak watts with sixteen hundred running watts\n- Compact suitcase design\n- Eight hours of runtime\n- Parallel capable\nWhat We Didn’t Love:\n- Difficult assembly\nTo learn more about this generator, click the button below.\nWhat is One of the Leading Quietest Inverter Generators on the Market?\nThe Wen PowerPro 56101 Inverter Generator features a sixty-decibel rating at a moderate power level, which is better than average. If you’re looking for a particularly quiet inverter generator, then paying close attention to each model’s DB rating is essential. Of course, you’ll want to learn about the generator’s runtime in addition to the decibel rating at different engine speeds.\nTo learn how to pick out the perfect camp generator for your next trip, click here to read our buyer’s guide.\nHow Noisy is 60 Decibels?\nSixty decibels is pretty quiet and comparable to the noise of an air conditioner, a conversation in a public place, and the noise level in a retail store. The top-selling inverter generators typically have a sixty-decibel noise rating, when they’re running a fifty to eighty percent load. At the lowest setting, many models have a decibel rating of just forty-seven to fifty decibels.\nWhich is Better, Solar Panels or Inverter Generators?\nThe HQST 100 Watts 12 Volts Polycrystalline Solar Panel Off-Grid RV and Boat Kit is one of the best-selling solar panel kits for RVs and produces enough power to run most of your appliances unless you run into two or three consecutive cloudy days. Camp generators, on the other hand, can produce power anytime, anywhere, because their operation isn’t based on weather conditions like solar panels are. However, you cannot run a camp generator in the rain. With this in mind, you may want to consider purchasing both a solar panel kit and an inverter generator for your next RV road trip.\nTo learn more about RV solar panel kits, click here to read our buyer’s guide.\nCan Inverter Generators be Used at Campsites?\nYes, they can! However, make sure you check out the rules of any campsite before you bring your generator along. Most campsites have strict noise rules in place, such as noise should not emit beyond an immediate campsite. Each campsite will also have specific quiet hours, usually ranging from ten at night until six the next morning. The strictest campsites will have specific hours of operation in place for inverter generators, although this time restriction will vary from site to site.\nNow you know why inverter generators are the go-to style of generators for most outdoor events, especially in public places. The generator’s lightweight design allows you to easily transport, set up, and haul the generator, but these machines really shine in terms of noise level.\nWhat is quiet generator DB levels? An inverter generator that has a noise rating ranging from forty-seven to seventy decibels. A generator’s noise level rating can vary from model to model and can also be dependent on what you’re using the generator for. But even the loudest inverter generator is much quieter than a conventional generator. These models utilize inverter technology for cleaner energy, consistent power, and quiet operation.']	['<urn:uuid:39add5db-96d3-4c48-b300-5c7f23f31b8a>', '<urn:uuid:c98a5da5-a98a-488d-a582-89244a7da112>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	10	72	2904
4	Which exercises are recommended for maintaining strong bones?	According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), weight-bearing exercise is particularly great for supporting bone strength, as it ensures working against gravity. Resistance exercises may also be great for supporting bone health. Specific recommended activities include climbing steps, playing tennis, and lifting weights.	['It can be easy to take our bodies for granted and assume we will stay perfectly fit and healthy for years to come. However, unless you’re making a conscious effort to stay healthy, this may not be the case.\nThis includes taking proper care of your bones. While bone health may be one of the last things on your mind, ensuring they stay nourished is extremely important, especially as you age.\nRead here to discover the importance of our bones, and we can best support their health.\nWhat Are Your Bones Made Of And Why Does It Matter?\nBones are made of living, growing tissue. Primarily, bone is made of the protein collagen. Collagen offers a soft framework for your body. Then there are several minerals, like calcium phosphate, for instance, that support your bone mineral density and add strength by helping to harden your bone framework.1\nWhat’s so special about the collagen and calcium duo? These compounds help make your bones flexible and strong. And strong, flexible bones are able to better withstand injury and stress than weaker bones.2\nBelieve it or not, approximately 99 percent of your body’s calcium is actually contained within your bones and teeth. Of course, there are traces of calcium found in your bloodstream as well.3,4\nImportance Of Bones: Risk Factors Associated With Poor Bone Health\nAlthough bones will stop growing in length in early adulthood, they may continue to grow in density. Until you reach about 30 years of age, your bones are at peak bone mass and your body is able to create new bone pretty quickly.5 After you hit age 30 or so, however, your body’s bone-building ability naturally changes and bone loss may begin.6,7\nBone health issues are generally characterized by lower bone mass. Sometimes the structural deterioration of your bone tissue can play a role here too.8\nPorous bones can sometimes lead to fragility in your bones and an even higher risk of certain types of bone fractures — namely fractures of the wrist, spine, and hips. One of the issues with this type of bone health concern is that you’ll really have no warning of weakened bone because there are not usually many symptoms leading up to a bone fracture.9 To help avoid this from happening, you’ll make to make sure you’re getting the proper nutrients your bones need to stay strong and healthy.\nBone Health And Nutrition\nA well-balanced diet can go a long way to keeping your bones as healthy as possible. Of course, this means you should include plenty of lectin-free vegetables in your diet.\nCertain fruits and vegetables can help provide more calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K. These vitamins and nutrients are essential for bone health.10,11\nOne thing to remember is that if your body isn’t getting enough calcium from a well-balanced diet, it will start to poach calcium from your bones — this can weaken them.12 So then, how might you enrich your diet with calcium?\nHere are some of the best calcium-rich foods to keep in your kitchen – all of which are Dr. Gundry-approved.\n- Casein A2 milk, goat milk, or buffalo milk\n- Leafy greens (kale, bok choy, collard greens)\n- Wild-caught sardines or wild-caught salmon\n- Blanched almonds\nOther Potential Ways To Support Bone Health\nVitamin D — Vitamin D plays a significant role when it comes to calcium absorption and maintaining proper bone health. And the synthesis of vitamin D takes place in your skin when you are exposed to sunlight.16\nSo, if you live in an area of the world that doesn’t get a lot of sun exposure or you spend much of your time indoors, you may want to talk to your doctor about the best way to get more vitamin D. They may recommend taking a vitamin D supplement or increasing your vitamin D intake through foods.\nYou’ll find vitamin D in the following lectin-free food sources:\n- Wild-caught fish\n- Omega-3 egg yolk\n- Grass-fed liver17\nVitamin K is also important as it can activate the osteocalcin protein — this protein is essential when it comes to building bone and helping weakened bone to rebuild strength.18 To find your vitamin K in food, try getting the following ingredients on your plate:\n- Olive oil19\nExercise — Because your bones, like your muscles, are living, growing tissue, exercise may also be a great way to support their health.\nSome National Institutes of Health (NIH government) sites recommend weight-bearing exercise as a particularly great way to support bone strength. Weight-bearing exercise ensures you are working against gravity. Resistance exercises may also be great for supporting bone health.\nTalk to your doctor about incorporating the following types of exercises into your routine:\n- Climbing steps\n- Playing tennis\n- Lifting weights20\nBone Health: Follow These Tips And Tricks\nDiet and exercise can go a long way when it comes to supporting the health of your bones. It’s important to get the proper nutrients your bones need to stay strong and healthy— especially if you’re over 30 years of age.\nLoad up on lectin-free foods that are rich in vitamin D, vitamin K and calcium. Start a workout routine and incorporate some bone-support exercises. Just make sure to get your doctor’s approval first. They may have other suggestions for supporting your bone health as well.']	['<urn:uuid:2d69e16d-2134-44a5-9bc4-37f33cdbacce>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	8	44	888
5	court battle vs mediation cost privacy compare	Traditional litigation (court battles) is generally more expensive and less private compared to mediation. The litigation process has been judged as expensive and time-consuming, requiring attorney fees and involving intense public scrutiny that may have negative effects. In contrast, mediation is offered at 'a fraction of the cost of an attorney' with fees charged hourly at the beginning of each session. Regarding privacy, mediation provides greater confidentiality since parties discuss their issues before their chosen mediator with few chances of private information falling into unintended hands, while traditional litigation involves public court proceedings.	"['|← The Law of Tort and its Implications||Intellectual Property Rights →|\nConflicts, controversies and disputes, have existed in the human history for an extraordinarily long time. This led to the invention as well as development of ways of resolving these conflicts. These methods vary according to the societies and this varies groups of people. Another thing that is common with the methods of conflict resolution is the high rate at which it evolves.\nLitigation refers to a lawful way of resolving conflicts between the various parties such as individuals, businesses, organizations, and governments among others. The traditional litigation system for a long time has been used to resolve conflicts using the civil court system. The key aspects that characterize the traditional litigation system include jury, trial, and discovery, among other aspects encountered in its day to day running. This system often entails the clients hiring attorney’s services in the attempt to seek justice.\nThe primary role of attorneys is to offer the legal advice to their clients and the client’s position in the whole procedure. This procedure happens, and it is usually done to serve justice to two parties that are against one another. During litigation system, the process of discovery is in most cases abused by either one or the both sides. A defiant person can file a lot of objections to detection requirements to deter the whole process. Moreover, the various motions are filed by either party before the trial. These are some reasons why the process of litigations can be protracted expensive and vexatious.\nApart from this classic form of dispute settlement, another method of dispute resolution has come in place. The alternative method is referred to as alternative dispute resolution (ADR). These methods try to solve some of the limitations of the traditional litigation. There are different methods of ADR that are in application today, these include; arbitration, negotiation and mediation. All of these processes are directed towards resolving conflicts.\nOf all the three methods of ADR, arbitration is the most commonly used method. As discussed earlier, traditional methods usually consist of two opposing sides each trying to defend their position, on the other hand, arbitration comprises of people or parties using an unbiased third party to listed and make his decision of the issue. This third party is known as an arbitrator and brings up the decision that is considered binding but some time may be unbinding.\nUnlike arbitration which may have more than one mediator; mediation is presided over by a single mediator whose role is not to provide judgment. The sole role of a mediator is to facilities a discussion that can lead to the conflict being resolved. Mediation has been found to be tremendously effective in conflict resolution and has been credited with reducing the cases that are taken to the courts. In addition, the decision reached is in most times viewed as the compromise between the parties and none feels aggrieved after wards. This occurs in a free environment where all parties can air out their views in from of a mediator who facilitates the reaching of a common ground.\nOne of the advantages of the ADR is the privacy involved. Since both parties are discussing and trying to solve their problem before their own choice of arbitrator, there are few chances that private information may fall into unintended hands. One of the advantages of traditional litigation over ADR is its ability to resole conflicts even when the parties are not willing to meet or discuss.\nMany business and people avoid the traditional method of litigation because of various reasons. One reason that is mostly given by firms and individuals, as to why many of them would not primarily prefer traditional litigation, is the dominant risk people and firms are exposed to in terms of being subjected to scrutiny. The intense scrutiny of an individual, a firm or a product may have negative effects in both the short and the long rung. The scrutiny may make firms suffer monetary loss; in addition, a brand may also suffer reduced demand.\nAnother burden that may make civil trial tedious for many people is the burden of proof. In the ADR, the proof is in most cases not necessary since, the parties are usually willing to come to a dialogue. The burden of proof can be expensive and may work to aggrieve further the aggrieved. For a successful civil trial to take place, the claims done by the plaintiff must be proven and be stronger than the defendants. This makes civil trial lees preferred compared to ADR.\nHowever, for this process to be fair the arbitrators must be neutral, the arbitrators do not have many problems attaining this because of the relaxed nature in which this occurs. This is because the process is informal, on the other hand, if these conditions are not met. The process cannot achieve the desired outcome. One of the major shortcomings of a civil legal process is its adversarial aspects; there always two parties that are defending their position.\nDespite the financial investment, and the time in traditional litigation, one party wins and the other losses at the end. This discourages many people to pursue justice through this process. In contrast, ADR provides a procedure that provides a safe landing for all parties. Mediation processes do not involve winning and losing. The mediator is uses his skills to assist the two parties to come up with a favorable compromise. In this case, both parties usually seek mutually satisfactory settlement for both parties making the final product palatable to all parties.\nIf we consider the costs involved in traditional litigation, it makes it unaffordable to all people. The traditional litigation process has been judged as expensive and time consuming, due to this, many people has resulted in using ADR methods. Among the methods that are preferred most by people are arbitration and mediation. Research shows that arbitration gives the people involved in conflict with smooth and speedy resolution of disagreement.', 'Divorce Mediation Frequently Asked Questions\nWhat is Divorce Mediation?\nMediation is the process of using a third party attorney to help negotiate and compromise a win/win outcome for all.\nWhy Choose Divorce Mediation?\nWhen using mediation, the goal is to help all parties and the family as a whole win. When using litigation, each attorney is looking for a win/lose outcome. The attorneys fight for their client’s rights whereas for the mediator the family is the client, resulting in a win/win. When using the litigation approach, the impact is a more costly and time consuming process with a tremendous negative emotional impact on the parents and the children.\nHow is mediation different from collaborative divorce?\nMediation is the negotiating of a divorce settlement or other dispute such as parenting issues using a single attorney mediator. The attorney mediator is trained to help the parties work together to develop solutions to all of the issues without the involvement of separate lawyers. This saves the cost of separate lawyers for both parties. Collaborative divorce involves each party having their own attorney for those who want to have a separate attorney.\nDoes it make sense to have children at mediation sessions?\nChildren should not be at the mediation sessions with the parents. If there are issues with the children, the divorce coach, who is a trained mental health professional, can work with the family to address these specific needs and concerns. Remember they are the victims of the separation and divorce and allowing them to have a voice in the process can make a huge difference in their lives because they usually feel most things are out of their control.\nChildren do not want to pick one parent over the other and they feel uncomfortable about talking about this, is it really good to get them involved?\nHaving the child discuss their feelings in a safe and secure environment, without fear of retribution, can make a difference in helping them move past any emotional issues. It helps them be a part of the solution and feel better about their future because now they feel more in control. This should be done wi\nHow long does divorce mediation take and how long are the sessions?\nEach session generally runs for an hour and a half and on average the entire process takes between 4 to 6 sessions.\nHow much does mediation cost?\nOur fees are reasonable and at a fraction of the cost of an attorney. We charge hourly and get paid at the beginning of each session .\nHow do I get started?\nWe offer a free phone consultation to help you determine if mediation is right for you. Contact us for more information or to schedule a consultation.\nIs it possible to get an unwilling party to try mediation?\nThere are various emotional stages that each party has to deal with internally before accepting their situation. Time can improve the situation or involving the party in our free consultation may help them understand the benefits of working in a cooperative way.\nCan I use an attorney during Divorce Mediation?\nYou always have the option of using a separate attorney during the process. However, because of the adversarial nature of divorce attorneys, it is possible for them to easily undo all the work completed during mediation. We do recommend that you use independent counsel to review the final agreement. We can recommend one for you at the end of the process to review the agreement before signing.\nAt the end of mediation, will we be divorced?\nYou will receive a settlement agreement which will be submitted to the court. Once signed and accepted by the court, you will be legally divorced.\nDo I need to bring anything to the first mediation session?\nWe will provide you with a form that will ask general questions regarding financials and family information.\nCollaborative Divorce Frequently Asked Question\nWhy would I use Collaborative Divorce instead of Mediation?\nIn some cases the parties cannot get along well enough to participate in a Divorce Mediation. If that is the case, there is another more peaceful way to accomplish a fair divorce. In Collaborative Divorce, the parties each have an attorney who is protecting them. While collaborative attorneys are trained in meditation techniques, it is very rare that clients in mediation have their advocates in the room with their mediators. The mediator does not represent either party, but the parties are encouraged to seek a review of their final agreement from their independent attorneys. In the collaborative process, clients attend a series of meetings accompanied by their attorneys; by their coaches; and/or by any other member of the collaborative team. The goal of the process is to create a global settlement in writing that meets the needs of the children and of the parents; a resolution acceptable to both spouses.\nWhat is collaborative practice and what is the collaborative team?\nCollaborative practice is a model for dispute resolution in which separated and divorcing couples, each represented by independent, specially trained attorneys, creatively reach agreement on all relevant issues without going to court and without threatening to do so. Collaborative divorce is a team approach often involving mental health professionals (""divorce coaches"" and ""child specialists""), and financial specialists all of whom agree to use neutral appraisers rather than appraisers favored by one party or the other. A primary goal of the collaborative model is to avoid the acrimony and trauma of subjecting the spouses and their children to the terrible stress and expense that comes with a divorce that is litigated in the courts.\nDo collaborative attorneys still zealously advocate for their clients?\nAbsolutely. Any good attorney knows that a negotiated settlement must work for both parties. Indeed, both parties must feel that they have “gotten” something (even if not everything) they needed. The role of the collaborative professional is to evoke the true needs and understand each party’s deepest concerns, helping a couple to develop resolutions that fall within a “range of reasonably acceptable options.” Our goal as attorneys is to “zealously” advocate. We can zealously advocate without being adversarial. Zealous advocacy does not mean the other spouse leaves the process with nothing, but rather that each spouse feels satisfied with his or her result.\nWhat kind of information will be disclosed?\nWith the exception of depositions under oath (which is not completely taboo), ALL documents and information typically exchanged in the traditional court based process is produced voluntarily. The parties will have to sign Financial Affidavits swearing under oath as to their income and assets, as well as liabilities. Because the Court may not accept your agreement without a sworn Financial Affidavit, it has to be done in the collaborative divorce process as well (and in a mediation). You will generally bring with you all of your financial statements such as bank accounts, investment accounts, mortgages, insurance, tax returns and other documents showing your income and expenses. Businesses, licenses, degrees, pensions, real estate and all other property is valued by neutral appraisers, specifically trained in the collaborative model. It is not uncommon for “ranges” in values to be established so that clients themselves can customize appropriate resolutions. The key to the collaborative process is that both parties agree to accurately and honestly disclose all assets, income and liabilities.\nWhy would I choose the collaborative divorce over mediation?\nSome people, for various reasons, are uncomfortable negotiating against his or her spouse without help of an attorney by his or her side. In the collaborative process, that help is right there; in the room; with the client every step of the way. While a mediator may provide some legal information, he or she does not advise either client. In a collaborative four way settlement meeting , it is common for both clients and for both attorneys to brainstorm as many options as possible. Once all of the options for each of the issues have been discussed, parties are typically in a better position to engage in a productive “give and take” in reaching an agreement, acceptable to both.\nHow is collaborative divorce different from a conventional divorce?\nThere is a big difference between a settlement that is negotiated during the conventional litigation process and one that takes place in the collaborative divorce process that prohibits court involvement or even the threat of court. Most conventional family law matters settle at the last minute before or during the trial. By that time, a great deal of money has been spent and emotional damage caused. The process is, for the most part driven by mutual coercion and fear which is why so many settlements occur just prior to trial. The settlements are often reached under conditions of considerable tension and anxiety and as a result are not done in consideration of important factors and do not provide for the proper support for the two parties. If the court makes a decision in your case, you have little control over what happens to you, your children and your property and often is not an ideal outcome for either party.\nIn contrast, the collaborative process is geared from the very beginning to make it possible for creative, respectful collective problem solving to occur. It is often quicker, often less costly, more individualized, less stressful, and almost invariably more satisfying. At its best, it is a process driven by mutual understanding and willingness to cooperate.\nWhat guarantees are there that all assets will be disclosed in the collaborative process?\nWhile there are no guarantees about anything in a mediation or the collaborative process, both require the parties to honestly disclose all assets, income and liabilities. Because each party has to submit a sworn affidavit to the court before their agreement will be accepted, a party intending to lie and hide assets or income during the divorce will also have to swear under oath to the court that all such information has been fully disclosed. If it is later found that a party did not disclose an asset or income, the court can re-open the case on the basis of fraud and can order the fraudulent party to pay the innocent party\'s legal fees as well as make a distribution order with respect to the assets that were not disclosed.\nCollaborative practice may not be for everyone. It is not always cheaper; it is not always quicker. The ultimate agreement however, is almost always better. Divorcing couples learn new ways to communicate in a manner that allows them to be better parents, better role models and often friends. The result is happier, more well-grounded children in healthier reconstructed families.\nIs a collaborative divorce cheaper than a traditional divorce? Is it faster?\nWhile there are no guarantees, the collaborative divorce process avoids the often wasteful and unnecessary hours of motions being filed, objections to the motions, hearings on the motions, nasty letters between attorneys, waiting in the halls of the courthouse while many other cases are called, and filing of appeals. Since the clients determine the frequency and timing of meetings, the pace is set by them and not by a judge handling hundreds of other matters. Obviously, cases with fewer issues take less time and cost less to complete. Even more complex cases, which will typically take more time and cost more money, are handled more efficiently than the traditional, court based model.\nDoesn\'t the collaborative divorce cost more because of the ""coaches"" and ""financial experts"" that are used?\nWhile there can be some expense for the coaches and financial experts, not every case needs these people involved in their case. What is beneficial about the collaborative process is that the parties with the guidance of their attorney can decide what resources to involve. The coaches are not necessary for each case, but when there is tremendous tension, they are expert at resolving disputes so the parties can move forward on the legal issues. Likewise, the financial experts are very good at moving quickly through the financial information and determining the value of assets such as pension plans, stock options, and investments. They are also very good at valuing businesses, or finding the right person to value the business. If this was done in a litigation environment in court, each party would hire their own expert to value the assets and there are usually extensive conflicts between the experts and the attorneys. The financial expert and coaches are only involved in the process to the extent necessary and are not ""on the clock"" for the whole process.\nFor whom is collaborative divorce the proper process choice?\nA collaborative divorce works best for:\nCollaborative practice is NOT a process for people destined to destroy their families and those seeking to punish and/or obtain revenge.\nA Peaceful Resolution']"	['<urn:uuid:255de3ff-ecf4-4f59-8a55-53dbd8357fce>', '<urn:uuid:1f70228e-b049-4d71-9127-0d78e774719b>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	7	93	3129

Hubble was specifically designed for servicing so that as technologies advanced on the ground and components wore out in the hostile environment of space, upgrades and repairs could extend the telescope’s scientific life. Hubble was launched into space in April 1990 with an anticipated lifespan of about 15 years.\nAstronauts visited Hubble five times to replace or repair computers, electronics, batteries, gyroscopes, and insulation, and to change out science instruments with newer, more powerful technologies. These visits left Hubble in renewed condition and with expanded reach into the cosmos. In the year 2020, Hubble marked its 30th year of exploration, a direct result of servicing missions. It continues to conduct ground- breaking science today.\nThe Telescope Workplace\nWhile Hubble was designed to be serviced, space is a dangerous environment, and astronauts are challenged by bulky spacesuits that limit movement and line of sight. Careful preparation and planning went into each extravehicular activity (EVA), or “spacewalk.” Hubble servicing missions required specialized tools and carefully choreographed procedures to ensure that the astronauts could safely and swiftly accomplish many tasks over the course of a spacewalk. Astronauts made their way around Hubble using yellow handrails, whose color indicated they were safe for grasping, while being careful to avoid keep-out zones and no-touch surfaces. Working in pairs, spacewalking astronauts helped each other prevent inadvertent contact with delicate structures. For every hour a spacewalking astronaut spent working on Hubble, they trained and prepared for approximately 10-16 hours on the ground.\nServicing Mission 1 (SM1): Dec. 2-13, 1993\nAfter Hubble’s launch in 1990, NASA learned that the telescope’s primary mirror had a slight flaw that blurred its vision. Space shuttle flight STS-61 was the first opportunity to correct the distortion and service the telescope. Astronauts installed two new instruments: the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR), which acted as a contact lens for Hubble’s flawed mirror, and the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2), which had corrective optics built in and replaced the original Wide Field and Planetary Camera instrument. In addition, SM1 included the installation and replacement of other components, including solar arrays and two Rate Sensor Units with gyroscopes. Since the first servicing mission, every instrument added to Hubble was designed to compensate for the mirror flaw, allowing COSTAR to eventually be removed during Servicing Mission 4.\nServicing Mission 2 (SM2): Feb. 11-21, 1997\nSTS-82 made significant improvements to Hubble’s productivity. The installation of two new instruments—the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS)— extended Hubble’s wavelength range into the near-infrared for imaging and spectroscopy, allowing scientists to probe the most distant reaches of the universe. The replacement of several components, including a Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS), Reaction Wheel Assembly, and solid-state data recorder, increased efficiency and performance.\nServicing Mission 3A (SM3A): Dec. 19-27, 1999\nWhat was originally conceived as a mission of preventive maintenance turned more urgent on November 13, 1999, when the fourth of Hubble’s six gyroscopes failed. At that time, Hubble needed at least three of its stabilizing gyroscopes to conduct science. Hubble went into a dormant “safe mode” while the telescope waited for repairs. NASA split the third servicing mission into two parts, beginning with STS- 103, to more quickly bring Hubble back into operation. The new, improved, and upgraded equipment included six fresh gyroscopes; six battery voltage/temperature improvement kits; a faster, more powerful, main computer; a solid-state data recorder; a new transmitter; an enhanced Fine Guidance Sensor; and new thermal insulation.\nServicing Mission 3B (SM3B): March 1-12, 2002\nDuring the fourth mission to service Hubble, STS-109 astronauts replaced Hubble’s solar panels with rigid and more powerful solar arrays and installed the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) in place of the Faint Object Camera (FOC), the telescope’s last original instrument. They also replaced the spacecraft’s original Power Control Unit (PCU), which had been on the job for 11 years, requiring Hubble to be completely powered down for the first time since its launch in 1990.\nServicing Mission 4 (SM4): May 11-24, 2009\nThe Hubble Space Telescope was reborn after Servicing Mission 4 (SM4). During STS-125, astronauts installed two new scientific instruments: the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) and Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). Two instruments that had experienced electronic failures, STIS and ACS, were revived by creative and complex in-orbit repairs that had not been anticipated when the telescope was designed. With these efforts, Hubble reached the apex of its scientific capabilities. To prolong Hubble’s life, astronauts also installed new batteries, new gyroscopes, a new science computer, a refurbished Fine Guidance Sensor, and new insulation on three electronics bays. Additionally, astronauts attached a soft-capture mechanism to the base of the telescope to assist NASA in safely deorbiting Hubble at the end of its life.']"	['<urn:uuid:e3d911ce-0324-4cf8-a09b-5bd1a658f51a>', '<urn:uuid:a82a288a-81b8-43aa-91b4-ca620a19ab11>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	10	65	1703
8	how climate change impacts global health inequities	Climate change negatively impacts health and living standards worldwide through changing weather patterns that affect water access and agriculture, as well as changes to disease-affected regions. Many countries lack the wealth, adequate technology, and government institutions to deal with climate change, which worsens health inequities between poor and rich areas of the world. This situation is sometimes referred to as 'environmental injustice'.	['The subject of the seventh and final taught week of the emerging trends in global health course focused on the concept of sustainable development and the environment and how these relate to health.\nA widely recognised definition of sustainable development is provided by the United Nations:\n“Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”\nUnited Nations 1987\nThere are three key pillars to sustainable development:\n- economic development,\n- social equity\n- and environmental protection.\nand health is involved in all three of these.\nClimate change and the negative impact of our activities on our environment continue to be controversial issues despite widespread recognition that the quality and functioning of our environment are key determinants of our health. McMichael (2009) argues that the health of the population is the real “bottom line” indicator of environmental and social conditions and he suggests that “environmental sustainability” must be ultimately about sustaining health.\nClimate change has the potential to negatively impact upon health and reduce living standards around the world, through changing weather patterns affecting access to water and agriculture and changes to regions affected by diseases. Many countries of the world lack the wealth, adequate technology and government institutions to deal with climate change, exacerbating inequities in health between poor and rich areas of the world. This reflects what is sometimes referred to as ‘environmental injustice’. Costello et al (2009)\nThe concept of ecosystem services was introduced which attempts to highlight how our natural environment functions to provide us with many of the basic necessities we need to live. For example clean water is originally provided by rainfall collected in a watershed and filtered through plants, soils and rocks. This concept aims to engage the business and government communities in appreciating these vital roles when taking development decisions.\nMeasuring sustainable development\nThe commonly used measures of development and progress focus solely on the economic pillar of sustainable development ignoring the other two pillars. So it is not surprising that the levels and changes in these economic measures do not correspond to levels or changes in population health.\n“Traditionally, it was thought that economic development (wealth, as measured by Gross Domestic Product) would automatically lead to health” however comparisons between countries such as the US and Costa Rica indicates that higher GDP does not on its own result in greater life expectancy. In this case US GDP is 4 times that of Costa Rica but average life expectancy is still one year less (Alsan et al., 2006).\nAn example of an attempt to provide a more holistic measure of development that also encompasses health and wellbeing is the Happy Planet Index. This uses three measures (life expectancy, experienced well-being and Ecological Footprint) to determine a score for each country that indicates “the extent to which countries deliver long, happy, sustainable lives for the people that live in them “. The map below shows the HPI resulting scores for the countries of the world where Green indicates a good score and red a poor score.\nThe food system\nObesity is now recognised as a global problem with enormous health implications. Current data suggests that in 19 out of the 34 OECD countries more than 50% of the population is over weight. While food selection and diet are considered an individual’s choice, the food systems that provide the options from which we can choose affect to a large degree the choices that individuals end up making. For instance subsidies that promote the growth of particular crops (e.g. corn) result in some ingredients being artificially low in cost (e.g. high fructose corn syrup). Inevitably these ingredients are then widely utilised in the production of the cheapest processed foods available. One course presenter, Prof. Schuter argued passionately that the world’s food systems need to be radically re-engineered and these subsidies be refocused to promote healthy food types over the unhealthy ones.\nThe secondary affects of the adoption of healthier diets also has implications for social equality (e.g. local food sourcing supporting small farmers) and the environment (e.g. reductions in livestock reducing green house gas emissions). The links between health related decisions and positive environmental implications go beyond the food system Kickbusch et al. (2010, p. 7) summarises this by arguing that\n“in many cases, the best choices for health are also the best choices for the planet; and the most ethical and environmental choices are also good for health”.\nPost 2015 Millenium Development Goals\nThe 8 Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) have been the focus of global efforts to achieve sustainable development since their agreement in 2000. For each goal a set of targets were defined to be achieved by 2015, but as you would anticipate despite much progress not all of these will not all be met. Haines et al. (2012) suggest this failure is due to a lack of integration between the efforts focused on separate social (including health), economic, and environmental priorities.\nWith 2 years remaining for the MDGs there is now a programme to determine a new set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to set the new development agenda. Contrary to the MDGs, which mainly focus on poor and emerging nations, it is anticipated that the SDGs will encompass both developed and developing countries. It is important that health issues are recognised in these new goals and the momentum achieved in the health related MDGs is not lost after 2015 (WHO task team 2013).\nThe United Nations has established top down and bottom up processes to gather opinions to influence the SDGs. The bottom up channel is an open consultation mechanism delivered by the My World and World We Want websites which can be used by anyone to add their perspective.\nImplications for Physical Therapy / Physiotherapy\nSustainable development is a worthy and important objective and we must consider the ability of future generations to meet their needs in the decisions we take daily. These decisions may be work related such as where to source our healthcare products, what form of transport we use to commute to work and personal such as what food we choose to eat each day.\nIt is apparent to us through our work with patients that wealth does not equate to health and many of the global health problems of the future will affect all nations. The identification in the Happy Planet Index of the importance of the “experience of well being” is very relevant to our profession as this one of our primary contributions to the health and quality of life of our patients.\nThe opportunity to participate in the definition of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) must be grasped by our profession to ensure our perspective is heard. We can do this individually through the My World (a simple poll that takes 1-2 minutes) and the World We Want web sites and we can encourage our professional organisations to represent our perspectives. It will be another 15 years before this opportunity arises again!']	['<urn:uuid:a778721b-28bb-4b21-8141-a696a0895e60>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	7	62	1171

Initial discussions were not successful and the property did not sell.\n2016 – Mountain Area Land Trust (MALT) and CCCOS met with Jefferson County Open Space to see if they had an interest in partnering to purchase a portion of the parcel for sale on North Floyd Hill. Jeffco Open Space saw a benefit and was willing to help purchase the parcel. Trust for Public Lands (TPL) provided a staff member who wrote the GOCO Open Space grant which was successfully funded. Clear Creek County Open Space and Jefferson County Open Space provided matching funds.\n2017 - The property was purchased by TPL and then transferred to Clear Creek and Jefferson Counties with MALT holding a conservation easement on the 108 acre parcel which is visible from I70. CCCOS owns an additional 600 plus acres that goes from the Jefferson County line west along the ridge and the Canyon.\n2017 – In early Fall, to channel early users of the area across the meadow, a trail was built across the meadow heading west and north. Money from the Gates Family Foundation from a grant given to MALT for development of trails at the Floyd Hill Open Space Trailhead was used to build the trail.\n2017-2018 – COMBA, Team Evergreen Cycling, MALT, TPL and CCCOS provided funding to pay a consultant to design a trail system starting from the Floyd Hill Open Space Trailhead that would utilize the 600 plus acres of Clear Creek County Open Space. Several public meetings were held to get input with overwhelming support from mountain bikers. In mid 2018, the Floyd Hill Open Space Trail System Master Plan was completed. It proposed a network of about 13 miles of trails. The Clear Creek Trail Crew and volunteers from COMBA, Volunteers for Outdoors Colorado, Teenworks, and Mile High Youth Corps, and assorted corporate volunteers have worked on trail construction.\n2018-2019 – COMBA and Team Evergreen spearheaded a fundraising campaign to secure funds to build “Segment 4,” a downhill bike only trail that would come down the east side of the 108 acres. Combined with funding from Gates Family Foundation and Clear Creek County sufficient funding was raised to hire FlowRide Concepts to build the trail with support from COMBA’s Trails Team and volunteers.\nAugust 21, 2019 - Segment 4 aka The Sluice opened to the public with more than 100 mountain bikers in attendance.\nSept. 2020 - Volunteers finish the last mile and the Floyd Hill system is complete!', 'Here\'s our selection of the best kids bikes for kids of all agesRead More\nAre kids e-bikes legal in the UK?\nRecently there\'s been an exciting development in kids bikes - the arrival of children\'s e-bikes into the UK. Scott, Haibike, Bergamont, Moustache and Cube have all released 24"" and 26"" wheel kids electric mountain bikes, aimed at making off road riding easier for junior riders. We\'ve had a number of Cycle Sprog readers get in touch and ask us ""Is it legal for a child to ride an e-bike in the UK?"" so we thought we\'d do a bit of digging.\nWe are discussing children\'s pedal bicycles, fitted with an electric motor by the manufacturer, as defined by the The Electrically Assisted Pedal Cycles – EAPC – (Amendment) Regulations 2015. These bikes are restricted to no more than 15.5mph /250 watts and must be pedalled for the battery to be in operation.\nThis article does not apply to electric motorbikes, dirt bikes, electric scooters, quad bikes or pedal bicycles fitted with batteries, engines or motors after purchase.\nBecause kids e-bikes are new the rules around them have not been widely documented. We\'ve done our best to write a clear and correct article, based on the answers to questions we submitted to the Department for Transport, DEFRA and Forestry Scotland. We are not lawyers, so please take legal advice if you need it before purchasing or using a child\'s e-bike.\nCycle Sprog take no responsibility for any death, injury, damage or criminal conviction resulting from anyone riding an e-bike.\nElectric kids mountain bikes are not cheap - coming in at between £1,800 and £2,100 - so it\'s worth knowing the law if you\'re thinking of buying one of these bikes. These laws will also apply to children pedalling an e-assist cargo bike or an adult sized e-bike, both of which are becoming increasingly common.\nHere\'s what we\'ve found out so far:\nIs it legal for a child to ride an e-bike in the UK?\nThe answer depends on how old the child is, and where they are riding.\nFor children aged over 14 years and not in Northern Ireland, the answer is ""yes"", with the caveat that they must not be ridden on pavements.\nIn Northern Ireland, you currently need a moped licence to ride any electric bike. The bike must also be registered, taxed and insured. However, it is likely that this law will be repealed at some point to bring it in line with the rest of the UK.\nFor younger children, the answer is slightly more complicated and depends on where the e-bike is being ridden.\nAll subsequent questions apply to children under the legal age limit:\nIs it legal for a child to ride an e-bike on the road?\nNo. It is illegal for a child to ride an e-bike on the road in the UK until they are over the age of 14 years.\nThe Department for Transport has confirmed to Cycle Sprog the following:\n""E-bikes can be ridden on the road (but not the pavement) provided they meet the Electrically Assisted Pedal Cycle Regulations 1983 (as amended) and the rider is over 14 years of age.""\nThis means that if your child is riding an electric bike below the age limit and any part of the route goes on roads, they are technically breaking the law.\nWe assume that where a pavement is a shared use cycle path then the use of an e-bike is allowed, but we are yet to have this clarified by the Department of Transport.\nIs it legal for a child to ride an e-bike on the road if the battery is switched off?\nThis would seem to be the perfect solution, but I asked the Department for Transport the following question:\n""Is it against the law to ride a bike with a battery fitted that\'s not been turned on?"" and their response was ""Yes it is"".\nSo, if a battery is fitted to the bike your child is riding they should not be on the road, even if the battery is switched off.\nIs it legal for a child to ride an electric bike on a bridleway?\nYes. If you\'re buying an e-bike for your child, then one place that they can ride is on bridleways.\nThe Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) who are responsible for policy in respect to bridleways confirmed ""Whilst there are no specific laws for e-bikes on bridleways, we hope that people will comply with the Road Traffic Act.""\nHope is a wonderful thing. Here at Cycle Sprog we hope every council will build safe, segregated cycle routes for all families to be able to ride safely. We also hope to win the lottery. I guess you need to buy a ticket for a chance of that though!\nAre children allowed to ride electric bikes on Forestry Commission land?\nScottish Forestry and Forestry and Land Scotland are responsible for Scotland\'s national forests, including the 7 Stanes mountain bike trail centres. They have confirmed that ""Under 14s will not be able to ride ebikes on Scotland’s national forests. Our forest trails/roads have to comply with the Road Traffic Act and therefore same rules apply.""\nForestry England have not responded to our emails, so we can only assume the same applies in England and Wales. This means all the trail centres located within the national forests are out of bounds for kids on e-bikes.\nAn interesting situation arises where a bridleway passes through national forest land!\nIs it legal for a child to ride an electric mountain bike at a privately owned trail centre?\nPrivate land is not subject to the Road Traffic Act, so it is at the discretion of the land owner as to whether your child is allowed to ride an electric bike.\nWhat is the penalty for a child caught riding an e-bike on the road?\nThankfully, your child is not going to get locked up if they get caught riding an e-bike.\nThe Department of Transport told us that the penalty is a fine under the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. We haven\'t heard of anyone being fined for this yet, although kids e-bikes are relatively new.\nIt\'s worth noting that a teenager has been fined and given 6 points against any future driving licence for riding an electric scooter dangerously at high speeds (although e-bikes are restricted to 15 mph and electric scooters aren\'t, with some capable of speeds of up to 40mph).\nIs it legal for children to ride e-bikes in Europe?\nFor those families heading off to Europe on holiday to ride their amazing cycle paths, trails and bike parks, the good news is that in the rest of the EU there are no age restrictions on the use of electric bikes.\nThis is presumably why these bikes are being built, with a move by many countries to make mountain biking more accessible for all ages and abilities. Plus many of the manufacturers of kids e-MTB\'s are based in the Alpine countries.\nIt\'s worth noting that Denmark has approved the speed pedelec, a type of super electric bike that can reach speeds of up to 45 km/hour, for riding on cycle paths. Riders need to have turned 15 years of age and wear a helmet.\nIs it legal for children to ride e-bikes elsewhere in the world?\nEvery country has different rules, which sometimes vary between states/provinces so you need to check before you travel. For example, in the USA the laws vary, with some states having an age limit of 16 years and other states having no age limit at all.\nWhy is there an age limit on electric bikes in the UK?\nThe Department for Transport told Cycle Sprog ""Driving a powered or power-assisted vehicle, on or off road, demands a certain level of responsibility, increasing with the power and weight of the vehicle. 16 is the minimum age to ride a moped. This was reduced to 14 years for EAPC taking into account the lower level of power compared to a moped. It is worth noting that statistically, the youngest riders of powered 2-wheel vehicles are at most risk. We would not recommend the use of power-assisted bikes off-road by riders under 14.""\nWe are waiting for more details of the research proving younger riders are more at risk. The battery restriction of 15.5mph on e-bikes is significantly lower than the speeds we know many Cycle Sprogs frequently ride at, without a battery.\nIt\'s interesting there is no law restricting the weight of kids bikes - something we\'d welcome, especially on those kids bikes that are half the body weight of a child.\nSummary: Where are children allowed to ride e-bikes in the UK?\nChildren aged over 14 years are allowed to ride e-bikes anywhere normal pedal bicycles are allowed (i.e. roads, bridleways, national forests and trail centres). They must not be ridden on pavements.\nIn Northern Ireland they need a moped licence and the bike must be registered, taxed and insured.\nChildren below this age limit are allowed to ride e-bikes on bridleways and on private land with the land owners permission. They are not allowed to ride them on the road, on pavements or in the national forests (including trail centres).\nBecause kids e-bikes are a new phenomenon the rules surrounding them are, at the moment, in a relatively undocumented state. We\'ve done our best to write a clear and correct article, based on the answers to questions we submitted to the Department for Transport, DEFRA and Forestry Scotland. We are not lawyers, so please take legal advice if you need it.\nCycle Sprog take no responsibility for any death, injury, damage or criminal conviction resulting from your child riding an e-bike.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Like the majority of websites, Cycle Sprog uses affiliate schemes to give us an income.

10	How was chocolate prepared in Georgian times, and what are the health benefits associated with its consumption?	In Georgian times, chocolate was prepared through a complex process starting with roasting cocoa beans at around 140 degrees centigrade. The roasted beans were then ground on a metate stone warmed to about 80 degrees, where they would liquefy as the cocoa butter was released. The ground mixture was scraped onto paper to form 'chocolate cakes,' which were then boiled with milk or even mixed with port to create drinks. These drinks were served in special chocolate pots with built-in whisks to create a frothy, homogenized beverage. As for health benefits, chocolate contains flavanols that can boost nitric oxide production, helping regulate blood pressure with benefits comparable to aspirin. It can help prevent deep vein thrombosis and improve cardiovascular health. Dark chocolate is particularly beneficial as it contains 2-3 times more beneficial compounds than milk chocolate. The cocoa bean contains over 400 distinct aromas and 300 different chemical compounds, including substances that can induce emotions similar to falling in love.	"[""Skip to 0 minutes and 11 secondsHello, my name is Christopher Hew, and I'm from the University of Reading. Nice to meet you. Oh, very nice to meet you. My name's Robert Hoare. I'm from the Historical Royal Kitchens team at Hampton Court Palace. How was chocolate made during the Georgian period? The process starts with taking the pods off the tree, and then fermenting them on basically the forest floor. And then drying them off. And then we have them in this form. And these have been processed abroad. They had to be fermented and dried and everything. And that takes quite a while. But we didn't know that. So we get the beans like this. And then we roast them.\nSkip to 0 minutes and 44 secondsAnd we roast them in front of fires, sometimes just with iron pans, sometimes with things like this. Great big cylinders that you put onto the spit. And once it's roasted, it gets to be like these. These are roasted beans. These are already roasted beans. Already roasted beans, which I did this morning. And we roast them-- not a terribly high temperature compared to coffee. I've done these at 140 degrees centigrade. Are they edible? They are. Would you care to try them? Yes, please. Thank you.\nSkip to 1 minute and 17 secondsIt's crunch-- it's chocolatey. Very chocolatey. But very dry. And what happens next is the amazing thing, because you crunch these up, and then you put them on the metate stone, which is warmed. But only warmed to about 80. It's heated below. EIther using a charcoal stove or in our case, you can have a tray with sort of charcoal embers in. And then you use this to crunch them. You crunch the beans. And after a while, they sort of liquefy. It's really strange. Suddenly the cocoa butter comes out. And they become liquid? Yeah, it becomes really fatty. Back home in Indonesia, we have a similar device as well. Oh, do you?\nSkip to 2 minutes and 0 secondsBut we use it to grind up herbs and chillies, usually. And it's much more rough in texture. And so it grinds the herbs very, very finely, as compared to probably this. So what you do is you get it until you think it's ready. You sort of scrape it off with your special scraper. And you scrape it onto bits of paper, like this. And when you scrape it onto bits of paper like this, this is now called a chocolate cake. Called cake because of their shape. Cake of soap. It was just an old thing for a round thing. And then some people say keep them for a month. Some people say don't keep them for a month.\nSkip to 2 minutes and 37 secondsIt's a sort of trade secret thing. And then, typical Georgian, you boil this up in-- over here, in England, milk. But not only milk. Chocolate wine, chocolate port-- Oh, chocolate port. Which is very nice, yes. You have to serve it up quickly. But because it's still got the fat in there, and it's still got a slight graininess, you serve it in one of these. This is a classic chocolate pot. And the reason it's got this, it's because you want to-- it's basically a whisk. built in. And so what you do is you give it a whisk up. And get it all nice and frothy, so when it is poured out, it's also sort of nice and homogenised.\nMaking chocolate the Georgian way\nThis Week we’ve focused on the role of chocolate in showcasing power, wealth and kingship during the Georgian era.\nIn this video, Robert Hoare, Food Historian and member of the Historic Kitchens Team at Hampton Court Palace explains the traditional, Georgian method for preparing a ‘cake’ of chocolate from raw chocolate nibs. These cakes were then taken and mixed with hot water, milk, or alcohol to make a delicious range of chocolate drinks.\nRobert is joined by Christopher Hew, a Food and Nutritional Science student from the University of Reading. Christopher is keen to find out how these ‘cakes’ of chocolate are prepared and to take a sample back to the labs at Reading, where he plans to analyse the aromas released from drinking chocolate prepared using different ingredients, as part of his final year research project.\nFigure 1: Georgian Chocolate cakes © Historic Royal Palaces\nIf you’d like to see the full process of making chocolate, watch this recreation, also made in the Chocolate Kitchen at Hampton Court Palace on YouTube.\n© University of Reading and Historic Royal Palaces."", 'A guide to chocolate – the journey from pod to palate.\nBy Sara Jayne Stanes, Founder, The Academy of Chocolate\nChocolate is unique. It is the only substance that melts in the mouth at body temperature, gently exploding into a warm, sensual liquid. This singularly hedonistic and deeply satisfying experience has earned chocolate a role in everything from seduction and the demise of slavery to a venerated staple of the herbal pharmacopoeia. Of course, we are talking really serious chocolate here.\nWhat is fine chocolate?\nChocolate is ‘cocoa mass’ or ‘cocoa liquor’ – a combination of the roasted and ground kernel of the ‘cacao’ bean, the principal part of which is cocoa butter (i.e. the fat released when the bean is ground) and sugar. This is then refined and processed. Chocolate may also contain lecithin – a natural emulsifier – as well as flavours like vanilla, and in the case of milk chocolate, milk solids.\nChocolate itself of course doesn’t grow anywhere. It is cocoa, or ‘cacao’, as it should be known, which grows on trees. Its name derives from ‘Theobroma Cacao’ (food for the gods) and is made from the seeds of the rainforest tree grown 20 degrees north and 20 degrees south of the Equator. There are three major varieties: Criollo, Trinitario, and Forastero. These varieties are generally separated into what is known as fine beans (the first two) and bulk beans (normally Forastero). Of these three varieties of cacao, there are over 280 hybrids. Cocoa beans are very susceptible to hybridisation and it is debatable whether there are any true Criollo beans still growing (with the exception of very remote parts of Venezuela’s borders with Colombia and Bolivia).\nThe history of chocolate\nThe name ‘chocolate’ most probably comes from the Olmec/Mayan/Aztec hybrid: xoco-atl (whoko-atll) meaning ‘bitter water’ – a fatty, grainy drink made from the crushed roasted and ground cocoa beans, sometimes with the addition of herbs and spices. Sugar (from the Caribbean) was not known in Central and South America until well after the Spanish invasion. When Hernan Cortes and his men invaded Mexico in 1518, they found cocoa was used also as currency. Montezuma was reputed to drink several cups of foaming ‘xoco-atl’ a day before visiting his harem of wives!\nWhile geographical discoveries point to the existence of ‘cacao’ around 6,000 years ago, it was the Olmecs (by Veracruz, Mexico) who were the first recorded people to have found uses for chocolate circa 1500 BC. Remains of cacao have been found in the graves of their priests and are thought to be gifts for the gods on their journey from earth to the afterlife. Cacao was used in ceremonial occasions as offerings to the gods just as communion bread and wine traditionally represent the body and blood of Christ.\nThe Mayans believed that for the sun to rise every morning, cacao had to be prepared and offered to replace the blood that the sun lost in its overnight fight with the jaguar. In the 9th century, the god of cacao, Queztalcoatl, introduced the cacao seeds to humans and showed them how to use it.\nBanished from earth by a party of jealous gods from ‘eden’, he vowed to return to earth disguised as a ‘fair-skinned, bearded man’ to save the people. This gave rise to the legend that Cortes was the resurrected god, Queztalcoatl, and gave him and his Spanish army free passage to capture and colonise Mexico City (then known as Tenochtitlan).\nMany other uses for chocolate have been recorded especially for medicinal remedies. Rather than illness being caused by disease, Native Americans viewed health as the state of being in balance with the environment. Losing that balance – perhaps through a ‘perturbed’ diet – could create sickness. Chocolate was viewed as one means for restoring lost balance. As we know now, they were more accurate in their analysis of chocolate than we gave them credit. Among the conditions cured by chocolate were tuberculosis, toothaches, and ulcers. It was also alleged to cure itches, repel tumours, and foster sleep.\nBy the 1680s, reports emerged that chocolate could restore energy after a day of hard labour, alleviate lung inflammation, and even strengthen the heart. By the 1800s, cocoa was being mixed with ground amber dust to relieve hangovers. Combined with other ingredients, it also became the basis of treatments for syphilis, hemorrhoids, and intestinal parasites.\nChocolate arrived in England around the middle of the 17th century – the same time as coffee and tea. Travellers brought home recipes for the strange drinks, together with tales of their reputed therapeutic prowess. It’s really no wonder that chocolate became such an important part of the apothecary’s medicine chest. It’s also no coincidence that many apothecaries were Quakers, who as part of the Quaker religion, were not permitted to enter certain trades and professions, including the armed forces, and were not allowed to go to university.\nAt the time of the industrial revolution in the early 19th century, many people across England and elsewhere in Europe moved from areas full of countryside known for their agriculture to towns. At this time, conditions became squalid and people turned to drink for relief. Names like Cadbury, Fry, and Rowntree were all devout Quakers and were familiar with and proficient at using cocoa.\nNaturally, with the advent of machinery, they discovered ways of making the fatty grainy drink into something far more palatable. Thus more work for the labourers and an alternative to the demon alcohol. It was this desire for the smooth drink that led to the discovery of chocolate – allegedly by the grandson of the founder, Joseph Fry in c. 1840, as a by-product in the form of a pastille to eat and enjoy.\nQualities and varieties\nCocoa grows on trees some 20 metres high in the wild and 3-8 metres under cultivation in parts of the world close to the Equator (20 degrees north and 20 degrees south). Its indigenous home is Central and South America, with the best beans coming from Venezuela, Grenada, Ecuador, Belize, Colombia, and the Caribbean. The very first cocoa beans were cultivated from Brazilian beans in Portuguese West Africa as late as 1840. Today, the largest producers are the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Indonesia, and Brazil.\nThe three main varieties of beans are as follows:\n‘Native’ or ‘of local origin’, this high-quality, aromatic chocolate, which is substantially lacking in bitterness, is grown in Central America and a few regions of Asia. It is likely originally from Mexico, but now represents less than 5% of the world’s production. Criollo is rarely used alone due to its scarcity and expense. It is finicky to grow and doesn’t adapt well to different climates.\n‘Foreigner’ or ‘stranger’, this is ordinary, everyday cocoa, which originates from the Amazon. Forastero represents 80% of the world’s cocoa and has a slightly bitter flavour. In the context of coffee, it is often referred to as ‘cocoa’s robusta beans.’\nTrinitario was developed as a hybrid of Criollo and Forastero in Trinidad as a result of the near-total destruction of the Criollo plantations by a hurricane in 1727. Seeds for new plantings were brought from Venezuela and cross-fertilised, with the final result encompassing characteristics of both varieties. Trinitario represents about 10-15% of the world’s total cocoa beans. Its blends are fine and rich in fats and it makes great chocolate.\nFrom this small parentage, there are thousands of hybrids, all affected by different soil and climates. This makes the identification of cocoa a complex process.\nThe flavours of the beans are affected by the location, climate and soil in which they are grown. It is important to remember that like fine wines, the vintages vary from year to year – sometimes subtly, and sometimes dramatically.\nThe journey from pod to palate\nCocoa trees produce thousands of tiny, delicate flowers that develop into pods. Resembling rugby balls, pods grow directly from the lower branches and the trunk. They contain between 25-40 seeds, roughly the size of olives, which are formed like a giant corn on the cob. The pods weigh between 200-800g and ripen after 5-6 months.\nThe taste of the juice and the freshly-picked beans is similar to tropical fruits such as sweet milky lychees, pineapple, and melon. After a few hours, they become very bitter and almost inedible. One tree produces only enough beans for 1kg chocolate per year.\nIn the next stage of the process, pods are harvested and cut open with a machete. Fresh beans are then scooped out and laid on the ground, or put in special boxes to ferment for between 5-9 days, depending on the variety. It’s the fermentation process that develops the full flavour profile. After that, seeds (or beans) are laid out on the ground to dry in the sun for several days. They are evenly and regularly raked over before being shipped and transported to the factory.\nThe chocolate-making process\n1) To make the majority of commercial chocolate, ‘anonymous’ beans from different countries are blended. The exception is for origin or single bean chocolate varieties (although these high-quality products represent a tiny percentage of the chocolate produced).\n2) The next stage of the process is cleaning, which removes foreign bodies like unwanted twigs and stone.\n3) Roasting time and temperature are also important to the end product. The higher the temperature, the more bitter the chocolate and the more need for sugar generally. The best chocolate is made from beans roasted at a lower temperature for a longer time, thus creating a richer flavour. In the case of the latter, less sugar is generally needed.\n4) Kibbling/shelling/winnowing separates the nib from the shell.\n5) Grinding of the cocoa nib then produces cocoa mass (or liquor). An average cocoa bean contains 55% cocoa butter.\n6) Now the mass (liquor) takes one of two journeys. It’s either used to make chocolate, or it is pressed to make cocoa cake or cocoa butter.\nThe ground cocoa mass is mixed with sugar and kneaded into a ‘dough’. The dough is then refined through five revolving steel rollers which reduces all the solid particles to 20 microns (less for top-quality chocolate). The ‘mixture’ that comes off at the top of the fifth roller is in powder or flake form which is barely perceptible to the touch.\n‘Conching’ is essential at this stage for smoothness. The process uses paddles that resemble shells or ‘conches’ (the origin of its name) to thoroughly mix and refine the chocolate mixture to perfection. Depending on the producer’s recipe, more cocoa butter can be added at this stage. Generally, the longer the ‘conch,’ the better, but not so long ago, it was a sign of good chocolate when it was conched for four or five days. Today’s technology has changed that to 8 or 10 hours. The conching time should be long enough to drive off the unwanted volatile odours and bitterness, but not too long to damage some of the more complex chocolate flavours.\nLiquid chocolate is then loaded onto thermostatically-controlled tankers for national and international distribution, or chocolate is tempered to ensure proper crystallisation of cocoa butter and its homogenous dispersal throughout the chocolate. Chocolate is then moulded into the familiar blocks or pistoles (chips) that we buy.\nFor cocoa cake or cocoa butter:\nThe second route for the liquor is ‘pressing’ in which immense hydraulic pressure is exerted to produce cocoa cake and cocoa butter. Cocoa cake is crushed into a fine powder, before being alkalised (also known as ‘Dutching’ after Van Houten, who invented it at the beginning of the 19th century). Alkalisation mellows the flavour, makes it more digestible because it becomes soluble, and, importantly, darkens the colour. The process was ‘invented’ based on the customs of the Aztec medicine men who used to add wood ashes from the fire to chocolate to make it more palatable.\nCocoa butter is deodorised and refined for use in white chocolate and also added to some dark chocolate.\nSo is chocolate good for us?\nPeople should certainly not feel guilty about eating it. Below are just some of the ways in which the consumption of chocolate can benefit health.\nChemicals called flavanols, present in cocoa drinks, and to a lesser extent, in chocolate, can boost the production of nitric oxide which is crucial to the regulation of blood pressure. Research by Harvard Medical School has shown that the benefits can be as great as those of aspirin.\nDeep vein thrombosis\nThe chances of developing this condition can also be offset by the flavanols, according to research at the University of California Davis. A 50g bar of chocolate contains the same concentration of chemicals as two glasses of red wine, four-and-a-half cups of tea, six apples, or seven onions.\nFlavanols are also known to improve the cardiovascular system and are said to help prevent coronary heart disease.\nScientists at the University of California have also detected that many of chocolate’s naturally occurring chemical compounds, such as opiates, are also found in cannabis. Opiates and cannabinoids trigger different receptors in the brain, which is “therapeutically interesting.”\nIn the meantime, individuals wishing to self-medicate with non-prescription-strength chocolate should reach for cocoa or dark chocolate, which can contain 2-3 times more of these compounds per ounce than milk chocolate. The chocolate you find in industrial newsagents is also much less compound-rich, while containing far more sugar.\nTasting: the senses\nThe cocoa bean naturally contains over 400 distinct aromas – at least twice as much as any other gems of nature. The rose has only 14, and the gastronome’s staple, the onion, only half a dozen.\nThe taste of chocolate is equally complex as a result of the presence of over 300 different chemical compounds, including theobromine and methyl-xanthine – two mildly addictive caffeine-like substances – and phenylethylamine, a stimulant similar to the body’s own dopamine and adrenaline. Phenylethylamine strikes the brains’ mood centres and induces the emotion of falling in love, a matter of only partly understood brain chemistry. Then there is the actual physical pleasure of feeling the chocolate melt in the mouth, a perculiarly seductive sensation.\nMany of these chemical compounds are identical or similar to those found in fruits, vegetables, spices, herbs, and other substances. That’s why we chocolate enthusiasts compare the aromas of\ndifferent chocolates to those in toasted bread, grass, wood (bark), leather, melon, mango, citrus, cherry, red berry, plum, raisin, honey, peach, vanilla, butterscotch, herbs, and wine, to name but a few. We’re not being fanciful; there’s a chemical correlation underlying the comparison, and this fact explains the rich metaphorical language used to describe a chocolate’s sensory characteristics.\nWe all taste things differently according to our mood, our own individual physiological make-up, and the time of day, which is why ‘discovering’ chocolate is so much fun and tells us not only about the chocolate but also about ourselves!\nAnd who said chocolate was junk food?\nAbout Sara Jayne Stanes\nSara Jayne Stanes is the founder of The Academy of Chocolate and CEO of the Royal Academy of Culinary Arts, a food writer, author of award-winning book, ‘Chocolate – the Definitive Guide’, and a Chocolate ‘Evangelist’.\nSara was awarded an OBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours in June of 2007, was made an Honorary Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Cooks in 2006, and was awarded the Special Award in the 2011 Catey Awards. She was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of West London where she is also a Visiting Professor.\nThe Royal Academy is Culinary Arts is Britain’s leading association of head chefs, pastry chefs and restaurant managers whose principal aims include raising the standards of food, cooking, and service through education and training, and providing career opportunities for young people. The Academy runs awards schemes, specialised apprenticeships, and ‘Chefs Adopt a School’ (of which Sara is a Trustee). As well as being the Academy’s charity, it is a schools project that teaches children about food in a holistic sense, where it comes from, and the importance of cookery through ‘discovering tastes’ sessions. The RACA supports the Gold Service Scholarship (of which Sara is also a Trustee) started in 2012 to reward talented young professionals in hotel and restaurant food service.\nAs a food writer and chocolate truffle maker, Sara’s love affair with fine chocolate stretches over 20 years. She evangelises about it whenever she can and to whoever will listen! She is passionate about the provenance of ingredients, origins, varieties, breeds, organics, and, above all else, chocolate. She has written ‘Chocolate – The Definitive Guide’, which contains a foreword by Michel Roux OBE. It is the story of 3,500 years of cocoa to chocolate from pod to palate, covering its history, geography, social, and religious applications, nutritional values, tastings, wines pairings, ‘do’s and don’ts, and recipes. ‘Chocolate’ won the Guild of Food Writers Jeremy Round Award in 2000. Sara regularly broadcasts and writes about chocolate, as well as giving lectures, seminars, and tastings.\nSara campaigns to encourage people to ‘look beyond the label’ of their chocolate confectionery. Currently, like much of agriculture across the world, cacao farmers are paid a pittance (average $1.4 per kilo). Between $4-6 would ensure that they maintain a decent standard of living, and would ensure that they would get healthcare and a proper education for their children.

11	framing techniques diamond painting vs macrame wall art mounting differences display methods	Diamond paintings and macramé pieces use distinct display methods. Diamond paintings typically require traditional frames, with the recommendation to use frames slightly smaller than the painting since they have extra borders that can be cut. The diamonds need to be wrapped around the sides using a two-inch overhang for a gallery-style finish. In contrast, macramé wall art is usually mounted using dowel rods as anchors for wall hangings, or metal hoops for circular pieces and mobiles. Macramé doesn't require conventional framing as the knotted design itself creates the finished look.	"[""Diamond painting is a new craft hobby that is a mix between Painting by Numbers and Cross Stitch. With Diamond Painting, you apply thousands of tiny resin diamonds to a coded adhesive canvas to create brilliant diamond art. Adding your diamond painting to a frame gives it an elegant and finished look. Framing your painting is quite an easy process.\nYou can buy a standard frame at any craft store or search for a custom size that fits your specific painting. If you are buying a standard frame in the store, look for one that is a little smaller than your painting. Diamond art paintings have an extra border around the image so you can cut some of this material to fit the frame and focus more on the image itself. According to Chu, diamond painting is a combination of cross stitch and painting by numbers.\nYou use an applicator to apply hundreds of sparkling resin rhinestones, one by one, onto a color-coded canvas adhesive paint, she explains. The end result is a vivid and sparkling work of art. Each piece can be framed and hung in the office, given to a loved one or kept for you to enjoy. Even if you have used square drills, an unprotected diamond painting is more likely to be damaged by dust or dirt, and over time, exposure to the elements can break the adhesive that keeps the diamonds firmly attached to the canvas.\nHowever, most diamond painters feel that diamond painting is not really finished unless it has been stamped. If you're not ready to frame or display your diamond art, check out this post on how to save your diamond painting. If you want the stand to serve as a kind of frame, be sure to select one that complements the colors and theme of your diamond painting. Once you have finished your diamond painting and are ready to store or display it, first spread it out on a flat surface to admire your handwork.\nMark two inches on the back of the diamond painting with a marker or fabric marker, then cut everything except the two-inch overhang with your craft trimming tools. Diamonds can stand out when they are not properly attached to the canvas or, on occasion, you may notice a diamond that has a small imperfection on the surface. This will give you two inches of leftover material that you will use to wrap the diamonds around the sides of the diamond art piece, so the effect will be like an oil painting you would buy from an art gallery. Most of us spend quite a bit of time working on a single diamond painting project because it can take a while to get each bead in the right place.\nIf you just finished a diamond painting and you want it to last, then finishing and sealing the painting is your best option. I have been working diamond paintings for about 2 years and have tried many techniques, from DIY to in-store shopping. When you are sure the painting is complete, take a soft brush (toothbrushes work fine) and remove dust or debris from the diamond painting. The easiest option is simply to cut the excess canvas with sharp scissors designed for fabric or crafts, and this option is certainly used by many diamond painters, especially for works of art with smaller diamonds.\nApply the same method to your diamond painting to mix things up a little in areas with large amounts of the same color."", 'Learn How to Make Macrame Knots and Projects for Free\nMacramé is a 1970s-era craft that, in the past few years, has had a contemporary revival. The knot-based textile art had previously been associated with your groovy grandmother’s house; but today, crafters have transformed macramé into a must-have for cool and cozy home decor.\nIf you’ve seen macramé plant holders or wall hangings and always wanted to try making them for yourself, you’re in luck. The activity is easy to get started as it requires very few materials—the most important is finding your favorite rope or string. Depending on your project, you might also need a dowel rod or rings to hang your work once you’re done.\nLike most crafts, you can learn a great deal of macramé on your own. YouTube is a fantastic (and free!) resource for learning the basic knots and techniques, as well as tutorials for plant hangers, coasters, and more. Scroll down for an essential supply list, YouTube videos to learn knots, and kits you can buy to start your macramé journey.\nEssential Macramé Supplies\nYou can produce your own macramé with shoelaces—so many types of string will do. But as you start the craft, it’s wise to invest in some of these basic materials to help you begin knotting.\n100% Cotton 5mm Twisted Rope\nAs a beginner, you’ll want to look for a 100% cotton 5mm twisted rope. It’s not too thick or too thin and is easy to tie knots with as you work on your macramé dexterity.\n1/4-Inch Braided Cotton Rope\nIf you’re looking for a larger rope (aka sash cord), try this high-quality braided cotton rope sold by Knot & Rope.\n5mm Cotton String\nMany macramé projects have fringed edges. To achieve that effect, use string. Making fringe requires you to unwind string or rope. If you were to unwind rope, you’d find that it’s wound so tight that the fibers are wavy. String, on the other hand, will produce straight strands.\nDowel rods will be the anchor for your wall hangings.\nFor circular wall hangings or macramé mobiles, you’ll want to work with metal hoops. They come in various sizes—often in packs of two or three (or more).\nWhen crafting flat objects—such as coasters—safety pins will help you hold things together.\nLearn Macramé Knots and Patterns on YouTube\nYouTube has a wealth of macramé knowledge.

12	light telescope performance vs radar distance	Radar and optical telescopes behave differently with distance. For radar, as the beam moves further from the radar site, it expands in a cone shape, leading to decreased resolution and accuracy. The beam spreading causes rainfall intensity to be increasingly underestimated and areal coverage to be overestimated at greater distances. Additionally, attenuation causes the signal to weaken over distance. For optical telescopes observing visible light (400-700 nm), the main limitation is that light can be absorbed by dust clouds between stars, acting like an interstellar fog. Radio telescopes, in contrast, can see straight through these dust clouds, though they require large telescopes to achieve good angular resolution due to their long wavelengths.	"['|WHAT IS BEAM SPREADING|\nAND THE CONSEQUENCES?\nMETEOROLOGIST JEFF HABY\nIn a 3-D sense, a beam of radar emission has a cone shape. The tip of the cone is at the radar site and the\ndiameter of the cone gradually increases away from the radar site. As a radar beam moves further from the\nradar, it expands to take up a larger volume. An example of this process is to turn out the lights and shine\na flashlight on the wall. First stand 2 feet from the wall and then gradually stand back further from the wall.\nYou will notice as you keep standing further from the wall that the diameter of the brightest light striking the\nwall becoming larger and larger. You will also notice some light from the flashlight does not stay in the main\nflashlight beam. A small portion of the light fills the room (you will notice that when you shine a flashlight\non the wall that the light becomes dimmer the further away it is from the bright spot on the wall). The light\nthat is not in the main beam is similar to ""side-lobes"" that are produced by radar.\nA process called attenuation occurs as a radar beam of radiation leaves the radar site. Substances in the air\nabsorb some radar radiation including hydrometeors. The more space a beam travels through, the more absorption\nthat will take place of that beam. Energy backscattered from a storm near the radar will be more powerful than\nthe energy backscattered from a distant storm. Backscattered radiation close to the radar does not undergo much\nattenuation. This causes rainfall intensity to be measured higher for storms near the radar as compared to far\nfrom the radar, all else being equal.\nThe resolution of radar data decreases with distance from the radar. A ""range gate"" is the area encompassed by\none pixel of radar data. These range gates become larger with increasing distance from the radar site since\nthe beam is expanding as it moves away from the radar site. Large range gates will result in less resolution.\nAn analogy is to think of two computer images where one looks crisp and sharp while another looks grainy. The\ngrainy image has larger pixels and thus has a poorer resolution. The consequence of having a larger range gate\nresults in an overestimation of the areal extent of rainfall. The value of dBZ in a range gate represents the\naverage dBZ within that range gate. Also, the entire range gate must be filled with a dBZ value. In actuality,\nprecipitation and/or heavy precipitation may only be occurring in part of the range gate. Since every range gate\nmust be filled that has reflectivity coming from it, this causes the area that precipitation covers to be larger\non radar than in actuality. This error increases with distance from the radar.\nIn situations where only part of the range gate is filled, the reflectivity will be lower in that range gate than\nis occurring in actuality with the precipitation that is occurring in part of the range gate. The reflectivity\nwill be lower because the reflectivity must be averaged over the entire range gate. As range gate size increases,\nit becomes increasingly more likely that only part of the range gate is being filled with precipitation and/or\nTo sum up, as beam spreading increases (diameter of cone increases), rainfall intensity is increasingly\nunderestimated, rainfall areal coverage is increasingly overestimated and precipitation and/or heavy precipitation\nin only part of the range gate increasingly becomes averaged over a larger area.\nThe image below shows the errors produced by beam spreading. The radar site is in Columbus. Notice as you go\nfurther south the range gates become larger. The storms at the edge of the radar look more grainy and larger than\nthe storms close to the radar. The storms near the edge of the radar are in actuality smaller than\nshown by radar. The storms near the edge of the radar are also being sampled at a higher elevation\nthan the storms close to radar.', 'Whats is Radio Astronomy?\nIntroduction: What is radio astronomy [reference: pictortelescope.com]\nRadio astronomy is a subfield of astronomy that studies celestial objects at radio frequencies. Unlike traditional telescopes that observe the sky in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum (400-700 nm), radio telescopes observe the sky in wavelengths ranging from centimeters to a few meters.\nA diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum, showing various properties across the range of frequencies and wavelengths.\nBut why should we observe in radio wavelengths?\nThere are several reasons to observe the sky at radio frequencies. The most common reason radio astronomers point radio telescopes to the sky is to study sources that produce radio emissions: radiation that is invisible to the human eye, but is capable of providing compelling information to astronomers & astrophysicists.\nA significant advantage radio astronomers have over IR, UV and high-energy astronomers is the atmospheric window: our atmosphere is completely transparent to radio waves, so we don’t need to send large radio antennas to space (like we usually have to do with IR/UV/high-energy astronomy satellites) in order to efficiently expose our instruments to the sky.\nA diagram showing the amount of absorption of each wavelength of light by the Earth’s atmosphere, highlighting the atmospheric windows.\nIt is also worth noting that radio observations can be carried out during both daytime and nighttime, and even under poor weather conditions (e.g. clouds)!\nLast but not least, we can utilize the techniques of radio interferometry and aperture synthesis using large arrays of antennas to achieve extremely high (angular) resolution observations, which is how the first image of a black hole became possible (the combination of several radio telescopes around the world allowed the Event Horizon Telescope team to create a virtual telescope the size of the Earth)!\nThe Very Large Array (VLA) is one of the most sophisticated radio telescope arrays in the world, consisting of twenty-seven 25-meter radio antennas that can function as a high-resolution radio interferometer.\nSo… What can I observe with a radio telescope?\nThere are plenty of sources in the sky that present radio emissions, including galaxies, supernova remnants, nebulae, radio galaxies, quasars, pulsars, masers and more. Since the radio telescope you’ll be using is primarily used to detect the neutral hydrogen concentration of the spiral arms of the galaxy, we will focus our attention on the hydrogen line.\nThe 21-centimeter hydrogen line\nThe hydrogen line refers to the electromagnetic radiation spectral line that is created by a change in the energy state of neutral hydrogen atoms. This electromagnetic radiation is at the approximate frequency of 1420.4 MHz, which is equivalent to the wavelength of approximately 21 cm ( λ =c/v). This wavelength falls within the radio region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and it is frequently observed by radio astronomers.\nThe exact mechanism under which hydrogen atoms emit electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of 21 cm is slightly complicated.\nWhy observe at radio wavelengths?\nThere are several reasons to observe at radio wavelengths. Below we will show you the advantages and disadvantages:\nRadio astronomy can be done from the earth without being too much affected by the weather (although the quality of the observations is better with good weather)! However, there is now also a radio antenna in space, to further improve the resolution of the observations.\nDay and night\nRadio telescopes observe day and night (although for some observations the influence of the sun is negative!)\nAbout 90 % of the visible matter in the Universe is Hydrogen (wavelength: 21.106114 cm). With a radio telescope, we can study the most abundant element in the Universe.\nRadio waves are not affected by absorption. Optical waves are absorbed by e.g. dust clouds that are floating between the stars (like a sort of interstellar fog ). Radio telescopes see straight through these dust clouds.\nOn the negative side, to get good quality images that show all the details of the celestial objects it is more complicated than, e.g. at optical wavelengths. This has to do with long wavelengths of radio waves. To get good angular resolution requires large telescopes.\nA complicated procedure is required to produce the images of the observed objects (in other words, the observer does not see the images straight away). This procedure uses very powerful computers and it is necessary because of the way the observations are done.']"	['<urn:uuid:9ebe4e2a-dc9a-45c4-a63c-f5929406c6c6>', '<urn:uuid:c0cec02f-19fe-4092-af2b-f3bbee760a0f>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	6	112	1401
13	number deaths caused by radon yearly	According to the EPA, Radon is responsible for 21,000 lung cancer deaths every year. Nearly 2,900 of these deaths occur among people who have never smoked.	"['""We were somewhat concerned about the expense of having an inspection done, but now that we have our report in hand, we can see it was well worth it!""\nIs Radon Risk Real?\nYou have heard of radon. Perhaps you have tested your home or the home you intended to buy for the presence of radon gas. If so, when you received the results, did you take any action? Did you install a mitigation pump or even refuse to purchase the home?\nIs radon risk real? There is a wealth of information out there. Let’s review some facts. Let’s look at what leading agencies are saying. Then let’s review our engineering perspective on radon risk and tips on what you can do before you build or after you buy.\nWhat is Radon? Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that occurs from the natural breakdown of uranium in soil, rocks and water. The gas is highly toxic, odorless, and colorless.\nHow does Radon gas enter the homes? Radon seeps into homes through:\n- cracks in basement or slab floors\n- construction joints\n- cracks in walls\n- gaps in suspended floors\n- gaps around service pipes\n- cavities inside walls\n- water supply\nEssentially all homes – old, new, slab or stone foundation – are at risk, even if your home does not have a basement.\nWhat increases Radon concentration? Radon levels tend to be higher in homes that are built near large rock masses or mountains. In addition, improper ventilation causes increased radon due to lack of airflow. Simply opening a window or installing fans to promote air flow in basements can lower radon levels in the home.\nWhere in the US is Radon most prevalent?\nWhat are the medical effects of Radon exposure? According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Radon is responsible for 21,000 lung cancer deaths every year. Nearly 2,900 of these deaths occur among people who have never smoked. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that Radon is estimated to cause between 3% and 14% of all lung cancers, more likely in people who smoke. While statistics can be debated, scientists and researchers agree that any exposure to Radon can be harmful and may cause cancer.\nHow much Radon is too much? The EPA’s limit for Radon concentration in a home (set in the 1980s) is 4 picoCuries per liter of air (pCi/L). However, under 4 pCi/L does not necessarily imply a safer home. The agency states that nearly 1 out of every 15 homes in the United States is estimated to have an elevated radon level (4 pCi/L or more).\nHow do I find out if my home or the one I want to purchase is at risk?\nYou can purchase a do-it-yourself radon test kit online or at your local home improvement store. Kits typically cost between $10 and $30. They are not very accurate as radon concentrations can fluctuate by a factor of two. This means a quick, one-time test – even if the test takes 2-3 days – may not provide an accurate radon concentration reading of the home. The most accurate tests take up to 90 days and provide a more realistic summary of day-to-day average concentration of radon in the home. The EPA also recommends that you test various areas of your home, especially during and after renovations, and test every two years.\nYou can find a licensed professional in your area or state-specific radon information by visiting http://www.epa.gov/radon/whereyoulive.html and selecting your state.\nMitigating risk when building new homes or buying old ones\nAs the facts state and the map shows, potential exposure to radon gas in the home is indeed a real risk. Arm yourself with solutions to mitigate radon risk. When building a new home, engineers recommend installing a sub-slab ventilation system. It is a relatively simple fix to increase ventilation below the slab. Air flows through the system, thereby collecting any possible radon that is seeping up from the soil and removing it before it reaches the slab. This system can then be adapted to an active, mechanical system if levels of radon increase. Any measures you take while building to keep out radon can prevent higher mitigation costs in the future.\nAs a new home ages, the slab or foundation will crack, allowing radon to enter. WHO’s website has multiple suggestions for reducing the radon concentration in older homes:\n- improve the ventilation of the house\n- avoid the passage of radon from the basement into upper living spaces\n- increase under-floor ventilation\n- install a radon sump system in the basement\n- seal floors and walls\nThe severity of the radon levels in the home, will dictate the extensiveness of the needed mitigation.\nBefore blowing money on equipment or mitigation, try some simple techniques to improve ventilation then retest radon levels before consulting a professional.\nFor the office nearest you, call 1-800-242-1969.\nCopyright © 2014 Criterium Engineers']"	['<urn:uuid:8c3831d4-5aba-4abd-83ae-1c59d74a8986>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	6	26	823

According to the documents, robots cannot keep up with human creativity - they cannot create truly new and valuable ideas like poetry, music, recipes, jokes, fashion designs or scientific theories. While robots can randomly combine old ideas, the results don't necessarily make sense or have value. In contrast, human astronauts have proven highly capable during planetary exploration, as demonstrated during Apollo missions where crews conducted 14 successful EVAs (spacewalks) totaling over 81 hours and covering nearly 60 miles of traverse distance on the lunar surface. This shows humans' unique ability to make real-time decisions and adapt to complex situations during exploration.	"['Robots need electrical components to control and power machines.

The ACES was not designed to perform EVAs.The Russian Orlan and Sokol, while slightly varied in design, have many of the same limitations.To support the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) and Constellation objectives, it is necessary to develop a new pressurized suit system. One that is smart and evolvable.\n11 Design Challenges (1 vs 2 vs 3 suits…) The broad range of operational environments that this new suit system will be required to support poses some new challenges in selecting and designing the appropriate suit architecture.However, the potential programmatic benefits of developing, operating and sustaining a common/evolvable single suit system architecture warrant a more thorough examination.Development of a single integrated IVA/EVA suit system that satisfies all of the Constellation capability requirements versus a multiple suit approach is a programmatic decision that is at the forefront of the Exploration pressure suit development activity.\n12 Design Challenges (1 vs 2 vs 3 suits…) Some basic design challenges that need to be examined includeFor IVA un-pressurized periods, the suit needs to support the crew for long periods of time (i.e. launch/entry/abort and in-flight powered phases). These phases alone would lean towards a lightweight, low-bulk, all fabric-based garment structure, minimizing hard-contact points.For EVA, more gross mobility is necessary to support planetary exploration. For surface EVA alone, this would lean towards a more rigid, high bulk suit for operating in an upright position but could be uncomfortable to wear in a recumbent position as necessary for IVA phases.\n13 The overall NASA goal is to get to Mars by using LEO and Lunar missions as stepping stones Initial Prove-OutSystem VerificationImprove DesignEtc.Long Term TestingPlanetary EVAHabitatEtc.Final GoalLong Term UseReliabilityMaintainability\n14 Maintenance Goal = 4% of EVA Time Repair Goal = 1% of EVA Time The number of EVA’s between overhauls will need to significantly increase in order to support future missionsShuttleISSLunar/Mars(1)Recertification5XRedesign20X5 EVA25 EVA300 – 500 EVAMaintenance Goal = 4% of EVA TimeRepair Goal = 1% of EVA TimeNotes: (1) Assumes 2 year mission, EVA every other day\n15 Schematic Need Statement EVA ChallengesSchematic Need StatementPLSS Packaging DriverThere are many technology components and system options already in development that may support VSE EVA requirementsShuttle/ISS EMUComponent Weight: 73 lbsPackaging Weight: 79 lbsTotal: 152 lbsMars: lbsPLSS design objectivesFlexible (upgradeable & evolvable)Mission maintainableSmallReliableLightweightRobustNASA must determine the optimum combination of these life support technologies (i.e., a functional support schematic) that meets the mission requirements\n16 Technology Options to Consider CO2/Humidity ControlVent Flow and Pressure ControlThermal ControlOxygenPowerElectronicsPackaging Concepts\n17 Shuttle Extravehicular ChallengesSSA129 lbs.PLSS200 lbs.Total329 lbs.PF: 2.20SSAxxx lbs.PLSS145 lbs.TotalPF: 1.59SSA35 lbs.PLSS65 lbs.Total100 lbs.PF: 1.24Shuttle ExtravehicularMobility UnitMk.

15	I want to register my brand name but I'm worried because it has the word 'Super' in it - should I add something else to make it work?	Yes, you should combine descriptive elements like 'Super' with other distinctive elements to create a registrable trade mark. While 'Super' alone cannot be registered since it's descriptive, adding distinctive elements can make the trade mark as a whole eligible for protection. For example, while 'WATCHES' alone can't be protected for watches, 'MEIER WATCHES' can be eligible for protection.	"['Any sign that is capable of being represented graphically can, in principle, be a trade mark if it is able to distinguish the goods or services of your company from those of your competitors.\nYour trade mark must fulfil certain requirements in order to be able to be registered.\nA trade mark is considered descriptive if it contains information on possible characteristics of the goods or services, such as quality, geographical origin or function. Therefore, you can\'t register “Super” or “Bike” as a trade mark. Terms that competitors are dependent on for describing their goods or services – for example, “Waterproof” for clothing – also can\'t be protected as a trade mark. Descriptive signs such as these belong to the public domain.\n- HYDRO COSMETIQUE for cosmetics\n- SUPEROIL for lubricating oil\n- CAFE SUISSE for catering\nCombine a descriptive element with other elements so that the trade mark as a whole can be registered. The consumer must perceive your trade mark as a distinctive reference to your company. For example, the word mark WATCHES can\'t be used to protect watches. However, by adding the distinctive element MEIER to create MEIER WATCHES, this results in a word mark that can be eligible for protection for watches manufactured by your company.\nSigns that belong to the public domain, such as descriptive signs, can be protected as a trade mark if they have achieved recognition on the market as being a trade mark for the goods or services of a particular company. In trade mark jargon, this is called ‘acquired distinctiveness’. In this case, the sign must have been used extensively as a trade mark in Switzerland for several years (known as trade mark-related use).\nFor example: the yellow colour mark of Swiss Post Ltd; the word mark ‘Läckerli Huus’.\nA trade mark is considered deceptive if it raises false expectations in consumers with regard to the characteristics of the goods or services, such as to the origin. You can\'t use a trade mark with the element “Switzerland” for goods and services from France. Equally, you can only use indications such as “William Tell” or “Säntis” to protect goods and services of Swiss origin. Additionally, indications concerning quality or properties can also be deceptive, such as trade marks with the element “Café” for coffee substitutes or “Gold” for gold-plated goods.\n- Beltina Suisse for bicycles from France\n- VITAMINREICH for alcoholic drinks\n- Meier Café for coffee substitutes\nA trade mark containing the element “Switzerland” can be registered if the list of goods and services is restricted to those of Swiss origin (→ Indications of source).\nExample of a trade mark with a limited product list:\nList of goods and/or services:\n""29 Fromage de provenance suisse""\n- Signs that are in conflict with national legislation and/or with Switzerland\'s obligations under international treaties are in breach of applicable law.\n- Signs that could hurt the sensitivities of foreign nationals, tarnish Switzerland\'s reputation or disrupt diplomatic relations are in breach of public policy.\n- Signs that have a racist or obscene connotation or hurt religious sentiments or are of a sexually offensive nature are in breach of public morality.\n- UNO for motor bikes\n- 11th September 2001 for aircraft\n- MOHAMMED for alcoholic drinks\nA trade mark will only be registered if it fulfils all of the requirements for protection.

16	How many flight hours will the RACER demonstrator test?	The flight test regime of the RACER demonstrator will amount to about 200 flight hours.	['CleanSky, April 03, 2019 - Now into the final year of its 48-month timeline, Clean Sky’s CA³TCH (Comprehensive Aerodynamic - Aeroacoustic Analysis of a Trimmed Compound Helicopter) project is strengthening the competitive position of the EU aeronautics industry and underpinning European international aviation.\nIts primary aim is to establish the simulation technology required to support the aerodynamic design and development of Airbus’s RACER (Rapid And Cost-Efficient Rotorcraft) demonstrator, all the way from rough estimates to detailed design and analysis at different flight states, through to the point of first flight.\nIt’s a comprehensive research study taking account of the full external aerodynamic behaviour of the compound rotorcraft, whereby aerodynamics and aeroacoustics are being investigated through full-featured structural simulation and flight mechanics, using a ’Digital Wind Tunnel’.\n”The goal of CA³TCH is to reduce risks before the first flight by elaborate flow simulations. This encompasses flight stability in adverse conditions, power and control limits in different flight regimes and, not least, noise emissions” says Dr. Manuel Keßler, Head of Helicopters and Aeroacoustics at the Institut für Aerodynamik und Gasdynamik (IAG) at Universität Stuttgart. ”Our unique advanced simulation framework at IAG is able to provide accurate and dependable answers to such questions by means of heavy use of supercomputing power”.\nThis means, in practical terms, the University’s ’virtual simulations’ will provide insights to support the development process related to aerodynamic and aeroacoustic optimisation, flight mechanics properties and even handling qualities to a certain extent – all before the actual physical prototype leaves the ground. As the project approaches its final months CA³TCH will offer a potential ’halo effect’ as publication and dissemination efforts in the pipeline spread this enhanced capability to related areas of European industry, from fixed wings to wind turbines.\nThe focus of CA³TCH started with detailed investigations of the flight mechanic stability and aerodynamic interference of the compound helicopter’s rotor and wing under numerous flight conditions. Anticipating the wide range of operations that the vehicle will be potentially capable of, analyses were made of transverse and reverse flights, download factors on the wings – especially in hover mode – and flight stability, with focus on autorotation and other critical flight states, such as slow lateral flight.\nAdditionally, study has been ongoing of the most efficient operations possible at high speeds as well as noise evaluations, where acoustic analysis of the rotorcraft focuses on interference phenomena between the main rotor and propellers and the interaction of the sound generated there with the airframe.\nHighly accurate CFD simulation of the complete vehicle configuration with all its components, including consideration of the flow-structure coupling on the elastic rotor blades, and trimmed in load-free stationary flight, is eliciting valuable information about the predicted behaviour of the RACER, long before any hardware is manufactured. Hence, safety-critical issues can be identified and managed at an early stage, significantly reducing the risk before the first flight, resulting in condensed development time and cost reduction.\n”Several million CPU-hours (equivalent to some thousand years on a desktop computer) of computing time have been invested, and the results have helped Airbus Helicopters to gain a better insight into the phenomena occurring on this innovative configuration” says Keßler. ”They have cross-checked their own findings based on other tools, and sometimes we observed surprising issues necessitating adaptations, in order to mitigate. Three PhD candidates at IAG work on this ambitious undertaking”.\nFollowing validation of the RACER demonstrator’s aerodynamic configuration last year, key subsystems have now successfully passed their Preliminary Design Review, paving the way for manufacture of the first components, with final assembly of the prototype planned in Q4 2019.\n”First flight of the RACER prototype is currently scheduled for 2020” says Keßler, and the flight test regime of the actual demonstrator will amount to about 200 flight hours. But none of this would be possible without the additional digital wind tunnel analyses of Clean Sky’s CA³TCH. Keßler adds that ”if successful, this may evolve into a future product of Airbus Helicopters, achieving unprecedented efficiently and flight speeds, for a rotorcraft, thus enabling mission capabilities that are currently unavailable”.']	['<urn:uuid:06c14d4c-87f1-4cd9-b114-b02520485ffb>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	9	15	678
17	What was the military significance of the Dukla Pass battle during World War II, and how does it compare to other memorials for unknown soldiers from that conflict?	The Battle of Dukla Pass was one of the bloodiest battles on the Eastern Front, resulting in over 70,000 casualties on both sides while attempting to support Slovak rebels against Nazi Germany. The Soviet operation to capture the pass took from September 8 to October 6, 1944, much longer than the planned 5 days, due to heavy German fortifications. The battle is commemorated by several memorials and cemeteries in the region, including one erected by the Czechoslovak government in 1949 containing hundreds of Russian and Czechoslovak soldiers' graves. In comparison, other World War II unknown soldier memorials include the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery containing remains from WWII, and the Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery in Tokyo.	"['|Battle of the Dukla Pass|\n|Part of the Eastern Front of World War II|\nKingdom of Hungary (1920–46)\n|Commanders and leaders|\n2,000 artillery pieces\n120,000 - 150,000 Soviet soldiers|\n16,700 Czechoslovak soldiers\n1,517 artillery pieces\n|Casualties and losses|\n20,000- 21,000 dead|\n80,000< – 123,000 total\nThe Battle of the Dukla Pass, also known as the Dukla / Carpatho-Dukla / Rzeszów-Dukla / Dukla-Prešov Offensive was the scene of bitterly contested battle for the Dukla Pass (borderland between Poland and Slovakia) on the Eastern Front of World War II between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in September–October 1944. It was part of the Soviet Eastern Carpathian Strategic Offensive Operation that also included the Carpathian-Uzhgorod Offensive. The operation\'s primary goal to provide support for the Slovaks was not achieved, however it concluded the full liberation of the Ukraine in its modern borders by the occupation of the Subcarpathian region as a territory of the former Carpatho-Ukraine.\nThe German resistance in the eastern Carpathian region was much harder than expected. The battle which began on 8 September would not see the Soviet forces on the other side of the pass until 6 October, and German forces would stop their heavy resistance in the region only around 10 October. Five days to Prešov turned into fifty days to Svidník alone with over 70,000 casualties on both sides. Prešov that was to be reached in six days remained beyond the Czechoslovaks\' grasp for four months. The battle would be counted among one of the most bloody in the entire Eastern Front and in the history of Slovakia; one of the valleys in the pass near villages of Kapišová, Chyrowa, Iwla and Głojsce would become known as the Valley of Death.\nIn summer 1944, Slovaks rebelled against the Nazis and the Czechoslovak government appealed to Soviets for help. On 31 August, Soviet marshal Ivan Konev was ordered to prepare plans for an offensive to destroy Nazi forces in Slovakia. The plan was to push through the old Slovak-Polish border in the Carpathian Mountains via the Dukla Pass near Svidník to penetrate into Slovakia proper.\nIn the meantime, however, the Germans had fortified the region, forming the Karpatenfestung (""Carpathian fortress"") or Árpád line.\nThe Soviet operation plan called for the Soviet forces to cross the pass and capture the town of Prešov within five days.\nThe operation started on 8 September. It took the Soviets three days to take Krosno (it was captured on 11 September). One of the biggest battles in the pass took place on and around Hill 534 in the northwest from the town of Dukla; the battle to capture this hill lasted from 10–20 September, and during that period the control of the hill changed more than 20 times. The town of Dukla was seized on 21 September. The area of the former Czechoslovak state border—heavily fortified by the Germans—was captured on 6 October; it took almost a month for the Soviet forces to reach Slovakia.\nThe Dukla operation did not end when the Soviets forced the pass. The combat zone shifted to Eastern Slovakia, with Soviet forces trying to outflank and push back the German forces, still strong and having many fortified positions. South of the pass and directly west of the village of Dobroslava lies an area which has come to be known as the ""Valley of Death"". Here Soviet and German armor clashed in a miniature reenactment of the great tank battle of Kursk. Soviet and Czechoslovak forces would enter Svidník on 28 October. A major German fortified position near the pass, Hill 532 ""Obšár"", would be secured as late as on 25 November 1944.\nThe Slovak National Uprising was mostly crushed by the time Soviet units secured Slovak territories; one of the main reasons for it was that the German resistance in the Dukla Pass was much heavier than expected. Another factor was that the Slovak insurgent forces failed to secure the other side of the pass, as planned by the Slovak and Soviet commanders during early preparations.\nThe Soviet delay and eventual failure in providing support for the insurgents led to the accusations that it was deliberate, just as in the case of the Warsaw Uprising — that Joseph Stalin wanted to weaken the Czechoslovak forces to facilitate the eventual Soviet takeover of that country.\nIn 1949, the Czechoslovak government erected a memorial and cemetery southeast of the Dukla border crossing, in Vyšný Komárnik, the first liberated village on the territory of (then) Czechoslovakia. It contains the graves of several hundred Russian and Czechoslovak soldiers. Several other memorials and cemeteries have also been erected in the region.\nOrder of battle\n- Elements of 1st Ukrainian Front, Marshal Ivan Konev commanding\n- Elements of 4th Ukrainian Front:\n- Army Group Heinrici\n- Andrusikiewicz J., Boje o Przełęcz Dukielską (w:) ""Wierchy"" t. 37, Kraków 1968\n- Grzywacz-Świtalski Ł., Z walk na Podkarpaciu, Warszawa 1971\n- Luboński P., Operacja dukielsko-preszowska (w:) Magury’ 83, Warszawa 1983\n- Michalak J., Dukla i okolice, Krosno 1996\n- Post-Dukla 1944 Soviet Offensive Operations in Eastern Slovakia\n- Maps of operations in Carpathian Mountains including battle of the Dukla Pass: http://rkkaww2.armchairgeneral.com/maps/1944SW/1UF/CZ/s17_Carpatians_Sep_Nov44_eng.jpg, http://www.rkka.ru/maps/dukl.gif, https://archive.is/20130117045604/rkkaww2.armchairgeneral.com/maps/1944SW/1UF/CZ/38A_Dukla_s04_Sept27_Nov8_44.gif\n- Diorama painting and Google Earth view of the pass\n- Commemorative medal of the Battle of Dukla Pass\n- Monuments to the battle\n|This page uses Creative Commons Licensed content from Wikipedia (view authors).|', 'Tomb of the Unknown Soldier\nA Tomb of the Unknown Soldier refers to a monument in dedication to the services of an unknown soldier and to the common memories of all soldiers killed in any war. Such tombs can be found in many nations and are usually high-profile national monuments. Throughout history, many soldiers have died in war with their remains being unidentified. Following World War I, a movement arose to commemorate these soldiers with a single tomb, containing the body of one such unidentified soldier.\nBritain and France\nDuring the First World War, the British and French armies jointly decided to bury soldiers themselves. In Britain, under the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission), the Reverend David Railton had seen a grave marked by a rough cross while serving in the British Army as a chaplain on the Western Front, which bore the pencil-written legend ""An Unknown British Soldier"". He suggested (together with the French in their own country) the creation at a national level of a symbolic funeral and burial of an ""Unknown Warrior"", proposing that the grave should in Britain include a national monument in the form of what is usually, but not in this particular case, a headstone. The idea received the support of the Dean of Westminster, Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and later from King George V, responding to a wave of public support. At the same time, there was a similar undertaking in France, where the idea was debated and agreed upon in Parliament.\nBritain and France conducted services connected with their \'monumental\' graves (as presumably newly conceived, and in any case approved, by their respective armies) on Armistice Day 1920 (the burial itself taking place later in January of the following year in France). In Britain, the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior was created at Westminster Abbey, while in France La tombe du soldat inconnu was placed in the Arc de Triomphe.\nThe idea of a symbolic Tomb of the Unknown Soldier then spread to other countries. In 1921, the Tomb of the Unknowns (United States), Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Portugal) and Monument to Vittorio Emanuele—Unknown Soldier (Italy) were all unveiled. Other nations have followed the practice and created their own tombs.\nIn the United States and other countries, tombs have also been created representing the fallen of other wars in their history. In Chile and Ukraine, second \'unknown tombs\' were unveiled to commemorate The Unknown Sailor.\nThe Tombs of the Unknown Soldiers typically contain the remains of a dead soldier who is unidentified (or ""known but to God"" as the stone is sometimes inscribed). The remains are considered impossible to be identified, and so serve as a symbol for all of a country\'s unknown dead wherever they fell in the war being remembered. The anonymity of the entombed soldier is the key symbolism of the monument; it could be the tomb of anyone who fell in service of the nation, and therefore serves as a monument symbolizing all of the sacrifices.\nTombs of the Unknown Soldier from around the world and various wars include:\n|Argentina||Metropolitan Cathedral in Buenos Aires||100px||Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the Independence|\n|Australia||Australian War Memorial in Canberra||100px||The tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.|\n|Austria||Heldenplatz in Vienna|||\n|Bangladesh||Jatiyo Smriti Soudho in Savar Upazila||100px||Jatiyo Sriti Shoudho (Bengali: জাতীয় স্মৃতি সৌধ Jatio Sriti Shoudho) or National Martyrs\' Memorial is the national monument of Bangladesh is the symbol in the memory of the valour and the sacrifice of all those who gave their lives in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, many of whom were buried in mass graves in that park.The monument is located in Savar, about 35 km north-west of the capital, Dhaka.

18	compare confucius buddhist approach dealing with human desires control difference	The approaches differ in how they handle desires - Buddha teaches that one must completely free oneself from desires and give them up entirely in order to achieve enlightenment, as desires condemn one to suffering. In contrast, according to the comparison made in the first document, Confucius would simply ignore desires rather than try to extirpate them, taking a more passive approach focused on self-sufficiency rather than active elimination.	"['The Tao Teh King: A Short Study in Comparative Religion, by C. Spurgeon Medhurst, , at sacred-texts.com\n""In every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him."" The Spirit of God is confined to no sect, religion, race nor creed. Wherever hearts are still and aspirations pure the vision may dawn, the voice of inspiration be heard. God has spoken to man in many languages, and the translator of the present work was supported throughout what was often an arduous task by the belief that the Tao-teh-king is a message from above. Like all ancient writings, it may have suffered at the hands of time, but as I have endeavored to show in my notes and comments on the text, the teaching is one which the inner consciousness of all ages has recognized as The Truth. Though Lao-tzu\'s accent is his own, it is easily seen to be but a dialect of the universal tongue. ""And I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall recline with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.""\nMany are the editions of the Tao-teh-king (vid. the list at the end of this book), but has Lao-tzu ever really been translated? If I have in any measure succeeded where others have failed it is because I have built on their labors. The Chinese is difficult, and mistakes are perhaps inevitable, but I have taken pains to reduce these to a minimum, and with the utmost care have consulted in detail the works of Legge, Balfour, Giles, Carus, Kingsmill, Maclagan, Old and von Strauss during the whole of my preliminary labors. Although unable to agree with any of these gentlemen in their interpretations, to all I am indebted for guidance and suggestions while working my way through the terse obscurity of the Chinese. In the course of my researches I have consulted nearly an equal number of native commentaries, but my chief claim to having come nearer to Lao-tzu\'s meaning than my predecessors is the fact that it requires a mystic to understand a mystic, and although I dare not venture to number myself with the mystics, I may confess that long before I dreamed of being presumptuous enough to endeavor to translate Lao-tzu into my own tongue, I was accustomed to carry his writing with me on my itineraries as a sort of spiritual vade mecum. My present rendering of the ancient\nphilosopher is not so much a specimen of scholarship as the humble offering of a disciple. The difficulties which lie across the pathway of anyone attempting such a work may be illustrated by a quotation from Dr. Legge\'s preface to the Yi King (Sacred Books of the East), Vol. xvi: ""The written characters of the Chinese,"" writes this eminent scholar, ""are not representations of words, but symbols of ideas, … the combination of them in composition is not a representation of what the writer would say, but of what he thinks. It is vain, therefore, for a translator to attempt a literal version.… In the study of a Chinese classical book there is not so much an interpretation of the characters employed by the writer as a participation of his thoughts—there is a seeing of mind to mind."" In this last sentence the Doctor has unconsciously explained why he so signally failed in his efforts to render Lao-tzu into English. Prof. Legge, one of the foremost Chinese scholars of his day, was wholly Confucianist in his sympathies, and it is a pity that so faulty a translation as is his version of the Tao-teh-king should have obtained the prominence and importance which it derives from its inclusion in that monumental series, ""The Sacred Books of the East.""\nIt only remains for me to add in this connection that I have made no attempt to accomplish the impossible and reproduce the measured rhythm of the original, but have contented myself with rendering the whole into as clear and concise English as I could command, without reference to the regulated cadences in which a large part of the Chinese has been written. Neither have I considered it worth while entering into any technical defense of my renderings. Such would only have been of interest to sinologues, and sinologues will have no use for such a work as the present little book.\nIn his ""Remains of Lao-tzu,"" Prof. Giles has endeavored to prove that there is very little of the real Lao-tzu in the essay which goes under his name. Though perhaps few scholars would follow Mr. Giles in all his slashing criticisms—the learned doctor lacks all the qualities necessary for the understanding of a mystical work—it may be admitted that the shadowy and broken progression in the development of the basic ideas of the Tao-teh-king, together with the seemingly needless repetitions, suggest that what we have are but the higher peaks of a submerged continent, not the entire\nmap of the old Mystic\'s scheme. The thought of the book is a buried thought, the connections of its sentences spiritual rather than grammatical. Divided into two parts, Part I may be described as ""metaphysical,"" Part II as ""moral,"" but the division is rough and not accurate. Were such a liberty allowable, it would be comparatively easy to rearrange the sections into a more orderly sequence than that which they now occupy. Perhaps the index in front may do something to remedy the existing irregularities of the text, while the bibliography, the most complete that has been published, will inform the student where he can find whatever is known of ancient Taoism, unless indeed he is able to search for himself the enormous mass of Chinese literature dealing with the topic.\nIn dealing with the Tao-teh-king, it is hardly possible to avoid some reference to the sister religion, Confucianism, as it sprang from the same soil and from among the same people. Both Lao-tzu and Confucius appeal to pre-existing authorities. Before their day the two systems probably formed one ideal plan for life; since then, however, there has been a growing tendency to separate the practical ethics of the one from the metaphysical mysticism of the other. Yet many devout Confucianists study Lao-tzu\'s classic with deep interest, but privately, and as those who read heretical works.\nLao-tzu, like Buddha, would extirpate desire; Confucius, like the Stoics, would ignore it. The asceticism of Lao-tzu is matched by the self-sufficiency of Confucius, and each agrees that the desire which ends in self is an evil. As regards cosmogony, it is interesting to note that while the practical Confucianist has a metaphysical explanation for the origin of the universe, the metaphysical Lao-tzu is content to put forward his TAO as an explanation of the whole, without attempting to say how anything came to be.\nAs for Lao-tzu\'s Tao, which is as untranslatable as the algebraic x, and which von Strauss, in the thirty-third section of his introduction to the Tao-teh-king, compares to the Sanskrit Buddhi, it may be said that it has much in common\nwith the Primeval Fire or Aether of Heracleitus. The properties of mind and matter may be attributed to both; both become transformed into the elements; and in both the elements vanish into the primordial All, though Lao-tzu, of course, gives us nothing like the theologic-cosmogonical system of the Greek.\nLao-tzu presents us with the Tao under two aspects—the undifferentiated Nameless, and the differentiated Universal Life, in this agreeing with the Bhagavad Gita, in which we read: ""There are two Purushas in this world, the destructible and the indestructible; the destructible (is) all beings, the unchanging (is) called the indestructible."" (xv-16.) Again, as in the Confucian cosmogony, THE Absolute or The Unlimited is always behind The Great Extreme from whose vibrations everything sprang, so there lies behind the Tao, which is nameable, the Tao which cannot be named.\nNotwithstanding Lao-tzu\'s reverence for the mysterious, he never sacrifices Man to the Divine. On the contrary, throughout the Tao-teh-king, the individuality of the True Man is emphasized in every possible way. The goal of humanity is only possible by complete union with the Tao—the Ultimate Unity of the Universe. If the Tao-teh-king teaches anything it certainly teaches this. Thus, like all religions in all ages, Lao-tzu points to Yoga or union, as the summum bonum of existence. The Perfected Men, or The Sages, are those who have attained to this great good. ""As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine, so neither can ye; except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches.""\nThe weakest part of Lao-tzu\'s teachings may perhaps be thought to be his utopian conceptions of a model State. Like Plato, he seems to have thought that ""until kings are philosophers, or philosophers are kings, cities will never cease from ill,"" and not only like Plato does he appear to consider the study of economics, law, or finance as unnecessary qualifications for a legislator, but he requires no education for the citizens of his ideal republic. Spirituality rather\nthan political economy is to be the basis of this strange kingdom. Its appeals are not made to men\'s hopes and fears, but to the calm passionlessness of their higher natures. Its controlling force is not militarism, but spiritual culture. Both rulers and people obtain all they require by the abstract contemplation of an abstract good. Everything is reduced to the purest simplicity. In many respects Lao-tzu\'s completed society corresponds to the ""natural and spiritual theocracy"" which Saint Martin of Tours describes in his ""Lettre a un ami sur La Revolution Française.""\nLao-tzu loves paradox, and his sayings are frequently as paradoxical as the Sayings in the Gospels. In his extreme assertions as to what constitutes a perfect State he is endeavoring to show that righteousness alone exalteth a nation, and that whatever clouds the nation\'s conceptions of this is worse than valueless. The student must never forget that Lao-tzu, being a mystic, is no more susceptible to literal interpretation when he deals with the concrete than is the word of Jesus, ""Cast not your pearls before swine."" No absolute rule of conduct is conveyed by this expression, yet who does not perfectly understand its meaning? So with Lao-tzu\'s politics; they are physical illustrations of spiritual truths. Lao-tzu\'s only concern is that the government shall give free development to the individual spiritual life of each citizen in the State; this secured, an autocracy might equal a democracy. A passage in Epictetus illustrates Lao-tzu\'s position: ""Do this, do not this, or I will cast thee into prison—this is not a rule for reasoning beings. But—\'As Zeus has ordered so do thou act; but if thou dost not thou shalt suffer loss and hurt.\' What hurt? None other than this—not to have done what it behooved thee to do. Thou shalt lose faith, piety, decency—look for no greater injury than these."" So Lao-tzu reduces life to the utmost simplicity, that nothing may interfere with the contemplation of the Tao. The never absent presence of this Perfect Ideal in the mind will be enough to keep the people from trespassing either in thought, speech or action. Such an accomplishment is better than all that the finest civilizations offer.\nHere again we may observe the difference between Lao-tzu and his contemporary, Confucius. Both were politicians, but while Confucius would regulate the State by extra rules of conduct, multiplied until they covered every department\nof life, Lao-tzu sought the same end by the purification of the inner being. Little wonder that when Confucius, whose field of vision was almost entirely objective, visited Lao-tzu, who was almost as much concerned with the subjective, he returned bewildered, and said to his disciples—I quote Dr. Carus’s translation of the Chinese historian\'s record: ""I know that the birds can fly; I know that the fishes can swim; I know that the wild animals can run. For the running, one could make nooses; for the swimming, one could make nets; for the flying, one could make arrows. As to the dragon, I cannot know how he can bestride wind and clouds when he heavenwards rises. To-day I saw Lao-Tze. Is he perhaps like the dragon?"" Others, like Confucius, may be inclined to ask the same question, but ""he that hath ears to hear, let him hear.""\nIt must not, however, be supposed that Lao-tzu\'s system is non-ethical and impractical. On the contrary, in his doctrine of non-attachment, or non-action, the old mystic supplies us with the very essence of all morality. He holds that nature provides a perfect example in her inactive activity. The vegetable kingdom is Lao-tzu\'s ideal, and though it is not a point made in the Tao-teh-king, I may perhaps be pardoned a digression in order to show the appropriateness of sitting at the feet of Dame Nature, and learning from her as she works in her vast garden. Unless man\'s fussiness interferes with her plans, Nature mingles her plants and her shrubs in the wildest and most inextricable manner. Left to follow her own devices, as in the jungle, Nature so arranges her plantation that nothing is separate; each plant lives in the close embrace of its neighbor—a holy fraternity, a fitting symbol of the oneness in diversity which characterizes mankind when viewed from the highest planes. Only as the presence of man drives God further from his universe does this sacred fellowship between all sorts of plants and herbage come to an end. In the cultivated garden everything is in order, everything is separate. It is not this, however, which so much interests Lao-tzu as the quiet detachment of vegetable life. It plants without seeking the fruit; it never mars by its effort to accomplish; everything is left to develop according to its own nature. Here Lao-tzu has an echo in Emerson. In his essay\non ""Spiritual Laws,"" the philosopher of Concord writes: ""Action and inaction are alike. One piece of the tree is cut for the weathercock, and one for the sleeper of a bridge; the virtue of the wood is apparent in both."" Well will it be for this restless, weary, discontented age if it comprehend this message of action in non-action and non-action in action which comes to it out of the dim past, from the great Loess plains of Northwest China.\nSaid a greater than Lao-tzu: ""So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth; and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how."" ""The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field; which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof."" ""The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened."" There is a striking similarity between these sayings of Jesus and the teaching of the Tao-teh-king. Lao-tzu\'s doctrine of non-attachment, or non-action, found its loftiest expression on the cross on Calvary.\nThis, then, is the word which this ancient writing has for the world—a life of sensation is a life of instability, a life of non-accomplishment. Until the ""final facts of consciousness"" are understood, true peace is impossible, but when these are known, detachment from action for the sake of action will be the result. ""If any man love the world (is attached to the sensuous) the love of the Father is not in him."" So says the Christian mystic, John. He who has not attained to non-attachment or non-action is a stranger to the power of the Tao; this is the cry of the Chinese mystic, Lao-tzu.\nVictor von Strauss summarizes Lao-tzu\'s teaching thus: ""Man\'s moral worth consists of what he has, not of what he does; it has respect not only to what he is in himself, but to his influence on others. It is what a man is which makes his acts good, and not the deeds which make the man. The higher the moral worth of the man the less he values his own acts, and the less likely is he to seek justification through his works. In this way he influences his fellows, not so much\nthrough what he does as through what he is; not so much through his speech as through his conduct""—(Wandel.) ""But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness."" Confucius represents the James, Lao-tzu the Paul. of Christian theology.', 'Introduction to Philosophy/What is Buddhist Philosophy?\nBuddha expressed his philosophy when he said: ""I teach only two things, O disciples, the nature of suffering and the cessation of suffering.""\nBuddha taught the famous ""Four Noble Truths"" and ""Eightfold Path,"" which allows people to achieve enlightenment. Enlightenment (nirvana, awakening, realization, satori) is the cessation of suffering, freedom from conditioned existence (samsara). Buddha taught that every action has a consequence; things are because of previous conditions. If one practices the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, then one will no longer be subject to the cycle of existence samsara.\n""My teaching is not a philosophy. It is the result of direct experience... My teaching is a means of practice, not something to hold onto or worship. My teaching is like a raft used to cross the river. Only a fool would carry the raft around after he had already reached the other shore of liberation.""\nTo his favourite disciple, Ananda, the Buddha once said (from: Old Path, White Clouds by Thich Nath Hanh):\nThree Marks of Existence\n- Annica - Everything is subject to change.\n- Dukkha - All pervasive unsatisfactoriness.\n- Anatta - Everything is empty of a separate self.\nFour Noble Truths\n- Dukkha - Life is unsatisfactory, disjointed, suffering.\n- Samudaya - There is a cause of suffering, which is attachment or desire (tanha).\n- Nirodha - There is a cessation of suffering, which is to eliminate attachment and desire.\n- Marga - The path that leads out of suffering is called the Noble Eightfold Path.\nBuddha taught that in order to realize enlightenment, man must free himself from his ego, and give up all desires. Buddha taught that by having so many desires (such as wanting pleasure, wealth, happiness, security, success, long life, etc.), man condemns himself to suffering, and will never escape the cycle of rebirths.\nTherefore Buddhism believes that suffering is self-created.\nThe Eightfold Path\nWisdom - Prajna\n1.

20	obsidian historical civilizations availability manufacturing locations chemical composition	While obsidian was widely used throughout prehistory, it's actually a rare material that requires specific volcanic conditions to form. It needs highly viscous lava with high silica content to create glass. During formation, minerals from surrounding rock leach into the lava, adding location-specific elements. The raw material becomes glass when the lava cools quickly before crystals can form, freezing these unique chemical signatures inside. At Çatalhöyük in central Anatolia, while the local area only had clay, lake-bed marl, grasses, and animal hide, obsidian could be sourced from the Taurus Mountains to the south and several volcanoes in other directions. These distinct chemical signatures allow modern researchers to determine the exact geographical origin of obsidian artifacts through X-ray fluorescence analysis.	"['A publication of the Archaeological Institute of America\nMaking a mirror the old-fashioned way\nCypriot ship painted on a modern pot shows clearly on polished obsidian surface. (James Vedder)\nAmong the intriguing finds at the Neolithic site of Çatalhöyük in central Anatolia are a few polished obsidian artifacts believed to have been used as mirrors. In a letter in response to an article, ""The World\'s First City"" (March/April 1998), which mentions the obsidian mirrors, P.H.M. Hawley wrote, ""to make such a mirror requires considerable technology in a sense. To grind a flat surface and then achieve a true polish is not easy"" (May/June 1998, p. 11). In an accompanying comment, Orrin Shane (an author of the original article and a curator at the Minnesota Museum of Science) said of the Çatalhöyük mirrors, ""Their exceptional planar surfaces are highly polished and reflect a sharp image."" I was curious just how difficult it would be and how long it would take to make an obsidian mirror.\nIn December 1999, I started to fashion a small one by hand, using various readily available materials (some artificial) to grind and polish a broken obsidian nodule. A fragment of concrete sidewalk provided the rough surface for the initial grinding. Once there was a flat surface, I continued, using in order, the side of a discarded abrasive wheel, a fine whetstone, and a fine clay slip on a piece of plate glass. The result was a nearly flat polished area that produced an excellent reflection. After this first success, I used three more obsidian nodules and an obsidian lump with conchoidal surfaces that had lost their luster during long exposure, grinding and polishing them with materials such as granite, quartzite, sandstone, slate, marble, sand, fine-grained stone, clay, and wood ash. The most used for grinding were granite, sand, sandstone, and the fine-grained stone. The fine grained stone gave a fairly good polish, while the others were used briefly to verify that a wide range of materials are effective in the process. I observed the sun\'s reflection and examined the obsidian surface with a 10x hand lens to evaluate the progress of the grinding and polishing and took great care to keep the surface clear of extraneous material to reduce the possibility of generating scratches. I have yet to explore fully various possible final burnishing, buffing, and polishing procedures. The wood ash was briefly tried as a final polishing agent, but it was probably too fine-grained to improve the existing state of the polished surface with out the expense of an inordinate amount of time. Materials for grinding and polishing comparable to those listed above can be found in Turkey.\nThe largest mirror surface I produced is about 4 by 6 centimeters (1.6 by 2.4 inches). With experience, one could probably select an optimum set of materials to expedite the creation of a mirror surface. Since achieving the final polish may take the longest time, I can not estimate now the time required to make a mirror.\nAll of the mirrors produced good images, and all were slightly convex as expected from manual grinding in which linear and rotary motions result in greater pressure being applied around the perimeter of the surface. The only technical reference that I have seen on an obsidian mirror from Çatalhöyük states that it is slightly convex. With special preparation of a core and great care during the grinding process, one could probably make a nearly flat mirror with no obvious distortions in the image.\n""STOP"" image is reflected in experimental obsidian mirror. (James Vedder)\nDuring my stay at Çatalhöyük in August 2000, I collected information from unpublished notes and speaking with those at the site who had any familiarity with obsidian and grinding stones. I was able to see eight of the Çatalhöyük mirrors. Three each were in the Archaeological Museum of Konya and the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara. Dim lighting and glass cases made it difficult to discern details of fabrication. Two in storage at the Konya museum could be inspected close-up. Their faces were slightly convex, as I had suspected; but they were badly scratched, probably from post-manufacturing usage and disposal.\nPictures of at least six obsidian artifacts from Çatalhöyük were published and claimed to be mirrors by the site\'s first excavator, James Mellaart, who dug there in the 1960s. Naomi Hamilton (a participant in the current efforts at the site) in her unpublished inventory of artifacts from Çatalhöyük held in the Konya and Ankara museums lists 11 items as mirrors or possible mirrors. Those shown by Mellaart are in this list. I have verified that eight of the 11 objects are mirrors and rejected two. One of these two, described by Hamilton as possibly a broken mirror with grinding marks, has linear sets of abrasions at several angles that have obliterated the luster on 60 percent of the surface but have not flattened it. The other, described as a questionable mirror fragment or flake, is a long, thin curved piece lacking luster. The eleventh item, in storage at the Konya museum, is possibly the beginnings of a mirror in the early stage of grinding a core to produce a flat surface.\nWhat purpose did they serve? The conventional answer given by Mellaart is for a woman to view her application of make-up, but few obsidian mirrors have been found and these only in the middle occupation levels at Çatalhöyük. Various alternative uses have been suggested, some practical (illuminating rooms or shafts, starting fires, reflecting sunlight for a compact seasonal calendar, or signalling) and some spiritual (viewing one\'s soul or performing special rites). No mirrors have been found in the recent excavations, under the general direction of the University of Cambridge\'s Ian Hodder; but only the group from the University of California, Berkeley, is working at the levels IV to VI in which Mellaart discovered the objects.\nIn conclusion, there is abundant archaeological evidence for grinding and polishing stone to make tools and ornaments. No technological innovation was required before obsidian mirrors could be produced. While the only raw materials available locally to the ancient inhabitants of Çatalhöyük were clay, lake-bed marl, grasses, and animal hide, at some distance, the Tarus Mountains to the south and several volcanoes in other directions, could have been the sources ofmaterials suitable for grinding and polishing obsidian.', 'Shiny and sharp, obsidian is enjoying a bit of a pop culture moment. It plays a central role in HBO’s hit fantasy series Game of Thrones, now wrapping its final season. Called dragonglass on the show, obsidian is one of only two substances that can cut down White Walkers, malevolent otherworldly warriors.\nIn the real world, the volcanic glass reveals the human story in a way no other material can.\nOur evolutionary ancestors used obsidian for toolmaking for more than a million years. Thanks to the material’s unique chemical attributes, archaeologists can determine the geographical origin of even small pieces. But that’s only part of the story.\nArizona State University archaeological scientist Andrew Zipkin says knowing where our distant ancestors collected obsidian allows researchers to ask much broader questions, such as where early humans traveled, and why.\n“It’s easy to source obsidian and determine where it came from, but that’s only the first step, because that’s chemistry, not archaeology,” says Zipkin. “The ultimate goal is to understand what motivated these people to collect it from that location.”\nGetting To The Point\nObsidian artifacts turn up at archaeological sites going back at least as far as 1.7 million years ago, when an early member of the genus Homo made tools with it at the Ethiopian site of Melka Kunture.\nAround the world, the prehistoric record is littered with obsidian scrapers, choppers and all-purpose hand axes. Early toolmakers likely chose the volcanic glass because it flakes predictably — it can be shaped more easily than other materials — and the result is a razor-sharp edge.\n“The fresh edge of an obsidian flake is just a few dozen atoms thick,” says Ellery Frahm, an archaeological scientist at Yale University. “When viewed under a microscope, a steel surgical scalpel would look like a dull and badly abused ax next to an obsidian flake.”\nObsidian is also brittle, a bonus for hunters.\n“An obsidian projectile point creates a lot of damage because it’s sharp and also likely to break inside the animal,” says Albuquerque-based geoarchaeologist M. Steven Shackley, professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley. He adds: “If you want to create damage, you want to use obsidian.”\nThe material’s bold appearance — shiny and usually black, though red and other colors occur — may have made it attractive for symbolic or aesthetic reasons as well. Whatever its appeal, early humans sought it out. Despite its frequent use throughout prehistory, the raw material is not common.\n“Obsidian is rare most places in the world, and it takes the right kind of volcanic eruption to create it,” says Frahm. “The lava needs to be highly viscous — or sticky — to form glass. A high amount of silica is required to get that sticky lava.”\nWhile this high-silica lava is still below ground, minerals from surrounding rock leach into it, adding different elements specific to that location. When it finally erupts, if it reaches the surface fast enough, the lava will cool quickly and turn into uniform glass before its unique chemical mix has a chance to organize itself into crystals.\n“When that happens, all the elements are frozen inside that glass like a snapshot,” says Shackley. “That’s why we can distinguish all these different sources.”\nX Marks the Source\nDetermining the source of a piece of obsidian means analyzing the chemistry of the artifact and then matching it to a database of geochemical signatures unique to individual sources, called flows.\nFor decades, archaeologists have had few options for that analysis. Most of the equipment is expensive and limited to lab settings. The most precise methods also require destroying the material to be analyzed and, as Shackley notes dryly, “for some reason, people in museums get really upset when you break their artifacts into tiny little pieces.”\nThat’s why non-destructive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) emerged as the most popular method for sourcing obsidian. Though not the most exacting analysis, it’s particularly good at identifying strontium, rubidium and other elements that are frequently key ingredients in a flow’s signature.\n“XRF is a beam technology,” says Zipkin. “It hits the target atom, knocks electrons out of orbit, exciting them, and then, as they drop back down [into normal orbit], they emit characteristic energy that the device measures.”\nLab-based XRF devices have gotten smaller over the years: “The first XRF [machine] I used in the ’80s filled a room,” says Shackley, who is director of the Geoarchaeological XRF Laboratory. “Now the equipment sits on a desktop, a little bigger than a breadbox.” Outside the lab, the technology has seen even more impressive downsizing.\nThe first commercial portable XRF (pXRF) devices arrived in the 1990s, intended for industrial applications such as exploratory mining and quality control in cement manufacturing. They soon found their way into the hands of many an archaeologist. In those early adoption years, enthusiasm for the new tool’s potential sometimes outpaced scientific rigor, and results were not always reliable.\nMethods and standards across the field have since improved, as have the portable devices, which continue to get cheaper and more precise. Today’s pXRF devices — which “look like a combination of a ray gun and a hair dryer,” says Zipkin — run less than $40,000.\n“One can put it in a carry-on bag and bring it almost anywhere in the world,” says Frahm. “No longer do we have to request permission to export a few artifacts to a distant lab. Instead, we can work where the artifacts are, whether in a museum, in a field lab, or even at an archaeological site itself.”\nHe adds: “In only 10 or 20 seconds, we can know where a particular obsidian artifact originated, hundreds, thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of years ago.”\nDates That Don’t Hold Water\nWhile the tools to determine the source of obsidian become ever more user-friendly, obsidian hydration, a method used to date the material, remains problematic.\nDeveloped in the mid-20th century, the method takes advantage of the fact that an obsidian surface starts absorbing atmospheric water as soon as it’s exposed to the air. To date the artifact, researchers take a cross-section and look at the hydration rim, a gauge of how far water has penetrated into the volcanic glass.\n“It’s a great idea, but it’s almost impossible to put into action,” says Zipkin, who calls the results “really just an educated guess.”\nThat’s because the speed of moisture penetration is affected by numerous factors, including temperature and humidity. A difference in temperature of 1 degree Celsius, for example, can change the hydration rate by 10 percent; a single event such as a forest fire roaring past the artifact’s location might reset the hydration rim completely.\nMost archaeologists instead date obsidian artifacts by context — what else was found with it at the site — and relative dating methods, such as the age of the layer of sediment in which it was found.\nTracking Ancient Travel\nAs groups of hunter-gatherers moved across prehistoric landscapes, collecting obsidian and leaving behind flakes of it after making or resharpening tools, they created maps of their movement that archaeologists can follow with ever greater precision.\nTracing the paths obsidian traveled with early humans, says Frahm, can reconstruct how people “made use of their surroundings and met their subsistence needs through mobility across the landscape and connections with other groups.”\nIn 2018 in Science, for example, Zipkin and colleagues published a trio of papers about finds, including obsidian artifacts, at the Kenyan site of Olorgesailie. The obsidian pieces, more than 300,000 years old, came from multiple flows up to 70 miles away: a distance significantly greater than the average territory of hunter-gatherer groups. This means that the obsidian collectors may have either traveled into another group’s territory or traded with them for the material. Both scenarios suggest that humans were cognitively capable of complex social interactions and planning long-distance expeditions more than 200,000 years earlier than once thought.\nObsidian continues to tell us more about not only ourselves, but our closest evolutionary kin.\nIn February, for example, in the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports, researchers described obsidian artifacts up to 73,000 years old, made of raw material from the Baksan River valley. The location is the only known obsidian source in the Northern Caucasus — part of a rugged stretch of mountainous land straddling southern Russia and the Republic of Georgia.\nThe artifacts were found at sites up to 150 miles from Baksan and, based on style, were made by different, culturally distinct groups of Neanderthals. It’s the latest blow to the idea that Neanderthals were less mobile and less capable of networking than early modern humans.\nEkaterina Doronicheva, lead author of the paper and an archaeologist at the Laboratory of Prehistory in St. Petersburg, Russia, says the Baksan obsidian source was probably a zone of contact between different populations: “We can assume the existence of cultural contacts between these regions . . . and that local Neanderthal groups were part of developed social networks.”\nAs technology improves and archaeologists turn up additional sites, obsidian will remain the glass through which we see our deep history.\n“It’s a bit like being Sherlock Holmes,” says Frahm. “We are trying to wring every last bit of information out of these objects that were simply tossed aside in the past.”\nGemma Tarlach is senior editor at Discover.

21	osmolality expressed which units	Osmolality is expressed as Osm/Kg	['Difference Between Osmolality and Osmolarity\nOsmolality vs Osmolarity\nOsmolality and osmolarity are units of measurement. Osmolality is the number of osmoles of solute in a kilogram of solvent, while osmolarity is the number of osmoles of solute in a litre of solution. An osmole is one mole of any non-dissociable substance. It will contain 6.02 x 1023 particles.\nOsmolarity is the concentration of an osmotic solution. This is usually measured in osmoles. Osmolarity is also used to determine certain medical conditions, like the dissolved particles in urine. The volume of a solution will change with the addition of solutes, and also with any change in the temperature or pressure. Therefore, osmolarity is sometimes difficult to determine.\nOsmolality deals with the concentration of the particles that is dissolved in a fluid. In medical science, osmolality is used to determine several conditions like diabetes, dehydration and shock. For the detection of these conditions, the osmolality of the serum is checked, and is known as plasma osmolality. The concentration of the substances like chloride, sodium, potassium, glucose and urea are calculated.\nThe volume of a solvent remains the same regardless of any changes in pressure or temperature, so it is relatively easier to determine the osmolality. Owing to this fact, osmolality is the common method of measurement in Osmometry.\nOsmolality measures the number of particles in the unit weight of a solvent, and is independent of the shape, size or weight of the particles. The properties based on which the particle concentration is measured are known as Colligative properties. The properties are vapour pressure depression, freezing point depression, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure.\nUsually osmolarity is expressed as Osm/L, and osmolality as Osm/Kg. To measure osmolality an instrument known as an osmometer is used, and it works by using the method of freezing point depression.\nThe difference between the calculated osmolarity and measured osmolality is known as the osmolar gap. The values are presented in different units, and this is due to the difference in the method of the calculation and measuring. The abbreviation for measured osmolality is MO, and that for calculated osmolarity is CO. The osmolar gap is represented as OG. If the concentration of solutes in the given fluid is very low, then osmolality and osmolarity are considered to be equivalent.\n1. If osmolality is the number of osmoles of solute in a kilogram of solvent, then osmolarity is the number of osmoles of solute in a litre of solution.\n2. Osmolarity deals with the concentration of an osmotic solution, while osmolality deals with the concentration of particles in a fluid.\n3. It is easier to determine the osmolality than the osmolarity.\n4. Osmolarity is expressed as Osm/L, and osmolality is expressed as Osm/Kg.\n5. Osmolality is used to determine medical conditions like diabetes, shock and dehydration, while osmolarity is used for the detection of the concentration of dissolved particles in urine.\n6. Osmolality is the commonly used method of measurement in Osmometry.\n7.

The inductees included NFL players Vaughan Johnson, Buford Jordan and Morten Andersen, NBA player Slick Watts, MLB player Todd Walker, University of Louisiana-Lafayette pitcher Kyla Hall Holas, West Monroe football coach Don Shows, and former LSU athletic director T.P. 'Skipper' Heard. Additionally, Elmo Adolph and Billy Montgomery received the Dave Dixon award, while Ron Brocato and Larry Hymel received Distinguished Service awards.	"['Elmo Adolph is still telling stories.\nIt has been more a month since Adolph, 77, a world-renowed boxing referee and long- time prep football official, stood on a stage June 25 in Natchitoches with other sports legends to receive the Louisiana Sports Writers Association’s Dave Dix on Sports Leadership Award and become one of the newest members of the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame. And he hasn’t stopped talking about it yet.\n“I’m still telling stories about the weekend, ” Adolph said. “It was such a memorable experience.”\nAdolph, of Destrehan, was one of 12 men and women honored by the LSWA for their contributions to sports. He and former coach and longtime state legislator Billy Montgomery, were the recipients of the Dave Dixon award. Longtime sports journalists Ron Brocato and Larry Hymel received Distinguished Service awards. Also inducted into the 53-year-old hall were former Saints Vaughan John- son, Buford Jordan and Morten Andersen, former NBA great Slick Watts, former LSU and major league baseball player Todd Walker, former University of Louisiana-Lafayette pitcher Kyla Hall Holas, West Monroe football coach Don Shows and the late former LSU athletic director T.P. ""Skipper"" Heard.\nIn addition to the Saturday night induction ceremony, the group also participated in a press conference, a children\'s clinic and a golf tournament, as well as some social outings organized by the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame foundation.\nAnd he has plenty of stories to tell, from Andersen regaling an appreciative press conference crowd with the story of his first experience watching an American football game, to Bobby Hebert\'s raucous 15-minute introduction of his former teammate at the induction ceremony.\n""I just feel so fortunate to have shared a stage with those guys, "" Adolph said. ""When I was just about to go on the stage to receive my award and I looked around at all the people, all the legends in that room. That was a special moment.""\nAnd there is no question that Adolph has earned his place in Louisiana sports history.\nIn a career that spanned more than 40 years, Adolph estimates that he officiated more than 23,000 amateur boxing bouts and at least 1,000 professional matches, including 32 world championship fights. He is the only man to officiate both a professional world championship fight and an Olympic gold medal fight, and one of only 16 referees from the United States invited to officiate the Olympic games.\n""That\'s quite an accomplishment when you think about, only one goes every four years, "" Adolph said. ""When the games were in Los Angeles, they used three.""\nBut Adolph didn\'t just sit around waiting for the next fight. For more than 30 years Adolph served the New Orleans area as a football referee, working hundreds of prep games before hanging up his whistle in 2008. He remains a fixture in local press boxes as an official clock operator.\nHe has since been inducted into the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame, the USA Southern Boxing Hall of Fame, the Warren Easton High School Hall of Fame, the USBA Referees Hall of Fame and the Italian-American Sports Hall of Fame.\n""Elmo Adolph is unquestionably the most recognized and respected boxing figure from Louisiana in his era, "" said Doug Ireland, the Louisiana Sports Foundation\'s Executive Director and Hall of Fame Chairman.""

23	When can I freely copy church music without permission?	You can freely copy music that is 'in the public domain', which means either the composer, arranger, text writer, and translator have been dead for more than 50 years, or the published edition is more than 25 years old.	"[""Liturgy LinesReturn to Liturgy Lines\nCopyright Part 1\nWHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU GOT?\nIt is becoming increasingly common for parishes to project the words of hymns onto overhead screens or print them on bulletins in preference to using hymnbooks at Mass.\nThere are several reasons for this. It is cheaper than purchasing hymnbooks and paying for their repair and replacement. It also offers greater flexibility in the selection of liturgical music.\nWhen a parish purchases a set of hymnbooks for the assembly to use at worship, the publisher receives payment for the expense involved in producing the book and in turn makes payment to those composers who have given permission for their works to be published in it.\nHow are those who write and publish music compensated for their efforts if parishes switch to buying just one copy of hymn collection and reproducing hymn words on parish newsletters or on overheads or on PowerPoint?\nThe answer is that they aren't, unless parishes pay them for the right to use their music as hymnbook publishers do and as they are fully entitled to expect.\nI have heard people claim that we shouldn't have to pay composers of liturgical music because it is used for the glory of God and should be a free service. Try telling that to Energex when you don't pay the next parish electricity bill, or the plumber who expects to be paid for fixing the leaking baptismal font, or the tiler who repaired the church roof! Why are music writers any less entitled to be paid for their time and efforts? Where will the good composers of church music come from if we expect them to do it as a labour of love?\nComposers and text writers have ownership of what they have written and we can no more take their work and use it without giving something in return than we can with the local plumber or tiler. If we use what is theirs by right, we must ask permission and pay a fee.\nThis is the issue of 'copyright'. It simply means if we provide the words for liturgical celebration by any method other than giving out hymnbooks, we must get permission to do so, acknowledge the source, and compensate the rightful owner of the work in some way.\nIt should never happen that music is handed around at choir practice, or hymn words printed in booklets or projected on a screen unless each piece is clearly labelled with the name of the composer and date of composition, the publisher, and a statement of permission to use.\nIt is not necessary to get copyright permission if the composer/ arranger/ text writer/ translator, that is, everyone involved in writing the piece, have been dead for more than 50 years, or if the published edition you are using is more than 25 years old. Such work is classified as being 'in the public domain' and may be copied freely. Much of the music we use in liturgy, however, does not belong in this category.\nDoing the right thing with copyright is a matter of social justice and is relatively simple matter. More on that next week.""]"	['<urn:uuid:c15188a0-0b88-443d-9a30-b2b60deb575c>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	9	39	529

25	tree root damage trench cutting effectiveness and long term symptoms of root damage what happens after cutting	Trenching to control tree roots has mixed effectiveness and poses risks. While it can temporarily keep roots out of specific areas, it's not healthy for trees and could affect their stability. The severity depends on how close to the trunk and how many large roots are cut. While trees can handle losing some small feeder roots, cutting major roots is more threatening. Root damage symptoms may not be immediately visible - it can take 3-7 years for signs to appear in the tree's crown. This delayed reaction occurs because trees store about 66% of their energy and can draw from this reserve for several years after root damage before ultimately dying. Once the damage becomes evident through leaf drop or limb dieback, it's often irreversible and fatal for the tree.	"['Q: I have a large, established maple tree close enough to my garden (due to space limits) that it is now stealing nutrients from my vegetable plants. I vaguely remember reading somewhere that I can cut a tree ""trench"" to separate the tree roots from the veggies, but I haven\'t been able to retrieve that information. Can you help?\nA: Tree roots in the veggie garden is a tough issue, and it\'s one I\'m familiar with first-hand. I have neighbors who planted a row of Douglas firs within a few feet on my back property line, and now -- about a dozen years later -- the fir roots have spread about 15 feet into my yard and directly under my vegetable garden.\nI noticed my veggies seemed to be drying out unusually fast in that area, and when I dug the spent plants at the end of that season, I found feeder roots from the trees all throughout my raised beds.\nSo-called ""trenching"" is one way to keep tree roots out of any area, but it\'s not healthy for the trees. Depending on how much cutting you do and how close you go to the tree\'s trunk, you could undermine the tree\'s health and affect its stability. A tree can withstand the loss of a fair amount of smaller, fibrous feeder roots around the perimeter of its root zone, but having several bigger roots sawed off is much more of a threat.\nHere\'s a really good web page from the International Society of Arboriculture that describes threats posed by root damage to trees: http://www.treesaregood.com/treecare/avoiding_construction.aspx.\nYou have a few options.\nOne is to clear out the tree roots and sink a 2- to 3-foot-deep barrier into a trench by the vegetable garden to keep new roots from encroaching. Then hope you didn\'t do enough root damage to harm the tree.\nA second option is to move the vegetable garden farther away from the tree (if that\'s even possible).\nA third option is the one I used to deal with my neighbor\'s Douglas fir roots. I removed the soil from my raised vegetable beds down to about a foot deep, clearing out the feeder roots in the process.\nThen I lined the bottom of the beds with black plastic -- several layers thick. I brought the plastic up the sides of the bed and stapled it to the inside of my wooden bed frames. I poked a few drainage holes in the bottom. Finally, I refilled the beds with the soil.\nThis essentially turned my garden into large, in-ground containers. I\'m hoping the plastic will be sturdy enough to keep new roots from encroaching. The roots should grow around the beds, harmlessly under the paths and maybe under the plastic. This plan also did only minimal damage to the tree roots.\nDon\'t under-estimate the problem tree roots can cause in a vegetable garden. Tree roots can easily out-compete young veggie roots, and they\'ll love the rich, loose soil of a veggie garden.\nIf you do nothing and let the maple roots keep spreading, you\'ll eventually end up with little to no production from your veggie beds.', 'Biggest Myth About Tree Roots\nMany people believe that tree roots grow mostly downward and mirror the top of the tree. Not true.\nMost Important Things to Know About Trees\nFact: In our area, the Piedmont region of Georgia, tree roots spread out just under the surface of the soil surrounding the tree.\nFact: Roots survive and grow only where there is adequate water and oxygen. Our soils have high clay content, and deeper soils do not contain sufficient water and oxygen for tree root growth.\nFact: The vast majority of tree roots are in the top 18 inches of soil (some sources say as much as 98% of tree roots).\nFact: Providing adequate room for a tree\'s roots to grow without being disturbed is one of the most important aspects of keeping a tree healthy.\nProtect the Root Zone and Structural Root Plate\nStructural Root Plate: The woody roots close to the trunk, known as the structural root plate, help anchor the tree and provide physical stability. Destroying or disturbing these roots may leave the tree unable to hold itself up. This type of damage can result in disaster. The City of Atlanta Tree Ordinance prohibits damage to the structural root plate of trees.\nCritical Root Zone: The majority of roots reach out just beneath the soil surrounding the tree. The roots usually extend one to two times the reach of the branches. For some types of trees, this critical root zone can be two or three times as wide as the extent of the branches. The City of Atlanta Tree Ordinance defines the critical root zone as a circle having a radius of one foot for each one inch of diameter at breast height of the tree for a free-standing tree with no apparent root restrictions. For trees to be considered ""saved"", no more than 20% of the critical root zone may be damaged.\nWhen it is done correctly, mulching a tree can often be the single most beneficial aspect of tree care. Mulch contributes to soil nutrients levels, helps retain soil moisture during drought, reduces compaction, and can even help control some common root diseases. It also reduces the tree\'s need to compete with other plants and turf for water and nutrients.\nIdeally, mulch should be applied in a circle from near the tree trunk to the edge of the tree canopy, and covers about the same area as the critical root zone. On a practical note, however, sometimes it is not possible to mulch the entire root zone, so mulch should extend as far from the tree as possible within the scope of the site and landscape area.\nMulch should be spread only two to four inches deep, and should not touch the tree trunk or buttress roots, so leave some breathing room at the base of the tree. Never start mulching next to the trunk of the tree. Instead, the mulch should start a foot away from the base of the trunk to prevent damage to the base of the tree. Piling a heap of mulch against the tree trunk is sometimes called \'volcano mulching\' and can cause insect and disease problems, often killing the tree within a few years. Deeper mulch is NOT better and can harm the tree. Covering a wider area is better.\nWood chips, pine straw, shredded cypress, pine bark, and bagged mulch all work quite well. Artificial mulches and stone ground covers (like lava rock, pebbles or crushed granite) may cause changes in soil pH and do not have the same beneficial effects as natural materials that biodegrade over time.\nRoot damage can sometimes result in an immediate effect on a tree. You might see leaves dry or drop during the wrong season or limbs die back. More often, however, the symptoms of root damage appear years later. It can take as many as three to seven years for symptoms of root damage to become evident in the crown of the tree. This damage is often irreversible and results in the death of the tree.\nTree ""murder"" by root suffocation can be the ""perfect crime"" since the injured tree can take several years to die after the offending act. New homeowners often report having moved into a newly constructed home with ""beautiful, perfectly healthy mature trees"" that mysteriously enter a spiral of decline several years later. This is because trees typically store as much as 66% of the energy they make. After tree roots are damaged and the tree is unable to make new energy, it pulls from its ""bank"" of energy for up to seven years before ultimately dying.\nSoil Compaction Irreversible\nSoil compaction should be considered permanent. University of Georgia studies show that under normal forest conditions, soils do not readily ""come back"" from compaction. Recovery time is at least two human generations. Damage to the trees occurs because the roots cannot function properly in compacted soil. Arborists sometimes recommend mechanical means of aerating the compacted soil around trees, but this can be difficult to accomplish without damaging roots.\nReducing the Negative Effect of Soil Compaction\nSometimes root damage cannot be avoided, but it can be minimized by restricting access to the areas close to trees during construction. If the area near the tree must be disturbed by, for example, heavy foot traffic or delivery of construction materials, the roots can be protected by softening and distributing the impact. This can be accomplished by placing heavy mulch, plywood, or metal driving pads under the trees. Physical properties of soil can be improved with the addition of organic matter and aeration to increase pore space. When tree roots must be cut, they should be cut cleanly with a sharp pruning shear or saw. When root damage is severe or occurs to woody roots, the whole tree should be evaluated to determine whether it should be removed. If a damaged tree is to remain, it should be monitored and maintained to promote tree health. Maintenance may include mulching, aeration, and irrigation.\nREFERENCES City of Covington Tree Preservation Ordinance and information, prepared by Connie Head 01/04/2001.

They are highly efficient and cost-effective, requiring no additional capital investment after initial integration and helping prevent fraud-related losses. The system is user-friendly and easy to operate, allowing quick data entry and analysis. It provides convenience by eliminating the need to reset passwords or carry cards, as biological features serve as passcodes. The technology offers quick and accurate identification and authentication, superior to traditional password systems since biological features cannot be forged. It's particularly efficient for workplace functions like attendance tracking for payroll, and the data can be easily logged and audited.	"[""What is meant by biometric recognition?\nBiometric recognition (also known as biometrics) refers to the automated recognition of individuals based on their biological and behavioral traits. It is based on hardware systems for data acquisition that integrate the software components that allow, through mathematical algorithms, to perform data analysis and reconstruct the identity of a person and recognize it.\nHow does biometric recognition work?\nInstead of using something you have (like a key) or something you know (like a password), biometrics uses who you are to identify you. Biometrics can use physical characteristics, like your face, fingerprints, irises or veins, or behavioral characteristics like your voice, handwriting or typing rhythm. Unlike keys and passwords, your personal traits are extremely difficult to lose or forget. They can also be very difficult to copy. For this reason, many people consider them to be safer and more secure than keys or passwords.\nBiometric systems can seem complicated, but they all use the same three steps:\nThe first time you use a biometric system, it records basic information about you, like your name or an identification number. It then captures an image or recording of your specific trait.\nContrary to what you may see in movies, most systems don't store the complete image or recording. They instead analyze your trait and translate it into a code or graph. Some systems also record this data onto a smart card that you carry with you.\nThe next time you use the system, it compares the trait you present to the information on file. Then, it either accepts or rejects that you are who you claim to be.\nSystems also use the same three components:\n- A sensor that detects the characteristic being used for identification\n- A computer that reads and stores the information\n- Software that analyzes the characteristic, translates it into a graph or code and performs the actual comparisons\nWhat are the goals of biometric recognition for authentication?\nThe functioning of the biometric recognition systems varies according to the objective, which can be the verification or identification of a person:\nA person declares his identity so his recognition becomes a verification process (one by one) that requires a match between the detected image (or the acquired data) in real-time from the sensors and that present in an archive;\nThe biometric recognition is done by matching the image, the data, the information acquired in real-time with all the images and information present in an archive (one to many verifications). The biometric recognition system will associate identity by comparing and identifying the most similar and consistent physiological and behavioral characteristics between those in the archive and those collected in real-time.\nThe biometric system is showing its full potential not only because it reaches higher levels of protection than the password method, but above all, because it opens the door to new services that are able to integrate security and a better user experience for users.\nWhat are the benefits of biometric recognition?\n1. Security and Profitability\nOnce the biometric verification system is integrated, there’s no need to invest in additional capital. This significantly cuts upfront and ongoing investment costs. These systems are also critical to preventing loss due to fraud and illegal entries. That benefit alone saves money and drives profitability.\n2. Easy to Operate and User Friendly\nManaging, fitting, and even analyzing biometric verification is very user-friendly – providing technological and accurate results with minimal need for intervention. New data can be entered quickly and logs analyzed fast. Once the table of entries and exits is created, it’s easy to study and manage.\n3. Highly Efficient\nEvery company demands highly efficient security systems. Biometric verification systems not only enhance security but make it is easier and more efficient to manage key functions such as attendance tracking for payroll. It is even helpful for employees as they don't need to carry cards everywhere.\n4. Convenience is Key\nOne key advantage of a biometric verification system is convenience. There’s just no need to reset the passwords. Once the biometric test is activated, all fingerprints, iris, and facial recognition are done - and employees are good to go. It is even convenient to log the data and audit it accordingly.\n5. Quick and Accurate Identification and Authentication\nUsing passwords and codes for security access is pretty straightforward but generic. Anyone with a card or pass can gain access. But biometric security technology refers to the biological passcodes that cannot be forged - meaning accurate identification and authentication of the specific individual. Iris or facial recognition is more often becoming integrated as part of the security process, as scanning is a quick and easy process.\nThis menu allows you to set up answers to probable queries by setting up FAQs, defining Entities, uploading questions, and responses in a Tabular Input format or uploading relevant documents in Document Lookup. Engati NLP engine has been set up and has the intelligence to search across the four types and match the most relevant response according to the query asked, further users, have the control to change most of the settings and search preference according to their requirements.\nWhat are the biometric recognition characteristics?\nBiometric characteristics are typically divided into two categories: physiological biometrics and behavioral biometrics.\nThese are features that can be notably identified through the five senses and could be processed finite calculable differences: sight (the colour of a person’s hair and eyes, their teeth, their facial features, etc.), sound (the pitch of a person’s voice), smell (their odor or scent), taste (the composition of a person’s saliva or DNA), and touch (like the person’s fingerprints or handprints).\nThese are all about the manner in which people behave and conduct themselves. This could include their gait, walking rhythm, writing style, typing speed, etc.\nFor any of these biometric characteristics to be used for identification encryption and recognition purposes, they need to be reliable, unique, collectable, convenient, long term, universal, and acceptable.\nWhat are the types of biometric recognition devices?\nThere are several types of biometric recognition devices. Here are some of these devices:\nThey perform mathematical analysis of the random patterns that are visible within the iris of an eye from some distance. They make use of computer vision, pattern recognition, statistical inference, and optics.\nHand scanners and fingerprint recognition systems\nThey measure the structure, shape, and proportions of the hand like the length, width, and thickness of the hand, fingers, and joints, and features of the skin surface like creases and ridges.\nFacial recognition devices\nThey compare images or videos of a person’s face with those stored in the database. Facial recognition devices check the structure, shape, and proportions of the person’s face, the distance between their eyes, nose, mouth & jaw, the upper outlines of their eye sockets, the sides of their mouth, the location of their nose and eyes, as well as the area surrounding the person’s cheek bones.\nVoice recognition devices\nDifferent people’s voices create different shapes on the spectrogram graph, which are used to verify the person’s identity.\nVein recognition devices are employed to identify people on the basis of the vein patterns in their fingers.""]"	['<urn:uuid:2362cb7e-a8f2-4386-a547-d8e14ae1e5d6>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	13	99	1191
27	future workplace trends training requirements explain	Several key trends are shaping future workplace requirements. First, technological changes are driving the need for workers to develop new skills, but rather than complete reskilling, the focus should be on 're-architecting' existing strengths and combining human capabilities with automation. According to a 2020 McKinsey study, 87% of executives anticipate skills gaps in their workforce. Organizations are responding by conducting regular skills gap analyses, particularly when implementing new tools or changing business strategies. These analyses involve reviewing company objectives, assessing current workforce capabilities, and identifying both technical and soft skill requirements. Additionally, the rise of remote work due to the pandemic has created new demands for digital competencies and collaboration skills.

Schwarzman College of Computing, has some ideas.\nHe spoke Dec. 2 at the MIT Technology Review Future Compute event in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and discussed the future of machines and the digital workforce.\n“I think it’s very hard to predict the future and particularly hard to predict the positive outcomes of the future,” said Huttenlocher, PhD ’88. “It’s a lot easier to see a technology and say ‘Gee, that looks like it’s going to pose a risk for a particular form of employment’ … than to envision some whole new type of work that is very hard to see because of the way that the technology is going to change.”\nMachines will change jobs, not take them\nMachines are probably not going to take your job. They might automate parts of it, but as Huttenlocher pointed out, commercial planes can fly themselves but that reality hasn’t eliminated pilots.\n“It’s not like computers come in and replace specific jobs,” he said. “What they tend to do is automate certain tasks, and if a particular job is heavy in a particular type of task and can’t kind of adapt to new ways of working, then that job becomes at risk.”\nWhat’s important is to look at those tasks that are likely to be automated, how they map on to the workforce, and what are the likely new paths for technologies that will create jobs.\nRe-skilling should take advantage of existing strengths\nChanges in jobs mean workers will need to develop new skills, but Huttenlocher said he doesn’t think of it as reskilling so much as “re-architecting” and taking advantage of the strengths someone already has.\n“What are the contributions that people make in their jobs that are very hard to automate?,” he asked. “How do we think about a combination of automation and human labor that is mutually beneficial?”\nThat also means the decision-makers in business, government, and academia need to recognize that some of the most creative content and ideas come from the factory floors and warehouses, rather than the people with the highest levels of education, he said.\nDon’t fear the digital future, but be cautious\nWhether it’s social media, artificial intelligence, or any kind of computing technology, because they affect human lives, their potential outcomes need to be thought through.\nSocial media was supposed to have great societal benefits but now is producing a lot of negative consequences, Huttenlocher said. It’s the type of technology that would have benefited from thoughtful study at its beginning stages, not just when things got bad.\n“The analogy I would use is that computing research today is much more like medical research than it is like research in other areas,” Huttenlocher said. “We think pretty carefully when we undertake medical research projects, about societal consequences. … I think that those issues need to be part of the research and part of commercialization all along the way.”', ""How to Perform a Skills Gap Analysis\nIf a chef doesn’t have the right ingredients, it’s nearly impossible for them to craft the exact dish they envision. The same is true for companies.\nDuring unprecedented change and innovation, many companies realize they don’t currently have the right people and skillsets to achieve their goals. According to a 2020 McKinsey study, 87 percent of executives say they are currently experiencing skills gaps or expect to within the next few years.\nBut knowing you have skills gaps and knowing what skills you lack are two different things. That’s why a skills gap analysis is a powerful tool for learning and development teams.\nBut how do you accurately identify skills gaps? We’ll cover the what, why, and how of skills gap analyses so you can implement the same process and help steer your organization to success.\nA Quick Refresher on Skills Gap Analyses\nWhat is a Skills Gap Analysis?\nA skills gap analysis is a process aimed at identifying gaps in necessary skills for the job that needs to be done.\nThroughout this post, we’ll follow the journey of a data professional named Megan. She has been working in data analytics for nearly a decade, but changes to her organization’s technical suite have affected her job performance and output.\nStep by step, we’ll explore how a skills gap analysis can help both Megan and her employer succeed.\nWhy are Skills Gap Analyses Important for L&D Professionals?\nBefore we get into the steps, let’s take a moment to establish the answer to the following question: Why should you care about skills gap analyses?\nSkills gap analyses are essential in the modern workplace. As your organization evolves, you need to ensure you’re taking the proper steps to help your workforce evolve with it. Skills gap analyses can help you be proactive regarding these changes. By identifying skills gaps early and planning to fill them, you can keep your employees—and your organization—ahead of the competition.\nYou can also use skills gap analyses to shape and prioritize your L&D efforts and maximize your corporate learning and development ROI. By taking the time to identify your employees’ strengths and weaknesses, you’ll have an easier time selecting technical and soft skill training topics that will be useful to your workforce.\nIdentifying skills gaps can also help your organization remain aligned on company-wide goals and initiatives. As you’ll see in our step-by-step walkthrough later in this post, a skills gap analysis requires you to identify and agree upon goals for your workforce and your business.\nThe last benefit of skills gap analyses is employee empowerment. You can provide employees with the data from their skills gap analysis. Taking this step will allow them to understand their weaknesses, enabling them to work toward their own improvement.\nWhen Should You Use a Skills Gap Analysis?\nConducting a skills gap analysis is not a one-and-done process. Your business is always evolving, and technology is always changing. As a result, new solutions always need to be implemented. These truths mean you’ll need to conduct skills gap analyses regularly.\nSome common triggers for conducting an analysis include:\n- Missed Targets: If a department—or your business as a whole—are consistently missing targets, it’s time to see where your weaknesses are.\n- Changes in Business Strategy: If your business is changing course, you need to ensure your workforce is prepared to change with it.\n- New Tool Implementation: You want to keep up with the latest technology—ensure your employees are prepared to tackle the learning curve.\nHow to Perform a Skills Gap Analysis in 5 Steps\nThere are five key steps to lay the foundation for performing a successful skills gap analysis:\n- Review your company’s objectives and goals.\n- Identify “future of work” trends that will impact your company.\n- Make a comprehensive list of skills required.\n- Assess current workforce skills.\n- Identify assessment data to identify skills gaps.\nLet’s dive into more detail on each.\nStep 1. Review Your Company’s Objectives and Goals\nAlignment is necessary to the success of any organization. Begin your skills gap analysis by reviewing organizational goals and targets with key stakeholders. To ensure all parties are on the same page, you should involve the C-suite, executives, and VPs.\nIf you skip this alignment, you may end up wasting time and resources checking for irrelevant gaps.\nWhen you take the time to coordinate your L&D efforts with the organization’s overall goals, you demonstrate how L&D can contribute to the business's success. Establishing the ways your training efforts contribute to organizational outcomes can make it easier for you to gain high-level support—and necessary resources—for future initiatives.\nIt’s important to ensure your training aligns with specific, measurable goals. This step is doubly essential to your skills gap analysis success if your business has recently changed its business model or plans to soon.\nMegan’s organization is undergoing an initiative to centralize all reporting. A part of this effort involves swapping out their old tool, Access, for a series of new, web-based reporting tools. Establishing the goal of centralized reporting and efficient use of the updated technology is essential to planning the skills gap analysis Megan and her team will undergo.\nStep 2. Identify “Future of Work” Trends that Will Impact Your Company\nYour next step is to identify any trends that may impact your company. Your organization does not operate within a bubble, nor should your training efforts. You need to consider trends that originate outside of your organization.\nFor example, are any jobs in your organization at risk of becoming obsolete due to changing technology? On the other hand, do you foresee technological changes that will require you to create new positions to keep up with the changing market?\nRelated Read: The Top 5 Trends in Learning and Development\nKeeping up with industry changes and future-of-work trends will help ensure your organization is prepared to take the steps needed to remain at the forefront of performance and efficiency in your space.\nMegan’s organization has changed quite a bit over the past few years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of the workforce switched to remote positions temporarily. The changes wrought by the pandemic have encouraged the company's leadership to embrace fully-remote positions permanently to remain competitive in the recruiting space.\nThese changes have required implementing multiple new tools and are the impetus behind switching to a web-based reporting tool rather than a locally hosted solution. These trends and the company’s reactions will impact the future of work at Megan’s organization—and the skills gap analysis needed to ensure success.\nStep 3. Make a Comprehensive List of Skills Required\nOnce you understand your organization’s goals and the outside factors and trends that may impact your company, you’re ready to begin planning the skills gap analysis itself.\nMake a list of all the skills needed to achieve the goals your leadership has outlined. Include any additional skills required to keep up with changing industry trends.\nNOTE: Don’t forget to include soft skills! You’ll need to test for technical skills, but every position requires a robust set of soft skills as well. For your skills gap analysis to succeed, you’ll need to know how to effectively measure soft skills. If you neglect to test for this skill, your skills gap analysis will not be as impactful as possible.\nOnce you have your list of skills, you’ll want to align those skills with current roles at your organization. If no current role fits a necessary skill you’ve identified, you may need to hire new talent or create a new role to account for that skill.\nLooking at the skills required for success in Megan’s department, you identify soft skills like attention to detail, collaboration, and problem-solving. Additionally, you identify technical skills, including data visualization, proficiency with your new data analytics tool, and SQL knowledge.\nStep 4. Assess Current Workforce Skills\nYou know the skills your organization needs to succeed in the near future. Now, it’s time to assess the skills of your current workforce.\nEstablish a baseline for each employee and department in your organization. You will then use this baseline data to compare with the necessary skills you identified in step 3 above.\nHow can you gather this baseline data? You have four main options:\n- Job Performance Metrics: Take a look at the existing metrics your organization measures employee performance against. The upside of this method is that the data may be readily available. However, you may not have ready-made data on the specific skills you’re looking to study.\n- One-on-One Conversations: Speak to each employee about their job performance (or require management to do so for their teams and document the results of the conversation). This type of analysis can be very in-depth. However, it is also very time-consuming and may be inaccurate as it relies on employee self-evaluation.\n- Digital Assessments: Provide a test or questionnaire to each employee to analyze their proficiency level on the skills you are examining. A positive of digital assessments is that they can be completed quickly. However, they also rely on employee self-evaluation, making them less accurate.\n- Simulation-Based Assessments: Use a simulation like the ones provided by CapsimInbox to measure and study your employees’ skills in a real-world scenario. This method is incredibly accurate and provides measurable results. However, creating custom simulations can be time-consuming.\nTo get starting data for Megan and her team, you decide to use a simulation. One of CapsimInbox’s ready-to-use simulations was a great fit for your use case, so you’re able to provide the simulation to your team quickly.\nThe simulation walks Megan and the other data analysts through several guided scenarios that mimic their real-world job duties. This allows you to accurately assess their performance and skill level in various tasks.\nStep 5. Analyze Assessment Data to Identify Skills Gaps\nOnce you have baseline data on your workforce’s proficiency in the skills you’re examining, it’s time to analyze the data.\nCompare each employee’s performance in the evaluation, simulation, or assessment to the necessary skill level associated with proficiency in that task. You can then compare that data to the skills you identified back in step three.\nIs there a gap between the skills necessary to achieve your organization’s goals and the skills your employees are proficient in? Any such gaps are skill gaps in your organization.\nArmed with the knowledge of where skills gaps exist in your team and organization, you can now make a plan. What training does your workforce need to close those gaps? Does your organization need to create new positions or hire new talent to fill the gaps? These are all questions you now have the tools to answer.\nAfter completing the analysis, you realize that Megan isn’t the only team member struggling. You find skills gaps related to your new software as well as gaps in soft skills related to remote work, like written communication and self-motivation.\nYou realize that you need to provide team training on soft skills organization-wide. Additionally, you recommend hiring a technical specialist to serve internally as the functional administrator for your new reporting software.\nUse Your Skill Gap Analysis to Create a Training Plan\nCompleting a skills gap analysis empowers your L&D team to determine topics for training and development initiatives that will be useful to team members and overall business objectives. Consider providing employees with the results of their skills gap analysis. This information can help your workforce realize the value of your training opportunities, increasing engagement.\nAs discussed previously, you may find that training alone cannot close all your skills gaps. In this case, you’ll want to consider hiring outside experts or new talent to fill overall gaps in the organization without overwhelming your current workforce with new responsibilities and information.\nREMEMBER: Skills gap analyses aren’t a one-and-done process. You should be conducting a new analysis at least once a year. Ensure that you are including future skills gap analyses in your L&D plan for each year.\nYou Know the Steps to Perform a Skills Gap Analysis…Now What?\nKnowing the steps to conduct an effective skills gap analysis is an excellent first step, but your journey isn’t over just yet. Next, you need to determine how you want to proceed with skills gap analyses in your organization.\nThe marketplace has no shortage of tools or methods that can help you conduct skills gap analyses. You need to ensure you choose a tool that allows you to maintain baseline data and track employee progress—the more unbiased, the better.\nAdditionally, you’ll need a tool to help you conduct impactful training sessions centered around the identified skills gaps. We don’t mean check-box training; we mean training efforts that can lead to real, lasting employee growth.\nSimulations are a natural fit.\nSimulation tools like CapsimInbox provide assessments, skill gap analysis tools, learning modules, and progress-tracking all in one tool. You can also use simulations to conduct microlearning modules. These modules can be completed in 30 minutes or less, making them more engaging and less intrusive on the workday.\nCheck out CapsimInbox to see how our life-like, ready-to-use, or custom simulations can help your employees reach their maximum potential.

28	brain damage causes clinical features	Brain damage can result from either traumatic injury causing contusions and intracranial bleeding (as evidenced by subarachnoid and intraventricular blood), or from strokes (which can be ischemic due to blood clots or hemorrhagic due to vessel rupture). Clinical features include decreased consciousness (measured by Glasgow Coma Score), cognitive decline, muscle weakness, vision difficulties, speech problems, and motor movement impairment, with specific symptoms depending on the affected brain region.	['A young man with no significant past medical history was admitted to the Emergency Department following an assault. His Glasgow Coma Score on arrival was 8 with a motor score of 4 and there was evidence of an external head injury. Pupils were symmetrically reactive. He was intubated to facilitate further management. Both primary and secondary surveys were unremarkable apart from multiple contusions to the face and scalp. Multi-slice CT showed no intrabdominal or intrathoracic injury but significant intracranial pathology with subarachnoid and intraventricular blood and multiple, principally frontal contusions. No associated neuraxial fracture was seen.\nUrgent neurosurgical opinion was sought which confirmed no immediate target for surgical intervention. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit where appropriate monitoring was established including the insertion of a fibreoptic subdural intracranial pressure bolt. Initial intracranial pressure was measured at 18 mmHg. Sedation with propofol and alfentanil infusions was titrated to a RASS score of -3, ventilation adjusted to a PaO2 > 13 kPa and PaCO2 4.5-5.0 kPa as per the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines and an infusion of noradrenaline started to achieve a cerebral perfusion pressure of 60 mmHg. The patient was nursed 30° head-up and although active cooling was not undertaken, temperature maintained at less 35-37.5°C.\nThere was initial stability but approximately 24 hours after admission sustained rises in intracranial pressure (ICP) in excess of 25 mmHg were seen, necessitating boluses of sedation, the addition of atracurium by infusion, administration of hypertonic saline, cooling to 35°C and brief periods of hyperventilation to a PaCO2 4.0-4.5 kPa albeit without significant control. Urgent repeat CT brain was undertaken which showed evolution of the contusions with signifiant oedema and loss of both the lateral ventricles and basal cisterns.\nOn further consultation, neurosurgical colleagues again felt that no immediate surgical option was viable; in particular that attempts to insert and external ventricular drain were unlikely to be successful and that contusionectomy would produce significant disability. The patient was randomised into the RESCUEicp trial and thiopentone infusion started at a rate to produce isoelectrical activity on three lead electroencephalogram.\nWhat are the management options for refractory intracranial hypertension?\nEffective cerebral oxygenation requires an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure which in turn depends upon the ‘resistance’ offered by intracranial or jugular venous pressure (JVP), whichever is the higher. ICP is determined by the relative proportion of soft tissue, blood and CSF within the cranium. In healthy, supine adults normal ICP is 5-15 mmHg, becoming sub-atmospheric on standing (around -10 mmHg).(1)\nSustained elevations in ICP have been shown to adversely affect patient outcomes; intracranial hypertension therefore provides a crucial modifiable risk factor in the management of head-injured patients. The most recent Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines suggest that an ICP of 20-25 mmHg is the threshold at which treatment should be initiated.(2,3) In most cases, relatively conservative methods such as head elevation, sedation and osmotherapy are sufficient.(4) However, in some cases however, ICP remains elevated despite the optimal use of these treatments.Limited treatment modalities exist where no potentially evacuable mass lesions or CSF drainage opportunities exist.\nCooling may be considered for either control of ICP or neuroprotection. The benefit of hypothermia in the latter has been convincingly demonstrated after a transient global brain ischaemia following a cardiac arrest and is recommended in this setting by the European Rescuscitation Council.(5) A recent Cochrane meta-analysis of moderate hypothermia in the setting of traumatic brain injury concluded that there was no beneficial effect of routine hypothermia in TBI.(6) Patients receiving hypothermia were at a greater risk of developing pneumonia and slightly more prone to die. However, hypothermia combined brain-tissue oxygen guided management, may show improved neurological functioning but no survival benefit.(7) The ongoing Eurotherm trial may help to answer this question with more certainty; in this study patients are randomised to a minimum of 48 hours of hypothermia at 32-35 °C with a primary outcome measure of neurological status at 6 month follow-up.(8)\nThe efficacy of barbiturate coma in lowering ICP was demonstrated over twenty years ago. (1,9) No recent work has established the efficacy of this treatment in refractory intracranial hypertension and barbiturate therapy has become less popular treatment option due to their many potential side effects.(9) An improved survival has been demonstrated retrospectively where barbituate coma was used as a rescue therapy after failure of hyperosmolar treatment.(10) Maintenance of higher cerebral perfusion pressure in this setting was associated with better survival. The RESCUEicp trial comparing rescue barbiturate coma with decompressive craniectomy is currently ongoing.(11)\nVarious surgical options are available outside of primary management which may limit or prevent secondary insult in traumatic brain injury; indications for these interventions are recognised internationally with recommendations for the appropriate timing of surgery.(12) The role of decompressive craniectomy however, remains controversial. This may be performed prophylactically when removing mass lesions or as a rescue therapy, although as yet no high-quality evidence demonstrates an improved clinical outcome.(1,13) The most recent trial of this therapy demonstrated unfavourable functional outcomes although significant methodological issues existed.(14) These may be addressed by the ongoing RESCUEicp trial are made available.(11) Until then, it appears the role of surgery in the management of brain ischaemia is limited to focal lesions.\nAs yet no convincing paradigm exists for the management of refractory hypertension. Ongoing studies may better elucidate the role of pharmcosuppression and surgical decompression but as yet hypothermia appears to offer little benefit on it’s own.\n- Wijayatilake DS, Shepherd SJ, Sherren PB.

Med. 2011 Apr 21;364(16):1493–502.', 'The brain demands a constant supply of nutrient rich and oxygenated blood throughout life. The cerebral arteries accomplish the delivery of blood to all of the structures of the cerebrum. Thus, the cerebral arteries are absolutely imperative to survival. During our lifetimes, these cerebral arteries are prone to trauma, blockages and disease. Stroke pathophysiology is related trauma or blood clot formation in the brain. There are two different types of an acute stroke: an ischemic stroke and a hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic strokes are far more common than hemorrhagic strokes as they make up roughly 85% of all acute strokes. An ischemic stroke results when a blood clot forms in one of the arteries of the brain. Ischemic strokes are very serious as permanent brain damage and death may result due to the blockage. The other type of acute stroke, a hemorrhagic stroke, results when a blood vessel ruptures and subsequent brain bleeding occurs. Hemorrhagic stroke etiology is related to aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations. They are less common and usually constitute roughly 15% of acute strokes. There are many risk factors associated with the development of an acute stroke. These can include hypertension, aging, genetics, abnormal cholesterol levels, heart complications, and alcohol consumption.\nIt is important to minimize these risk factors to avoid an acute stroke. Symptoms of strokes include the sudden onset of muscle weakness or numbness, cognitive decline, vision loss, loss of muscle coordination, and migraines. It is important to monitor for the sign and symptoms of an acute stroke, as treatment must begin immediately. The prognosis of strokes greatly improves when treatment is administered as fast as possible after the onset of stroke complications. Stroke diagnosis can also involved the use of numerous tests and procedures. These can involve cerebral computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasounds and cerebral angiograms. If the detection of brain bleeding or blood clot is confirmed, treatment is begun immediately to improve the prognosis of a stroke. Treatment of a stroke can involve lifestyle changes, medications and if needed, emergency surgery. Lifestyle changes commonly recommended are quitting smoking and exercising regularly, while medications used are anticoagulants and thrombolytics. Surgery is used as a last resort in the treatment of an acute stroke. This is due to the added risks and complications surgery may present. The most common surgical procedure is a carotid endarterectomy. This procedure involves the removal of plaque and restoration of blood flow through the carotid artery to the brain.\nAn ischemic stroke is the most common type of acute stroke. Ischemic strokes can be further subdivided into thrombotic and embolic strokes. Stroke etiology differs between the two. In a cerebral thrombotic stroke, a blood clot forms directly in one of the cerebral arteries and remains there. It blocks blood flow to the respectively area of the brain which the artery was supplying. In a cerebral embolic stroke, a blood clot forms elsewhere in the body, usually in the chest or neck regions. This blood clot then dislodges and travels via the circulatory system into the brain. The symptoms related to an embolic stroke depend on which area of the brain is affected by the clot and subsequent blockage. Prognosis of stroke after suffering from an ischemic event is more positive than a hemorrhagic event.\nHemorrhagic strokes are less common than ischemic strokes. Hemorrhagic strokes are often extremely severe and life threatening. Stroke pathophysiology is caused by aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. An aneurysm results when a weakened blood vessel eventually ruptures and blood begins to pool in the surrounding region. Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) can also trigger hemorrhagic strokes. Arteriovenous malformations are a group of abnormal blood vessels that are prone to rupture and bleeding. Stroke complications are severe in hemorrhagic strokes. Brain bleeding can cause severe pressure on the surrounding regions of brain tissue and cause permanent tissue death. Prognosis of a stroke involving brain bleeding is relatively poor, especially if immediate treatment is not sought to relive the bleeding and pressure.\nRisk factors for the development of an acute stroke are associated with the increased likelihood of vessel hardening and narrowing. Both of these can trigger blood clot formation and rupture. Common risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, heart irregularities, smoking, aging, genetic history of clotting or rupture, alcohol consumption, obesity, lack of exercise, poor diet and abnormal cholesterol levels. These risk factors have the ability to compound and exponentially increase your risk for an acute stroke as well. It is important to mitigate the risk of developing an acute stroke. Speaking with your physician is imperative in minimizing the above risk factors.\nSymptoms of strokes can be very severe and life altering. In many cases, symptoms can be permanent as brain damage can result from an acute stroke. It is extremely important to be proactive in monitoring for the symptoms of strokes as immediate treatment can be life saving. Common symptoms associated with an acute stroke are facial paralysis, muscle weakness throughout the body, cognitive decline or confusion, vision difficulties, speech difficulties, trouble with motor movement, and migraines or headaches. Depending on where the blood clot or rupture occurs, patients can also suffer from a left-sided stroke or right-sided stroke. Patients suffering from damage in the right side of the brain, suffer from a life-sided stroke and vise versa. The left-sided stroke involves inability to speak, and language impairments, as while a right-handed stroke involves general cognitive decline and vision problems. These strokes are directly related to the left and right sides of the brain having distinct and different functions in everyday life.\nThe quick and accurate diagnosis is imperative in prognosis of strokes. If treatment can begin immediately, the chances of a full recovery greatly improve. If stroke complications are present, several diagnostic tools and procedures are often used to confirm the presence of brain bleeding or clotting. This can include the use of blood tests, cerebral computed tomography (CT) scans, computed tomography arteriograms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance arteriograms, carotid ultrasounds, carotid angiograms, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms. These tests can provide information on how blood is flowing through the cerebral arteries, help detect brain bleeding and clotting, examine for pressure buildups and heart irregularities. It is important to discuss with your physician on what is the best diagnostic procedure for the detection of an acute stroke.\nStroke treatment must begin immediately following the detection of stroke complications and symptoms. The prognosis of an acute stroke greatly diminishes if treatment is not sought immediately. Treatment is also dependent on the size and severity of blood clot or blood vessel rupture. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, medications and, if needed, emergency surgeries to relieve the blood clot or cranial pressure build up.\nThe lifestyle changes commonly recommended are directly correlated with the risk factors associated with developing an acute stroke. These lifestyle changes aid in general health as well. Lifestyle changes can include dietary changes (avoidance of foods high in saturated and Tran’s fats, sugars), exercising regularly, and losing weight, quitting smoking and avoiding alcohol. All of these things can reduce the likelihood of blood vessel hardening and narrowing. It may also revere the development of atherosclerosis. It is important to seek advice from your doctor on how to best make lifestyle changes to decrease the risks associated with an acute stroke.\nMedications are often vital in the treatment of an acute stroke. Common medications used are anticoagulants, antiplatelet and thrombolytics. Warfarin and Aspirin are the most common anticoagulant and antiplatelet respectively. They are used to help decrease the likelihood of blood clot formation in the future and also can limit the size of the present blood clot. Other medications used in the treatment process involve medications to control blood pressure and cholesterol. Managing blood pressure is vital in the avoidance of hemorrhagic strokes and thus, medications such as diuretics and ACE inhibitors are used. In terms of cholesterol, statins are commonly used to control low-density lipoprotein (LDL or bad cholesterol) levels to avoid atherosclerosis development. The most important medication for in the treatment of an acute stroke is thrombolytics. The most common thrombolytic medication is tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA. Tissue plasminogen activator works to dissolve the present clot entirely to restore blood flow to areas of the brain. Tissue plasminogen activator needs to be administered within 3-4 hours of stroke onset and thus, is the reason treatment must be sought immediately to improve prognosis of stroke. Patients on tPA must be monitored regularly as severe bleeding is a side effect of the medication. Searching for a natural vasodilator? Recent studies have found that medical marijuana may have some weight in this arena.\nIn terms of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, emergency surgery may be used if deemed necessary. It is commonly used as last resort as due to the added complications and risk it poses. Carotid endarterectomy is a common procedure used to remove plaque build up from the carotid artery.

29	catchment management waterborne disease prevention measures	Canterbury's approach to water management focuses on tailoring solutions to individual catchments - areas of land bound by natural features where surface and sub-surface water flows into streams, rivers and wetlands. This localized approach is crucial given that waterborne diseases are a significant concern in New Zealand, with common pathogens including Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Campylobacter, often originating from livestock sources. To prevent outbreaks, management strategies include community-based zone committees making recommendations on water allocation and nutrient management, while monitoring systems are in place to track water quality and report incidents. The Havelock North outbreak demonstrates the importance of vigilant safeguarding of drinking water sources and appropriate disinfection measures.	"[""He puna wai, he puna tāngata. The pool of water sustains the pool of people.\nWe help ensure that we have enough clean, fresh water today and in the future.\nHow are we doing now?\nOver the past twenty years, rural land use in Canterbury has changed and the amount of nutrients reaching waterways has increased. This has led to a decline in water quality in some areas. There is also less water in our region than in previous years. This is as a result of a long period of dry weather, which may continue for some time, and a dramatic increase in demand. In Canterbury, groundwater use now surpasses out-of-river water use. We can’t increase the amount of water in the system, but we can work to ensure the water we have is managed in the most sustainable way possible.\nWhat do we need to do?\nOur management of water has immense significance for the region’s future productivity, the maintenance of ecosystems and the purity of our drinking water. We need to tailor solutions to individual catchments, of which there are thousands in Canterbury. We need to work with communities to deliver the outcomes communities want, in a collaborative manner — beyond simply setting and enforcing rules.\nA catchment or river basin is the area of land bound by natural features such as hills or mountains, from which surface and sub-surface water flows into streams, rivers and wetlands. Everyone lives in a catchment.\nA way forward together\nWe know that water is highly valued and that people who live and work in Canterbury have significant expectations around water quality, water use and quantity. It is also an issue that creates significant tension and debate. Our way of working is set out in the Canterbury Water Management Strategy. It provides a collaborative framework to help manage the multiple demands on our precious water resource. The overarching vision of the strategy is ‘to gain the greatest cultural, economic, environmental, recreational and social benefits from our water resources within a sustainable framework both now and for future generations’.\nWe've put our people where the discussions, issues and solutions are. We’ve moved many of our operational staff out into community-based zone teams.\nWhat is happening in my zone?\nDecisions on water allocation and nutrient management are driven by recommendations from zone committees in 10 areas, which are made up of community members, rūnanga and council representatives. Members are appointed for three years and seek feedback and opinions from stakeholders and the community to ensure all interests are represented. There is also a regional committee that considers environmental restoration and repair, land use impacts on water quality and water storage, distribution and efficiency options.\n- Keep up to date via our Canterbury Water page on Facebook\n- Check swimming water quality at your favourite recreational spot\n- Use our pollution hotline to report a water quality incident\n- Check out the Government’s National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management\n- View up-to-date cyanobacteria warnings for rivers and lakes\n- Read an illustrated story about the Canterbury Water Management Strategy"", 'A Cautionary Tale of Untreated Groundwater, Campylobacter, and New Zealand’s Largest Drinking Water Outbreak\nHavelock North is a suburb of the City of Hastings on the North Island of New Zealand with 14,000 residents. By the end of August 2016, over one-third of the residents of this entire town had been sickened by drinking water contaminated with Campylobacter bacteria, the most common source of foodborne illness in New Zealand.1 How did a wealthy country with national drinking water standards come to experience the largest documented drinking water outbreak in its history?\nLike most waterborne disease outbreaks, Havelock North’s began when a few residents stayed home from work assuming they had food poisoning or a seasonal illness. The trickle soon grew to dozens, then hundreds, and ultimately thousands of residents suffering from debilitating cramps, headaches and nausea. “By Friday August 12 schools reported hundreds of children struck down with widespread vomiting and diarrhoea… Whole families were sick, with parents having to look after children while battling the illness themselves.”2\nLocal health authorities noticed the rising numbers of patients seeking medical treatment for gastrointestinal symptoms at about the same time the Hastings District Council received a positive test for bacteria in the town’s groundwater supply. The bacteria were later determined to be Campylobacter. Local officials decided to chlorinate the groundwater shortly thereafter and advised residents to boil water. The latest estimates are that more than 5,000 persons (with over 600 confirmed cases of campylobacterosis) were sickened, with scores hospitalized and two confirmed cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome-a rare neurological illness that can be caused by Campylobacter infection. A detailed timeline of the outbreak is available.\nOn average, New Zealand records about 17 waterborne outbreaks (range from 6 to 27) per year,3 primarily zoonotic diseases that can spread between animals and humans such as through ingestion of water contaminated with feces. The top two are caused by intestinal parasites, Giardia and Cryptosporidium; the third is Campylobacter. The most frequent reservoirs of Campylobacter in New Zealand are sheep, poultry, cattle and swine. Initial reports are that livestock are the most likely source of the Havelock North Campylobacter.\nMost reported outbreaks in New Zealand are small with an average of about eight affected persons, but larger outbreaks are often traced to animal waste entering a well after heavy rain and receiving no or insufficient treatment. In fact, just days before the first people became sick, the region received three months’ worth of rain in a single weekend-conditions hauntingly familiar to the deadly pathogenic E. coli and Campylobacter outbreak that occurred in 2000 in Walkerton, Canada, where seven people died and thousands fell sick. In Walkerton, heavy rain washed cow manure applied as fertilizer into a municipal well whose chlorinator was not operating due to inadequate maintenance. Similar to Walkerton, Havelock North also relies on a shallow aquifer, but unlike Walkerton, Havelock North was intentionally not chlorinating because their groundwater had been considered “secure” from contamination. In addition to local and regional investigations, an independent government inquiry into the cause of the historic outbreak was announced on August 18, the results of which are expected by March 2017.\nSimilar to the fallout from the Walkerton outbreak, the Havelock North outbreak has raised concerns about the management of public water sources across the New Zealand, including whether chlorination should be required for all groundwater drinking water supplies. Aside from the still unknown but considerable human and societal costs,4 the 2016 Havelock North outbreak is a cautionary tale: Public health officials must be ever vigilant to safeguard drinking water sources from contamination while providing appropriate disinfection. Because chlorine is both economical and effective in killing/inactivating Campylobacter and most other pathogenic bacteria and viruses, it can be viewed as a very inexpensive insurance policy against the high cost of waterborne illness when it is continuously applied at the proper level.\nFred M. Reiff, P.E., is a retired official from both the U.S. Public Health Service and the Pan American Health Organization, and lives in the Reno, Nevada, area.\n1 On a global basis, the majority of small outbreaks of Campylobacter gastrointestinal illness are due to eating meat that has been contaminated with this pathogen during the slaughtering process. It is noteworthy that most raw poultry is contaminated with C. jejuni, which highlights the need for it to be cooked thoroughly before consumption.\n2 Something in the Water – How the Havelock Gastro Outbreak Began. http://www.nzherald.co.nz/hawkes-bay-today/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503462&objectid=11697426.\n3 New Zealand Ministry of Health (2007).

30	scba cylinder connection types and training requirements	SCBA cylinders can have either quick connect or threaded valve connections. Quick connect allows faster changes but requires checking for proper connection by pulling back on the cylinder valve. Threaded valves need several turns for an airtight connection. Training requirements include learning to check equipment condition, practicing cylinder changeout, and conducting pre-use tests to ensure safe operation. Training must be done by participants who can communicate in English or with an interpreter present.	['Photos by author\nSome self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) manufacturers are designing their cylinders to have a quick connect for the cylinder to be attached to the high-pressure hose feeding the reducing block. This quick connect allows for a faster change time between cylinders and to make the process easier. Most SCBA cylinders will have a threaded valve that will screw right into the high-pressure hose, making an airtight connection. It does take a few turns to make the connection and this process does add a bit if time. There is also a potential for cross threading if done in a hurry or in an improper manner. The threaded type of connection ensures that you have an airtight and locked connection.\nRELATED FIREFIGHTER TRAINING\nThe quick connect as shown in the two pictures has one inherent problem, namely the possibility of the connection not snapping in correctly. The lights and sound may activate, indicating the connection, only to have the valve pop back out once the cylinder is opened. Ensure that your connection is made by pulling back on the cylinder valve, as an attempt to pull it back out. If connected properly, it should not come out.\nThe majority of SCBAs also have a mask-mounted regulator (MMR) that connects the low-pressure air hose to the face piece, which allows the firefighter to breathe. The MMR is a technological advancement in the SCBA, replacing the belt-mounted regulator of the older generation of SCBAs. In photo 3 below, you can see one type of SCBA MMR connected to the face piece. The MMR is connected correctly to the face piece and you can see that there is no gap between the MMR and the face piece receptacle.\nIn photo 4, you will see an improperly connected MMR to the face piece. You can see a gap present between the MMR and the face piece. The problem that can occur here with the MMR is that air flow will be initiated upon inhalation by the firefighter, but the connection is not complete. The MMR will pop back out once any physical movement occurs. There have been times in training and an emergency scene where the MMR has popped back out due to a faulty connection. To ensure that the connection has been made correctly, pull back on the MMR to try and pull it back out. If connected properly, it will pull the face piece with the MMR.\nA simple training drill is to practice the changeout of a SCBA cylinder as well as donning and doffing the MMR from the mask.\nEquipment needed: SCBA, spare cylinder, face piece\nGoal: To practice and become familiar with “the SCBA tug.”\n- Check in the SCBA to make sure that it is in working condition.\n- Change out the cylinder. Put a new cylinder in and, once connected, tug back on the connection to ensure that it is connected\n- Don the SCBA on the back of the firefighter, open the cylinder fully, and go on air.\n- When connecting the MMR to the face piece, start the flow of air by breathing.\n- Take one hand and tug on the MMR away from the face piece to ensure that it is connected to the mask.\n- Once done, doff the regulator and shut down the SCBA.\n- Repeat as necessary.\n- When connecting a quick connect or snap-in cylinder, gently pull back on the connection to ensure it is connected.\n- When connecting the MMR to the face piece, tug back on the regulator to ensure a connection.\nMark van der Feyst has been in the fire service since 1999 and is a full-time firefighter in Ontario, Canada.

31	gray box testing benefits drawbacks web apps	Gray box testing combines benefits of both black and white box testing, using limited system knowledge like design documents and interface definitions. For web services, it leverages WSDL files to construct intelligent tests without requiring source code access. The benefits include non-intrusive testing, intelligent test authoring, and unbiased testing with clear separation between testers and developers. However, limitations include partial code coverage and difficulty in defect identification within distributed environments. In fintech applications, gray box testing includes software design and architecture review beyond standard black box testing, requiring more documentation and team involvement than black box testing but less than white box testing.	"[""SOA Testing Techniques\nSOA Testing Tools for Black, White and Gray Box\nBlack, White & Gray Box SOA Testing Tools are essential for deploying robust, scalable, interoperable and secure Web Services.\nWeb Services are the foundations of modern Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Typical Web Services include message exchange between a consumer and a producer using SOAP request and responses over the ubiquitous HTTP protocol. A Web service producer advertises its services to potential consumers through Web Services Description Language (WSDL) – an XML file that contains details of available operations, execution endpoints and expected SOAP request-response structures.\nMany testing techniques and methodologies developed over the years apply to Web Services-based SOA systems as well. Through functional, regression, unit, integration, system and process level testing, the primary objective of testing methodologies is to increase confidence that the target system will deliver functionality in a robust, scalable, interoperable and secure manner.\nTechniques such as Black, White and Gray Box testing applied to traditional systems map well into Web Services deployments. However, the following characteristics of a Web Services deployments introduce unique testing challenges:\n§ Web Services are intrinsically distributed and are platform and language agnostic.\n§ Web Services can be chained with dependencies on other 3rd party Web Services that can change without notice.\n§ Web Services ownership is shared across various stakeholders.\n§ Web Services client developers typically only have access to interfaces (WSDLs) and lack access to code.\nIn this paper, we will investigate testing techniques and their application to Web Services. We will use a simple sample Web service to illustrate each of these techniques and the relative strengths and weaknesses of such techniques. Finally, a novel approach that extends Gray Box’s reach into realm of White Box testing by leveraging the rich information provided in the WSDL file will be described.\nEssential Testing Techniques\nUsing Black, White, & Gray Box Testing techniques are key to deploying robust SOA.\nGray Box Testing is ideal for Web Services Consumers\nPublished Web Services operations in WSDLs provide rich enough information for consumers to derive benefits of Gray Box Testing.\nExtending Gray Box’s Reach into the Domain of White Box Testing\nUsing Web Services WSDLs, intelligent auto-generated tests can elevate the Gray Box Testing closer to White Box Testing without the associated burdens.\nMutations based on Web Services WSDLs enable users to auto-generate tests that exercise multiple code-paths extensively in published operations.\nII. Black, White and Gray Box Testing for Web Services\nA. Black Box Testing\nDefinition: Black Box testing refers to the technique of testing a system with no knowledge of the internals of the system. Black Box testers do not have access to the source code and are oblivious of the system architecture. A Black Box tester typically interacts with a system through a user interface by providing inputs and examining outputs without knowing where and how the inputs were operated upon. In Black-Box testing, target software is exercised over a range of inputs and the outputs are observed for correctness. How those outputs are generated or what is inside the Box doesn't matter to the tester.\nWeb Service Example: To illustrate Black Box testing for a sample Web Services, an operation Divide that simply divides to integers a and b. The Black Box tester is unaware of what operating system, programming language, 3rd party libraries or other Web Services are being used under the hood to perform the Divide operation.\nFigure 1: Black Box Testing Example for Divide Operation.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the Black Box tester has the ability to insert inputs to the operation and look at outputs. The tester may know that the Web Services WSDL is located but is completely oblivious of implementation details, program execution states, and internal exception handling. The tester has a specification and goes through a rigorous, time-consuming and oftentimes redundant exercise of trying values and ensuring that the operation Divide functions as expected.\n§ Efficient Testing – Well suited and efficient for large code segments or units.\n§ Unbiased Testing – clearly separates user’s perspective from developer’s perspective through separation of QA and Development responsibilities.\n§ Non intrusive – code access not required.\n§ Easy to execute – can be scaled to large number of moderately skilled testers with no knowledge of implementation, programming language, operating systems or networks.\n§ Localized Testing – Limited code path coverage since only a limited number of test inputs are actually tested.\n§ Inefficient Test Authoring – without implementation information, exhaustive input coverage has unknown additional benefits to the actual code paths exercised and can require tremendous resources.\n§ Blind Coverage – cannot control targeting code segments or paths which may be more error prone than others.\nBlack Box testing is best suited for rapid test scenario testing and quick Web Service prototyping. This testing technique for Web Services provides quick feedback on the functional readiness of operations through quick spot checking. Black Box testing is also better suited for operations that have enumerated inputs or tightly defined ranges or facets so that broad input coverage is not necessary.\nB. White Box Testing\nDefinition: White Box testing refers to the technique of testing a system with knowledge of the internals of the system. White Box testers have access to the source code and are aware of the system architecture. A White Box tester typically analyzes source code, derives test cases from knowledge about the source code, and finally targets specific code paths to achieve a certain level of code coverage.\nWeb Service Example: To illustrate White Box testing, Figure 2 presents a simple set of rudimentary operations in C#. The first Operation Divide takes in 2 integers and returns a divide-by b with no checks on the input values. The second operation safeDivide takes in 2 string parameter inputs, but in contrast to the first operation Divide, the safeDivide operation has a broad exception handling mechanism that safely catches errors for cases where either bad data types of bad data values are sent.\nA White Box tester with access to such details about both operations can readily craft efficient test cases that exercise boundary conditions. Just by observing the code, a White Box tester can immediately try:\n§ Divide-by-Zero scenario by setting the denominator b to zero\n§ Integer Overflow scenario by setting either integer a value > ± 2,147,483,647\n§ Orthogonal Data types for example floats, date, decimal data types.\n§ Special characters.\nFigure 2: White Box Testing Example for 2 Web Services Operations.\nA simple Divide-by-Zero test, executed for the safeDivide operation returns a rudimentary error code -1 as expected. However, performing the same Divide-by-Zero test on the Divide operation results in the following verbose stack trace in the SOAP Response:\n3. <faultstring>System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapException: Server was unable to process request. --- System.DivideByZeroException: Attempted to divide by zero. at DivideService.Divide(Int32 a, Int32 b)End of inner exception stack trace ---\nIn the Divide operation, a White Box tester can quickly identify and subsequently verify that the target operation has no custom exception handling but rather relies on the vendor container running the Web Service to handle the exception. The tester would then point this lack of exception handling to the development teams and bring this operation inline with the safeDivide operation where try-catch flow is used for exception handling. A Black Box tester may perhaps identify the weakness through blind testing, however, the level of effort and the number of iterations would be large and the probability of stumbling on to such defects would be low, especially with increasing program complexity.\n§ Increased Effectiveness – Crosschecking design decisions and assumptions against source code may outline a robust design, but the implementation may not align with the design intent.\n§ Full Code Pathway Capable – all the possible code pathways can be tested including error handling, resource dependencies, and additional internal code logic/flow.\n§ Early Defect Identification – Analyzing source code and developing tests based on the implementation details enables testers to find programming errors quickly.\n§ Reveal Hidden Code Flaws – access to source code improves understanding and uncovering unintended hidden behavior of program modules.\n§ Difficult To Scale – requires intimate knowledge of target system, testing tools and coding languages, and modeling. It suffers for scalability of skilled and expert testers.\n§ Difficult to Maintain – requires specialized tools such as source code analyzers, debuggers, and fault injectors.\n§ Cultural Stress – the demarcation between developer and testers starts to blur which may become a cultural stress.\n§ Highly intrusive – requires code modification has been done using interactive debuggers, or by actually changing the source code. This may be adequate for small programs; however, it does not scale well to larger applications. Not useful for networked or distributed systems.\nWhite-Box testing is most suited for Web Services early in the development cycle where the developer and the tester may collaborate to identify defects. White-Box testing is problematic for large SOA deployments where the distributed nature of services makes it easy for 3rd party Web Services to be invoked from within other Web Services. This results in the lack of knowledge of programming language, operating systems and hardware platforms. Unlike calling functions from a shared library running in the same memory space, distributed Web Services provide additional access challenges making White-Box testing across a SOA next to impossible.\nC. Gray Box Testing\nDefinition: Gray Box testing refers to the technique of testing a system with limited knowledge of the internals of the system. Gray Box testers have access to detailed design documents with information beyond requirement documents. Gray Box tests are generated based on information such as state-based models or architecture diagrams of the target system.\nWeb Service Example: To illustrate Gray Box testing, Figure 3 presents a Web Services Definition Language (WSDL) file for the simple Divide and safeDivide operations. Lines 3-36 show the data types for the messages. These lines as well as Lines 23-24 and Lines 43-45 point to safeDivide request message using unbounded strings. Even without access to source code or binaries, this would indicate to a tester to try buffer overflow type boundary conditions.\nWithout access to source code or binaries, a web service tester can only consume and invoke Web Services through WSDL files. With a rich array of information available through such WSDLs, and the inability to modify code or binaries for White Box testing, a Web Services tester can use details such as the location of the web service and the transport protocol (Line 82), data types (Lines 3-36), etc. provide significant leverage for authoring intelligent, efficient and highly targeted test cases.\nFigure 3: WSDL file (partially collapsed) for Divide and safeDivide operations.\n§ Offers Combined Benefits – Leverage strengths of both Black Box and White Box testing wherever possible.\n§ Non Intrusive – Gray Box does not rely on access to source code or binaries. Instead, based on interface definition, functional specifications, and application architecture.\n§ Intelligent Test Authoring – Based on the limited information available, a Gray Box tester can author intelligent test scenarios, especially around data type handling, communication protocols and exception handling.\n§ Unbiased Testing – The demarcation between testers and developer is still maintained. The handoff is only around interface definitions and documentation without access to source code or binaries.\n§ Partial Code Coverage – Since the source code or binaries are not available, the ability to traverse code paths is still limited by the tests deduced through available information. The coverage depends on the tester authoring skills.\n§ Defect Identification – Inherent to distributed application is the difficult associated in defect identification. Gray Box testing is still at the mercy of how well systems throw exceptions and how well are these exceptions propagated with a distributed Web Services environment.\nThe inherent distributed nature of Web Services and lack of source code or program binaries access makes White Box testing impossible within a SOA. With WSDLs as the de facto contract between consumers and producers in a Web Services-based SOA, significant information is available to construct intelligent and efficient gray Box tests. WSDLs provide rich information to construct and automate such tests to improve Web Services deployments.\nIII. Pushing Gray towards White Box Testing\nThrough WSDLs – the Web Services API – testers have significant insight into the protocol, data types, operation expectations and error handling capabilities of a Web Services. Intelligent and efficient Gray Box tests can be authored and run to determine defects based on the information available in WSDLs. However, there exists a strong need to automate the test generation process based on the available information for increased testing efficiency.\nXSD-Mutation™ is one such patent-pending automation technique by\nCrosscheck Networks’ SOAPSonar™\nBy using such techniques, Web Services can be thoroughly exercised without source code or binary access. Along the Black-White testing spectrum, such testing techniques push the middle ground gray Box testing more towards the White Box testing end of the spectrum without the associated expense or intrusiveness. Furthermore, given that White Box testing is not even an option in distributed Web Services-based SOAs, the only option available is to start with Gray Box testing and use automation tools such as SOAPSonar™ to push the gray towards White Box testing. Mutation techniques add newer test “frequencies” to the testing spectrum driving the test cases closer towards a complete White Box set of “frequencies.”\nIV. Summary & Recommendations\nWeb Services-based SOA plays an important role in facilitating the integration of disparate applications from various departments or trading partners and thus increasing business productivity. The distributed nature of Web Services makes Gray Box testing ideal for detecting defects within a SOA. Black Box testing provides rapid functional testing that can be used across distributed services; however, owing to the “blind” nature of Black Box testing, test coverage is limited, inefficient and redundant. White Box testing is not practical for Web Services since access to source code or binaries in a Web Services deployment is usually impossible. By leveraging the rich information presented in WSDL files, intelligent and efficient Gray Box test can be generated. Further state-of-the-art techniques such as message mutation can be used to auto-generate a large array of test that can extract program internals – exception handling, states, flows – without having access to source or binaries. Such techniques push the Gray Box testing closer to the results of White Box testing without dealing with its expense or intrusive characteristics.\nV.

Penetration testing gives you the independent assurance that all the hard work you have invested in designing and implementing secure infrastructure or applications has paid off and your product won’t fall apart when subjected to malicious activity – as eventually it will be. Deciding on the specific type and scope of penetration testing however is not straightforward. Here is a basic introduction to assist with informed decision-making.\nWeb application penetration testing\nPenetration testing of Web applications involves identification of security weaknesses and vulnerabilities caused by insecure coding practices, misconfiguration and bugs. It is usually performed on a test instance of the application but can also be performed on live instances. The penetration testing process involves intercepting, analysing, modifying and generating specially crafted malicious and/or invalid HTTP requests to identify and exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in the application and usually covers at least the Top 10 areas of risk as identified by the Open Web Applications Security Project (OWASP) with additional testing based on specific business requirements or technologies used.\nInfrastructure penetration testing\nInfrastructure penetration testing is a generic term covering testing of operating systems, network services, network devices and other targets. Its objective is to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that can be exploited to obtain unauthorised access to data, systems or hosted applications. Specific testing activities and methodologies may differ depending on the scope and objectives of the infrastructure testing engagement but most engagements involve the following stages:\n1. Identification and enumeration of targets of testing\n2. Reconnaissance and information gathering\n3. Identification of vulnerabilities, weaknesses or misconfiguration\n4. Testing and exploitation of identified vulnerabilities\n5. Post-exploitation activities\n6. Reporting and recommendations to address the identified issues\nUnderstanding your options: black, grey or white?\nWhen it comes to commissioning a penetration test you will need to decide whether you require a black, grey or white box penetration test. The type of testing chosen will decide the amount of time and effort required as well as the level of security assurance obtained – not to mention the cost.\nBlack box testing is the most widely performed (“standard”) type of testing – it gives basic assurance that is usually sufficient in most cases, and includes automated testing, manual review, and manual testing to identify any weaknesses or vulnerabilities in your application that may be exploited to compromise the security of your data or customers.\nGrey box testing includes software design and architecture review in addition to all activities included in black box testing.\nWhite box testing provides the maximum possible assurance – in addition to including all of the above it also includes review of source code to identify weaknesses or vulnerabilities hidden deep within the application code.\nThe type of testing chosen determines how much time and effort is required and the extent of your own team’s involvement in the testing process. Whereas with black box testing your team’s involvement is limited to provision of a test instance of your application or specification of infrastructure to be tested, with grey or white box testing documentation, meetings and access to source code would have to be arranged as appropriate.\nThe time required to test a particular application or infrastructure depends on its size and complexity, as well as the type of testing: a black box test of a simple application may only require a day or two, while a white box test of a large and complex application may require weeks or more. Most testing engagements however are black box tests and usually take about a week to complete. Once testing is concluded a report is issued detailing identified findings and their criticality, as well as making recommendations on how to address them and the engagements are usually concluded by holding a closing meeting where the next steps and discussed and agreed.\nEdgar ter Danielyan']"	['<urn:uuid:8c50aa16-6162-4412-9fce-f48f7dfae634>', '<urn:uuid:80c2e95f-b5fe-4881-a931-9e3b118ae721>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	7	103	3116
32	what protein cause alzheimers failed trials	While A-beta amyloid peptide was historically viewed as the principal cause of Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease, multiple clinical trials targeting A-beta aggregates have not proven this hypothesis.	"[""Treating Alzheimer's with Gene Therapy and the Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (2021-2022)\nThe causative factors and the mechanism behind the onset of Late-onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LOAD) remain unknown. Historically, the common view has been that the A-beta amyloid peptide is the principal cause; however, multiple clinical trials targeting A-beta aggregates have not borne this out. Moreover, treating LOAD at a late stage, in which pathological lesions are already apparent, is thought to diminish the effectiveness of any disease-modifying therapy.\nGaining insight into the biological pathways and molecular basis underlying the causes of LOAD should lead to the development of disease-modifying and/or preventative treatments. In turn, that would eventually increase our ability to offset this devastating disease process and mitigate the suffering of LOAD patients and their loved ones.\nRecently emerged gene-editing technologies provide an unparalleled opportunity for treating LOAD and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, new therapies also bring up many questions regarding safety and perceptions of patients as well as their family caregivers. How will gene therapy in LOAD be distributed in a just way? Who will pay for it? What are the implications of administering expensive therapies to patients closer to the end of life than the beginning? What do patients and their family members think about this technology’s potential and applications?\nThis project aims to advance research and development of the new gene therapy technologies that will be applicable to treating age-related brain diseases such as LOAD, and to examine their implications for society.\nThe project team will design an experimental plan and participate in laboratory experiments that will test the hypothesis that the association of the APOE gene with LOAD is mediated by dysregulation of APOE expression. The team will focus on modulating APOE expression levels as a therapeutic target for LOAD using innovative genome and epigenome editing tools based on CRISPR/Cas9 technologies. The outcomes of this research will greatly facilitate the development of “smart” drugs for treating LOAD.\nIn addition, the team will investigate ethical, legal and social questions related to the CRISPR/Cas9 technology and gene therapy for LOAD and other late-onset neurodegenerative conditions. Team members will undertake case studies of earlier gene therapies and trace their development; evaluate the ethical issues associated with the use of gene editing technologies; analyze novel questions of cost and pricing for so-called “one and done” therapies; and mine the literature for approaches to late-onset diseases that have reckoned with both treatment and quality-of-life issues.\nLearn more about this project team by viewing the team's video.\nManuscripts in scientific journals; presentations at professional conferences and to the community; preliminary data for external grant applications\nIdeally, this project team will include 1-2 graduate students and 3-4 undergraduate students from a diverse set of disciplines such as neuroscience, biology, biomedical engineering, social sciences and humanities.\nStudents involved in bench research will gain the experience in cutting-edge genome and epigenome editing technologies using innovative human stem cell techniques. Students engaged in ethical, legal and social implications(ELSI) research will conduct primary data collection with health consumers and family caregivers and gain skills in developing a research protocol, conducting interviews, collecting data and conducting qualitative data analysis. Team members will contribute to publications, posters and abstracts and may also get the opportunity to participate and present their work at international Alzheimer’s and/or gene and cell therapy conferences. These experiences will provide them with learning opportunities to enrich their language skills.\nTeam interactions will include joint weekly team meetings that will alternate among student project presentations, journal clubs and external guest speakers. The team leaders will invite speakers to present on specific aspects of gene therapy, LOAD and ELSI and speak with the students about their career experiences.\nThe Summer 2021 component is required for all students and will take place over six weeks, from May 24 to July 2, 2021, for 40 hours per week.\nJulio Barrera will serve as project manager.\nSummer 2021 – Spring 2022\n- Summer 2021: Receive training and practice lab safety; acquire skills in molecular techniques and laboratory procedures; search background literature; seek IRB approval; define ethical, legal and social questions; choose and launch individual projects (bench-based and caregivers survey); present on project aims, approaches and progress\n- Fall 2021: Continue individual research projects\n- Spring 2022: Continue individual research projects\nAcademic credit available for fall and spring semesters; summer funding available\nSee earlier related team, Gene Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease and Ethical Aspects of Genome Editing (2020-2021).\nImage: Mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, by NIH Image Gallery, licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0\n- Nathan Boucher, Sanford School of Public Policy\n- Ornit Chiba-Falek, School of Medicine-Neurology\n- Boris Kantor, School of Medicine-Neurobiology\n/yfaculty/staff Team Members\nJulio Barrera, School of Medicine-Neurology\nLogan Brown, School of Medicine-Neurobiology""]"	['<urn:uuid:a7bee1d7-8e8b-4655-aa54-731f8c98e102>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	6	26	787
33	What solvent is used to remove stamps from discs?	Acetone is used as a very strong solvent to remove manufacturer's stamps from discs.	"[""If you would like to share your dye methods, send me an e-mail and I will post it here.\nSubmitted by Will T.\nI had always wanted to dye a disc. I had seen other peoples cool designs and I didn't really like most of the stamps put on the discs by manufacturers. I happened to finally read a post about dyed discs at www.odsa.com, my local disc golf forum, which described the following technique. I did not invent this method. I just decided to put together a step by step with pictures to help anyone else interested in using this technique.\nThe first step is to remove the manufacturer's stamp from the disc. This is done using a very strong solvent called Acetone that will very quickly remove the stamp. I very much recommend doing this outside. Use gloves and follow all directions for safe use on the can of Acetone. I use a small rag and pour a very small amount onto the rag. Then very quickly start wiping away the stamp on the disc. This solvent will start to eat into proline plastic if you take too long. I didn't notice this problem with champion, kc pro, esp or z plastic. Be careful with lighter colored discs because the solvent mixing with the ink of the stamp can start to dye your disc that color. This happened on a white proline disc with a blue stamp. As I was trying to wipe the blue stamp off I could see that it began to tint the white a little. Work quickly!!Make and Cut the stencil: Create a stencil that you want to put on your disc. Here is a geometric design I made in fireworks and printed out. Tape the stencil to a piece of sign vinyl. Cut out the stencil using an xacto blade. When cutting out your stencil remember that the cut out areas will be the dyed areas on the disc. Putting the Stencil on the disc: This part gets a little tricky but I will try to explain it the best I can. It is one of those things that you need to do once to understand but once you do it is fairly easy. First remove the paper you taped to the vinyl to help cut the stencil. Then cut a piece of tranfer tape slightly bigger than the piece of vinyl. The vinyl has two sides, a shiny white side and a backing side with lettering (in this case it is 3M). You want to apply the transfer tape to the shiny white side. Make sure the vinyl is flat when you do this part. Lay the transfer tape on top of the vinyl and use a credit card to rub the tranfer tape onto the vinyl. You want to make sure the tranfer tape is stuck to the vinyl, especially in the fine detail areas. This is what will allow you to transfer the stencil onto the disc without the stencil moving around and getting stuck to itself. This show the backside of the vinyl/tranfer tape. Note the lettering. Now put this onto to your disc where you want the stencil to be. The transfer tape will stick to the disc a little so I use this to help with positioning. It is easier on clear discs as you can just turn them over and place it onto the stencil. Once the stencil is where you want it place pieces of tape basically in the center of the stencil. I have shown where my tape is in red. The idea is that you are trying to create a flap. While holding onto the flap peel the backing off the vinyl. Be very careful at the point. If the vinyl gets stuck to something or bent and stuck to itself there is not much you can do to fix it. Very carefully cut the backing off. I did a somewhat bad job here. You don't want those ragged edges. The scissors I used aren't great so I just kind of tore it off after a certain point. A clean cut as close to the center is what you want. Now start lowering the flap back down smoothing it onto the disc as you go. Try to smooth out any little bubble or lines at this point. Any bubbles or lines in or around your design can cause bleeding. Turn it around and do the other side but this time you don't need to cut. You will probably have to remove the tape you used in the center. That's okay though because the stencil is already half applied and will stay in place. You are removing the rest of the backing from the vinyl. Smooth as you lower the flap down. Try to get all bubbles and lines out now. Now the stencil is on the disc. Remove the transfer tape. It will pretty much pull right off. Grab a corner and pull. Masking: Now the rest of the disc needs to be covered so it doesn't get dyed as well. I use contact paper for this part as it is a lot cheaper than the sign vinyl. Start cutting pieces and put them on the disc overlapping the edges as much as possible. You don't want dye leaking through onto your disc. You want to completely wrap up around to the bottom side of the disc. Ready to dye. Dyeing: Take a pot big enough to fit your disc into and fill about 1/4 with water and add your dye. I used about 2/3 of one package of red for this. I am still not sure exactly how much to put in. If it isn't dark enough the first time though you can just add more dye to the water and do this part again. Bring the water to a boil and then remove it from heat. Let it sit for about 15 - 20 minutes. I usually feel the side or bottom of the pan to make sure it isn't too hot. You want it to cool to a lukewarm temperature. I imagine that if the water is still too hot it could warp or melt your disc. So again be careful!! If you warp or melt your disc it certainly won't be the same anymore and would definitely not be useable in a PDGA tournament. BE CAREFUL!! Place the disc into pot. I try to make a couple of little handles with the contact paper when I am masking the disc. Note how I have wrapped the contact paper completely around onto the bottom. The disc will just float on top of the dye. Let it sit for 10 - 20 minutes. Take the disc out and rinse it off with water. Remove the contact paper and vinyl. Be careful while doing this as there can be dye water that has splashed into the folds of the contact paper. I keep some paper towels handy when removing to wipe up any excess dye water. Once you are done you will have a nice custom design dyed onto your disc. Good luck!!\nBack to the Main Page.""]"	['<urn:uuid:57b69fe6-b355-464a-ab9d-2d934278e32d>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	9	14	1196
34	why did scientists trap coyote nebraska 1819	In 1819-20, during the Stephen Long Expedition, scientists attempted to trap a coyote (which they called a 'prairie wolf') in Nebraska as part of the first complete biodiversity inventory in US history. The scientists, Thomas Say and Titian Ramsay Peale, tried various methods including baited boxes, wooden cages, steel traps, and log fall traps before finally succeeding in capturing one. They were conducting this scientific work to gather specimens and document the local wildlife, though the expedition was originally funded by the US government for political, military, and economic reasons.	['When science met the coyote\nHow and why did this coyote end up in this cruel trap?\nThe coyote was long known to Nebraska’s Native peoples. They understood its intelligence. It’s no accident that Coyote often appears as a trickster figure in their stories. But the species was barely known to science until an 1819-20 expedition studied it in Nebraska.\nWe’ve been telling you about the Stephen Long Expedition and its re-discovered winter campsite at Engineer Cantonment north of Omaha. The “discovery” of the coyote is part of the larger story of the expedition’s groundbreaking scientific work. Although the expedition didn’t use the modern term “biodiversity inventory,” that’s exactly what they were doing. More about that below.\nHow did the coyote end up in the trap? Two expedition members, Thomas Say and Titian Ramsay Peale (the artist who made the above sketch), went to great lengths to trap what they called a “prairie wolf.” They tried a baited box held up by a stick, but the coyote burrowed underneath to steal the bait. They tried a wooden cage without success. They tried steel traps. They even built a “log fall trap” in which a log was propped up and set to fall if a “trigger stick” was disturbed. After numerous failures they finally got their coyote.\nBut why? Hugh Genoways and Brett Ratcliffe write in Nebraska History:\n“This is the first place in America of which we are aware that a party of scientists attempted to produce a complete inventory of the mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, insects, snails, and plants occurring in a limited geographic area….”\nFor nine months, the team of scientists gathered specimens, made sketches and paintings of animals, and interviewed local Indians about their knowledge. The US government paid for this fact-finding expedition because of political, military, and economic concerns that had little to do with pure science. But once in the field, the scientists were free to pursue their curiosity.\nToday’s scientists would consider the use of this type of trap unethical. But in the 19th century the study of wild animals involved a lot of trapping, shooting, and mounting of specimens with no effort to minimize the suffering involved. This is one way in which their view of the world was different from ours.\nAnother difference is that around the former base camp, habitats are “vastly different from the broad floodplain of almost 200 years ago.” Humans have literally changed the local environment almost beyond recognition—draining the valley’s swamps, building cities and farms and highways, changing the balance of plants and animals, re-engineering the course of the river itself, even changing the climate. The work of Long’s men provides a snapshot in time of the area’s biodiversity before these changes took place. Genoways and Ratcliffe explain why this matters:\n“Biodiversity is important to humankind practically, aesthetically, and ethically, because our very existence depends on our direct use of, and care for, the plants, animals, and ecosystem functions that comprise biodiversity. The presence of many different kinds of species is important because many species provide food, shelter, clothing, medicine, and enhanced spirituality to humans… Current extinction rates are 50 to 500 times background rates and increasing… We are now living in what will eventually be recognized as a mass extinction event.”\nThe Long Expedition not only provides a local baseline for comparison, but also stands out as the first such systematic inventory in US history.\nRead more in “Science and Engineer Cantonment” in the Spring 2018 issue of Nebraska History.\n—David Bristow, Editor\nImage credit: American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia (APSimg2051)']	['<urn:uuid:2a9db7f7-55da-4024-88f2-313234acbcfe>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	7	90	594
35	I'm planning to make a large pot of stew for a community event. What's the safest way to store leftover stew to prevent bacteria from growing?	You should divide large pots of stew into small quantities for refrigeration, as this helps food cool quickly enough to prevent bacteria from growing. Refrigerate at 40°F or colder within 2 hours after cooking, or within 1 hour if the outside temperature is above 90°F. When reheating, make sure to heat leftovers to at least 165°F before serving.	['Prevent Illness From C. perfringens\nClostridium perfringens bacteria are one of the most common causes of foodborne illness (food poisoning). CDC estimates these bacteria cause nearly 1 million illnesses in the United States every year.\nC. perfringens can be found on raw meat and poultry, in the intestines of animals, and in the environment.\nThese bacteria make spores, which act like protective coatings that help the bacteria survive. Under certain conditions, such as when food is kept at an unsafe temperature (between 40°F–140°F), C. perfringens can grow and multiply. After someone swallows the bacteria, it can produce a toxin (poison) that causes diarrhea.\nCommon sources of C. perfringens infection include meat, poultry, gravies, and other foods cooked in large batches and held at an unsafe temperature. Outbreaks tend to happen in places that serve large groups of people, such as hospitals, school cafeterias, prisons, and nursing homes, and at events with catered food. C. perfringens outbreaks occur most often in November and December. Many of these outbreaks have been linked to foods commonly served during the holidays, such as turkey and roast beef.\nAnyone can get food poisoning from C. perfringens. Young children and older adults are at higher risk for severe illness.\nMost people with C. perfringens infection develop diarrhea and stomach cramps within 6 to 24 hours after eating contaminated food. The illness usually begins suddenly and lasts for less than 24 hours. Diarrhea can cause dehydration, so it’s important to drink plenty of fluids. This infection usually does not cause fever or vomiting, and it cannot be passed from one person to another.\nDiagnosis and Treatment\nMost people with C. perfringens infection do not receive a diagnosis.\nInfection is confirmed when a laboratory test detects the bacteria or their toxin in a stool (poop) sample or the bacteria are found in food linked to illness. However, clinical laboratories do not routinely test for C. perfringens infection, and public health laboratories usually test for it only when it is the suspected cause of an outbreak. More information for healthcare professionals\nMost people recover from C. perfringens infection without antibiotic treatment. Patients should drink extra fluids as long as diarrhea lasts.\nReport Food Poisoning\nIf you think you or someone you know got sick from food, even if you don’t know what food it was, please report it to your local health department. Reporting an illness can help public health officials identify a foodborne disease outbreak and keep others from getting sick.\n- Cook food to a safe temperature, especially beef roasts and whole poultry.\n- After food is cooked, keep it at 140°F or warmer or 40°F or colder if it will not be served and eaten soon.\n- Refrigerate leftovers at 40°F or colder within 2 hours after cooking the food or within 2 hours after removing it from an appliance that’s keeping it at a safe temperature. Refrigerate within 1 hour if the outside temperature is above 90°F.\n- It is OK to put hot foods directly into the refrigerator.\n- Divide large pots of food, such as soups and stews, and large cuts of meats, such as roasts, into small quantities for refrigeration. This helps food cool quickly enough to prevent bacteria from growing.\n- Reheat leftovers to at least 165°F before serving.\nLearn more about preventing food poisoning.\nBacteria can multiply rapidly if food is left at room temperature or in the “danger zone” between 40°F and 140°F. Never leave perishable food, such as meat, poultry, eggs, and casseroles, in the danger zone for longer than 2 hours (or 1 hour if it’s hotter than 90°F outside).\nIs turkey on your holiday menu?\nGet food safety tips on preparing turkey.\nLearn how to safely thaw, roast, store, and reheat turkey with USDA’s “Let’s Talk Turkey” consumer guide.\nGet more turkey tips from Foodsafety.gov.\nContact the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline:\n1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) or email@example.com.\nInformation for Healthcare Professionals\nDemonstration of C. perfringens enterotoxin in the stool or a count of ≥106 C. perfringens organisms per gram of stool within 48 hours of onset of typical illness is required to confirm infection.

36	How do Buddhist meditation practices and modern farming technologies both approach the concept of controlled environments for optimal results?	In Buddhist Jhana practice, practitioners create controlled mental environments by eliminating five hindrances (sensual desire, ill will, sloth, restlessness, and doubt) to achieve optimal meditative states. Similarly, vertical farming systems create precisely controlled physical environments, managing factors like light, temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, water, and nutrients to optimize crop growth. Both approaches emphasize the importance of eliminating unwanted elements (hindrances in meditation, pests in farming) and maintaining strict control over conditions to achieve desired outcomes.	"['Jhana, The Rapturous State of Stillness in Buddhist Meditation Practice\nSummary: This is a comprehensive essay on Buddhist Jhanas, the meditative states experienced by the Buddhist monks during their practice of Right Concentration on the Eightfold Path\nBuddhism is a practical religion. Its philosophy and practice are rooted in the mundane lives of common people who are subject to transience and suffering. The Buddha presented his teachings in clear terms, and set achievable and verifiable goals so that there was little scope for ambiguity or speculation. Therefore, Buddhism sets itself apart from the speculative philosophies and complex theologies of other religions.\nFor the same reason, although you may find identical words in Hinduism and Buddhism, they may not carry the same meaning, intent or purpose. Hinduism is primarily focused upon the eternal Self (Atman) and Buddhism upon the objective reality or the not-Self (Anatma). Hence, they fundamentally differ in their interpretation of various spiritual concepts and experiences.\nFor example, liberation in Buddhism does not mean immortality. It only means liberation from the cycle of births and deaths. Buddhism does not believe in the eternality of anything, nor does it view the world as unreal or illusory. The illusion arises in the mind due to unwholesome thoughts, desires and expectations. Buddhism also acknowledges the existence of devas (gods) in heavenly realm, but does not consider them to be immortal or immutable.\nAnother important concept where Buddhism differs from others is Samadhi. Samadhi in Buddhism does not mean absorption in the eternal self, but absorption within the mind or entering the unified states of awareness in which neither any thought nor emotion nor any other modification of the mind remains active.\nTo achieve this state, Buddhism prescribes the attainment of Jhanas through the transformative practices such as right actions, right thinking, right awareness, right concentration, etc., on the Eightfold Path. In the following discussion we focus upon the importance of Jhanas in Buddhist meditative practices and their distinguishing features.\nJhana is the Pali equivalent of the Sanskrit word Dhayna. In Hinduism Dhyana refers to the practice of meditation or contemplation, which can be done with or without concentration. However, in Buddhism Jhana refers to both concentrated meditation and any meditative state which arises from it. In Buddhism, the practice of Jhana forms part of the Right Concentration on the Eightfold Path. By practising it one overcomes the hindrances of unwholesome and evil states of the mind and attains one pointedness, peace and happiness.\nThe practice of Jhana has a great significance in Buddhism. It is central to many Buddhist Practices. The Buddha constantly advised his followers to practice Jhanas to attain Nirvana. Jhana is also frequently mentioned in many Buddhist texts. They attest to its popularity and importance in Buddhist spiritual practices.\nThe Buddha identified four progressive states of Jhanas, which arise from the practice of Right Concentration and which lead to meditative absorption (Samadhi). He also explained their characteristic features and how to identify them and distinguish them. From the Buddhist perspective, Jhana (Concentrated meditation) is neither an abstract concept nor an aesthetic, mental exercise. It is a transformative practice, which is difficult but practicable. Regular practice of jhana leads to verifiable and distinguishable mental states, which can be discerned to know the progress one has made.\nThe Jhanas are attained by a two-pronged approach. One is by eliminating the unwholesome factors, which need to be removed to purify the mind such as negative thoughts and emotions, and the other is by cultivating factors that need to be acquired such as positive thoughts and states of mind. However, as we see later, when a monk advances into the higher Jhanas, he has to abandon even the positive aspects of the mind to end up with just one unified mental state in which one-pointedness, equanimity, discernment, sameness, etc., work in tandem.\nTo enter the first state of Jhana, the initiate has to begin the journey by abandoning the five hindrances (pañcanivarana) so that he can experience five positive states or modifications. These too he has to abandon as he advances into higher states, so that in the end he remains with nothing but sheer discernment (buddhi). The five hindrances are sensual desire (kama), ill will (vyapada), sloth and torpor ((thina and middha), restlessness and worry (uddhaca and kukkucca), and doubt (vicikiccha). Detailed description of the Jhanas is found many Buddhist texts. The Buddha himself described them to the monks for guidance. A brief description of the same is provided in the following section.\nThe first Jhana\nThe Buddha: “There is the case where a monk — quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful qualities — enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.”\nExplanation: The practitioner enters the first jhana when he wholly gives up the aforementioned five hindrances or unwholesome states of mind and cultivates the five “factors of possession” or the mental features that need to be cultivated. They are the directed thought (vitarka), evaluative thought (vichara), one pointedness (ekagrata), rapture (priti) and happiness (sukham). To attain this the practitioner has to follow a strict monastic discipline and live in a suitable dwelling place amidst likeminded people. It may be noted that vitarka and vicara are differently defined by different scholars. As their names suggest vitarka is associated with controlled thought, and vicara with analysis and evaluation. Together, they represent the whole thought process.\nThe second Jhana\nThe Buddha: ""Furthermore, with the stilling of directed thought and evaluation, he enters and remains in the second jhana: rapture and pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation — internal assurance.”\nExplanation: When he is fully stabilized in the first Jhana and perfected the five factors of possession, with mastery in strengthening, attaining and sustaining those factors (which may involve considerable time), the practitioner qualifies to enter the second Jhana. In this stage, he has to abandon both types of thought so as to silence the mind and free it from all thoughts, and remain stabilized in the remaining three factors of possession namely rapture, pleasure and one pointedness. With the mind freed from thoughts, with unified and one-pointed awareness, and with the feelings of assuredness, composure, confidence and tranquility which arises from it, he experiences rapture and pleasure as they permeate and pervade his whole body. Thus, in this Jhana out of the five factors of possession, only three are retained.\nThe third Jhana\nThe Buddha: “And furthermore, with the fading of rapture, he remains in equanimity, mindful and alert, and physically sensitive to pleasure. He enters and remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, \'Equanimous and mindful, he has a pleasurable abiding.\'”\nExplanation: After mastering the second Jhana in different ways and having succeeded in attaining, strengthening, sustaining the three factors of it, the practitioner is now ready to practice and enter the third Jhana. In this state, he comes to realize that rapture is also a form of unwholesome disturbance only and needs to be abandoned or eliminated to advance further into the deeper states of stability and tranquility. Thereby, he cultivates indifference towards it. To achieve mastery in its practice, he resorts to mindfulness (sati), sameness or equanimity (upeksha) and discernment (samprajnata). Thus in this state, out of the five factors of possession, only two are retained and the rest are abandoned as unwholesome.\nThe Fourth Jhana\nThe Buddha: ""And furthermore, with the abandoning of pleasure and stress — as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress — he enters and remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain.”\nExplanation: The Fourth Jhana begins with the realization that one cannot completely abandon rapture without abandoning happiness. Since both are interlinked and have close affinity, the initiate realizes that since it is difficult not to experience rapture when one is happy, he is vulnerable to the risk of falling back to the previous Jhana and remaining stuck there. Further, he also realizes that abiding in prolonged happiness may lead to habitual clinging, which in itself is an unwholesome hindrance. Therefore, contemplating upon the state of equanimity or sameness and abandoning happiness along with its accompanying physical and mental feelings, he enters the four Jhana. With the neutral feeling of sameness firmly established in his mind in the place of happiness, with peace and stability reigning his mind, he abides in unified awareness more than ever. Having abandoned happiness, pleasure and pain, he practices unwavering concentration. Thus, in this Jhana, he retains only one pointedness, with equanimity and pure mindfulness (parisuddha sati), and abandons the remaining factors of possession as gross and unwholesome.\nThe subtle Jhanas\nThe Jhanas are usually four, since it is not practically possible to abandon one pointedness also and practice discernment. Once the four Jhanas are attained, there is nothing else to be abandoned or attained. The practitioner’s unified mental state becomes stabilized, without the risk of reversal or falling back. He cannot easily be disturbed or tempted with unwholesome thoughts and distractions.\nHowever, it is not the end of the road. The Buddha described the fifth state of concentration as the practice of one pointed concentration which is refined, improved and perfected with discernment. It arises from the attainment of the four Jhanas. The Buddha also spoke about the supernatural powers that arise from the perfection one achieves in the fivefold practice of Right Concentration.\nApart from the four Jhanas, the Buddhist texts also refer to four subtle Jhanas or non-material Jhanas, which are named after their respective objects of concentration. They are, mindfulness of space (akasa chetana), mindfulness of consciousness (Vijnana chetana), mindfulness of emptiness (akincana chetana), and mindfulness of neither perception nor non-perception (nevasaññana saññayatana). Some describe them as variations or modes of the fourth Jhana.\nFrom the names ascribed to them, it becomes clear that in these Jhanas the objects of the concentration are fixed, unlike in the previous Jhanas where one may choose different objects to practice concentration. The factor of possession, one-pointedness, also remains constant since it cannot be abandoned. The four objects of concentration are also progressively subtler. For example, consciousness is subtler than space, emptiness subtler than consciousness, and that which is neither perception nor non-perception is even more subtler than emptiness. By practising concentration on the subtle objects, one reaches the end of the objective world, the not-Self and attains the indescribable state of Nirvana.\nSuggestions for Further Reading\n- Right Concentration on The Eightfold Path of Buddhism\n- What is Dhyana?

With a growing population and resource needs, the availability of arable land is shrinking rapidly.\nSince the agricultural revolution, conventional agriculture has focused on practices requiring considerable quantities of space, water, fertilizer, and pesticides. The past 50 years have seen an accelerating rate of increase in these requirements as modern food production aims to increase productivity in the hopes of addressing growing food insecurity.\nLooking into the future, yield production is forecasted to decrease due to widespread environmental and socioeconomic changes that will generate unpredictable consequences on food systems.\nIn response, many strategies have been developed as alternatives to conventional agricultural practices. These strategies have focused on key principles and their combination to be effective: require less space, less water, and increase yield per unit of area. Moreover, due to the negative effects of agrichemicals, modern practices have also aimed to use significantly less to avoid potentially adverse effects for humans and animals.\nOne such alternative is the development of vertical agriculture, also referred to as vertical farming. As the name implies, vertical agriculture relies on expanding production vertically and not horizontally. Vertical agriculture is a multilayer indoor plant production system that allows for precise control of growth factors, such as light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, water, and nutrients.\nThis allows for the growing and production of crops year-round, completely independent of solar light and other external conditions. Indeed, vertical agriculture makes use of key concepts within ecology and physiology to optimize growing and fertilization within controlled conditions. For instance, elements of photobiology, thermomorphogenesis, hydroponics, and genetic breeding, are all used commonly across systems of vertical agriculture.\nBenefits, challenges, and disadvantages moving from horizontal to vertical farming\nAs a result of tight control over crop breeding, growing, and harvesting, vertical farming provides several benefits relative to conventional methods of ‘horizontal’ food production. This was the topic of a literature review by Kalantari et al. published in 2016 in the Journal of Landscape Ecology.\nFrom a systems perspective, the enclosed design prevents pests and diseases from entering by the adoption of a high level of hygiene, continuous monitoring, and non-chemical disinfection, providing security from crops. Moreover, recent technology has also allowed for automated control over environmental conditions by using sensors and imaging techniques in combination with crop simulation models and artificial intelligence, limiting the need for physical labor.\nVertical farming also allows for flexible organization, with designs ranging from large vertical walls covered with crops to large hangars or re-used shipping containers that can be transported. Consequently, vertical agricultural systems, can comprise many varying sizes and be located within many different areas from the middle of highly urbanized cities to more suburban or rural areas.\nMoreover, the verticality element of this system also provides nutrient and water flow, helping to reuse costly resources. The reduction in space also means there is a significant increase in yield per area, holding extensive potential for a future world of urbanization.\nFrom an economic perspective, vertical farming also provides for more jobs in localized areas and is community-focused by addressing the needs of immediate areas, which in turn can provide food at a lower price. Finally, the optionality of location for vertical systems also allows producers to reduce transport costs, as consumers may access them within urban areas, or transport can be minimized to nearby areas.\nHowever, despite the design, environmental, and economic advantages, vertical farming also incorporates several issues that remain a challenge to its broader implementation as a system.\nVertical farming has a high energy requirement and needs extensive investment costs to implement and develop successfully. Moreover, indoor issues relating to excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage may have unpredictable repercussions for plant growth.\nAdditionally, vertical systems are difficult to adapt to a larger scale. They are costly to build and maintain and have yet to demonstrate the ability to provide food for larger areas than community-scale populations. This would make it difficult to implement in areas at higher risk of food insecurity, such as developing agricultural nations.\nThe lack of empirical research on a broader scale has meant that vertical farming has yet to develop past the concept stage on community levels, as persistent issues make it difficult to break through to a larger scale.\nImage Credit: YEINISM/Shutterstock.com\nGrowing skywards - the implications of vertical farming in a rapidly populating and changing world\nAmong the development of alternative agricultural practices, vertical agriculture provides a promising solution for many of the challenges facing current agricultural policies. However, for vertical systems to be integrated on a larger scale requires further technological progress and economic investment.\nNevertheless, gradually implementing more verticality, or combining it with other practices aiming for more sustainable practices may be promising. For instance, the combination of verticality with other practices such as intercropping may be particularly beneficial for developing more sustainable food systems.\nIncorporating technological progress into vertical systems also holds promise, with automated sensors and machinery able to operate near-independently. Progress in gene editing and plant genome modifications will also allow for faster, bigger, and healthier crops, allowing vertical agriculture to produce more over time.\nThroughout agricultural history, farming systems have typically spread over large spans of land, yet the reduction in arable land, as well as the increase in demand to house growing populations, means that such strategies need to be reconsidered, and vertical agriculture may play a role looking into the future.\nContinue Reading: Benefits of Vertical Agriculture and Hydroponics\n- Beacham, A.

37	radionuclide treatment expert compare disposal options water treatment plant landfill efficiency safety	For liquid residuals (like brine and backwash water), discharge to sewer or wastewater treatment plants is most common, while solid residuals containing radionuclides require careful disposal consideration. Local landfills and wastewater treatment plants have widely varying requirements for accepting radionuclide-containing residuals. The concentration of radionuclides must be determined to assess disposal options. For NORM-contaminated materials, best international practice involves reducing waste volume, concentrating radioactivity to minimum practical volume, storing concentrated activity safely, and maximizing equipment recycling/reuse.	"['Radionuclides in Drinking Water\nRadionuclides in Drinking Water\nDecision Narrative 3: Selecting Treatment Options\nFor Water Systems with Radionuclides above the MCL\nCommunity water systems (CWSs) that use source water containing radium-226 (Ra-226), radium-228 (Ra-228), gross alpha particle activity, beta particle and photon radioactivity, or uranium must comply with the Radionuclides Rule (see www.epa.gov/safewater/radionuc.html). This document provides general information to CWSs on: the available treatment technologies for the removal of radium, uranium, and gross alpha particle activity; the residuals produced by each technology; disposal options; and, the regulations governing these options. The applicable regulatory requirements are described here in summary form only and there may be additional federal or State laws or regulations that apply to you beyond those described in this document. You need to consult the statutory and regulatory provisions that apply to the waste you generate or manage in order to determine the requirements with which you must comply. This document also provides additional recommendations and information on possible options; these are not regulatory requirements and are provided for your information only. This document does not cover residuals from treatment of beta particle or photon radioactivity. Information on those radionuclides can be obtained from your primacy agency. EPA will continue to review and update this guidance as necessary and appropriate.\nIn the Radionuclides Rule, EPA has listed Best Available Technologies (BATs) and Small System Compliance Technologies (SSCTs) for radionuclide treatment based on their efficiency at removing radionuclides from drinking water, taking cost into consideration. You are not required to use a listed BAT or a SSCT. Any technology that is accepted by your primacy agency and achieves compliance with the maximum contaminant level (MCL) is allowed.\nThe EPA Radionuclides Rule lists Best Available Technology (BAT) for radium as reverse osmosis (RO), ion exchange, and lime softening. For uranium removal, BATs consist of RO, ion exchange, coagulation/filtration, and lime softening. Other non-BAT technologies, such as iron/manganese removal, preformed hydrous manganese oxide (HMO) addition with filtration, adsorptive media (such as activated alumina) and electrodialysis/electrodialysis reversal (ED/EDR) are also capable of removing either radium or uranium. The removal efficiency of all of the processes will vary with the source water quality and the technology.\nAll technologies, whether they are BAT or non-BAT, produce a residual (waste) containing radium or uranium or both that requires appropriate disposal. The residual(s) can be a liquid, a solid, or both. Liquid residuals include brine, backwash water, reject water, acid neutralization water, caustic regenerant, and rinse water. The most common methods for liquid residual disposal is discharge to a sewer. Some water systems may also be able to dispose of liquid residuals (after receiving appropriate regulatory approvals) by direct discharge to a water body, in underground injection wells, in on-site wastewater treatment systems, or hauling the liquid residuals to a wastewater treatment plant. If liquid residual disposal options are limited or unavailable, consider switching to treatment units that do not generate significant quantities of liquid residuals. Solid residuals may include aged/ineffective media which typically refers to media that has been used and/or regenerated so many times that it is no longer effective at removing the contaminant(s) of concern; exhausted media which refers to the one-use throw-away media or media that has adsorbed all the contaminant(s) that it can handle and therefore contains a high concentration of the contaminant(s); and spent/used membranes that no longer effectively remove the contaminant(s) of concern. Because these solid residuals contain radionuclides, disposal can be a major consideration. Consequently, the very first step in the technology evaluation and selection process should be the identification of the disposal options available to the utility for these radionuclide wastes. Local landfills and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have requirements that vary widely for accepting liquid and solid residuals containing radionuclides. You should consult with local landfill and WWTP professionals as well as your state drinking water primacy agency to determine if residuals containing radionuclides can be accepted, and at what concentrations.\nKnowing the concentration of radionuclides in the residuals will likely be needed when determining the disposal options available. You may need to consult with the treatment process manufacturer and perhaps run pilot tests to determine concentrations. Residuals disposal.\nCan you dispose of wastes containing radionuclides locally?', 'Presentation on theme: ""RWE NUKEM The Design, Construction and Operation of NORM Descaling Plants E Taylor and L Fellingham.""— Presentation transcript:\nRWE NUKEM The Design, Construction and Operation of NORM Descaling Plants E Taylor and L Fellingham\nRWE NUKEM 2 Structure of the Presentation Background to the Problem of NORM Contamination Potential Solutions De-scaling Techniques Design of Plants Examples of Operational Plant Safety Assessment Waste Management Concepts for Next Generation Plant Conclusions\nRWE NUKEM 3 Nature of the Problem Around the world there are significant arisings of NORM- contaminated plant being generated by the oil & gas industry Much of this is stored in open yards There is a potential contamination threat to workers and a long-term environmental liability\nRWE NUKEM 4 NORM-contaminated Equipment\nRWE NUKEM 5 Required Solution Manage NORM wastes in accordance with best international practice Reduce the volume of NORM-contaminated waste arisings Concentrate the radioactivity into the minimum practical volume Store the concentrated activity safely Reuse or recycle as much of the contaminated equipment, etc, as possible.\nRWE NUKEM 6 RWE NUKEM’s Experience of providing Solutions Design, construction and initial operation of the Al-Furat Petroleum Company (AFPC) facility in Syria Design, construction and operation of the NORM facility at the Dounreay site serving the North Sea oilfields (now closed) Design, construction and operation of a modular facility at the Winfrith site to meet the requirements of the Wytch Farm oilfield operated by BP\nRWE NUKEM 7 The Facilities\nRWE NUKEM 8 Techniques evaluated for removing Scale and Sludge from contaminated Equipment Proprietary and developmental stage, chemical descaling methods Various forms of particle blasting using sand, ballotini, metal shot, solid CO 2, etc; Abrasion techniques using wire and other forms of brushes; and High pressure jetting techniques, using water and other process fluids.\nRWE NUKEM 9 High Pressure Water Jetting – The Optimum Choice for Descaling It is very efficient at scale removal, irrespective of the chemical and mineral form of the scale; The water is capable of penetrating into narrow crevices, cracks, corrosion pits, etc, and removing scale and other adhering deposits. Hence residual contamination levels are very low and high decontamination factors are achieved; The speed of processing is higher than with any alternatives, so reducing the necessary size of any plant; It does minimal damage to the metal surface of the components, etc, being descaled; The process makes use of the very low solubility of the scale and particularly the radium salts. The scale and radioactive contaminants are not solubilised. Hence the process water treatment is very simple involving only filtration and no chemical treatment;\nRWE NUKEM 10 High Pressure Water Jetting – The Optimum Choice for Descaling (2) The process water is recycled after filtration, so enabling the minimum volume of water to be used and generating no or a minimal volume of liquid effluent; The scale can be encapsulated or re-injected with the minimum of treatment. It is compatible with hydraulic cements, making it ideal for encapsulation directly or after maceration. It can be disposed of after maceration and slurrying by reinjection into appropriate geological formations, including those exhausted of oil and gas.

The other equipment comes in a very diverse range of shapes and sizes, making process automation much more difficult without complex equipment. Treat these as two distinct streams.

In contrast, the Microsoft Kinect technology used in the Worldwide Telescope project primarily focuses on basic movement control for navigating 3D space through body movements.	['Harvard scientists are creating a group of interstellar “ambassadors” who are helping to explain the universe in school classrooms through a web-based program that lets students soar through space to view planets, stars, and the gassy clouds where the latter are born.\nThe Worldwide Telescope Ambassadors Program is the brainchild of astronomy Professor Alyssa Goodman, who has been working with Microsoft programmers for several years on their Internet-based Worldwide Telescope, a free program. Goodman has worked with its creator, Curtis Wong, at Microsoft Research, suggesting updates and changes that have added functionality useful to researchers.\nThrough the main interface, users can zoom “through” the universe to explore. A click of the mouse will call up links to research databases, putting the current knowledge about a particular stellar body or region at the user’s fingertips. For more-basic users, there are also a series of “tours” — guided introductions to specific astronomy topics — to get them started.\nThe ambassadors program, cosponsored by Microsoft Research and WGBH, is run by Patricia Udomprasert out of Goodman’s Viz-e-Lab. The lab was founded earlier this year to develop ways that researchers can visualize and manipulate large data sets. The lab emphasizes low-cost, affordable technology and has developed a 3-D interface with the Worldwide Telescope, using a standard high-definition, flat-screen television and Microsoft Kinect, an add-on to the software giant’s Xbox 360 system that lets users control games with their bodies. The result is that users can navigate the 3-D universe not only with a mouse and keyboard but, at least in the Viz-e-Lab, by standing in front of the screen and moving their arms to swim closer to or further from an object.\nGoodman says that the technology, though still experimental, is just one example of new ways to interact with the large sets of data accumulated by projects affiliated with the lab, such as the Dataverse, Seamless Astronomy, and High Dimensional Data Visualization and Interaction. While data in the past has typically been displayed in charts and graphs, technology in recent years has enabled the collection of such large volumes of data that traditional display methods are inadequate. By displaying the data in three dimensions or by interacting with it graphically, researchers may be able to not only better explain what they’ve found but also understand it better themselves, Goodman said.\nThe ambassadors program takes that same approach to teaching astronomy. The ambassadors themselves are astronomy-savvy individuals, such as retired astronomers, astronomy hobbyists, researchers seeking to add an educational component to their work, and even Harvard undergraduates interested in the subject.\nIn one year, the ambassadors program has grown from several ambassadors working with 80 students in one school to a dozen ambassadors and 400 students at two schools, Lexington’s Clarke Middle School and Prospect Hill Academy in Somerville, Udomprasert said. Goodman and Udomprasert said they hope the program will continue to expand as funding becomes available.\n“People learn with this in a different way than they do with books,” Goodman said.\nMichelle Bartley, a sixth-grade science teacher at Clarke Middle School, where the program kicked off last year, said the traditional curriculum required students to do projects on subjects covered in class, like constellations and the life and death of a star. The Worldwide Telescope not only engages this generation of video-savvy kids better, it allows them much greater freedom to explore the universe on their own and to pick astronomy projects that follow their interest.\nAs Bartley taught the year’s astronomy lessons, ambassadors were there to help, working one-on-one with students, helping them if they got stuck with the software, and allowing them to move ahead with their projects.\n“They’re phenomenal,” Bartley said of the ambassadors. “They’re there from day one, walking around the class and talking with the kids. The program really gets kids excited about astronomy.”\nDick Post, a retired businessman and member of the Amateur Telescope Makers of Boston, worked with Bartley and other Clarke teachers two days a week this spring. He said that with 20 kids in a class working on the software, it’s critical that someone other than the instructor be there to help.\n“Even if you know the program, the kids will do something you’ve never thought about,” Post said. “This age group is amazing. You can’t believe how fast these kids learn.”', 'Google is working with tech nonprofit CyArk in preserving the world’s wonders in virtual reality.\nIn a joint effort called Open Heritage, Google teams up with tech nonprofit CyArk to provide the public with virtual reality (VR) access to the world’s endangered historical sites. CyArk, a 3D laser scanning nonprofit is responsible for scanning the historical monuments, preserving them as 3D models, while Google hosts the public’s access to CyArk’s digital library.\nStarting April 16, 2017, the public can now virtually tour the world’s endangered wonders in Google’s Open Heritage site with the use of computers, mobile devices or VR headsets.\nSites Available for Touring\nOpen Heritage has numerous 3D models and expedition overviews available for viewing. To date, visitors can explore stories from more than 25 iconic sites, across 18 countries.\nJust some of the sites viewers can virtually explore are Eim Ya Kyaung, a Buddhist monument in Bagan, Myanmar now closed to the public because of a 2016 earthquake and the Chichen Itza, the ancient Mayan metropolis in Mexico.\nNumerous historical sites in Open Heritage have 3D models that allow virtual visitors to inspect the monuments from every angle using Google’s Poly 3D viewer. With the help of Google’s Cloud Platform, everyone can apply to download the data. They can also download Open Heritage’s free app for iOS or Android.\nHeritage Preservation through Digital Recreation\nThe story of Open Heritage began way before Google conceptualized it. It started with CyArk’s founder Ben Kacyra.\nBen Kacyra founded CyArk after watching footage of Talibans destroying 1,500-year-old Buddhist statues in Afghanistan. As one of the creators of the world’s first 3D scanner, Kacyra realized that he can use his technology to digitally preserve monuments under threat from natural disasters, human conflict and other factors.\nUnder CyArk, he then started creating the world’s largest and most detailed 3D archive of the world’s endangered wonders.\nWith the improvement of the 3D scanning technologies, CyArk captures monuments in fuller detail, including color and texture of surfaces. The organization’s laser scanners have millimeter precision, allowing the detailed scans to be used for identifying damaged areas and restoration efforts.\nTech Used in Digital Preservation\nThere are numerous tools used in digital preservation. Just some of the tools CyArk uses are\n3D laser scanning, photogrammetry, and stereoscopic 360 imagery.\nThree-dimensional laser scans digitally capture the surface and dimensions of objects in a non-destructive way. CyArk utilizes scanners for creating “point clouds” to document the exact shape and size of a monument. Scans are registered to one another to create a complete 3D point cloud.\nPhotogrammetry uses images to survey, map and measure the size and distance of objects. CyArk takes overlapping images which are then brought together to create a 3D photo-textured model.\nStereoscopic 360 imagery uses panoramic photography to allow for immersive 360-degree views of a monument. Multiple images are taken from a single site coming from different angles and are then stitched together to create a single 360 image.\nThere are more technologies used in the digital preservation of the world’s heritage sites. With CyArk’s mission to make historical sites available to future generations and Google Arts and Culture’s aim to make art more accessible, the outlook for these technologies and the digital preservation of sites looks bright.\nFascinated with the women of ENIAC, Apriya started taking an interest in technology at 11 years old. Today, she keeps herself busy by following trends and innovation in the world of tech.']	['<urn:uuid:df638268-e684-44ad-bdeb-c24882d14520>', '<urn:uuid:6a15b6d5-9427-43ee-bf5b-0ce5a95aa047>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	11	43	1293
39	What are the maximum fines for violating PCI versus GDPR standards?	For PCI non-compliance, fines can reach up to $10,000 monthly plus up to $90 per compromised card, while GDPR violations can result in fines up to €20M ($28M) or 4% of global revenue.	"['When it comes to your customers’ information, sophisticated data protection is a must. Yet so many businesses continue to store sensitive customer data haphazardly. Keeping this raw information in filing cabinets or on your computer makes both you and your customers vulnerable to a number of risks.\nWhen it comes to moving away from these old-school tactics, a common misconception we come across is that it’s riskier to use a third-party provider to store the data for you. As a PCI level 1 Merchant Service Provider, we can confidently say this claim is false.\nIn this post, we dive into the importance of securely maintaining cardholder data and the costs around failing to do so. First, we review what puts your business squarely within PCI scope.\nWhat Falls Into PCI Scope\nAnything that stores, processes or transmits cardholder data is within PCI scope. So, if you’re internally storing customer card data, you’re within scope — and likely not doing it in a way that adheres to PCI standards. Here are three major components of your business’s technological infrastructure that impact PCI compliance:\nNetworks: These are physical, wireless and virtual connections. Pretty much every modern-day business uses some combination of these connections, so network segmentation serves to separate out-of-scope systems to avoid impacting security. An example of this is isolating where your cardholder data is stored.\nApplications: These are the points of data entry, and are therefore always within scope. Think of card readers, point-of-sale software, Virtual Terminals and patient management systems. Without a security standard in place to secure cardholder data, these applications are vulnerable to exposing raw data. Commonly used standards are point-to-point encryption and tokenization.\nSoftware: Whether the payment processing software is native or cloud-based dictates whether your computer servers are within scope. Cloud-based is more favorable, as it removes your servers from scope but still allows you to remotely access the encrypted card data on file.\nYou can descope your business technology and cut down on the amount of networks, applications and softwares used to store, transmit and process your customers card data. If you fail to recognize and address what in your business’s technological infrastructure is within PCI scope you’re a sitting target for hackers and fraudsters. This can lead to hefty costs for your business.\nThe Costs of Non-Compliance\nBefore you shy away from the costs associated with upgrading your business’s technology, consider the hefty fees you may face if you’re found to be operating outside of PCI compliance. Failure to maintain the highest standard of customer card data protection can result in the following repercussions:\n- Monthly fines ranging from $5,000 to $10,000\n- Fines per compromised card, which can reach up to $90 per card\n- Lawsuits by cardholders whose information was compromised\n- Compensation for cardholders, such as credit monitoring\n- Revenue loss due to reputation damage\n- Costly audits by the FTC or PCI\n- Merchant account loss\nWhy PCI Compliance Is Important\nIf it isn’t obvious by now, PCI compliance poses a number of benefits to your business. While avoiding reputation damage and heavy costs, you also reduce the risk of a data breach, protect your business’s longevity, secure your cardholders’ data and increase customer retention. Don’t be apprehensive when it comes to new technologies and change at your business. Implementing these solutions today may just save your business from a major breach in the near future.\nAre you unsure whether the way you store customer card data is secure? Give us more details below and we’d be happy to assist you!', ""What is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?\nThe General Data Protection regulation or the GDPR is a European Union (EU) regulation designed to protect the privacy rights of Individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the European Union, Iceland, Norway, and Lichtenstein. It is intended to be an overarching privacy regulation for all EU Member States and replaces prior EU privacy regulations and goes even further than benchmark United States privacy laws governing health care and educational records, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).\nWhat does GDPR do?\nGDPR expands privacy rights for individuals located in the EEA regardless of citizenship. Specifically, it guarantees certain rights, depending on how the data is used:\nThe right to be informed regarding the collection and intended use of a subject’s personal data,\nThe ability to make informed decisions regarding the use and disclosure of the data,\nThe right to access the data upon request or have the data transferred to a third party, and\n- The right to have the data returned or deleted.\nIt also impacts data pertaining to these individuals even when the data is located in other countries, regardless of the citizenship of the individuals. Specifically, the GDPR establishes a framework for safeguarding how personal data is used, such as:\nEnsuring that the data is transferred, processed, stored and eventually disposed of using appropriate technical safeguards,\nLimiting the use/processing of the data to purposes that comply with GDPR requirements (e.g., managing the academic records of UC students studying in the EEA as part of Education Abroad),\nRequiring third parties who receive the data to adopt UC’s GDPR protections and safeguards through changes to contract terms.\nWho does GDPR apply to?\nGDPR applies to all organizations that are established in the EEA, including higher education institutions (e.g., a study center in Europe). It also applies to organizations not physically in the EEA when goods or services are offered to individuals in the EEA (e.g., applications for admissions), or when the behavior of individuals in the EEA are monitored by individuals either inside or outside of the EEA (e.g., research that includes EU citizens).\nAre there penalties for GDPR non-compliance?\nYes, GDPR imposes significant monetary penalties for organizations that do not comply with the regulation. The fines are up to €20M ($28M) or 4% of global revenue.\nWhat is the UCB Privacy Office doing to comply with GDPR?\nThe Privacy Office established a Working Group to address issues that are specific to the impact of GDPR at our campus.\nThe Working Group is comprised of representatives from key sectors likely to be impacted by the regulation and who will drive implementation efforts here at Berkeley, including Privacy, Compliance, Legal Affairs, Information Technology, Security, Risk Management, Insurance Services, and others. The primary goal of the Working Group will be to develop guidelines, processes, and policy changes to be implemented at Berkeley to promote compliance with GDPR.\nThe Privacy Office is also working closely with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) in accordance with their system-wide GDPR efforts as listed below.\nUC Berkeley's Statement of Privacy Practices - GDPR\nUC Berkeley's Statement of Privacy Practices for Persons in the European Economic Area Subject to GDPR explains how we comply with GDPR and indicates your rights regarding your Personal Data\nWhat is the University of California (UC) doing to comply with GDPR?\nUC’s compliance, privacy and informational technology programs are working together to develop an effective GDPR compliance program. This program is specifically designed to enhance the existing robust privacy infrastructure at UC to ensure compliance with this new regulation.\nProgram activities include:\n- Assessing how GDPR will affect UC programs\n- Developing tools and templates to assist UC programs with GDPR compliance\n- Developing communication tools to provide greater transparency to UC students, employees, and other UC program participants regarding the collection and use of personal data\n- Ensuring that appropriate physical and technical safeguards are in place to protect the personal data of individuals\n- Working with our partners and vendors to ensure that data protections are maintained when personal data is transferred outside UC\nWhat can I do to prepare my office for GDPR?\n- Understand GDPR:\n- Determine if GDPR applies:\n- Develop a plan:\n- Review Tools & Resources created by UCB, and UCOP, and start working on a plan for your Department\n- Stay informed:\n- Review FAQs from UCB, UCOP, and selected external partners\n- Visit GDPR.berkeley.edu regularly for updates\nFor questions relating to GDPR and its impact at UCB, please contact the Privacy Office""]"	['<urn:uuid:1826ccbb-1749-49d6-b078-af3713168f72>', '<urn:uuid:f9242506-b63b-4295-b069-8fa423e70d6d>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	11	33	1374
40	As a lawyer, I wonder - how long does trademark protection last in India?	Trademark can be registered for a duration of 10 years. It can be renewed for a further period of 10 years on payment of the renewal fees.	['Trademark | Copyright | Patent | Design\nAs a business owner, if you have a unique idea i.e. likely going to be translated into a product or service or an algorithm, it is very important to think about the intellectual property right for this particular thing right from the beginning. Because intellectual property right (IPR) is something that gets less attention and is neglected which leads to big problems in the business in the future so it is going to be very important for us to understand the critical aspects of the intellectual property rights from some of our subject matter experts.\nIn the process of starting your business, if you’re going to be creating anything, whether it’s creating anything which is in literary or something in writing or it’s an artistic work or it’s music or even your brand or even designs, all of these things are intellectual property and capable of protection and more importantly monetization for you going forward.\nThere are a few aspects of IPRs which you must look at for registering your creation:\nThis is something you can do for protecting your brand/logo. This helps you in differentiating your products/services from other players in the market.\nREGISTRATION PROCESS of Trademark:\nRegistration of a trademark can be done by two ways offline or online. Offline registration of the trademark can be done at one of the offices of the trademark register based on the jurisdiction. While online registration is called E-filing of a trademark.\nE-filing of a trademark application is a new service provided by the trademark office. E-filing is beneficial and more useful than offline registration as it provides trademark application number immediately. It also provides online verification to assure error-free filing and obtain your filing date. It also speeds up the process. All the details can be saved in your PC and can see online history or track status of the applications filed by clicking “Status of filed application”.\nThe trademark registration application will be allotted to a Trademark Officer in the Trademark Registrar Office. The Trademark Officer would then review the trademark application for correctness and issue a trademark examination report. The Trademark Officer has the ability to accept the trademark registration application and allow for trademark journal publication or object the trademark registration application.\nDuration of Trademark:\nTrademark can be registered for a duration of 10 years. It can be renewed for a further period of 10 years on payment of the renewal fees. The trademark can be renewed by filling the form TM-R with transaction costs.\nDocuments required and Fee for Trademark:\nA soft copy of the logo in JPEG format is required for the registration.\n• Name and address of the proprietor of the mark or Name of all the partners if its a partnership firm. or also attached partnership firm deed.\n- For Private Limited Company – COI and Name and address of Authorized signatures\n• In case company if you submit MSME certificate the fees will be reduced. You have to pay only Rs.4500/ instead of Rs.9,000/-\n• In case of sole-proprietary firm fees will be Rs.4500/- or in case of Company Rs.9,000/-\nTypes Of Trademark available:\n- Names According to Section 9 or 11 of Trade Marks Act it should not be similar to with an earlier trademark.\n- The Combination of Colours or even a single color in combination with a word or device according to Section 10.\n- Letters, numerals or combination of both.\n- Sounds Mark\nIt is a legal right which is given to the creator of the product for a fixed time period.\nThrough this the author enjoys the exclusive privilege to publish, broadcast, adapt, make derivative works, showcase and monetize the same. It could either be a literary work, a dramatic work, music or artistic work.\nHow to get Copyright for a website?\nA website may contain a number of elements that are literary or artistic in nature. For example, words, graphics, videos, software and photos etc. As per the Copyright Office, you will have to file copyright registration request for each of these elements separately.\nDuration/Term of Copyright\nIn the case of original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, the duration of copyright is the lifetime of the author or artist, and 60 years counted from the year following the death of the author.\nIn the case of cinematograph films, sound recordings, photographs, posthumous publications, anonymous and pseudonymous publications, works of government and works of international organizations are protected for a period of 60 years which is counted from the year following the date of publication.\nApplication Procedure of Copyright\nAny individual who is an author or rights owner or assignee or legal heir can file an application for copyright of a work either by the e-filing facility or by speed post. However, with effect from August 01, 2014, the Copyright Counter for filing copyright applications has been closed in order to popularise the electronic filing. Online Filing Process:\nStep 1- Applicant need to create a User ID at http://copyright.gov.in/UserRegistration/frmNewUser.aspx by filling basic details.\nStep 2- After successful registration, browse http://copyright.gov.in/UserRegistration/frmLoginPage.aspx and Log In with credentials.\nStep 3- Once you are Logged In, click on “e-Filing of Application” in the left menu.\nStep 4- Click on the link “Click here for online Copyright Registration”\nStage 5- The online “Copyright Registration Form” is to be filled-up in four\nOffline Filing Process:\na) Application for registration is to be made on Form XIV. Form can be downloaded from here-http://copyright.gov.in/frmformsDownload.aspx\nb) Separate applications should be made for registration of each work.\nc) Each application should be accompanied by the requisite fee.\nd) The applications should be signed by the applicant or the advocate in whose favour a Power of Attorney has been executed. The Power of Attorney should also be enclosed.\ne) Answer each and every column of the Statement of Particulars and Statement of Further Particulars specifically.\nSend the documents by post to Copyright Division, Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development, 4th Floor, Jeevan Deep Building, Parliament Street, New Delhi : 110001 Email\nTelephone No, – 011-23362436\nA mandatory period of 30 days should be passed post obtaining the diary number so that no objection is filed in the Copyright office against your claim that particular work is created by you. If such objection is filed it may take another one month time to decide as to whether the work could be registered by the Registrar of Copyrights after giving an opportunity of hearing to both the parties.\nIf no objection is filed the application goes for scrutiny from the examiners. If any discrepancy is found the applicant is given 30 days time to remove the same. Therefore, it may take 2 to 3 month’s time for registration of any work in the ordinary course. The applicant himself or his/her leader may appear in the hearing according to S. 27 of the Act. As per section 72 of the Copyright Act, 1957 any person aggrieved by the final decision or order of the Registrar of Copyrights may, within three months from the date of the order or decision, appeal to the Copyright Board. The registration of a copyright thus, may take a period of 1 to 1.5 years.\nList of Documents required to be submitted by Post along with application form.

Click here for list- Documents Required for Copyright Registration in India.\nFee for copyright:\nThe Fee can by paid either through Online mode or Postal Order or Demand Draft. List of Documents required to be submitted by Hand/ By Post along with application form.\n3. Patent – The focus here is on proving the novelty of your creation. It needs to be a new invention for you to get a patent. Availing patent protection is a bit more complex than getting a trademark or a copyright. Generally, these are given for machines and pharmaceutical products.\n4. Design – Registered designs are used to protect the external appearance of any object. These are primarily meant for protecting designs meant for commercial/industrial use. For instance, a Coca-Cola bottle.\nIP – Investor’s Perspective\nWhenever the company seeks funding from the investor community, IP – how it is managed and protected\n– becomes an important criteria for them to decide. It helps investors figure out the long-term growth of the company. They check on a few key aspects like:\n- IP ownership rests with the company and not with the founder\n- Ensure that there are no arrangements of IP sharing.\n- How frequently are the IP rights being reviewed?\n- What are the legal implications for changes made to the brand or logo?\nIP Registration Process\nWhen it comes to registering your IP, say, for instance, trademark, the first thing which you need to figure out is to decide on its geographic spread – national registration or international registration. Under the Indian national regime of registration of a trademark, you can apply to any of the five registrars located at Mumbai, New Delhi, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, or Chennai for complete protection across India. The Registrar shall examine the application, post which it shall be published in the Indian Trademarks Journal. If no opposition is raised by any third party within 90 days, the Registrar accepts the trademark application.\nUnder the international regime, India is a signatory to various treaties, which allow for registration of a trademark in multiple countries with a single application process. Depending on the targeted countries you wish to register your trademark in, you can select any of the various international treaties such as the Madrid Protocol, European Community Trademark, etc.\nConclusion: When you think of any startup business you must have to Understand your intellectual property obligations. these intellectual property obligations build your band and secure your content & design.\nTHE FOURTH SCHEDULE TO TRADEMARKS RULES, 2002\nClassification of goods and services – Name of the classes\nClass 1.

41	difference between european red oak american white oak barrels whisky making	European red oak has a darker color due to higher lignin and tannin content, has a looser structure, and requires thicker staves that are usually split rather than sawed. American white oak is lighter in color, has a denser structure, and can be sawn into thinner staves, making the casks easier and cheaper to produce.	['By Paul Dejong, Belgium\nThe boring part: Chemistry.\nSome experts say the influence of wood on, and the interaction of wood with whisky makes up for more than 70% of the aroma’s in the final product! So, if wood is so important, the question arises: What is wood made of?\nThe building stones of wood are the following:\n* The main ingredient and building stome of wood is: CELLULOSE (C6H10O5). (compare this to the most important supplier of bio-energy: glucose C5H10O5) Cellulose is good for about 40 to 50% of the total mass of the wood. (incidentally, cellulose is the main part of the total bio-mass on this planet!) Unfortunately, under normal circumstances most multicellular living organisms cannot digest Cellulose. Only some bacteria can break down Cellulose!\n* A second, important constituent of wood is HEMI-CELLULOSE: Hemicellulose is a “conglomerate” of eight sugars (all with a similar chemical formula, C5H10O5 – C6H12O6) which are essential for human nutrition, being Xylose, galactose, glucose, mannose, N -acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, fucose, and sialic acid. While cellulose is crystalline, strong, and resistant to hydrolysis, hemicellulose has a random, amorphous structure with little strength. It is easily hydrolyzed by dilute acid or base as well as myriad hemicellulase enzymes.\n* The third ingridient of wood is LIGNIN. Lignin is a very complicated molecule (polymer) and is -together with pectin- the fysical bond between Cellulose and Hemi-cellulose. It is the substance that makes wood strong and hard. When burned it forms what is chemically known as Methoxyphenols. The main methoxyphenols are guaiacol and syringol…and they are very wel known to the average whisky-affectionado as: phenols!\nHow does wood get its colour?\nWhy ask this?\nSimply because the main ingredients of wood are clear or colourless (cellulose and hemicellulose)… and whisky is said to inherit it’s colour from the wood. Several molecules and substances give colour to the wood;\n* the first is LIGNIN: Lignin becomes so strong and hard because of a chemical concept called Resonance. Resonance is also what makes lignin look brownish…\n* the second group of molecules are the TANNINS or POLYPHENOLES: different acids that bond with sugars such as glucose to become tannins. The best known are Gallic Acid + glucose = Gallotannin and Ellagic Acid + Glucose = Ellagotannin. These tannins have a dark reddish-brown colour\n* also a part of the colour of wood are some acids (most noticably acetic acid and Formic acid) and Whisky-lactones (wonder how they got their name?)\nAs we all know, most Single Malt whisky is maturing in “second hand” casks that previously held Sherry (or other wines) or Bourbon. As we all know, bourbon, like Scotch is a cristal clear liquid, and imparts no colour into the wood. Sherry or Wine however, usually have a colour of their own (from the start, or thru oxidation) and could impart colour into the wood, or leave chemical residu behind that has an influence on colour. An important chemical substance in wine is Tartaric Acid (E334), which, when bonded with Potassium, forms Potassium Bitartrate or wine -diamonds… these cristals, once formed , are UNDISSOLVABLE , and form a layer on the inside of a winecask (winecasks used to be the most important industrial source of these cristals) , thus possibly forming a barrier between wood and wine (or whisky)\nOther well known, and almost equally boring trivia….\nCasks used for the maturation of Scotch Whisky are usually made out of European red oak (Quercus robur and quercus sessilis) or out of American white oak (usually Quercus Alba). Could it be that these names were chosen for a reason? Could it be that European oak is actually red, and American oak is actually White? Bingo! Yes it could! European oak is actually darker in colour than it’s American counterpart, because it contains a lot more lignin, and a lot more tannins! Hence “red” Oak. European Red Oak has a “looser” structure than American oak. European oak staves are usually split instead of sawed, making them a lot thikker and more difficult to work with. American oak has a denser structur, that allows it to be sawn in thinner, easier to modulate staves. Hence, an American casks holds less wood, and is easier and cheaper to make.\nWe also know that Scotch whisky matures either on Bourbon-casks out of American White Oak, or on ex-wine-casks, usually out of European Red Oak. Extraction of Tannins, Lignin, Vannillin, Sugars happens better with a higher alcohollevel (up to appr. 66% this is true,above that level the extraction becomes less effective).\n– New Make has an average ABV of 63,5%\n– Wine (Sherry) has an average ABV of 15%\nWhat does the Cooper do?\nOak is used to make casks, because it has a unique trait: It bends well when heated (an oak stave can be bend almost 90°). The wooden staves are bend using steam, and once the cask is put together, it is toasted or charred. For this, the cask is put over a heatsource with the ‘lid’ on. It heats up inside but the heat consumes the oxigen… then, when the lid is taken of, and the oxigen comes in, the wood ignites… when left to burn for appr. 5 to 15 seconds it is called toasted, when it is longer (appr. 20 tot 40 seconds) it is called charred. This toasting or charring has two purposes, it effectively sterilises the cask, and -more importantly- the heat pyrolises the lignin (giving phenols) and caramellises the hemicellulose-sugars (forming vanillin, amongst others)\n– Most American Oak is Charred,\n– Most European Oak is Toasted\nSo, how to distill this into a tasty, nicely coloured whisky?\nAfter visiting some bodegas in Xerez, and after noticing that almost all the samples of Oloroso cherry we saw were, at best, as dark as an average whisky blend of today, we started wondering where the colour of a so-called dark oloroso matured whisky came from! None of the oloroso’s we saw were even half as dark as that. Only pedro-Ximinez came close. But Bodega’s rarely sell Ximinez casks, so dark oloroso actually being Ximinez was not really an option. So, How do these extra dark (black Bowmore, aso) whisky’s erupt out of a relatively lighter (in colour) oloroso cask? Surely the whisky is further diluting the colour of the Sherry…\nA couple of assumptions and conclusions:\n– Wood colour is determined by the amount of lignin, Tannins, acids and lactones in the wood.\nEuropean red oak contains more of these colouring agents than American white oak\n– Wine casks have matured a low alcohol drink, the wine extracts only very little colour from the wood.\nBourbon casks are maturing a high alcohol spirit at 63,5%, the optimum for extracting colour and taste from the wood (which is why most single barrel bourbons are so dark in colour)\n-Wine casks were lightly toasted, whereas Bourbon casks are heavily charred.\nThis charring releases more caramel and lignin/vanillin and allows deeper penetration of new make into the wood. Colour in bourbon comes from the charring, taste in bourbon comes from the charring (vanilla-aroma’s, maple syrup from the caramel, relatively low in tannins)\n– European oak is more porous than American oak, allowing for greater penetration (and sometimes leakage) of the newmake in the wood, allowing it the extract more colour and tannins from the wood. This is why Oloroso sherry casks are so dark, the colour and taste come from the wood (less vanilin and caramel due to less toasting, more tannins, hence some bitterness and more colour)\n– American Oak and bourbon are maturing in a relatively warm and sometimes even hot conditions, which gives more expansion and contraction of the wood, speeding up the maturation process and often allowing the alcohol-level to go up, instead of down.\nDue to the shortage of European oak (it’s protected) , and the benefits of American white oak (cheaper, easier to handle, aso) more and more wine casks nowadays are made out of American white oak. Lightly toasted American oak that held wine is going to impart a completely different taste in whisky…. could this be the change?\nSo I guess you could say I’m with Dave in the ongoing e-mail discussion within the maniacs.\nAlthough Michel’s paxarette question is indeed food for thought!']	['<urn:uuid:0bef45cf-c401-4af7-a205-1d0bfa9c629c>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	11	55	1382
42	I'm curious about work in monasteries. What jobs do monks do?	Monks perform various tasks within the monastery, including laundry, tailoring clothes, managing the linen room, repairing shoes, printing, painting, maintaining buildings and equipment, managing central heating and electricity systems. They also work on the farm tending to animals, maintain fruit and vegetable gardens, and operate an apiary farm. All work assignments are made according to each monk's abilities and can be both intellectual and manual in nature.	['Our Daily Work\nSustaining Our Life of Prayer and Study\nWe also encounter the Lord in our work. Again in chapter 48, of the Rule of St Benedict, explains that “Idleness is the enemy of the soul” and stresses that each monk should apply himself to the work he is assigned.\nChrist himself sanctified work by his carpenter’s trade. Our daily work and duties unites us to Christ. If work is carried out in accordance with the Rule, it does not distract us from God’s constant presence. On the contrary, it fosters silence, humility, “Obedience” and charity. Working relationships helps us to build up the community’s unity. Work also maintains our own psychological balance. Since we are enclosed, we have a special need to expend our energy and devote ourselves to some sort of activity which fosters each monk’s gifts and the ability to use them within the structure of our vocation to serve God.\nAll activities, work and assignments are made by the “Counsel” and in acoordance to the monk’s abilities. Both intellectual and manual – enabling the monastery to earn its living. The Rule of St Benedict paints a demanding portrait of the monk’s assignments. The “Counsel” must be like a father to the community, although not undertake anything without the Abbot’s consent.\nThe work detail ” (laundry, tailor’s workshop for making and repairing clothes, linen room, shoe repair shop, print shop, workshops for painting, equipment and building maintenance, the central heating system, electricity, etc.) limits our need for outside tradesmen.\nThe farm and the animals, the gardens both for fruit trees, vegetables and organic study. Our apiary farm and many more areas that need daily attention.\nMost of our income comes from the monastery gardens, farm, honey products and the seasonal Maple Syrup collected from our Maple Trees . Our Monastery Gift Shop is an online based store which represents not only our products but products from monasteries, of men and women from around the world. We also depend on donations to help us maintain our daily life and the growth of our monastic community, maintaining the expansion of our buildings and the care that is required in their upkeep.\n“For the Knowledge of God Is Received in Divine Silence” — St. John of the Cross\nA monk is always studying and the works and writings of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church have a never ending breath of the Church’s Tradition along with the writings and lives of the Saints . Lecitio Divina throughout each day is also a moment of intimacy with God and time spent listening to God’s word which comes to us through the Bible, Holy Scripture. Also in the Church’s Traditions the word of God reaches us in the history of of her foundation by Christ Himself.\nGod speaks to us and wants to enter into dialogue with us is a source of wonder. We try not to miss any of these life-giving words by opening wide the ears of our mind and heart. In chapter 48 of his Rule, St Benedict lays down that his disciples should devote themselves to Lectio Divina at specified periods every day. Here at our Community of Saint Benedict these times of study are at early morning and evening afternoon.']	['<urn:uuid:c06aa110-411e-46fc-8247-0beb7074ba52>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	11	67	545
43	psychological physical effects regular meditation cognitive function health outcomes	Regular mindfulness meditation practice has both psychological and physical health benefits. On the cognitive side, it helps preserve memory and brain function, improves decision-making ability, increases thinking flexibility, and even stimulates new brain growth. Research shows it can slow down the brain's aging process at the DNA level through telomere repair. Physically, it helps manage chronic pain, reduces blood pressure, and improves overall health awareness. The practice also helps relieve chronic stress and anxiety, which are linked to conditions like heart disease and diabetes.	"['Mindfulness is a buzzword that’s been around for a few years now, but did you know that new science is emerging that suggests its pluses for your brain are impressively far-reaching?\nMEDITATION 2.0: A new way to meditate\nDr Craig Hassed is from Monash University in Melbourne’s Department of General Practice and has authored Mindfulness for Life and co-authored Mindful Learning. He says consistent use of the skill has been shown to:\n1. Lower your risk of relapse if you’ve suffered bouts of low mood\n2. Help preserve your memory and brain function\n3. Stimulate new brain growth\n4. Quieten down stress\n5. Aid your ability to make decisions\n6. Improve the flexibility of your thinking\n7. Grow your capacity for empathy\n8. Help you manage pain\n9. Slow down the brain’s ageing process\nOn the latter, Hassed adds, “One really fascinating area of research is to do with genetics. Research from Elizabeth Blackburn, the Nobel Prize winner and her team, shows that mindfulness stimulates the repair of telomere, which is associated with slowing down the ageing process on the level of our DNA.”\nWe quizzed Dr Hassed about how much time is needed to accrue these benefits, and how to best get on board.\nHow would you explain mindfulness?\nMindfulness is not just a form of meditation; it’s also a way of living. So when people are learning to develop mindfulness, it’s not just sitting in a chair, practising a bit of meditation. It’s what they take with them out of the chair that really matters.\nSo when they are talking with their friends, do they have their attention engaged? When they are eating food, do they really taste it? In their day-to-day work, are they focused on what they’re doing and really engaged with their work?\nBeing mindful means really living with attention, and being present and open and curious, and also being accepting about your day-to-day life – accepting of the ebb and flow, the ups and downs, all of which are quite natural.\nHow much time does it take to see some of the payoffs from practising mindfulness?\nYou start to get some of the benefits even if you’re doing 5 or 10 minutes a day. In the case of addressing more chronic illnesses, studies have looked at benefits among people doing 30 or 40 minutes in a day.\nWhat do you think is the biggest positive about practising mindfulness?\nProbably honing your intuition. As a result of mindfulness, the mind is calmer, clearer, more attentive and engaged – the brain works differently, and very often, in a much more intuitive way. When we’re quieter inwardly, we can hear our intuition more clearly. When we’re busy and distracted, very often we don’t hear our intuition.\nWhat’s the best way to get started?\nIt’s very good to do a course and to work with a group. Psychologists are trained it these days, and you can also access information and courses through The Black Dog Institute, Beyond Blue and the Anxiety Recovery Centre.\nThere are books you can read and there are apps, like Smiling Mind which are very good, but there’s nothing better than learning from a well-trained teacher alongside a group – here, you can learn from each other’s experiences as well.\nMindful Learning: Reduce stress and improve brain performance for effective learning ($29.99) is published by Exisle Publishing', ""Mindfulness for Health\nPhoto credit: Alice Popkorn/Flickr.com\nMedical and mental health professionals have been discovering how mindfulness can be used to effectively improve health.\nFor decades professionals have known that chronic stress and anxiety can have profound effects on both physical and mental health.\nChronic stress can raise blood pressure, can cause memory loss, affects cognitive thinking, and contributes to depression.\nStress has also been linked to heart disease, diabetes, and increased accidents and injuries.\nPracticing mindfulness can help to relieve chronic stress helping people feel less anxious and depressed and lowering their blood pressure.\nIt can also help people become more aware of their bodies, and help them identify when something doesn't feel quite right.\nMindfulness can also help people suffering from chronic pain manage their pain more effectively.\n- Mindfulness for Better Mental Health\nDepression often occurs when an individual is subjected to stress for a long period of time.\nThis stress can cause a person to become anxious, view the world negatively, and lead to negative thoughts which they can't seem to escape from.\nMindfulness practice allows individuals to slow down those adverse thought processes by focusing their mind on simple functions of the here and now, such as breathing, walking, or listening to music.\nWhen you practice mindfulness activities, your focus shifts to one simple activity, you simply observe this activity without judgment.\nAs you concentrate on that one activity, your body begins to relax, tension flows from the body, and you begin to feel more relaxed, less overwhelmed, and free from stress and worry.\nPracticing mindfulness meditation on a regular basis can help to relieve stress and elevate your mood, which in turn helps to relieve depression, letting you feel more hopeful and happier.\n- Mindfulness For Better Emotional HealthMindfulness for Health\nWhen too much is going on in our minds we begin to feel overwhelmed, and this feeling of weight on our minds and shoulders, affects us emotionally.\nWe find ourselves unable to view situations clearly, often focusing on the negative rather than the positive. We become upset, easily frustrated, and irritable.\nSome people become tearful and overly sensitive. Others shut off emotionally or withdraw which can lead to all types of complications with family, friends, and relationships in general.\nPracticing mindfulness works to clear the mind. It relieves that feeling of being overwhelmed by allowing us to focus on the here and now, on a single moment in time instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.\nBy focusing on the moment, we are less likely to judge a situation based on past experiences, and are better able to view an event more realistically.\nThis allows us to deal with a current situation less emotionally, because we aren't viewing the situation with negative connotations based on past experiences.\nMindfulness practice allows us to control our emotions and reduce our tendency to become upset, hostile or irritable.\n- Mindfulness For Physical HealthMindfulness for Health\nPracticing mindfulness allows us to know and better understand how our bodies work.\nThis helps us to recognize when something is not quite right sooner than we otherwise would, which can result in seeking treatment faster, before a small problem becomes a big one.\nMindfulness mediation can also help people suffering from chronic pain manage their condition better.\nWhen people experience pain on a continual basis they tend to focus much of their attention on the pain they feel or the pain they experienced in the past.\nThey worry that the pain will worsen in the future.\nStudies show that focusing on pain can set up an emotional response where people actually feel more pain than just the physical pain.\nMindfulness practice can divert a person’s focus for a short period of time to something other than the pain.\nFor instance when you focus on your breathing, concentrating on how it feels to draw in each breath and release it, the way your chest and stomach expands, and the rise and fall of your shoulders, your mind lets go of the memory of past pain and the worry about future pain, and people find that the actual pain they are feeling diminishes.\nPart of the reduction in pain is due to do the fact that they relax. Their muscles become less tense.\nPart of the reduction in pain also has to do with the fact that by letting go of the memory of pain, and the worry of future pain, they only feel that pain that is here now, not the emotional pain that contributes to the physical pain.\nMindfulness practice can affect many aspects of our health, and when people feel healthier they can face the world more positively while experiencing less stress and anxiety.""]"	['<urn:uuid:9bfe3383-15fe-41ff-b3f3-2f1cf46343d3>', '<urn:uuid:f9f9e11d-7996-4876-b2cb-bc7b6a5027bb>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	9	84	1352
44	How much energy does liquid cremation save compared to regular cremation?	Liquid cremation requires only one-eighth of the energy compared to conventional cremation.	['Every person affects the natural environment during that person’s life and life activities. Today, the current topic is related to death or funerals, which consume huge amounts of wood and metal (coffin), stone and concrete (tombs), chemicals (body treatment and posthumous cleansing), plastics (artificial flowers and lanterns), fresh flowers that quickly withered, candles extinguished by wind and rain and the like. Cemeteries also occupy ever larger urban or suburban areas. People today want to live and die more sustainably. Thus the natural or green world funeral trend is becoming increasingly popular. The body is disposed of in cleaner and less invasive ways than conventional burials.\nEcological coffins, mortuary clothing, urns and burials made of natural materials and without added chemicals are already current in Western countries. The goal is for the body to be biodegradable after death to return to new life and life cycle as soon as possible. The practice of natural burials is most prevalent in Canada, the United States, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom.\nIn America, there are even “Green Burial Council” and “Center for Natural Burial” organizations that provide interested individuals with detailed information about green funerals. The Center for Natural Burier also provided insight into specific data on the post-mortem impact on the natural environment. They say that on average, 20,000 tons of concrete, 1,000 tons of steel and wooden coffins were buried on about 10 hectares of cemetery area, enough for about 40 potential houses. The old way of burial burdens the land and the air. The funeral industry generates significant amounts of carbon dioxide (transporting coffins, cremation, production of funeral items) and harmful gases. Cremation today seeks to strike a balance between the deceased and nature. Bios urns by Gerard Molina from Spain are popular around the world. The urn is in the shape of a jar in which the powder of the deceased is mixed with the substrate. In this way, a plant or a tree can be grown or a new life can be produced. Urn Bios can be planted outdoors directly into the ground or become a houseplant. The ashes of pets are disposed of in the same way. The Bios Park project has also been launched. The first Bios Park was built in Quebec, Canada, and more such parks are currently being built around the world. These are large green areas where urns can be planted en masse and at the same time preserve the beautiful memory of the deceased.\nEternal Reefs is an American company that takes care of the remains of pets. It offers new life in the form of a coral reef in the ocean. A kind of balls with holes are built from an environmentally friendly mixture of concrete and mortar ash. The balls are placed on the ocean floor to become a habitat for corals, fish and other sea creatures. Newly formed reefs encourage plant and marine biodiversity. So far, more than 2,000 reefs have been located in various locations along the US coast. Americans have popularized alkaline hydrolysis (a new way of cremation) which is liquid cremation. The body of the deceased with this method dissolves in a solution of water and potassium hydroxide. The bones remain as in the case of regular normal cremation by the cremation process. The bones are pulverized and given to the families of the deceased. The basic environmental advantage here is that liquid cremation requires only one-eighth of the energy compared to conventional cremation.\nComposting mortal remains is the latest alternative to burial and cremation. Life cycles happen just like that, says Katrina Spade, owner of Recompose (a composting company for the deceased) in the American city of Seattle, Washington. http://www.recompose.life http://www.seattletimes.com\nThe composting method or natural organic reduction was legalized in 2018. Today, this method is an alternative to cremation and funerals. The deceased is placed in a closed chamber where the body is lined with pieces of wood, straw and other natural materials. Beneficial microbes are stimulated under controlled conditions of a certain temperature, humidity and ratio of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Beneficial microbes are naturally present in the human body and the environment, so the body decomposes completely in a month. This leaves approximately one cubic meter of clean, odorless and completely safe to use compost. In the composting process, energy consumption is eight times lower than in cremation. A matter of less carbon dioxide. Recompose is building the world’s first center for mass composting of the dead. People who take the compost can return the compost to the soil in the desired way. Composted mortal remains can be donated to enrich the soil of the Bells Mountain Protected Area. Dutch scientist from the University of Technology in Delft Bob Hendrikx recently designed the “living cocoon”.\nIt is made of natural material from fungal mycelium (which promotes the decomposition of the body up to 5 times faster than the conventional method). Mushrooms cleanse the body of toxins, leaving only healthy food for the soil. Due to human parasitic life, we currently live in a cemetery of nature. Mycelium can humans return to the true circle of life — says scientist Hendrikx. It continues a new study how artificial grave lanterns replaced with a fungus that naturally glow in the dark. The creators of the biodegradable death capsule “Capsula Mundi” are Italian designers Anna Citelli and Raoul Bretzel. The body is placed in the fetal position and placed in the place where the tree of the deceased’s or relatives’ choice will be planted. A similar mini version or biodegradable urn Capsule Mundi is used. http://www.capsulamundi.it']	['<urn:uuid:ce92a32f-efb4-4753-b1bc-4e49c415614a>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	11	12	930
45	I'm trying to make my farm's soil healthier. How do different farming practices like tilling and organic fertilizers affect the bacteria and other living things in the soil?	Different farming practices significantly impact soil life. Tillage has the strongest effect - reduced tillage leads to much higher biological activity compared to moldboard plowing. Using organic inputs instead of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides also increases microbial biomass, enzyme activity, and soil respiration, though not as dramatically as reducing tillage. The bacteria in soil are particularly important as they convert plant materials into more stable microbial biomass, which helps maintain soil fertility. The efficiency of this bacterial conversion (called bacterial growth efficiency or BGE) varies between different farming systems - for example, soybean fields showed higher BGE than forest soils, and cropland soils showed more seasonal variation in BGE compared to forest soils.	['Lee, Z. 2011. Bacterial growth efficiency: Assessment in terrestrial ecosystems. Dissertation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.\nBacteria in soil are responsible for converting labile root exudates into microbial biomass that is more stable. This transformation is important for stabilizing soil organic carbon (SOC) and maintaining soil fertility. Bacterial partitioning of SOC into biosynthesis of new biomass or mineralization to carbon dioxide is defined as bacterial growth efficiency (BGE). BGE is also an integral component of models that simulate carbon dynamics in soil. However, variation in BGE in terrestrial ecosystems is not well understood, nor are environmental factors that influence it. In fact, BGE is often assumed to be constant. This dissertation explores BGE in four terrestrial biomes at the Kellogg Biological Station Long Term Ecological Research site and assesses factors that may influence BGE.\nBGE is calculated from bacterial production (BP) and respiration (BR) using the formula BGE = BP/(BP+BR). In terrestrial ecosystems, these parameters are often measured using a single radiolabeled substrate, which masks any influence of BGE specific to resources available in the soil. We developed a method that permits BGE measurements to reflect the nutrient status of the soil. BP was measured as 3 H-leucine incorporation rate into protein and BR as oxygen consumption rate, both without exogenously added substrates. Using this method, variation of BGE was assessed for soils collected from deciduous forest and three different croplands. We showed that BGE was not constant, but varied from 0.23 to 0.63. Bacterial communities in soils from soybean monoculture cropland tended to have a higher BGE than those in deciduous forests or rotational cropland soils. BGE in cropland soils exhibited a large seasonal variation not observed in forest soils.\nBGE can also be influenced by the composition of bacterial communities, as different bacterial species have different energy and growth requirements. However, it is challenging to link a general function such as carbon transformation to the structure of the bacterial community because of high functional redundancy. Using 16S rRNA gene surveys of rotation cropland and forest soils, it is proposed that the efficiency of bacterial communities can be predicted. In addition to identification of the types of bacteria in the soil sample, 16S rRNA gene surveys also provide a glimpse of the lifestyle of the bacteria. The identity of the bacteria provides an estimate of the number of 16S rRNA genes in the genome, which can then indicate the ecological strategy of the bacteria. Based on the ecological strategy, the growth efficiency can be predicted. The rotation cropland and forest soils have different community composition but the overall 16S rRNA gene copy number is the same, consistent with the observation that these two communities have similar growth efficiencies.\nInclusion of measured values of BGE into DAYCENT, a model simulating nutrient cycling in soils, revealed the sensitivity of the model to changes in BGE. When simulating carbon dynamics in a mock ecosystem, decreasing the default BGE value of 0.45 to the average BGE in forest soils, 0.35, reduced the active carbon fraction by 22%. This led to a 5% reduction in the predicted total soil carbon at equilibrium. Therefore, site-specific BGE is important for improving the predictive capacity of SOC models, especially when investigating the effects of changes in climate, soil edaphic properties and land management practices on labile SOC transformations.\nAssociated Treatment Areas:\nBiodiversity Gradient TDF T1 T8Sign in to download PDF back to index', 'Effects of Tillage, Rotation, and Organic Inputs on Soil Ecological Properties in Vegetable Crop Production Systems\nAgricultural management decisions that influence biological activity and diversity include tillage, fertilizer and pest-control inputs, and crop rotations. Our research objective was to characterize relationships between biological and physical properties resulting from long-term agricultural management decisions. A nine-year old factorially-designed field experiment was used to examine the effects of tillage (moldboard plow or strip-tillage), input (synthetic fertilizers and pesticides or inputs approved for organic certification programs), and crop rotation (continuous staked tomatoes or 3-year vegetable rotation) on a suite of biological and physical soil parameters. Biological measurements included microbial, nematode, and earthworm community composition, soil respiration and N mineralization potential, enzyme activity, and microbial biomass. Physical property measurements included aggregate stability, bulk density, and pore-size distribution. Biological properties generally responded to all treatment combinations, but tillage provided the strongest treatment effect in most cases. Compared to strip-tillage, moldboard tillage consistently yielded significantly lower values for the following biological measurements: total C and N, above-ground biomass, microbial biomass, enzyme activity, soil respiration, N mineralization, some nematode trophic groups, and earthworms. Compared with organic inputs, synthetic inputs consistently induced significantly lower values for the following biological measurements: microbial biomass, enzyme activity, some nematode trophic groups, and soil respiration. An examination of relationships between biological and physical parameters using redundancy analysis revealed that microporosity was the physical property that was most strongly correlated with most biological parameters. Soil organisms responded to treatments in the following order: tillage > input > rotation.\n1. To evaluate the biological diversity of soils under different agricultural management strategies, recognizing that a highly productive agricultural soil is considered to be one with a high degree of biological activity and containing a stable cross section of microorganisms and invertebrates.\n2. To make the best possible estimation of microbial and invertebrate populations and community structure using a range of direct enumeration and community evaluation techniques.\n3. To assess the effect of microbial and invertebrate communities on the following soil physical properties: aggregate stability, bulk density, porosity, and pore size distribution.\n4. To aid in the assessment of soil degradation by identifying soil biological indicators of high soil productivity potential for agricultural soils.\nSoil biological measurements have been concluded for microbial, nematode, and earthworm community composition, soil respiration and N mineralization potential, enzyme activity, and microbial biomass. Physical property measurements that included aggregate stability, bulk density, and pore-size distribution are also finished. This experiment has completed the field and lab measurement phase and final conclusions are being written. Final publications of the work are in departmental or journal review.\nImpacts and Contributions/Outcomes\nWe found that greatest biological activity among various field production systems was in those systems that had the least tillage. Changing production systems from chemical to organic also produced increased biological activity, but not to the the extent that tillage reduction did. We have given many workshops and speaker presentation on the findings of this research, with much interest from producers who want to achieve greater soil productity from their farm operation.\nPhD Graduate Student\nDept. of Soil Science, NCSU\nRaleigh, NC 27695-7619\nOffice Phone: 9195133037']	['<urn:uuid:beb81ff3-6e51-4533-82e3-959ef681327b>', '<urn:uuid:0f0e9afe-f184-451e-9d24-68c714462c8f>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	28	113	1091
46	drug policy reform reasons benefits costs	Drug policy reform is needed to reduce drug-related deaths, disease, violence, crime, and corruption associated with prohibitionist policies. The benefits include better protection of health and safety through evidence-based approaches rather than repressive measures. From a cost perspective, reform is beneficial as treatment saves money - every $1 spent on substance abuse treatment saves $4 in health care costs and $7 in law enforcement costs.	"['A number of world leaders call for ending criminalization of drug use and possession and responsible legal regulation of psychoactive substances\nFormer Presidents of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Poland, Portugal and Switzerland Join With Kofi Annan, Richard Branson, George Shultz, Paul Volcker And Others To Make Bold, New Recommendations for Major Paradigm Shift in Global Drug Policy on the Road to UN Special Session on Drugs in 2016\nNote: the opinions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the positions of Dianova International\nOpinion – ""Taking Control"": Pathways to Drug Policies that Work\n(…) A new and improved global drug control regime is needed that better protects the health and safety of individuals and communities around the world. Harsh measures grounded in repressive ideologies must be replaced by more humane and effective policies shaped by scientific evidence, public health principles and human rights standards. This is the only way to simultaneously reduce drug-related death, disease and suffering and the violence, crime, corruption and illicit markets associated with ineffective prohibitionist policies. The fiscal implications of the policies we advocate, it must be stressed, pale in comparison to the direct costs and indirect consequences generated by the current regime.\n(…) The obstacles to drug policy reform are both daunting and diverse. Powerful and established drug control bureaucracies, both national and international, staunchly defend status quo policies. They seldom question whether their involvement and tactics in enforcing drug policy are doing more harm than good. Meanwhile, there is often a tendency to sensationalize each new “drug scare” in the media. And politicians regularly subscribe to the appealing rhetoric of “zero tolerance” and creating “drug free” societies rather than pursuing an informed approach based on evidence of what works. Popular associations of illicit drugs with ethnic and racial minorities stir fear and inspire harsh legislation. And enlightened reform advocates are routinely attacked as “soft on crime” or even “pro-drug.”\nThe good news is that change is in the air. The Global Commission is gratified that a growing number of the recommendations offered in this report are already under consideration, underway or firmly in place around the world. But we are at the beginning of the journey and governments can benefit from the accumulating experience where reforms are being pursued. Fortunately, the dated rhetoric and unrealistic goals set during the 1998 UNGASS on drugs are unlikely to be repeated in 2016. Indeed, there is growing support for more flexible interpretations and reform of the international drug control conventions aligned with human rights and harm reduction principles.\nTaking Control makes seven recommendations which can be summarized as follows:\n- Put health and community safety first through a fundamental reorientation of policy priorities and resources, from failed punitive enforcement to proven health and social interventions.\n- Ensure equitable access to essential medicines, in particular opiate-based medications for pain.\n- Stop criminalizing people for drug use and possession – and stop imposing “compulsory treatment” on people whose only offense is drug use or possession.\n- Rely on alternatives to incarceration for non-violent, low-level participants in illicit drug markets such as farmers, couriers and others involved in the production, transport and sale of illicit drugs.\n- Focus on reducing the power of criminal organizations as well as the violence and insecurity that result from their competition with both one another and the state.\n- Allow and encourage diverse experiments in legally regulating markets in currently illicit drugs, beginning with but not limited to cannabis, coca leaf and certain novel psychoactive substances.\n- Take advantage of the opportunity presented by the upcoming UNGASS in 2016 to reform the global drug policy regime.\nCommission Members: Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the United Nations and chair of the Kofi Annan Foundation, Ghana – Louise Arbour, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Canada – Pavel Bém, former Mayor of Prague, Czech Republic – Richard Branson, entrepreneur, advocate for social causes, founder of the Virgin Group, cofounder of The Elders, United Kingdom – Fernando Henrique Cardoso, former President of Brazil (chair) – Maria Cattaui, former Secretary-General of the International Chamber of Commerce, Switzerland – Ruth Dreifuss, former President of Switzerland and Minister of Home Affairs – César Gaviria, former President of Colombia – Asma Jahangir, human rights activist, former UN Special Rapporteur on Arbitrary, Extrajudicial and Summary Executions, Pakistan – Michel Kazatchkine, UN Secretary General Special Envoy on HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and former executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, France – Aleksander Kwasniewski, former President of Poland – Ricardo Lagos, former President of Chile – George Papandreou, former Prime Minister of Greece – Jorge Sampaio, former President of Portugal – George P.

Having an addiction also comes with serious health concerns. Abusing drugs can seriously harm your body and you may even have to deal with these issues for the rest of your life.\nWhile the health issues and strain on relationships are usually the first things we all think about when it comes to drug addiction, don’t forget about the financial costs of substance abuse.\nAccording to researchers, the economic burden of addiction in the United States is more than twice that of any other neurological disease.1 Of course, actually buying drugs in the first place can be costly, but there are additional expenses when it comes to healthcare, legal fees, and other social costs. Let’s not forget that often those addicted to drugs may end up with a loss of income.\nLet’s look at the financial toll of addiction.\nAddiction and Poverty\nAddiction is by far most costly for the poor. If you’re at the poverty level, a pack of cigarettes per day can consume 10% of your family’s monthly income. Even worse, if you’re a heavy substance abuser, you might even be spending half or more of your monthly income on drugs.\nAddiction can even create poverty in future generations. Due to your drug habits, your children may receive inadequate education and struggle with budgeting and time management. They may even mimic your habits and develop addictions themselves; something no one wants for their children.\nAddiction is heavily associated with poverty, not just because substance abuse itself is expensive, but because addiction is often a means of escapism. Many people living in poverty abuse substances in order to avoid the serious problems they may be facing in their lives. When you’re living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to make ends meet, drugs can provide an instant gratification that is virtually absent in all other areas of your life.\nCost of Buying Drugs\nIf you have a substance addiction, paying for it can get expensive, regardless of the substance. Even something that can be cheap, such as alcohol, can drain your bank account over time, especially if you find you need to use more to get your desired effect.\nTo put this into perspective, if you drink a cheap $5 6-pack of beer every day, that’s $150 each month. That’s almost $1,000 in 6 months to support this habit.\nNow switch out the $5 beer to a more expensive drug like, cocaine or heroin and the cost skyrockets. Some people can easily spend more than $10,000 each year to support their addiction.\nLoss of Productivity and Income\nAbusing drugs can make you significantly less productive. You may start to notice that you’re calling in sick to work more often and when you do make an appearance, the quality of your work is very sub par. Poor work performance can mean you miss out on promotions or bonuses, a cut back on shifts, or you could even lose your job.\nMany addicts lose their jobs and remain unemployed as a result of their addiction. Others end up in jails, prisons, or long-term rehabilitation facilities, which can result in years of lost productivity. It can be difficult to get yourself back in the workforce after years of unemployment due to drug abuse.\nSocial security and retirement benefits can also be affected, so even after recovery, you could continue to experience the financial impact of your addiction for years.\nOver a lifetime, addiction can cost an addict thousands of dollars in lost productivity potential.\nHealth Care, Insurance Costs, and Legal Fees\nBeing a drug addict can result in serious health problems. This is already a huge and life-threatening cost, however it also comes with increased health care fees and insurance premiums.\nAnother cost that may often be overlooked, is the increase in car insurance premiums and fines you incur as a result of your addiction. Getting arrested for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol may result in a 300% increase in your car insurance premiums, significant legal fees, and let’s not forget jail time.\nOther payments you may need to make include fees for attorney services, educational courses, and drug-related fines.\nThe Costs of Addiction on Society\nThe costs of addiction on society are extremely high. Drug addiction costs society billions of dollars in health care expenditures, enforcement of drug laws, lost productivity, etc.\nAddiction can also result in unpaid debts, missed payments, late fees, and foreclosure of property. According to research, excessive drinking alone cost the United States approximately $223 billion dollars in health care expenses, law enforcement costs, and lost productivity in 2006.

The Marines were from the CBRN Defense Platoon, 4th Marine Logistics Group, Combat Logistics Regiment 4, Kansas City, Mo., and came from Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Nebraska and Iowa.	"['Reserve Marines on post for CBRN MOS training\nJuly 31, 2014\nReserve Marines from Kansas spent two weeks on Fort Leonard Wood focusing on their Military Occupation Specialty -- Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear defense.\nThe 30 Marines and one Navy corpsman were here from the CBRN Defense Platoon, 4th Marine Logistics Group, Combat Logistics Regiment 4, Kansas City, Mo.\nThey were here for MOS enhancement training and sustainment training.\n""We have Marines from Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Nebraska and Iowa. They report to Kansas City once a month. With the Reserves, we are dictated to do all of the annual training that active-duty Marines are required to do. But, instead of 365 days, we only have 38 days to get that in. To be able to focus purely on CBRN training is a unique opportunity for us,"" said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Robert Bauer, CBRN Defense Platoon commander, 4th Marine Logistics Group, Combat Logistics Regiment 4, Kansas City, Mo.\nWhile on post, they spent three days at the Marine Corps Detachment\'s CBRN School house, learning plotting of CBRN attacks followed by a Joint Warning and Reporting Network class. They also trained at the Chemical Defense Training Facility, concentrating on reconnaissance and sampling -- once in a self contained breathing apparatus and once in protective mask.\nThey conducted two days of training at the Edwin R. Bradley Radiological Laboratories studying the principles of shielding, detection, identifying radioactive sources, radiological monitoring, radiation detection equipment, radiological site analysis, exploitation and decontamination.\n""The Army and the Marines use the same radiological equipment, and our safety guidelines are the same. In fact, due to the nature of radiation, the U.S. and partner nations use the same tactics, techniques and procedures working around radiological material,"" said Sgt. 1st Class Donald Randall, ERB Radiological Laboratories noncommissioned-officer-in-charge.\nEven though the Marines were the ones here to train, Randall said the rad lab\'s instructors also benefitted from their time with the Reserve unit.\n""Hosting the 4th MLG was a great opportunity for our instructors to teach a class exclusively to Marine personnel. We do train some Marine personnel, but they are either a student in the Chemical Captains\' Career Course or the Chemical Warrant Officer Basic Course.""\nThe 4th MLG Marines also spent two days training with the Technical Escort branch at the Lt. Joseph Terry Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Responder Facility to study chemical processes and glasswork.\n""We are Title 10 Forces, so we are used for civil support. We are trying to exercise the techniques needed in case we are called to action. We also provide support to our major subordinate command, 4th Marine Logistic Group and our regiment for any CBRN assistance needed,"" Bauer said.\n""It\'s definitely a combat multiplier to be here. It\'s nice to have these facilities and subject-matter experts available. The Marine Corps Detachment here and all of the CBRN facilities on post have been great at providing instruction support to us,"" he added.\nBauer said the support they received on Fort Leonard Wood was first-class.\n""The Maneuver Support Center of Excellence and the Marine Corps Detachment have been outstanding.

48	what happens to methane when farmers use biodigesters	When farmers use biodigesters, the methane that would normally be released into the atmosphere is captured. The biodigester breaks down organic matter like manure and food waste without oxygen, producing biogas that consists primarily of carbon dioxide and methane. This process can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from a dairy farm by 35% when the biogas-based electricity replaces grid-based electricity.	"[""How it works\n- When microorganisms (e.g.bacteria) break down organic matter like manure and food waste anaerobically (without oxygen), biogas is released. Bio gas consists primarily of carbon dioxide and methane - one of the primary components of natural gas.\n- Farmers place animal manure, food waste and agricultural waste in an anaerobic digester with a pipe to extract the gas.\n- The solid byproduct is used as livestock bedding, soil amendments or in biodegradable planting pots, and the liquid byproduct is a nutrient-rich fertilizer.\nBenefits of Biogas-based Energy\n- Reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Biodigesters divert carbon dioxide and methane that would normally be released into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas emissions from a dairy farm can be reduced by 35% when biogas-based electricity replaces grid-based electricity.\n- Cost savings. On-site biodigesters help farmers save on electricity bills and fertilizer. A farmer told The Washington Post that he saved anywhere from $75,000 to $100,000 a year on electricity, heating, fertilizer, and animal bedding with a biodigester.\n- Renewable. Biogas is generally considered renewable as it is produced by animal and plant waste and the source is not limited in quantity like coal or natural gas.\n- Biogas generation is becoming increasingly popular. From 2000 to 2020, the number of operational anaerobic digesters in the United States has grown from 24 to 255.\n- Biogas is a popular mode of energy production in India and China, which have 4.54 million and 27 million biogas plants respectively.\n- As the world divests from fossil fuels, new and varied energy sources will be necessary to satisfy the energy needs of the world and biogas can help. Biogas just goes to show you that not all waste is useless. One cow’s waste is another man’s treasure.\nDig deeper → 4 min\nHow it stands\n- Companies frequently implement corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs (which include sustainability initiatives) in order to improve their image in the eyes of investors and customers, which in turn boosts profits.\n- But it is unclear if CSR programs actually make the world a better place\n- Most of the information about a company’s environmental footprint is only available through the company itself, presenting an obstacle to objective evaluation.\n- Coca-Cola claims to have reduced the water footprint of their drinks. But their calculations do not include the water used in the supply chain that provides the ingredients and packaging for the final product.\n- CSR programs (like Coca-Cola’s) often use offsets which instead of conserving limited resources lead to increased consumption.\n- Unilever claims to use a scientific approach to sustainability, trying to reduce their own emissions instead of investing in offsets for carbon neutrality.\n- More recently, Unilever announced the addition of carbon footprint labels on all products to increase transparency.\n- While the effectiveness of corporate sustainability programs is mixed, the fact that sustainability is on their radar and part of their marketing strategy is a big step forward.\n- Don’t take everything you hear at face value. Take a deep dive into a company’s sustainability practices and decide for yourself.\nDig deeper → 5 min\nThe Scoop Two new cases in Minnesota and Washington, D.C. add to the growing body of lawsuits trying to hold Big Oil accountable for deliberately concealing their role in harming environmental and human health.\nBreaking down the lawsuits\n- Minnesota’s Attorney General (AG) is suing Exxon Mobil Corporation, Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute for violating Minnesota laws against consumer fraud, deceptive trade practices, and false advertising. The lawsuit claims that oil and gas companies were aware of the environmental and health effects of their products as far back as the 1970s and 80s, but launched a “campaign of deception.”\n- Washington D.C.’s AG similarly is suing ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and Shell for “systematically and intentionally misl[eading] consumers in Washington, D.C. about the central role their products play in causing climate change.” in violation of Washington D.C.’s Consumer Protection Procedures Act.\nWhy it matters By charging Big Oil with consumer fraud, Minnesota and Washington D.C.’s cases closely resemble lawsuits against Big Tobacco in the 1990s which charged Big Tobacco with suppressing evidence for the dangers of smoking and misleading the public. With the clear similarities between these cases, there is hope for similar verdicts; including, heavy penalties (up to $6.5 billion) that could fund climate change resiliency programs.\nDig deeper → 5 min\nThe scoop In June 2020, the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis unveiled a 547-page, sweeping climate plan that aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and net-negative emissions thereafter.\nWhy it matters The plan seeks to uplift Americans and support front-line and low-income communities that are disproportionately impacted by climate change. Driven by science and economics, it also centers around environmental justice, with an opening paragraph alluding to the passing of George Floyd.\nBottom line The report is the most ambitious proposal to combat climate change we've seen from Democrats. Energy Innovation, an independent policy modeling company, projects that the plan would achieve a 37% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2048. If implemented, it would also save 62,000 lives annually by 2050 and $8 trillion in health and climate costs.\nDig deeper → 5 min\nThe scoop The price of crude oil plummeted following the outbreak of the novel COVID-19. As 2020 began, Brent crude oil - the global oil benchmark - cost $64/barrel. By April 21st, 2020, the price had dropped to $17/barrel. What happened?\nFuture of Oil\n- The volatility and steep decline in oil prices may lead some producers to shut down operations. Shale oil extraction pioneer Chesapeake Energy recently declared bankruptcy. Many oil giants are delaying expansion projects.\n- Investors are now less inclined to invest in oil & gas -- lower prices = greater risk, less profit. Energy was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 index for four out of the last six years.\nEnvironmental impact Climate awareness already poses a threat to Big Oil. With this economic crisis, investors might turn to renewable energy. Renewables are more price stable, cheap, and cost-competitive, even during low prices of oil.\nBottom line It’s impossible to predict the future. Big Oil will certainly survive the pandemic, but its century-long domination of energy may soon end. One thing’s for sure -- clean technology has a strong outlook, and can certainly give oil and gas companies a run for their money. Not only from its greenness, but also in its economics.\nDig deeper → 3 min\nHow it stands\n- An estimated 45-70% of clothing donated in Western countries (US, UK, Germany) enters the global used clothing trade.\n- Clothing is sold to traders in Sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda) and ends up in used clothing markets in cities, towns and villages.\n- Starting in 1980, economic liberalization (i.e. reforms to open their borders to international trade) in Sub-Saharan Africa caused domestic manufacturing to decline and increased demand for imported, cheap, used clothing to the region.\n- The used clothing trade is a lucrative profession for those with limited job prospects. A used clothing trader in Nairobi can make up to 1000 shillings a day ($9 USD), 10 times the prevailing wage.\n- In 2016, the East Africa Community (EAC) - an intergovernmental organization of six East African countries - decided to ban all imports of used clothing by 2019 to boost local manufacturing and create employment opportunities. The effects of this ban are unclear.\nWhat can we do\n- The problems plaguing the Sub-Saharan African textile industry are complicated to say the least. Limiting the used clothing trade is not enough to reinvigorate manufacturing.\n- Dominant trends like fast fashion encourage consumers to buy new and improved products and discard the old ones at the expense of manufacturing economies in developing nations.

49	what areas covered environmental damage claims compensation natural resources examples	Natural resource damage claims can cover a wide range of resources including land, water, groundwater, drinking water supplies, air, fish, wildlife, and biota. In New York State, this includes prominent resources such as Long Island Sound, the Hudson River, the Adirondack Park, and Niagara Falls, as well as smaller resources like rural ponds, creeks, wetlands and municipal parks.	"['Natural Resource Damages (NRD)\nNew York State has a rich and diverse array of natural resources. From prominent resources, such as Long Island Sound, the Hudson River, the Adirondack Park, and Niagara Falls to small rural ponds, creeks, wetlands and municipal parks - the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC)\'s mission is to conserve, improve and protect all of the natural resources of New York State for the benefit of its citizens. The Commissioner of Environmental Conservation is the Trustee for the natural resources of the State of New York, having been so designated by the Governor. In order to aid the Commissioner in fulfilling his Trustee obligations, DEC\'s Natural Resource Damages Staff seek to recover damages from responsible parties when natural resources are injured and use such damages to restore or replace those resources.\nWhat are Natural Resource Damages?\nWhen a spill or release of contaminants into the environment results in injuries to natural resources, Natural Resource Damages (NRD) are sought from the party or parties legally responsible in order to restore the injured natural resources and compensate the public. The goal of an NRD claim is the restoration, replacement, or acquisition of the equivalent of the injured resources, and compensation for past and future lost services that the injured resources would have provided had they not been injured by the release. Damages also include the cost of the damage assessment. ""Natural resources"" that may be the subject of an NRD claim include, but are not limited to, land, water, groundwater, drinking water supplies, air, fish, wildlife, and biota.\nRecovery of damages for injury to natural resources is authorized by both federal and state law. The federal laws are: the Superfund law (Comprehensive Environmental Remediation, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA), the Oil Pollution Act, and the Clean Water Act. The State laws are: the Environmental Conservation Law (ECL), the Navigation Law and common law. CERCLA requires the U.S. president and each state governor to designate federal and state officials who will act on behalf of the public as trustees for natural resources. The Governor has designated the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation as the Trustee for New York\'s natural resources. Frequently, DEC is a co-trustee with the federal Trustees from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of the Interior (DOI), among others, and, in certain cases, with Native American tribes. In most cases, the resolution of NRD claims is handled by attorneys in DEC\'s Office of General Counsel, but in some instances DEC refers cases to the NYS Office of the Attorney General for legal representation when a claim will be pursued in court.\nFor questions regarding Natural Resource Damages, please contact:\nFish, Wildlife & Marine Resources\nAlbany, NY 12233-4750\nMore about Natural Resource Damages (NRD):\n- CP-44 / Natural Resource Damages Policy - This Policy identifies the commitment by the Department of Environmental Conservation (Department) to the operation of a comprehensive Natural Resource Damages (NRD) Program to enable the Commissioner, as the designated Trustee for State natural resources, to fulfill his/her legal obligation to act on behalf of the public to recover damages for injuries to natural resources and to use any recovered damages to restore or replace those injured resources.\n- Natural Resource Damages Assessment and Restoration Process - A complete listing of the process, from identifying a release to implementing a restoration plan.\n- Major Ongoing Natural Resource Damages Assessments - Descriptions of major assessments being conducted by NYSDEC.\n- Natural Resource Damages Restoration Projects - Descriptions of NRD restoration projects, including habitat restoration and natural resource management, land acquisitions, and sportfishing restoration.', 'What are Natural Resource Damages?\nWhen a spill or release of contaminants into the environment results in injuries to natural resources, designated federal, state or tribal natural resources trustees may seek to a recover natural resource damages (NRDs) from the party or parties legally responsible for the spill or release. The goal of the Trustee’s NRD claim is to secure the restoration, replacement, or acquisition of the equivalent of the injured resources and to compensate the public for its lost use of the damaged natural resources. Damages also include the cost of the damage assessment. “Natural resources” that may be the subject of an NRD claim include, but are not limited to, land, water, groundwater, drinking water supplies, air, fish, wildlife, and biota.\nThe recovery of damages for injury to natural resources is authorized by both federal and state law.

CERCLA requires the president and each state governor to designate federal and state officials who will act on behalf of the public as trustees for natural resources. The Governor has designated the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation as the Trustee for New York’s natural resources. The federal Trustee for Onondaga Lake is the United States Department of the Interior (DOI). The Commissioner and USDOI are serving as co-trustees for Onondaga Lake.\nOnly CERCLA provides a statutory basis for the Onondaga Nation to serve as an NRD trustee. The scope of that authority is both broader possibly more restricted than that of the federal and state trustees. Specifically, the statute reads as follows:\n“In the case of an injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources under … this section liability shall be …to any Indian Tribe for natural resources belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to such tribe, or held in benefit for the trust of such tribe ….”\n42 U.S.C. § 9607(f)(1). Related sections of the CERCLA statue appear to limit a Tribe’s ability to recover NRDs, while at the same time other provisions appear to expand the reach of Tribal NRD rights. In sum, the ability, scope and magnitude of the ability of an Indian tribe to be awarded NRDs is less than certain.\nThere are no exclusions from liability for governmental entities; the definition of “person” expressly includes the United States, states, municipalities, or state political subdivisions. 42 U.S.C. § 9601(21). Congress expressed it clearly: “Each department, agency, and instrumentality of the United States (including the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government) shall be subject to, and comply with, this chapter in the same manner and to the same extent, both procedurally and substantively, as any nongovernmental entity, including liability under section 9607 of this title.” 42 U.S.C. § 9620(a)(1). There are limited exceptions to liability however, such as where a government acquired land involuntarily or through eminent domain, but the general rule is clear: governmental entities receive no special treatment under CERCLA.\nThe trustees have the following responsibilities:\n- Assess the damage to natural resources. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §9607(f)(2)(A). Federal trustees can also, upon request from a state or Indian tribe, assess damages for a natural resource under the state’s or tribe’s trusteeship. 42 U.S.C. §9607(f)(2)(A); 33 U.S.C. §2706(c)(1);\n- Develop and implement a plan to restore, rehabilitate, or replace damaged natural resources. 33 U.S.C. §2706(c); and\n- Request that the Attorney General commence civil suits against NRD defendants. See, e.g., 16 U.S.C. §19jj-2(a); 16 U.S.C. §1443(c)(1).\nOne of the trustees’ primary responsibilities is to conduct an NRD assessment to determine the extent of the injury to a natural resource and determine the appropriate manner by which to restore the resource. A natural resource damage assessment (NRDA) is “the process of collecting, compiling, and analyzing information, statistics, or data through prescribed methodologies to determine damages for injuries to natural resources.” 43 C.F.R. §11.14(aa).\nThe specific procedures to be followed for CERCLA and CWA NRD claims are found at 43 C.F.R. Part 11. Under the CERCLA and CWA regulations, there are two kinds of NRDAs allowed, depending on the resource damaged, Type A and Type B procedures. Type A assessments are “standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field observations to determine damages.” 43 C.F.R. §11.14(ss). Type B assessments are “alternative methodologies for conducting assessments in individual cases to determine the type and extent of short- and long-term injury and damages.” 43 C.F.R. §11.14(tt). The significant difference between the two types of assessments is the level of complexity. Type A assessments are “simplified assessments” and primarily use modeling to assess impacts with minimal field observation. 43 C.F.R. §11.40. So far, Type A procedures have only been promulgated for coastal or marine environments and Great Lake environments. See 43 C.F.R. §11.33(a). Type B assessments require more intensive field observation and a more rigorous assessment. The procedure for Type B assessments requires four steps: preassessment screen, injury determination, quantification, and damage determination. See 43 C.F.R. §11.60-11.84. The Onondaga Lake site is undergoing a Type B assessment.\nThe Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management Natural Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration Handbook notes that the NRDAR provisions of CERCLA and the CWA are based on three key principles:\n- Public natural resources are common property of all citizens. The federal and state governments and tribes act as trustees of these resources on behalf of the public.\n- The parties responsible for the hazardous substance release or oil spill are liable for the costs of restoring the injured resources and compensating the public for the public losses because of the release or spill until resource restoration is complete.\n- The trustees may use any damages recovered from responsible parties through the NRDAR process only to restore, replace, or acquire the equivalent resources for the public trust.\nId., at Section 1.2, Purpose of NRDAR.\nUpon completion of an NRDA conducted under CERCLA and the CWA, determinations or assessments of NRDs made by a trustee “shall have the force and effect of a rebuttable presumption on behalf of the trustee in any administrative or judicial proceeding.” 42 U.S.C. §9607(f)(2)(C) (applying the rebuttable presumption to both CERCLA and CWA NRD claims); 33 U.S.C. §2706(e)(2). These presumptions allow trustees to shift the burden of proof from the trustee onto the defendant who then has to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the assessment is invalid. Where NRD result from a discharge of a mixture of oil and hazardous substances, trustees must use the CERCLA and CWA regulations (43 C.F.R. Part 11) in order to obtain the rebuttable presumption. 15 C.F.R. §990.20(c).\nTrustee Actions to Date for the Onondaga Lake Site\nIn 1994 the State Trustee prepared an Onondaga Lake Preassessment Screen. It concluded that (1) a discharge of oil or hazardous substances had occurred; (2) natural resources had been or were likely to be adversely affected; (3) the quantity and concentration of released substances was sufficient to potentially cause injury; (4) there was sufficient data to pursue an assessment; and (5) response actions would not be sufficient to remedy the NRD injury. The following comprised the list of hazardous substances believed to have been released: mercury; chlorinated benzenes; polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX); ammonia; calcium and calcium salts; and other ionic wastes.\nThe 1996 State NRD Assessment Plan stated that the State trustee was asserting that “the natural resources in and around Onondaga Lake… have been injured by releases from Allied-Signal Inc. (Allied) of hazardous substances as defined under CERCLA and have created a public nuisance under New York State common law. In addition, the trustee asserts that releases of substances which are not defined as hazardous substances under CERCLA (referred to as non-hazardous substances in this plan) by Allied have also created a public nuisance under New York State common law.” See page xi of the Plan. “The boundaries of the study area generally include all areas in the vicinity of Onondaga Lake where Allied released hazardous and non-hazardous substances and all areas associated with the Onondaga Lake system where injuries to natural resources attributable to those releases have occurred.” Id.\nIn 2005 the USFWS prepared a Pre-Assessment Screen that reached the same five conclusions found in the 1994 State-conducted Pre-Assessment Screen. The Screen also concluded on pages 5 and 6 that:\nHazardous substances released to Onondaga Lake include, but are not limited to the following: mercury, PCBs, lead, cadmium, chromium, nickel, benzene, chlorinated benzenes, toluene, xylene, PAHs, and pesticides, including aldrin and dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT).\nMercury is the primary contaminant of concern regarding trust resources. It is found in sediments throughout the lake, generally in excess of 1 ppm in surface sediment, with higher concentrations found in the Ninemile Creek delta and in sediments in the southwestern portion of the lake in an area known as “in-lake waste deposit” (ILWD). The southwestern portion of the lake also contains some of the highest concentrations of other chemicals such as BTEX, PCBs, PAHs, dioxins, and furans.\nThe Trustees have engaged in natural resource injury studies, damage assessments, and restoration planning relating to the Site since 1991. In November 1996, the NYSDEC published its Onondaga Lake Natural Resource Damage Assessment Plan. In May 2009, the Trustees, the Onondaga Nation, and Honeywell entered into a Cooperative Assessment and Funding Agreement through by which Honeywell agreed to participate and provide funding for the performance of a cooperative natural resource assessment. In October 2012, the Trustees and the Onondaga Nation issued the Onondaga Lake Natural Resource Damage Assessment Plan Addendum. It is understood the on-going assessment has determined that sediment, fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals sustained ecological injuries from the hazardous substances releases at the Onondaga Lake site and a loss of recreational fishing trips lost as a result of the releases of hazardous substances at the Site.\nIt is anticipated the Trustees may release a draft Onondaga Lake Natural Resource Damage Assessment Restoration Plan and Environmental Assessment (“RP/EA”) for public comment in 2017. It is not yet known what the Restoration Plan will propose or what type of recovery the Trustee might secure.\nAn example of a recent NRD settlement is the accord reached between Alcoa, Inc and Reynolds Metals, Co. with the federal state and tribal Trustees for releases that took place in and around Massena, New York. The Trustees’ assessment determined that sediment, fish, birds, amphibians and mammals sustained ecological and remedial injuries and calculated an estimate of the number of fishing days lost as a result of those injuries. The settling parties in Massena agreed to reimburse approximately $1 million in past assessment costs; contribute $7.2 million for Joint Trustee sponsored Natural Resource Restoration Projects; pay $8.3 million for Tribal Cultural Restoration Projects; and purchase and donate two parcels of land to the state of New York to be incorporated into the Wilson Hill Wildlife Management Area.\nSolvay Process Works: syracusethenandnow.org']"	['<urn:uuid:81123083-272b-462c-9b3d-3fae897fe3a0>', '<urn:uuid:6fcec9b7-6ead-4079-9df7-4621cb718b3a>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	10	58	2440

These products are highly expensive. The CDRD introduced the first locally developed ballistic rubber of Sri Lanka with a local company (Microcells Pvt Ltd) proved to be sufficient to contain a directly fired high-velocity shot from a close range, such as 6 inches. With the improved elasticity and strength to absorb a higher number of shots using a synthetic and natural rubber mixture, the rubber product finally proved to be very economical during the final test firing while assuring maximum safety to the firers.\nThe first sets of ballistic rubber were installed at Commando Regiment Ganemulla (MILO Firing Range) and in the Underground firing range Vavunia.\nThis 40 feet indoor live firring range is designed for target practice purposes. The range is a pistol rated with a single firing lane. The basic concrete infrastructure had been completed by Special Forces a few years ago and was being abandoned. On the request of the Commander of the Army, CDRD undertook the task of completing the range. The project was handed over to Special Force in the year 2019.\nThe project involved designing of assault shields to protect from direct small arms fire. This was completed as a special request by the Special Forces during the post- Easter Attacks. The project was handed over to Special Force in the year 2019.\nIndexed as Ce-FRAD-2019, the pistol rated mobile live firing range is installed inside a 40 ft long shipping container and fully ballistic, protected with newly-developed ballistic rubber, that too has been manufactured and newly-developed by the same researcher.\nCDRD successfully managed to develop the first low-cost prototype for Rs 4.6 million, with all facilities, available in such units produced overseas. Ce-FRAD 2019 is considered as a significant outcome for the Sri Lankan military as it also built as a module to introduce the indoor live firing range concept for the Sri Lankan Military.\nCompleting another successful research project, the Defence Ministry’s Centre for Research and Development (CRD) introduced a new method for ‘Blue Gun’ production to Sri Lankan Tri-Services. This initiative minimises the damages caused to real weapons of high value while increasing their lifetime and ensuring the safety of trainees. CRD has fabricated replicas of Browning HP Pistol and an HK Gun for the purpose. Blue Guns are heavily used by the world’s professional militaries for weapon handling and training sessions without live rounds.\nCDRD Introduced the first Digital Close Quarter Combat Theatre (MILO Range) of Sri Lanka which could facilitate live-firing training sessions of Commandos and Special Forces.\nThis exceptionally-designed low-cost digital training theatre, equipped with live firing facility was specially designed for Commandos and Special Forces and operates on a digital platform similar to the MILO ranges in the US. The new system uses life size real videos running on surrounding digital screens to provide trainees real time feelings, combined with stress and ambiguity, instead of 3D objects, generally projected in traditional simulators.\nLive firing can be used in this way to train special operation soldiers and evaluate their performance under stress and different training scenarios, like shoot or no shoot, skill-building, decision-making, etc. The system also includes an instant feedback system which playbacks every episode for the trainees and instructors to see their performances in return for self-evaluation.\n“AK Bullet Trajectory Plotter”, use the dimensions of AK bullet holes produced in soft-skinned vehicles to estimate the trajectories of the fired bullets and proved to be effectively employed to identify the possible shooter direction, when it is unknown. The research outcome which saw the light after a series of scientific experiments was introduced as a reliable and novel method for the existing bullet trajectory reconstruction methods practised in the world. Due to the international significance of the findings to the field of Forensic Ballistics, the research outcomes have been published in the famed peer-reviewed journals in the world “Journal of Forensic Sciences” and “ Forensic Science International” published by the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, USA and Elsevier Publishers.\nThe new method was introduced and demonstrated for the Police and Military Police units of the Tri-services, at the Army Field Firing Range, PANALUWA.\nCustomized 2 x ballistic blankets were developed for the use of the Commander of the Army. This was a special request from the Sri Lanka Army. Ballistic blankets are used to protect VIPs travelling in soft-skinned vehicles. The project was handed over to Army Commander's Security Unit in 2019."", 'As seen in Night Stick the official publication for New Hampshire Police Association (Volume 77 Spring 2012 edition)\nAs your brain is your most important weapon, the effects of physical stress is often underappreciated for its effects on cognition for those who go into harms way, such military personnel, law enforcement, and other groups.\nIt’s been a generally held belief that cerebral blood flow (CBF) remains relatively steady during exercise, but recent studies (1,2) suggest that’s not the case. CBF appears to depend on a multitude of factors, including exercise intensity. With lower intensity steady state forms of exercise – all things being equal, such as hydration, etc, – CBF may increase, but during high intensity intermittent forms of exercise (like wrestling with another human being in a life or death struggle for example), appears to decrease. This may partially explain the cognitive decline people experience during high intensity exercise.\nThis information very much applies to law enforcement as it does for the military. Under psychological stress, demand for CBF increases, while supply may decrease, resulting in additional cognitive decline.\nIf a person has not experienced that cognitive decline under training conditions – and so has some experience and understanding of its effects – the results could prove fatal during a “real life” encounter.\nIf one has not experienced some job related stress training, they often find even simple directions difficult to follow during their first exposure to it. For example, simple directions regarding which targets to engage in which order, or other simple instructions, fail to happen…\nObviously, this will differ greatly with the persons experience, training, fitness, etc., but it’s well established that physical + psychological stress = decline in cognitive abilities and that’s old news for most and common sense.\nThe specific effects of stress, physical and psychological, on cognitive abilities is a large and growing topic of interest and research for the military and law enforcement.\nBasic take home: some form of stress training, where higher intensity, intermittent, training combined with firearms- hopefully following some job/task relevant movement patterns – will help best prepare those who are likely to face violent encounters that require an ability to function under physical and psychological stress simultaneously.\nAdditionally, such training will add to an ability to physically deal with the effects of stress and will improve overall fitness and general physical preparedness (GPP) of law enforcement and mil populations.\nMost people realize how physical and emotional stress will negatively impact performance, but few make the effort to utilize some form of stress training to help ‘inoculate’ the person to that stress, which could very well mean the difference between life and death in a highly stressful encounter not uncommon to law enforcement personnel.\nFor example, an article entitled “Assessment of Humans Experiencing Uncontrollable Stress: The SERE Course” by Dr. C.A. Morgan III and Major Gary Hazlett (3) goes into depth on the effects of stress on performance, and the importance of properly applied stress to help “inoculate” the individual to future stressors:\n“Physical and psychological stress are unavoidable in military operations, yet the negative effects of stress can make it difficult or impossible for individuals or teams to operate effectively. Stress is an essential element of warfare, and individual responses to combat-related stress have often been the determining factor between victory and defeat on the battlefield.”\n“Having recognized the effects of stress, the U.S. military designs its training scenarios to be both rigorous and realistic in their stress intensity. Rigorous training improves a person’s ability to perform on the battlefield, and exposure to realistic levels of stress can protect or “inoculate” a person from some of the negative effects of operational stress. The concept of stress inoculation is very much like the concept of preventing a particular disease through vaccination: When stress inoculation occurs, an individual’s performance will likely be better the next time he is stressed. Like immunization, which occurs only when the vaccine is given in the proper dosage, stress inoculation occurs only when the stress intensity is at the optimal level – high enough to activate a person’s psychological and biological systems, but low enough so as not to overwhelm them. If the stress level is not high enough, inoculation will not occur; if the stress level is too high, stress sensitization will occur, and the individual will probably perform less effectively when he is stressed again.”\nThe above is focused on the military specifically, but the same principles apply to other professions where a high level of physical and mental stress is likely to occur; such as law enforcement. The correct application of some form of practical job related stress training could pay long term dividends for the law enforcement community.\nHowever, it needs to be designed with the population in mind (patrol LEO vs. Tactical LEO, mil, etc), and correctly applied to that population. Some in the LE tactical community have found my Practical Applied Stress Training (P.A.S.T) is a tool in the tool box that can help there.\n(1) J Appl Physiol. 2009 Nov;107(5):1370-80.\nCerebral blood flow during exercise: mechanisms of regulation.\n(2) Sports Med. 2007;37(9):765-82.\nRegulation of cerebral blood flow during exercise.\n(3) 2000 Edition of the The Professional Bulletin of the John F.

51	clearing snow from roof vs chimney inspection signs and requirements	Roof snow clearing and chimney inspections both require safety precautions but have different warning signs and requirements. For roof clearing, you should use long-handled rakes when possible, secure ladders properly, avoid working alone, be aware of where snow will fall, avoid electrical wires, and consider hiring help if uncomfortable with heights. For chimneys, inspections are needed if you notice signs of chimney fires like loud popping sounds, rumbling noises, visible flames or thick smoke from the chimney even after the firebox fire is out. Chimney inspections are also required to check for creosote buildup, structural damage after fires, and to prevent carbon monoxide issues from blockages. Both maintenance tasks are essential for home safety but chimney issues pose more immediate danger requiring emergency response like evacuating and calling the fire department.	"['What are the signs of a chimney fire?\nSome chimney fires will go unnoticed by homeowners and will extinguish themselves after a few seconds or minutes. Other more noticeable fires usually have a popping sound like you would hear with wood burning in a fireplace, only much louder. Additionally, there have been reports of a low, rumbling sound emitting from the chimney during fires. Visually, you may be able to see flames or thick smoke being emitted from your chimney even after the fire in the firebox has already been extinguished. Regardless of which characteristics of a chimney fire become apparent the best course of action to take is to immediately get out of the house and call the fire department. If you can do so safely, it is also a good idea to start spraying down the roof of your home with a garden hose to keep the fire from spreading. After the fire has been completely extinguished it is important to get a chimney inspection as soon as possible to determine if there is any structural damage or to clean out any creosote that may still be left after the fire.\nWhat are the signs of excess Carbon Monoxide?\nCarbon monoxide is a colorless and odorless gas that is the by product of incomplete combustion. Regardless of whether the fuel being burned is wood, natural gas or oil, carbon monoxide can be a serious threat to the occupants of a home. Becuase carbon monoxide cannot be detected by a person until symptoms of poisoning start to set in, the gas can quickly build up in a house without the residents even realizing it. Mild carbon monoxide poisoning symptoms often resemble the flu and could be overlooked as a result. Acute carbon monoxide poisoning will lead too dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting and death within about three minutes to two hours, depending on the levels. The best defense against carbon monoxide poisoning is a carbon monoxide detector and a chimney inspection to investigate any blockage that may be stopping the proper flow of gases from a home.\nMy chimney smells bad, especially in the summer after it rains. Why?\nChimney odors in the spring and summer months are aggravated by the increased heat and humidity associated with this time of year, specifically just after a rain storm. An odor coming from your chimney typically is either a dead animal or an excess build up of creosote. Regardless of which one it is you should get your chimney inspected as soon as possible in order to identify the odor and eliminate the problem. If the problem is creosote a chimney cleaning may not get rid of the odor entirely. When creosote forms it will absorb into the masonry of the fireplace and is difficult to get out at that point. The next best alternative to eliminating odor in a chimney is to stop it before it comes into your house. A damper located at the throat of the fireplace is an effective impediment to air flowing from a chimney into the rest of a home.', ""Nassau County Executive Edward P. Mangano today announced that the Nassau County Department of Public Works (DPW) is pretreating roadways with brine to prevent black ice from forming over the next 24 hours as light snow enters the region.\n“Nassau County is helping ensure residents have a safe commute by brining main County roadways, bridges and overpasses to prevent black ice,” said County Executive Mangano.\nNassau County DPW has 23,700 tons of road salt and 2,370 tons of road sand on hand. DPW’s snowfighting fleet includes 115 plow/salt trucks, 20 pick-ups with plows and sanders, 10 payloaders and 3 brine trucks that cover 2,000 lane miles throughout the County. With the assistance of GPS, DPW supervisors monitor snowplows to determine when plows are down and where trucks are operating in order to ensure we are working at full capacity to make the roads safer for our residents as quickly and efficiently as possible, while also safeguarding the safety of our snowfighting crew.\nWith winter weather conditions upon us, County Executive Mangano encourages residents to begin preparing for the cold, snow and ice. To help ensure a safe winter season, Nassau County offers the following checklist:\nProperty Owners:1. Do not plow snow across the road or shovel snow from your driveway onto shoulders or roadways.2. Do not pile snow high near intersections or driveways obstructing others’ vision; Park vehicles away from the road and follow local parking ordinances related to snow removal.3. Keep rocks, timbers, fences, basketball hoops, garbage bins, reflectors and other items away from the road.4. Keep areas around mailboxes clear in order to assist in safe mail delivery and to help prevent damage to mailboxes.5. Maintaining the end of your driveway could decrease chances of getting plowed in, or having your mailbox damaged. 6. Keep sidewalks and pathways clear for pedestrians.\nChildren: 1. Never build snow forts, make tunnels, or play in ditches or snow banks by the road.2. Stay away from the edge of the roadway as you wait for the school bus, get the mail, or watch the snow plow.3. Stay away from the end of a driveway when a snow plow is approaching.4. Keep sleds and toys away from the roadways at all times.5. Remember, the plow driver can’t always see you.\nDrivers:Drivers should use extra precautions on the roads this winter season, especially when driving near trucks that are plowing and salting.\n1. Always wear your seatbelt and allow extra time to reach your destination.2. Do your best to minimize distractions so your focus can be on driving. 3. Don’t attempt to pass a snow plow vehicle while they are plowing.4. NEVER attempt to pass a snow plow on the right. Many plows are equipped with wings that weigh as much as a small compact car.5. Plows can suddenly move sideways from hitting drifts or by cutting through packed snow. 6. Plow drivers have limited visibility and they cannot see directly behind their trucks.7. Avoid sudden starts, stops and turns. Accelerate carefully so car wheels don't spin.8. Improve visibility by clearing all snow and ice from the entire car – hood, roof, trunk, turn signals, tail lights, headlights, windows, mirrors and fender wells. 9. Driving with headlights on low-beam provides better road illumination in snow and fog than using high-beams.\nFamily Disaster Plan:Families should be prepared for all hazards that affect their area and themselves. Follow these basic steps to develop a family disaster plan:\n1. Learn your community’s warning signals.2. Meet with your family to create a plan. Pick two places to meet: a spot outside your home for an emergency such as fire, and a place away from your neighborhood in case you cannot return home (a real possibility during the day when adults are at work and children are at school). Choose an out-of-area friend as your family check-in contact for everyone to call if the family becomes separated.3. Implement your plan. Post emergency telephone numbers by the phones. Install safety features in your house such as smoke detectors and fire extinguishers. 4. Inspect your home for potential hazards and correct them. 5. Have your family learn basic safety and first aid measures. Make sure everyone knows how and when to call 9-1-1 or your local emergency medical services phone number. 6. Have disaster supplies on hand.\nHome Emergency Supplies:Winter has arrived and you should stockpile the following supplies in the event a winter storm or power outage prevents you from leaving your home.\n1. Flashlights and extra batteries. 2. Battery-operated radio and extra batteries. 3. Emergency non-perishable foods that do not require refrigeration. 4. Non-electric can opener. 5. Bottled water. 6. One week supply of essential medicines. 7. Extra blankets and sleeping bags. 8. First aid kit and manual. 9. Fire extinguisher. 10. Emergency heating equipment, used properly.\nWinterize Your Home:Take the time now to get your home ready for the winter season by following these tips:\n1. Have your heating system checked by a professional annually. This will ensure that your system is working safely and efficiently which, in turn, will save you money. If you heat by wood, clean your fireplace or stove. Have your chimney flue checked for any buildup of creosote and then cleaned to lessen the risk of fire. 2. Make sure your home is properly insulated. If necessary, insulate walls and attic. This will help you to conserve energy and reduce your homes power demands for heat. 3. Caulk and weather-strip doors and windowsills to keep cold air out. 4. Install storm windows or cover windows with plastic from the inside. This will provide an extra layer of insulation, keeping more cold air out. 5. Inspect and flush your water heater. 6. Clean gutters. Leaves and other debris will hamper drainage. 7. Replace batteries of smoke, heat and carbon monoxide detectors. If you did not do it when you set the clocks back, do it now.\nClearing Your Roof:As the snow and ice continues to build up, homeowners should think about safety before trying to clear the snow from their roof. Clearing roofs is a dangerous task. However, if you think safety, and work safely, you will get the job done. Here are some safety tips:\n1. When possible, use long-handled snow rakes or poles. 2. If you must use a ladder, make certain that the base is securely anchored. Ask a friend, neighbor or adult family member to hold the ladder while you climb. 3. Know where the snow is going to fall before clearing the area. 4. Make certain not to contact electrical wires. 5. If possible, do not attempt to clear the roof alone. 6. If you are afraid of heights or think the job is too big for you, HIRE HELP.\nProtecting Water Pipes:To prevent the mess and aggravation of frozen water pipes, protect your home, apartment or business by following the simple steps below.\nTo keep pipes from freezing: 1. Wrap pipes in insulation or layers of old newspapers 2. Cover the newspapers with plastic to keep out moisture 3. Let faucets drip a little to avoid freezing 4. Know how to shut off water valves\nBefore Cold Weather:1. Locate and insulate pipes most susceptible to freezing, typically those near outer walls, in crawl spaces or in the attic. 2. Wrap pipes with heat tape (UL approved). 3. Seal any leaks that allow cold air inside where pipes are located. 4. Disconnect garden hoses and shut off and drain water from pipes leading to outside faucets. This reduces the chance of freezing in the short span of pipe just inside the house.\nWhen It's Cold:1. Let hot and cold water trickle at night from a faucet on an outside wall. 2. Open cabinet doors to allow more heat to get to un-insulated pipes under a sink or appliance near an outer wall. 3. Make sure heat is left on and set no lower than 55 degrees. 4. If you plan to be away: (1) Have someone check your house daily to make sure the heat is still on to prevent freezing, or (2) drain and shut off the water system (except indoor sprinkler systems).\nIf Pipes Freeze:1. Make sure you and your family knows how to shut off the water, in case pipes burst. Stopping the water flow minimizes the damage to your home. Call a plumber and contact your insurance agent. 2. Never try to thaw a pipe with an open flame or torch. 3. Always be careful of the potential for electric shock in and around standing water.\nStaying Warm Indoors:If heat goes out during a winter storm, you can keep warm by closing off rooms you do not need. Losing your heat when winters winds are howling is not pleasant. However, by following these simple tips, you will weather the storm more comfortably.1. 2. Use only safe sources of alternative heat such as a fireplace, small well-vented wood or coal stove or portable space heaters. Always follow manufacturer’s instructions. 3. Dress in layers of lightweight clothing and wear a cap. 4. Eat well-balanced meals.\nIf The Lights Go Out:If you lose electrical service during the winter, follow these tips:\n1. Call your utility provider first to determine area repair schedules. Turn off or unplug lights and appliances to prevent a circuit overload when service is restored. Leave one light on to indicate power has been restored. 2. To help prevent freezing pipes, turn on faucets slightly. Running water will not freeze as quickly. 3. Protect yourself from carbon monoxide poisoning: o DO NOT operate generators indoors; the motor emits deadly carbon monoxide gas. o DO NOT use charcoal to cook indoors. It, too, can cause a buildup of carbon monoxide gas. o DO NOT use your gas oven to heat your home -- prolonged use of an open oven in a closed house can create carbon monoxide gas. o Make sure fuel space heaters are used with proper ventilation. 4. Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to help reduce food spoilage.\nGenerator Safety:Electric generators can provide you with piece of mind and convenience when you are faced with a temporary loss of electric service. Follow these safety guidelines when operating a generator:\n1. Before installing a generator, be sure to properly disconnect from your utility electrical service. If possible, have your generator installed by a qualified electrician. 2. Run generators outside, downwind of structures. NEVER run a generator indoors. Deadly carbon monoxide gas from the generators exhaust can spread throughout enclosed spaces. Install a carbon monoxide detector. 3. Fuel spilled on a hot generator can cause an explosion. If your generator has a detachable fuel tank remove it before refilling. If this is not possible, shut off the generator and let it cool before refilling. 4. Do not exceed the rated capacity of your generator. Most of the small, home-use portable generators produce from 350 to 12,000 watts of power. Overloading your generator can damage it, the appliances connected to it, and may cause a fire. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions. 5. Keep children away from generators at all times.\nFire Safety:Wood-burning stoves, fireplaces and heaters can add a cozy glow, but make sure you are using them safely.\n1. Always keep a screen around an open flame.2. Never use gasoline to start your fireplace.3. Never burn charcoal indoors.4. Do not close the damper when ashes are hot.5. When using alternative heat sources such as a fireplace, woodstove, etc. always make sure you have proper ventilation. Keep curtains, towels and potholders away from hot surfaces.6. Have your chimney checked before the season for creosote buildup -- and then clean it.7. Have a fire extinguisher and smoke detectors and make sure they work! Establish a well-planned escape route with the entire family.\nFireplaces:1. Keep the area around the hearth clear of debris, decorations and flammable materials. 2. Leave the glass fireplace doors open while you are burning a fire. Close the doors when the fire is out. 3. Always use a mesh screen with fireplaces that do not have glass doors. 4. Do not use excessive amounts of paper when lighting a fire. 5. Avoid using liquid fire starter or other flammable liquids to start a fire.\nKerosene Heaters:If you use kerosene heaters to supplement your regular heating fuel, or as an emergency source of heat, follow these safety tips:\n1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions. 2. Use only the correct fuel for your unit. 3. Refuel outdoors ONLY and only when the unit is cool. 4. Keep the heater at least three feet away from furniture and other flammable objects. 5. When using the heater, use fire safeguards and ventilate properly.\nCarbon Monoxide Poisoning:Carbon monoxide poisoning is a silent, deadly killer claiming about 1,000 lives each year in the United States. Such common items as automotive exhaust, home heating systems and obstructed chimneys can produce the colorless, odorless gas. The gas can also be produced by poorly vented generators, kerosene heaters, gas grills and other items used for cooking and heating when used improperly during the winter months.\n1. NEVER run generators indoors. Open a window slightly when using a kerosene heater.2. NEVER use charcoal to cook indoors.3. NEVER use a gas oven to heat your home.\nSymptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include sleepiness, headaches and dizziness. If you suspect carbon monoxide poisoning, ventilate the area and get to a hospital.""]"	['<urn:uuid:98ba6220-a5aa-4189-bb33-7e731e37cbc7>', '<urn:uuid:af6ee56f-6928-45cd-a363-36d45caaa314>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	10	131	2741
52	what minerals important weanling horses bone development daily requirements	Weanlings need an ample supply of minerals, with particular emphasis on those essential for bone development, including calcium, phosphorous, zinc, and copper. However, it's crucial to avoid both under and over-supplementation of these minerals, as either extreme can lead to developmental orthopedic diseases. Due to the complexity of mineral requirements, it's recommended to work with a veterinarian or equine nutritionist to ensure proper mineral intake levels.	['Five Tips For Feeding Weanlings\nYoung P.R.E. horses are considered weanlings from the time they’re separated from their mothers until one year of age. This is a critical time in the young horse’s life, and nutrition plays an important part. Here are five important points to consider when feeding a weanling:\n1. Nutritional Needs\nFrom the time foals are weaned to the time they turn one, the young horse is considered to be on the highest nutritional plane of its life. Weanlings consume approximately 3 % of their body weight in dry matter per day. Key components in the weanling’s diet include:\nEnergy—Weanlings need energy to support their growth and development. Weanlings that consume too much energy will grow too fast, while too little energy will slow their growth. Both scenarios can put weanlings at risk for developmental orthopedic disorders. Consult a veterinarian or equine nutritionist if questions arise on determining the ideal amount of energy for each weanling.\nProtein—High-quality protein is essential for muscle, ligament, and tissue development, so ensuring your weanling consumes adequate amounts of protein each day is crucial. The following equation can be used to determine a growing horse’s protein requirement: Crude protein (or CP) requirement in grams = (body weight in kilograms x 1.44) + ((average daily gain x 0.2) / E) / 0.79. In the equation, 1.44 stands for the number of grams per kilogram of body weight needed, and E (the efficiency of use of dietary protein) is estimated as 50%, so plug .5 in for that. Most young horses that should mature to around 1,100 pounds will need about 675g of protein per day when they’re around 6 months old.\nResearch has shown that diets low in two essential amino acids, lysine and threonine, will slow growth rate and decrease feed efficiency in young, growing horses. Lysine should account for a just over 4% of the weanlings total protein requirement, and although evidence seems to point to threonine possibly being important for growth, the National Research Council hasn’t set a dietary requirement. Still, it’s important to ensure weanlings’ feed contains a quality source protein, including adequate amounts of lysine and threonine.\nMinerals—Weanlings need an ample supply of minerals, especially those needed for bone development (including calcium, phosphorous, zinc, and copper), are necessary for growth. However, under or over-supplementation must be avoided to prevent developmental orthopedic diseases. It’s advisable to work with a veterinarian or equine nutritionist to ensure weanlings’ mineral needs are being met.\n2. Treat Each Horse Individually: Regardless of sex, each weanling should be individually monitored and fed according to their needs. Feeding each young horse on an individual basis will not only allow you to keep your feeding costs as low as possible, but also create the best nutritional plan for each animal.\n3. Stress and Decreased Feed Intake: Weaning is an extremely stressful time for young horses. This stress is usually accompanied by a decrease in daily intake of food and slowed growth. Therefore, it is ideal that a high-quality diet, both hay and grain, be provided after weaning. Creep feeding prior to weaning will also help the transition period so that growth and development is not detrimentally affected.\n4. Exercise: Research has shown that weanlings benefit from free exercise or turn out. Scientists believe exercise helps to regulate bone and muscle growth, so allow young horses ample turnout opportunities.\n5. Record Keeping: To reduce the risk of developmental orthopedic diseases due to rapid fluctuations in growth rate that commonly occur at weaning or during other times of stress, a variety of measurements can be taken from birth. Average daily gain, wither height, and hip height are common measures of growth rates in young horses. By monitoring these on a weekly basis, changes can be made in the diet accordingly to maintain a level plane of growth.\nTake Home Message\nWeaning is an important time in a young horse’s life because of the increased needs for energy, protein, and minerals. Feed each weanling individually to monitor his or her proper growth and development during this critical time, and provide exercise or turnout daily to help regulate growth.\nKristen M.

53	Being interested in the historical development of geology, I'd like to understand how John Ferry's research environment compares to Florence Bascom's in terms of institutional access and recognition - what were the different challenges or opportunities they faced in their careers?	Their careers reflect different institutional environments and challenges. John Ferry worked in a supportive academic environment where he could freely conduct extensive field studies across multiple locations, collaborate with numerous colleagues, and receive recognition for his work, as evidenced by the Distinguished Geologic Career Award. In contrast, Florence Bascom faced significant gender-based barriers in academia, notably being one of the first female geologists in the United States and only the second woman to earn a Ph.D. in geology in the country. Despite these challenges, she persevered and achieved recognition from her fellow scientists as one of the nation's most important geologists, establishing herself at Bryn Mawr College where she built a successful career teaching and conducting research.	"['John M. Ferry\n2011 Distinguished Geologic Career Award (MGPV Division)\nPresented to John M. Ferry\nCitation by Sarah C. Penniston-Dorland\nJohn Ferry is a man of extraordinary intellect who has made significant contributions to the understanding of the role of fluids during metamorphism. Because of his work, metamorphic petrology now operates in an intellectual environment that links metamorphism to global change, volcanism, ore genesis and plate deformation. John recognized and characterized infiltration-driven reactions and the associated alteration of the chemical and isotopic compositions of rocks to quantitatively assess the amount and chemistry of fluid involved in metamorphic reactions. More than two decades ago, John recognized that the paradigm of static thermodynamic phase equilibria used in understanding metamorphism had been “squeezed dry” of new insights. He sought to transcend the limitations imposed by the time-invariant aspect of equilibrium models, and, throughout his career, has led metamorphic petrologists from a static towards a dynamic view of metamorphism.\nFrom his earliest contributions John’s work has made significant impacts on the field of metamorphic petrology. His most-cited work is an experimental calibration of Fe-Mg partitioning between biotite and garnet (Ferry and Spear, 1978), which is still a widely used geothermometer (1,206 citations as of this writing!). John has coauthored ten other papers that have over 100 citations, most of which quantify the composition and amount of fluid required for the progress of metamorphic reactions.\nJohn’s work has always been field-based, and includes all types of metamorphic environments—from his studies of regional metamorphism in Maine and Vermont, to studies of hydrothermal alteration on the Isle of Skye and in the Dolomites, to numerous studies of contact metamorphism including Notch Peak, Bergell, Monzoni, Predazzo, Onawa, Ballachulish, Beinn an Dubhaich, Ritter Range, and Mt. Morrison.\nJohn uses a multidisciplinary approach to his research. He integrates field-based studies, quantitative modeling of heat and mass transfer during fluid-rock interactions, application of thermodynamic analysis and experimental determinations of mineral-mineral and mineral-fluid equilibria. His analytical techniques include detailed three-dimensional field mapping of fluid flow pathways, petrology and thermobarometry, major and trace element analysis by electron microprobe and LA-ICP-MS, calculations of reaction progress, and measurement of stable isotopic compositions (both in bulk and in individual minerals) through both traditional and clumped isotope thermometry.\nWhat is it that makes John’s work so compelling? John has a deep commitment to understand the rocks as they are. His is the sort of integrity that looks to the rocks to suggest working hypotheses for testing with measured data. Throughout his career, John’s meticulous analytical protocols have solidly undergirded the once-extremely controversial conclusions he has drawn about the flux of fluids through metamorphic rocks and the time-scales for fluid-rock interactions in both pluton-related and regional metamorphic settings. No modern petrologist can ignore the implications of fluid fluxes during metamorphic processes, and this view can be traced to John’s elegant work.\nWe are pleased that the Division of Mineralogy, Geochemistry, Petrology and Volcanology has recognized John for his decades of leading metamorphic petrologists towards active consideration of the flow of fluids, matter and heat during metamorphism through the awarding of its Distinguished Geologic Career Award. Congratulations, John!\nThank you, Sarah, for your generous citation and my other students who wrote letters of support.\nI’m proud to receive this award for two reasons. First, GSA has been my most important meeting of the year because it has a focus on continental crust petrology. The greatest honor is to be recognized by the group whose work means the most to me.\nSecond, the award specifically recognizes field studies. Members of the MGPV Division need little persuasion of the importance of fieldwork. One reason is that you go out in the field expecting to find one thing and make an unimaginable discovery of something else even more significant. A favorite example is Louis Alvarez’s suggesting that iridium concentration might record sedimentation rate in a stratigraphic sequence Walter was studying at Gubbio, Italy. A similar, although less momentous, surprise brought me here. When I began graduate school in 1971, one of the hottest research subjects in mineralogy and petrology was subsolidus phase relations among plagioclase feldspars. Five years before, the peristerite gap was determined from feldspar compositions in metamorphic rocks. My first summer of fieldwork was to look for analogous miscibility gaps in more calcic plagioclases in metacarbonate rocks along a gradient from chlorite to sillimanite zones in Maine. Plagioclase compositions in the rocks proved bafflingly complicated, so I switched my attention to the petrology of the carbonate rocks themselves. This led to my first ideas about infiltration of rocks during metamorphism.\nEven more importantly, however, fieldwork is the enterprise of mapping spatial patterns of countless different features in nature. It’s these patterns, obtainable by no other means, that tell us how the Earth works. In my case, mapping the spatial distributions of mineral assemblages in metamorphic terrains at a range of scales revealed the existence, size, and fundamental properties of fossil fluid flow systems.\nMy field studies have been possible only in areas where stratigraphy, structure, and age relations are already worked out. Accordingly, my heroes among field geologists are those who do this. Many have shared their time and knowledge both in and out of the field getting me started at new locations, including Phil Osberg and Doug Rumble in New England; George Dunne, Cal Stevens, Rich Schweickert, and especially Sorena Sorensen in the Sierra Nevada; Dave Pattison and Ben Harte in Scotland; Bernard Evans and the late Volkmar Trommsdorff in Switzerland; and Lawrie Hardie and Nereo Preto in Italy. Three people made pivotal contributions to my intellectual development. My Ph.D. advisor, Jim Thompson, grounded me in thermodynamics and phase equilibria. When I was 46, my postdoc advisor, Doug Rumble, took me on in his laboratory as an apprentice stable isotope geochemist. Lukas Baumgartner first tuned me into transport theory. My students have expanded my horizons by involving me in field problems I would not have explored otherwise, by developing theory and numerical simulations beyond my abilities, and by pointing out my earlier ideas that needed revision. Many people thus share in this award, and I thank them all.', ""Florence Bascom, geologist, holding a compass\nFlorence Bascom Papers, Sophia Smith Collection, Women's History Archives at Smith College\nFlorence Bascom was one of the first female geologists in the United States and her fellow scientists thought she was one of the nationís most important geologists.

54	outdoor firepit fuel choices safety precautions	For fuel choices, seasoned hardwoods like hickory and oak are the best burning options. Avoid plywood or composite woods as they can release toxic fumes, and pine and cedar are not recommended as they can 'pop' or shoot sparks. Never use gas or lighter fluid to start the fire - instead, use small sticks, crumbled paper, or fire starter packs. For safety, always start with a small fire and build it up gradually. The fire should be properly extinguished when finished, following manufacturer's recommendations, and making sure the wood or coals are completely soaked and no longer smoking. It's important to check weather conditions and avoid lighting fires during very windy conditions.	['There’s nothing better than cozying up to a warm fire on a cool fall night. This is especially, true when you can do so in the comfort of your own backyard. For many, having a fire pit means spending time with family, friends and (hopefully) indulging in some S’mores.\nHow to get started?\nBefore you get to the relaxing around the fire pit stage, you need to figure out what type of fire pit you want and where it works best in your yard. Here are some tips to get you started on the installation process:\n- Is this going to be a portable or permanent fire pit?\nThe portable option offers convenience. You can move it to fit different entertainment situations, but might take up valuable space in your garage or yard when it’s not in use. With the permanent option, your fire pit can act as a statement piece because it gives you creative room to design. It could also be a great DIY project. Planning a fire pit can be simple and fun for all family members to participate. Check out these tips from DIY Network about how to install your own fire pit.\n- How much are you willing to spend?\nPrice will depend on the size and scope of the pit, if you‘re building or buying, and the materials used. Watch for price markdowns and end of summer sales.\n- Pick the location\nChoose a spot that is far from any combustibles such as brush, shrubs, plants and low- hanging branches. Also, be mindful of patio roofs. You want to place the pit at least 25 feet away from any structure. Make sure the fire pit area is flat and level.\n- Do your researchIf you’re looking to buy, fire pits can be found at almost all major retailers. Some styles are bowls, chimineas and tables that offer plenty of burning options – wood, propane, gel fuel and natural gas. If you’re making this a DIY project, research steps on how to begin and for guidance throughout the process. A simple Google search can be enough to find the perfect pit for you. For more inspiration, take a look at these designs from HGTV. There can be restrictions and codes on fire pits depending on where you live, so check with local city and county authorities first.\nLet’s Review Some Fire Pit Safety\n- Always place fire pits on a non-flammable surface (patio, blocks, concrete) and Never put a fire pit directly on grass. Always keep your fire pit outdoors – never inside the house or garage.\n- Keep the fire small.\n- Check the forecast and avoid windy conditions.\n- Keep area around fire pit clean by picking up leaves or any other combustible materials.\n- Keep water or a garden hose nearby.\n- Learn your wood! Plywood or composite woods can release toxic fumes. Pine and cedar are soft woods that can “pop” or shoot sparks. Hickory, oak, and other seasoned hardwoods are your best burning option.\n- Never light the fire with gas or lighter fluid. Use small sticks, crumbled up pieces of paper, or buy fire starter packs.\n- When you are done with the fire for the night, be sure to douse properly or turn off any burners. The U.S. Fire Administration states that 16 percent of outdoor fires are attributed to hot or smoldering objects, such as hot embers or ash. Keep an eye on the extinguished fire until the embers stop steaming.\nThere are plenty of options and factors to take into consideration when getting a fire pit for your yard. This can be a fun project that makes summer nights last longer. Fire pits are not only attractive, but also functional in providing entertainment and heat, plus you can cook snacks on. Now you can become the envy of the neighborhood with a new fire pit!\nMake sure your time around the fire is as relaxing as possible. It’s good to check in with your ERIE agent to determine the proper coverage for your home, and everything inside (and outside) of it.', 'Fire Pit Glass Pebbles – An outdoor fire bowl would have been a great addition for a backyard, patio or even for a campsite. They might be utilized to make you stay warm on cool evenings, or grilling, however, you would be wise to keep in mind that fire pits are fundamentally open fires. They may therefore be susceptible to regulation plus present a hearth hazard.\nBefore even installing any form of open fire device, ensure you check the local regulations. Some areas, and also entire cities, prohibit their use and resultant fines might be large. Do not purchase a fire bowl before you are sure you can use it as you might well be costing you money. Having established that you have no legal barriers, below are great tips on having an outdoor fire bowl safely, and getting the very best use as a result.\n1. Read the Manual, Make sure you browse the manual from cover to hide. Follow the instructions provided exactly, and if there’s anything you are unsure about contact the maker. There is usually a customer satisfaction number or email inside the manual. This is of particular importance if this is a fire bowl.\n2. Locate the Fire Pit Safely, Locate the fire bowl far from flammable objects – as an example, well far from trees and shrubbery. It would be handy to experience a way to obtain water close by in case there is emergency, such as a tap or even a hearth bucket. A fire extinguisher would also be sensible. It should also be located on an amount surface – you wouldn’t like any children tripping and falling to the flame. The prevailing wind direction might also be relevant, as you will not want the smoke and sparks blowing into the house or even giving you or perhaps your visitors. Sometimes it is not avoided, although you could construct a windbreak. Also avoid enclosed areas where smoke inhalation along with other fumes might be a problem.\n3. Fuel Source, Some people prefer gas outdoor fire pits, although a lot of select the ‘outdoor experience’ of solid fuel. A common fuel is seasoned hardwood. Green wood tends to spark a whole lot and build smoke, and soft woods such as conifers burn well, but tend to also generate excessive sparks. Store your wood well far from the flame. As with barbecues, be cautious when utilizing gasoline or other accelerant to start the hearth – plus its strongly suggested that you do not make use of them in any respect. Firelighters are better and some use paper and kindling to get it going although these can generate smoke.\n4. Operating Safety Tips, Start off with a reasonably small fire, and gradually assemble it up. Never begin too large or the hearth may get out of control. Do not pour accelerants directly onto a burning fire since the resultant flare-up might cause burns. Always keep track of the elements because sudden gusts of high winds might cause a hearth to get out of control rapidly. Never light an empty fire in very windy conditions, although you may still find it protected inside a bowl. Also, remember that, during prolonged periods of dry weather, surrounding woodland and foliage could become very dry and ignite with obviously any good small spark. Make sure you dampen any foliage around your fire bowl before lighting it whilst a good supply of water close by in the event.\n5. Extinguishing an Outdoor Fire Properly, Make sure that your fire is completely extinguished when you have finished. Do not allow die out on its own, but check the manufacturer’s recommendations. If necessary use a hearth extinguisher or water, making certain the wood or coals have been soaked and are no more smoking. Some form of lid should be utilized to make sure that the hearth can’t relight itself and acquire out of control. Store the used wood or coals in an ash bucket in lieu of adding for a woodpile or coal-house.\nThere a wide range of several types of outdoor fire bowl available, plus some beautiful outdoors furniture designed particularly for fire pits. Some firms even offer gas or wood burning fire pits plus a furniture set to set around them. Some teams of outdoor furniture add a table, coming with the tabletop pit, the tables plus a list of four beautifully upholstered chairs. The tables and pits are durable and weather-proof, and also the seats are fire-resistant understandably.\nOutdoor fire pits might be a whole lot of fun and the ones love sitting around them talking and drinking. However, don’t drink excessive once your fire is lit because alcohol is probably the significant reasons of outdoor fire bowl accidents. You don’t have to abstain completely, but somebody should be in control to make certain there’s no fooling around near the fire bowl by those that do over-imbibe.']	['<urn:uuid:da51bf3d-65c8-4b74-b267-82748d99f7d4>', '<urn:uuid:9d422a2c-48af-48bf-af0b-54f3911bf024>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	6	112	1502

It has been designed for fast heating and finds applications in the glass, electrical power, automotive and material processing industries.\nThe Pegasus-T is the latest member of the Pegasus family developed for sensors that are simply too short to be calibrated in the Pegasus 4853 or other conventional calibration furnaces.\nThe advanced control system allows the user to select optimal performance for sensors immersed at 25mm, 35mm or 50mm with three independent control loops. It also has built in over-temperature protection to protect the heater wire from over temperature thus increasing life expectancy.\nCalibration engineers understand that to get the best accuracy temperature sensors should be immersed deeply into a calibration bath or furnace and compared to a reference thermometer.\nCalibrate Short Sensors\nBut how to calibrate very short sensors such as those used in the automotive industry? These sensors are too short to go into conventional furnaces. The Isotech Pegasus Model 4853 has an immersion depth of 130mm which will suit many sensors but what if the sensor is very short, 25mm to 50mm? Large furnaces are unsuitable and calibrating these types of device provides a significant measurement challenge.\nDynamic Heating Zone\nThe new Pegasus-T has been developed for this very challenge and features a dynamic heating zone for short immersion probes providing a calibration source for sensors that are too short for other furnaces. It is being trialled and adopted at a number of customer sites in Europe and Asia and is now released for general sale.\nPegasus-T allows you to choose an internal control sensor at the same depth the sensors under test, selecting from three internal noble metal control sensors or using an external control sensor placed at the same depth as the sensor under test.\n1: Dynamic Heating Zone\nChoose one of three internal thermocouples to optimize performance for different length sensors.\n2: Control From External Sensor\nSwitch from the internal control sensor to an external Type R thermocouple that can be placed alongside the test sensor.\n3: Independent Reference Channel\nType R thermocouple input, can be used for external control or with a reference probe for an independent temperature measuring loop, option for UKAS calibration.\nThe operating life of the heater will vary with both the maximum operating temperature and the duty cycle. Units being used 24/7 at high temperatures may require a maintenance schedule for heater replacement\nWith short immersion probes there can be large errors as the sensor cannot be immersed deeply enough to allow it to reach the same temperature as the calibration block and there is a temperature gradient at the edge of the block. Tests show that the Pegasus-T is more useful than alternatives but there will always be a need to experiment and evaluate to determine the uncertainty for the conditions of use. It can be helpful to use a reference sensor of the same type as the units under test.

56	erlang program features malware protection	Erlang and Elixir offer powerful features like distributed programming capabilities, high availability, and the ability to handle thousands of concurrent connections. The platform leverages 30 years of development and includes security-related aspects like SSL module usage and VM hardening against DoS attacks. However, these systems still need protection against malware threats like process injection, which can hide malicious code within legitimate processes. Prevention requires multiple security measures including access control, antimalware software, SIEM tools, and intrusion prevention systems to detect and block common process injection behaviors.	"['This talk discusses the high availability challenge, an important property when building a system that needs to provide the service continuously. Based on my own experience in building an Erlang/Elixir powered system that constantly pushes the fast changing data to a few thousand of connected users, I will provide a high-level overview on how Erlang can help us implement continuously running systems, and back this theory with some real life examples. This is an introductory talk that targets mostly people new to Elixir and Erlang, aiming to explain why and how Elixir/Erlang can be beneficial. The talk is language agnostic with the focus on Erlang virtual machine rather than a particular BEAM oriented language. After the presentation, the audience should have a better insight on how highly available systems can be implemented, and how Elixir/Erlang can help in achieving that goal.\nEvercam connects to thousands of IP cameras, pulling streams and/or jpegs. We first built the project using .NET and at a certain point we decided to rebuild on OSS. The main project was well suited to Ruby but the camera connections could not scale so we rebuilt that part to Node. Right now we\'re just about to embark on re-architecting to make use of Elixir and would be happy to share our experiences and learning with the Elixir community.\n- People considering Elixir or interested in hearing how it compared in a real project to other languages.\nOne of Elixir\'s greatest strength are macros, and everybody knows that. However, macros are just one way to access a powerful and magical land: the compile time™.\nIn the last few months, I\'ve been working on a gettext implementation for Elixir (under the direction of José). This library does most of its work at compile time.\nIn this talk, we\'ll have a look at what crazy things you can do at compile time as well as some examples of taking advantage of compile time in the wild (and in Elixir itself). We\'ll see how moving things from the runtime to the compile time has huge benefits in terms of performance, without sacrificing clarity and expressiveness. We\'ll dive into Gettext\'s source code as the main example of this.\nThis talk will quickly introduce Ecto for unfamiliar audience members. Ecto recently underwent some major changes with improvements from the lessons learnt after it was first created almost two years ago. Eric will talk about some of the design choices made in Ecto and what sets it apart from traditional ORMs.\nElixir developers interested in Ecto\nPhoenix is an Elixir web framework for building productive, reliable applications with the performance to take on the modern computing world. Together, we’ll review what makes Phoenix great and how it uses Elixir to optimize code for performance – without sacrificing programmer productivity. Along the way, we’ll see neat features like live-reload and generators and how Phoenix’s realtime layer takes on the modern web.\nMachine learning is a popular and rapidly growing field these days, but there aren\'t a lot of machine learning tools available in Elixir; some in the programming community have even suggested that BEAM isn\'t suited enough to the necessary number crunching to do serious machine learning work. Not so! In this talk, we\'ll walk through training a home-grown neural network written in Elixir on financial data from the S&P 500, then develop a Phoenix application to use that network to try to predict stock prices.\nThe elixir of life is a mythical potion that supposedly grants the drinker eternal life and eternal youth. This elixir was said to cure all diseases. Alchemists in various ages and cultures sought the means of formulating the elixir. Today, thanks to José we can all use Elixir, and once you have tried, it\'s hard to stop. Why Elixir is so addictive? How is it transforming lives?\nIn this talk we will take a fun peek at the development of Elixir, and remind ourselves how it all started. We’ll join a whistle stop tour through the years from inception, learning how both the language and the community got to where we are today. We’ll take a closer look at some examples of how elixir has transformed the lives of those who have jumped in with both feet. And finally we’ll take a cautious but brave look towards the future, what opportunities might lay in the road ahead.\nStarting with a brief explanation for why Elixir is an excellent choice for embedded systems, we will look at how to building a cool Elixir robot, using [Nerves](http://nerves-project.org). You will learn how to: * get started (often the hardest part) * structure an embedded OTP appplication * customise an embedded linux using Buildroot/Nerves * control your robot using an embedded web server * control your robot with [Slack](https://slack.com) You will leave this presentation with more than just inspiration; you will have an actionable plan to make something fun with embedded Elixir. You will also have a genuine stepping stone towards creating a robust and secure _Internet of Things_ product.\nThe audience should leave with a clear understanding of how to get started with embedded Elixir. It will be a practical, rather than purely inspirational talk.\nThose with some Elixir knowledge, but no experience of using Nerves to embed Elixir.\nPaul is a coder with 20 years experience (only a couple with Elixir, though). Paul has spoken at various conferences and events including RubyConf, The Naked Agilist, and guest lectures at Glasgow Caledonian and Edinburgh Napier Universities. Paul is now CEO of Cultivate Software. He was also part of the team that won the giant banana presented to Jim Freeze at Elixir Conf 2015.\nI would like to present a brief overview of the variety of tools available for visual reasoning about concurrency patterns, ranging from Erlang/OTP (Observer, erlyberly) through Elixir ecosystem (visualixir), to the toolset available for other concurrent platforms like Go (gotrace, streamtools). The second goal is to showcase a proof of concept for a visual tool that extends the feature set of the aforementioned ones, with a strong focus on specific Elixir abstractions (like GenStage + Flow), rather than concurrency primitives.\nSuccessful mobile games have huge amounts of simultaneous users, which requires a scalable server in the backend. Getting featured in a store can also cause a rapid rapid ramp-up, putting even further pressure on the scalability of the backend. In this talk I\'ll present how Ministry of Games is tackling the scalability problem with distributed Elixir. I will cover how our system is implemented in Elixir as well as some practical aspects of deploying the Elixir server to a Kubernetes cluster.\nWe have built backends for three games in Elixir. Going to talk about what we learnedand how we did these. Also share a bit about our journey to using Elixir/Erlang.\nLearn about working production systems. Learn about solutions used to build realtime PvP, singleplayer and a turn based games. How we deploy the servers.\nGame developers, programmers, devops people.\nRoope spent the last 10+ years building services, most of it for mobile games. Currently a Co-Founder and lead server developer at Grand Cru.\nErlang\'s pg2 module provides distributed process groups and is a key technology underlying Phoenix\'s default PubSub adapter, which powers the Channels API that we know and love. Together, we\'ll take a guided tour of pg2\'s capabilities and see how easy it is to add distributed features to your own applications. Along the way, we\'ll dissect pg2\'s internals to see how the surprisingly short Erlang implementation can be accomplished in Elixir, while uncovering other primitives that make distributed Erlang so powerful. It\'s time to learn just how easy it is to tap into everything distributed Elixir has to offer!\nWith Phoenix 1.0 out recently, it\'s time to look ahead! Together, we\'ll outline what\'s next for Phoenix 1.1, then explore some exciting new features that take Phoenix to another level of modern web development.\nEvery new language or framework needs time to prove itself in production, for its early adopter to try, fail, iterate, and document what they have learned. Elixir and Phoenix can leverage the 30 years head-start of the underlying Erlang platform, but for newcomers to the platform it is not always easy to find and apply Erlang best practices. This talk explores some specific security-related aspects of Elixir, Phoenix and the Erlang VM, through practical demonstrations and use-cases. Topics covered include: use of Erlang\'s \'ssl\' module, distributed Erlang, and VM hardening against DoS attacks.\nThe purpose of this talk is to make people familiar with some of the Erlang/Elixir specific security considerations. It is focussed on those things that may surprise people coming to Elixir from other languages, and therefore skims over common attack patterns (XSS, CSRF, SQLI, etc.) and their mitigations.\nAnyone planning to deploy an Elixir application, with or without experience in deployment/security using other languages/platforms.\nBram is a system architect and security advocate at Cisco Systems. His work focusses on massively concurrent back-end systems for IoT/IoE applications, preferably built using Erlang/Elixir, as well as PKI-based security solutions for such environments. He has previously built/designed API servers using Ruby on Rails, as well as VoIP soft switches in Java.\nIt is the story of the birth of a quadcopter built using a 3D printer, a Raspberry Pi 3 and some Elixir magic.

What about network partitions and stuff? Let\'s build and test some examples.\nSetting up Ecto outside of Phoenix is really simple and can be a great way to get started learning about Elixir. In this live-coding presentation, we will set up Ecto in a test project and dive into some of the great things about Ecto and how to use it.\n00:00 Luke Imnoff: Decompiling .Beam Files\n04:54 Fernond GalianaL: GraphQL\n10:52 Dave Thomas: Code Like its 1999\n19:25 Robert Beene: Talking to the Machine\n26:10 Powell Kimmey Elixir Maths\nChris McCord is the creator of the Phoenix framework, and author of Metaprogramming Elixir and Programming Phoenix.

It is a language and framework that give you performance without sacrificing productivity. Learn why Phoenix is a great choice for Rails developers and how you can introduce it into your organization.\nThe best way to get better at code is by reading other\'s code. It just so happens that Elixir is the best language for reading other people\'s code. We\'ll dive into some examples of popular libraries to see how the experts do it.\nHave you always wanted to contribute to an Open Source project, but you\'re not sure how? The Elixir and Phoenix Framework communities are a great place to get started. In this talk you\'ll learn how to navigate the ecosystem, avoid missteps due to unwritten rules, find something to work on, and make your first contribution.\nWe\'ll start with the easiest things you can do, (ask a question! fix a typo in the docs!) move on to creating a bleeding edge project using the master branch of Phoenix so you can try out your changes, and go all the way through to building Elixir from source and patching the language itself.\n""Programs that write programs are called metaprograms. They occupy the space between your problem and its solution. When used haphazardly the results can be confusing and cryptic. But when used wisely, they simplify that space and make it possible to solve hard problems in elegant ways.\nElixir embraces metaprogramming. In fact, it\'s fundamental to the implementation of the language itself.\nThis talk will answer questions for you such as:\nWhen should I write a macro?\nWhat is quote and unquote and when do I use them?\nWhen and where does this macro code execute?\nMacro.prewalk? What does this have to do with macros?\nAlong with some practical examples.\nWhat\'s more astonishing is how approachable (and safe!) Elixir makes this complex subject.

Because it evades detection techniques, innocent processes run the malicious injected code, unknowingly infecting the systems. A type of arbitrary code execution, process injection enables attackers to infiltrate systems, access networks and resources, and potentially elevate their privileges.\nLet's take a deeper look at how process injection fits into an attack, specific process injection techniques and how to prevent attacks that use process injection.\nWhat is process injection?\nCyber attacks can generally be divided into two parts. First, attackers breach the perimeter of an organization. This includes techniques such as phishing, password guessing and exploiting out-of-date or vulnerable software. The second phase of an attack involves moving around a target's network to escalate privileges and steal or encrypt sensitive data.\nDuring this second phase of an attack, threat actors often face enterprise detection and response systems. They must, therefore, employ an array of techniques, such as process injection, to avoid detection.\nProcess injection, as mentioned, is a defense evasion technique. Attackers use it to hide the execution of malware code within the address space of a legitimate process. Because it is hidden within a legitimate program, the malicious code is difficult to detect. Process injection relies on the privileges of the legitimate process or program the malicious code is injected into. These legitimate processes or programs are often allowlisted and thus face no further scrutiny. Process injections also evade detection by any antivirus, application control, or endpoint detection and response systems running on the network because the infected processes are viewed as legitimate.\nAttackers commonly target processes that are legitimately needed by Windows and run on every system, such as svchost.exe, a shared service process, or rundll32.exe, a binary used to load dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). These processes typically have a higher privilege level than a normal user on a laptop, so attackers target them to gain complete control of the device. Sophisticated attacks may inject malicious code into multiple live processes to segment modules and further obfuscate themselves.\nProcess injection affects every OS, including Linux, Windows and macOS. Attacks can be broken down into a number of different subtechniques. The Mitre ATT&CK framework highlights the following process injection techniques:\n- DLL injection\n- portable execution injection\n- thread execution hijacking\n- ptrace system calls\n- proc memory\n- extra window memory injection\n- process hollowing\n- process doppelgänging\n- virtual dynamic shared object hijacking\nNo matter the technique, the end results are the same: The system is compromised, the attack has not been detected and the victim organization cannot isolate the affected machine to prevent attackers from gaining further access to the network.\nHow to prevent or mitigate process injection\nThe key to mitigating process injection is prevention and detection during the first phase of an attack. Once attackers are at the second attack phase -- injecting processes with malicious code -- they have already gained access to the network. To prevent attackers from successfully breaching the network, use the following defenses:\n- access control\n- antimalware software\n- SIEM tools\n- intrusion prevention systems\nDue to the nature and variety of process injection attacks, no one-size-fits-all prevention approach exists. Mitre suggests using endpoint security products that block common process injection behavior. Privileged access management can also limit which processes can be accessed and thus injected with code.\nOnce process injection has occurred, detection, containment and isolation of the threat are the priority. Although process injection is designed to evade detection, it creates a trail within system logs that can be detected by managed detection and response (MDR) tools and other security systems.\nProcess injection is just one technique attackers use to evade detection. Correlate event activity across your SIEM, MDR, and other tools and services to detect anomalies and other evidence of intrusion.""]"	['<urn:uuid:5b920fc2-6710-4299-b8da-72f33560d3c0>', '<urn:uuid:c99ab432-9f26-42e7-84eb-c9281d91d0de>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	5	86	2814
57	What are the innovative preventive strategies being developed for Lynch syndrome, and what conventional treatment approaches are currently available for managing colon cancer when it does develop?	For Lynch syndrome prevention, researchers are developing a promising cancer preventive vaccine. In preclinical studies, vaccination with four neoantigens generated from coding microsatellite mutations reduced intestinal tumor burden from 61mg to 31mg and improved survival from 241 to 380 days in mice. When combined with naproxen, survival further increased to 541 days. As for conventional colon cancer treatment, options depend on cancer stage. Stage 0 is treated through colonoscopy removal, while stages I, II, and III may require extensive surgery to remove portions of the colon. Chemotherapy is recommended for stage III patients for 3-6 months, and radiation therapy is often combined with chemotherapy. For stage IV cancer that has spread to the liver, treatments include ablation, targeted chemotherapy/radiation, and cryotherapy. Treatment outcomes vary significantly - early-stage patients have over 80% survival rate, while advanced cases with tumors beyond the intestinal wall have less than 10% five-year survival rate.	"['AACR Annual Meeting 2019: Preclinical Steps Toward a Cancer Preventive Vaccine for Lynch Syndrome\nCancer prevention refers to measures that people can take to reduce their risk of developing cancer. These measures can include lifestyle changes, like eliminating tobacco use, maintaining a healthy weight, staying active, and limiting exposure of skin to ultraviolet light. As our scientific knowledge of cancer etiology and the biology of premaligancy has grown, so too has our ability to rationally develop targeted and immunotherapeutic interventions for cancer prevention, in particular for those who inherit genetic mutations that predispose them to developing cancer.\nA preclinical study presented at the AACR Annual Meeting 2019 by Steven Lipkin MD, PhD, from Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, epitomizes this concept because the researchers report harnessing basic scientific discoveries about the biology of colorectal cancer in patients with Lynch syndrome to develop a vaccine that reduced intestinal tumors and improved survival in a mouse model of the disease.\nWhat is Lynch syndrome?\nLynch syndrome is an inherited disorder that increases a person’s risk of developing many types of cancer, including cancers of the bladder, colon, endometrium, gallbladder, liver, ovaries, rectum, stomach, skin, and small intestine. These cancers often arise at a younger age than would typically be expected. Because colorectal cancer is the most common cancer to arise in patients with Lynch syndrome the disease is sometimes referred to as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.\nLynch syndrome affects about one in every 280 individuals in the United States, according to Lipkin. These individuals have a 70 to 80 percent lifetime risk of colorectal cancer he says. Overall, it is estimated that Lynch syndrome is the cause of between 3 percent and 5 percent of the cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed each year in the United States. This translates into up to 7,280 cases of Lynch syndrome–attributable cases of colorectal cancer in the United States in 2019, given that it is projected that there will be 145,600 new cases of the disease this year.\n“Currently, frequent screening to detect precancers and early-stage cancer is the main approach used to prevent cancer in people with Lynch syndrome, although some people have risk-reducing surgeries and some take aspirin for colorectal cancer prevention,” said Lipkin in an AACR press release about the study he presented during the AACR Annual Meeting 2019.\nWhat do we know about the biology of Lynch syndrome?\nMutations in five different genes—EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2—can cause Lynch syndrome. Mutations in these genes cause defects in one of the many pathways that cells use to repair damaged DNA, the mismatch repair pathway. The mismatch repair deficiency that results from mutations in the five Lynch syndrome–associated genes leads to the gradual accumulation of other mutations in the genome, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and ultimately cancer.\nIn patients with Lynch syndrome, the mutations predominantly accumulate in parts of the genome called microsatellites, which are regions of DNA in which a short sequence, typically one to nine nucleotides in length, is repeated over and over. As a result, these tumors are referred to as having high microsatellite instability (MSI-high). Most of the microsatellites affected in patients with Lynch syndrome are in noncoding regions of the genome, but some are found in coding regions. Interestingly, some of the affected genes are known to be cancer-related, for example, BAX and TGFbRII.\nAs discussed in a review article on the biology of MSI-high cancer, Lynch syndrome–associated coding microsatellite mutations can cause a shift in how the coding sequence of the gene is read, a so-called frameshift mutation. Frameshift mutations result in the generation of truncated or modified proteins. Modified proteins that contain novel tumor-specific peptides, which are also called neoantigens, can trigger an immune response directed at the tumor.\nImportantly, in patients with Lynch syndrome, the number of genes with coding microsatellite mutations resulting in frameshift mutations and neoantigens is relatively well defined. Moreover, immune responses against these neoantigens have been detected in patients with Lynch syndrome.\nHow can we harness understanding of Lynch syndrome biology for cancer prevention?\nThe knowledge that coding microsatellite mutations generate neoantigens that can stimulate tumor-specific immune responses in patients with Lynch syndrome led to the idea of developing vaccines to preemptively trigger robust immune responses to prevent cancer from developing in Lynch syndrome patients.\nIn his presentation at the AACR Annual Meeting 2019, Lipkin reported promising results with a vaccine in a preclinical model of Lynch syndrome that suggest that it should be possible to develop a cancer preventive vaccine for patients with Lynch syndrome.\n“We are extremely encouraged by our preclinical data, which suggest that rationally designed cancer vaccines may prevent some cancers associated with Lynch syndrome. We are in the process of designing a clinical trial to test this hypothesis,” said Lipkin in the AACR press release about the study.\nLipkin and his colleagues started by studying cancer prevention in a mouse model of Lynch syndrome. One of the first steps they took was to analyze intestinal tumors from Lynch syndrome mice for mutations in coding microsatellites. They identified 13 coding microsatellites that had at least one mutation that occurred in 15 percent or more of the tumors.\nAfter determining which mutations were likely to generate neoantigens, the research team tested how effective the most promising of these neoantigens were as a vaccine.\nThey found that vaccination of Lynch syndrome mice with four of the neoantigens generated because of the coding microsatellite mutations induced robust neoantigen-specific immune responses. It also significantly reduced intestinal tumor burden and improved survival compared with nonvaccinated Lynch syndrome mice. In nonvaccinated Lynch syndrome mice, the median intestinal tumor burden was 61 mg and overall survival was 241 days, compared with 31 mg and 380 days, respectively, in vaccinated Lynch syndrome mice.\nGiven that some patients with Lynch syndrome take aspirin for colorectal cancer prevention, the researchers investigated whether combining vaccination with administration of aspirin or the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen could improve overall survival for the Lynch syndrome mice. They found that only the vaccine–naproxen combination significantly improved overall survival for the mice compared with vaccination alone; in mice receiving the naproxen combination treatment, overall survival was 541 days versus 380 days in mice receiving only the vaccine.\n“Our preclinical data are very exciting because they provide strong support for continuing the investigation and development of immunoprevention strategies for patients with Lynch syndrome,” said Lipkin. Fierce Biotech and The Daily Mail covered Lipkin’s study.\nThe data from this study highlight how breakthroughs in our understanding of the genomic and immunological events occurring during cancer initiation can transform cancer prevention research, as world-renowned leaders in the field predicted would happen in a Special Report published in the AACR journal Cancer Prevention Research in January 2016. We look forward to showcasing more of these cutting-edge advances on Cancer Research Catalyst in the future.', 'Colon Cancer Treatment: Where to Begin\nThe treatment prescribed for colon cancer will depend on the stage of the cancer. Some of the most common treatment options are:\n- Colectomy surgery to remove cancerous tumors and cells.\n- Chemotherapy to kill cancerous cells.\n- Radiation therapy to destroy cancerous tissue.\nIn most cases, stage 0 colon cancer will be treated through a colonoscopy to remove cancerous cells. For more advanced cancer cases in stages I, II, and III, extensive surgery may be necessary to remove portions of the colon that are cancerous.\nColon Cancer Treatment Outcome\nThe treatment outcome for colon cancer will depend on how far the cancer has spread to other areas of the body. Patients that have early colon cancer that has not penetrated beyond the bowel wall may only need surgery as treatment. These patients have a high long-term survival rate of more than 80%.\nPatients that have advanced cases of colon cancer where tumors have spread beyond the intestinal wall have a five-year survival rate that is less than 10%.\nChemotherapy is most often recommended to patients with stage III colon cancer for a period of 3 to 6 months. Chemotherapy can also be used to increase survival rates in patients that have stage IV colon cancer.\nRadiation therapy is most often used in combination with chemotherapy for patients that have stage III colon cancer. If stage IV colon cancer has spread as far as the liver, different treatment methods may be used to fight cancer in this area of the body, such as:\n- Ablation - Burning the cancer.\n- Chemotherapy/radiation treatment in the liver.\n- Cryotherapy - Freezing cancerous cells.\nColon Cancer Prevention\nAlthough many patients with colon cancer do not have an identifiable cause, there are many different aspects of prevention that can be used to reduce the risk of this disease.\nMost research indicates that eating a healthy diet that is high in fiber, not smoking, and exercising regularly will best prevent colon cancer. The National Cancer Institute recommends eating a low-fat diet that is high in fiber with a minimum of five servings of fruits and vegetables per day.\nOther studies have indicated that aspirin could prevent the multiplication of cancerous cells. Other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, like Motrin and Aleve, could decrease the size of polyps found in the colon and reduce the risk of cancer. However, more research is necessary to determine the proper dosage for this treatment to reduce the risk of cancer.\nLast but not least, the most effective preventative measure to take to reduce the risk of colon cancer is to screen regularly. This can be done through regular doctor’s checkups that include a rectal exam, a fecal occult blood test, and a colonoscopy.\n|Cancer||Causes and Risks||Symptoms||Diagnosis||Treatment|\n|Endometrial Cancer||Introduction: Causes and Risk Factors||Symptoms||Diagnosis and Staging||Treatment|\n|Cervical Cancer||Introduction: Causes and Risk Factors||Symptoms||Diagnosis and Staging||Treatment|\n|Ovarian Cancer||Introduction: Causes and Risk Factors||Symptoms||Diagnosis and Staging||Treatment|\n|Breast Cancer||Introduction: Causes and Risk Factors||Symptoms||Diagnosis and Staging||Treatment|\n|Colon Cancer||Introduction: Causes and Risk Factors||Symptoms||Diagnosis and Staging||Treatment|\n1.

58	how does deleuze approach topics of death pain and madness in his philosophy ethics	Deleuze approaches death, pain and madness through a neo-materialist, vital ethics of affirmation. He spent significant time rethinking 'ways to die', especially towards the end of his life. His emphasis on life and joy does not mean his thinking focuses on happiness - instead, he explores how to endure pain and 'live the wound.' He examines these topics under the combined influence of psychoanalysis (notably Melanie Klein), Maurice Blanchot, and Spinoza, using the neo-Spinozist notion of endurance to construct an affirmative ethics.	['MATTERS OF LIFE and DEATH\nProf. Rosi Braidotti & Dr. Rick Dolphijn\nDeleuze Seminar 2018-2019\nAcademic year 2018-2019 Time: Tuesday afternoons, 13.00-16.00 Location: Stijlkamer van Ravensteijn, Kromme Nieuwe Gracht 80, Utrecht University. Organised by: The OSL (Onderzoekschool Literatuurwetenschap) Convened by: Professor Rosi Braidotti with Dr. Rick Dolphijn (Utrecht University) For more information about Deleuze seminars and other activities please consult the website of the Deleuze Circle: https://deleuzecircle.wp.hum.uu.nl/\nPRESENTATION OF THE YEAR’S THEME\nThe focus of this year’s seminar will be on Deleuze’s approach to death, pain and madness, under the combined influence of psychanalysis, notably Melanie Klein, and the works of Maurice Blanchot and Spinoza. We will study and discuss the relationship between Deleuze’s neo-materialist, vital ethics of affirmation and its implications for complex issues around the lived experiences of pain, madness, resistance, suffering and dying. How does the neo-Spinozist notion of endurance foster the project of constructing an affirmative ethics? How can one live an affirmative ethical life and endure the pain?\nThroughout his working life, Deleuze devoted spent a lot of time rethinking ‘ways to die’. This emphasis intensified towards the end of his life and was addressed explicitly in his final text. It is key to understand that Deleuze’s affirmative vitalism or his emphasis on life and joy does not mean that Deleuze’s thinking is about happiness or a search for a happy life. Enduring the pain, or living the wound, means, especially in our times, that we have to rethink issues like death, pain and madness thoroughly.\nThese issues are especially relevant for posthuman subjects situated between the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the Sixth Extinction? In the brutal context of the Anthropocene and climate change, of rising populism, growing poverty and inequality? How does Deleuze’s ethics help us to deal affirmatively with these challenges?\nTo discuss these crucial issues in a balanced manner, the seminar will also look at some of the most common objections moved against affirmative ethics and try to assess them. It will also connect ideas like affirmation and endurance to the philosophical tradition of neo-stoicism, and to Deleuze’s re-reading of it.\nAlways starting from the active participation of all of its participants, this close reading seminar aims at making Deleuze’s ideas productive in many (unforeseen) aspects of academic research and artistic practice. This means we aim (jointly) to include your research projects in close reading. Thus, we find out how Deleuze’s take on death, madness, destruction, the Stoic tradition, the non-human and whatever we read in these texts, matters in the world today.\nWe are delighted that the annual Deleuze symposium will return to Delft in May 2019 and will focus on Life and Death in Architecture.\nThe seminar consists of 9 three-hour sessions in English which will run throughout the academic year 2018-2019 in Utrecht. Research masters and PhD students, as well as staff members, are welcome to participate. Each session of the three-hour seminar will consist of an in-depth reading of a text by Gilles Deleuze (with or without Felix Guattari), sometimes alongside secondary texts by other theorists or philosophers. Participants are expected to acquire the literature themselves, but wherever possible we will make pdf files available.\nRequirements for credits (RMA students only):\nRMA students are welcome to join the seminar throughout the year, and there are two ways to make this a credit bearing course (via the OSL):\n2 EC (no grade, only pass or fail):\nAttendance and active participation in 4 seminars\nPreparation of readings of 4 seminars\nShort presentation during seminar session\n5 EC (grade, based on presentation and paper 30/70):\nAttendance and active participation in 5 seminars\nPreparation of readings of 5 seminars\nShort presentation during seminar session\nPaper (2500 words)\nPlease send an e-mail, including a biographical text of up to 100 words stating your affiliation and motivation for the seminar, to Professor Braidotti’s assistant, firstname.lastname@example.org.

59	sheep inherited trait causing enlarged muscular posterior region ancient greek term name meaning	The gene is called Callipyge, which is a Greek term that translates to 'beautiful buttocks.' A mutation in this gene causes sheep to develop very large, muscular hind ends.	"['18 Gene Names that Cover the Gamut, From Movies to Pop Culture to Cartoons\nSome might believe that scientists stay holed up in their laboratories wearing white coats, mixing chemicals, and hanging out with lab animals, but the truth is that we do get out occasionally. That influence from the outside world continually creeps in and shows up in new discoveries—in the form of creative gene names. Varying expression of single genes in model organisms helps scientists to determine what they do. The results of the mutations are often quite humorous, resulting in equally funny names for the genes responsible. Though most gene names are relatively boring—combinations of letters and numbers in what appear to be random sequence—when scientists let loose, movies, TV, awkward social situations, and folk characters all provide a bit of comic relief to the normal, stuffier, scientific terminology.\n1. and 2. Grim and Reaper\nWhen these two genes work together, they help guide cells in flies through their death process, apoptosis—much like that spectre of 15th century folklore, the Grim Reaper.\nWhen a mouse embryo has a mutated version of this gene, it will develop with no heart, just like the Tinman from the Wizard of Oz.\nZebrafish with this gene mutation are born with two hearts. Eighteenth century Italian womanizer, song, movie, TV series—regardless of the reference, this fish can probably spread more love than any human heartthrob.\n5. Rolling Stones\nWhen zebrafish have this mutation, the otoliths, or particles located in the ear that help to control equilibrium, are in abnormal locations. Their stones have indeed been rolled, but the gene name probably resulted from too much hard rock music in the lab.\nZebrafish with this gene mutation develop pear-shaped ears, which probably reminded the researcher of the Vulcan’s phenotypic pointy ear shape.\n7. and 8. Van Gogh\nThis gene mutation varies between species. In zebrafish, the result of a mutation is very small ears; in fruit flies, the wings develop in a swirly pattern. The zebrafish gene subtly references when Van Gogh cut off one of his ears, while the fruit fly gene creates a wing pattern reminiscent of Van Gogh’s Starry Night.\n9. Sonic Hedgehog\nThis gene mutation causes fly embryos to be covered in projections that resemble spikes; the researcher who discovered it was reminded of a certain blue videogame and TV character, Sonic the Hedgehog. It is currently a popular gene of study because of its relationship with stem cells and cancer development, and thus is mentioned frequently in scientific literature.\nA Greek term that translates to ""beautiful buttocks."" A mutation in this gene causes sheep to develop very large, muscular, hind ends.\nCousin of Sleepy, Dopey, and Grumpy? Not exactly, but a mutation in this gene does cause a type of worm, C. elegans, to develop in an irregular manner. Instead of appearing long and slender — typical worm shape — they become short, fat and, dare we say, dumpy? A similar type of mutation in humans is responsible for disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta, brittle bone disease.\nThis gene name is an acronym for “I\'m Not Dead Yet,” a reference to a scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. A mutation in this gene increases the lifespan, or causes fruit flies to be “not dead,” about twice as long as normal, wild flies.\nThe zebrafish that have this mutation are definitely sensitive to light (though you probably couldn\'t ward them off with garlic). When these fish are exposed to light, their blood cells all burst, and the fish then die, similar to how Dracula would react when faced with the sun.\nThis gene brings back memories from the 90’s cartoon, Pinky and the Brain. One would imagine that Brain might have had a similar genetic mutation, one that causes excess development of brain cells in fruit flies, explaining his genetically altered, enlarged head.\n15. Cheap Date\nFlies with this mutation are extremely sensitive to alcohol—they only need a few drops to appear drunk.\n16., 17., and 18. Cabernet, Chardonnay, and Riesling\nThere are also several zebrafish mutants with alterations to genes that result in lower than normal numbers of red blood cells. The alterations cause each fish to have blood that varies in color. The shades of red inspired each gene to be named after a variety of wine, each of which shares a similar hue with the fish\'s blood.']"	['<urn:uuid:76f84b13-22af-4f88-b924-5064bd12c147>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	13	29	733
60	What helps sites rank better in Google, and what practices get penalized?	Sites rank better through proper on-page optimization (content, structure, meta-tags), off-page optimization (quality backlinks, social media), and technical factors like site speed and mobile-friendliness. However, practices like keyword stuffing and using duplicate content across multiple websites will get penalized by Google since they confuse search engines and provide poor user experience.	['The success of SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, lies in optimizing a website to enhance its visibility and rankings in search engine results, resulting in increased organic traffic and a more substantial online presence. Before understanding the factors affecting the success of SEO, let us understand what SEO is.\nWhat is SEO?\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO) is enhancing a website or web page to enhance its visibility and rankings on search engine results pages (SERPs). Its primary goal is to attract organic traffic from search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo.\nSEO involves various on-page and off-page optimizations to improve a website’s relevance, authority, and trustworthiness in the eyes of search engines. Critical aspects for the success of SEO include:\n- Keyword Research: Analyzing the search terms users enter into search engines to find relevant information. Also, keyword reporting is the only way to track SEO results effectively, as it can give a clear insight into the audience’s affinity and behavior.\n- On-Page Optimization: Making changes to the website’s content, structure, and HTML markup to improve its search engine friendliness. It includes optimizing meta tags, headings, URLs, internal linking, and keyword placement. Content optimization will not only boost your success of SEO but also keeps your audience engaged.\n- Off-Page Optimization: Building external signals of popularity and authority, such as acquiring high-quality backlinks, promoting through social media, and managing online reputation.\n- Technical SEO: Ensuring the website is easily accessible and indexable by search engine crawlers. It involves optimizing site speed, mobile-friendliness, XML sitemaps, robots.txt, and resolving technical issues.\n- Content Creation: Developing high-quality, relevant, and engaging content that satisfies user search intent. It can include various media formats like blog articles, videos, and infographics.\n- User Experience: It can be considered to be the most important parameter to measure the success of SEO. Improving page load times, navigation, mobile responsiveness, and overall website usability to deliver a positive user experience.\n- Analytics and Monitoring: It is important to know how to measure SEO in Google Analytics, track keyword rankings, monitor organic traffic, and gain insights for optimization. Also, you can use multiple SEO measurement tools to analyze your site effectively.\nThe success of SEO is an ongoing and complex process as search engines continually update their algorithms. It requires technical expertise, content strategy, and constant monitoring and adaptation to achieve sustainable search visibility and organic traffic growth. Also, the success of SEO depends on the time invested in improving the quality of the content and continuous efforts to enhance user experience.\nHaving understood what SEO services entail, it is crucial to examine the services provided by SEO companies. Although each digital marketing firm is unique, it is advisable to collaborate with a provider offering a comprehensive SEO package.\nFactors affecting SEO\nThe success of SEO is influenced by various factors that impact its effectiveness. Here are key considerations that affect SEO:\n- Backlinks and Link Building: The quantity and quality of backlinks from reputable and authoritative websites can significantly impact search engine rankings. Natural and relevant backlinks indicate the website’s credibility and authority.\n- Mobile-Friendliness: As mobile usage increases, having a mobile-friendly website that delivers a seamless user experience on smartphones and tablets is crucial for the success of SEO.\n- Page Load Speed: Fast-loading web pages enhance user experience and can positively influence search engine rankings.\n- Website Structure and Navigation: An organized and easily navigable website structure helps search engines crawl and index pages more efficiently, improving overall visibility.\n- Keyword Research and Optimization: Choosing relevant keywords and optimizing website content, including titles, headings, meta tags, and body text, helps search engines understand the website’s relevance to search queries.\n- Content Quality and Relevance: Creating high-quality, informative, and engaging content that aligns with user intent is essential for attracting organic traffic and earning backlinks.\n- Technical SEO: Optimizing technical aspects of a website, such as XML sitemaps, robots.txt, canonical tags, structured data markup, and HTTPS security, helps search engines better understand and crawl the site.\n- Algorithm Updates: Search engine algorithms evolve continually, requiring ongoing adaptation of SEO strategies to maintain and improve search rankings.\n- User Experience (UX): Intuitive navigation, user-friendly interface, and relevant internal linking contribute to a positive user experience, resulting in more extended website visits and improved SEO performance.\n- Social Signals: Engagement, shares, and mentions on social media platforms indirectly impact SEO by driving traffic and increasing brand visibility.\nIt’s important to understand that SEO is a complex and multifaceted discipline, with these SEO success factors interplaying in various ways. The success of SEO involves a comprehensive approach considering all these factors and adapting to the evolving search engine landscape.\nHere is the list of SEO services you should consider:\n1. SEO audit\n- An SEO audit is a crucial component of search engine optimization services, and the absence of one may indicate that your SEO company needs to be adequately prepared and invested in your business. Moreover, the lack of an SEO audit may suggest that your agency plans to rely on a template instead of creating a custom strategy for your business. It is also necessary to understand what is SEO performance and which parameters your campaigns lack. Thus, they may be interested in something other than investing time in auditing your site.\n- The most effective strategies are customized to fit the unique needs of your business, brand, and target audience.\n2. Competitor analysis\n- Irrespective of your industry’s specialization, conducting a competitor analysis as part of your search engine optimization services is essential. An SEO company can use competitor analysis tools to identify online and offline competitors.\n- They continuously evaluate your competitors, constantly seeking and identifying new opportunities. For instance, CrimsonCobalt Digital conducts a competitor analysis every quarter. This proactive approach enables us to develop competitive strategies for our clients. Contact us for more details.\n3. Custom strategy\n- A personalized strategy is a fundamental aspect of the success of SEO. By tailoring an approach to suit your business, you can optimize your return on investment (ROI) from SEO, leading to increased calls, orders, and visits to your company.\n4. Off-page optimization\n- To provide context, your backlink profile measures the number and caliber of other websites that link back to your own. For example, a food blogger might relate to your website if they feature the customized cookies you created for their wedding.\nOff-page SEO services typically offered by companies may include:\n- We contact bloggers and web admins to promote your website content.\n- We are creating compelling and shareable content for your website’s blog.\n- We are keeping track of your company’s social media mentions by users and influencers.\n- Improving the optimization of your Google My Business profile.\n5. On-page optimization\n- On-page optimization is another crucial aspect of the success of SEO. It involves optimizing your website’s various elements and features to make it more search engine-friendly, focusing on factors such as content, structure, and meta-tags to improve your site’s ranking on search engines like Google.\n- Some examples of on-page SEO service deliverables include revising title tags, meta descriptions, and header tags for improved search optimization.\n- Conduct a comprehensive audit of your website’s information architecture, internal linking structure, and redirects to optimize its search engine.\n- Generating a sitemap to facilitate crawling and indexing your website by search engines.\n- Optimize your website images per industry best practices for improved search engine optimization.\n6. Monthly reports\n- Working with an agency by considering the SEO factors your team can trust and depend on is essential. This is why partnering with a company that provides regular monthly reports is critical. Through an SEO report, your business can gain valuable insights into the outcomes of your SEO strategy in a timely and consistent manner.\n- Regular meetings with your account manager enable your team to ask questions, review the monthly report one-on-one, and stay up-to-date with the progress of your SEO strategy. In summary, these meetings help you and your team communicate clearly with your agency and remain aligned with your goals.\n7. Progressive optimization\n- Search Engine Optimization is an ongoing process, which is why the concept of SEO services typically emphasizes the collaborative partnership that your business establishes with your SEO agency.\n- Since you’re collaborating with your SEO agency on an ongoing basis, they need to work as an extension of your business. That’s why their services should involve continuously optimizing your website to improve its search engine rankings and overall performance.\n- Even after your website meets SEO standards, your agency should continue to explore ways to enhance and improve your optimization strategy. This allows you to maximize the success of SEO and earn even more from your investment in these services.\nBy considering these factors for the success of SEO, one can optimize their content or website as per the needs and gain audience attraction to improve their overall performance.\nTo conclude, comprehensive SEO services encompass crucial elements such as audits, competitor analysis, custom strategies, off-page and on-page optimization, monthly reports, and progressive optimization and will help to enhance the success of SEO. Partnering with an SEO agency offering these SEO services ensures ongoing success and maximum ROI.', 'There are several shady SEO practices that sadly are still being used and shouldn’t be. Collectively these techniques are often referred to as Black Hat techniques vs. ethical and Google approved techniques which are commonly called …. Wait for it….White hat techniques.\nWhat is Keyword Stuffing?\nThis refers to overusing your keywords in the misguided hope that it will prove to Google how relevant your site is for those keywords. Repeating the same words or phrases so often that it sounds unnatural, for example:\nWe sell custom cigar humidors. Our custom cigar humidors are handmade. If you’re thinking of buying a custom cigar humidor, please contact our custom cigar humidor specialists at [email protected].\nLooking for a vintage guitar? Bob’s Vintage Guitar emporium is the place to find almost any vintage guitar that a vintage guitar enthusiast might want to add to her vintage guitar collection. After all, vintage guitars is what we do here at Bob’s Vintage Guitar emporium – we sell, service and customize vintage guitars.\nDoes this sound natural to you? Of course not … and it won’t sound natural to anyone visiting your website either. Here is a piece of advice directly from Google:\nFocus on creating useful, information-rich content that uses keywords appropriately and in context.\nHow do I Use Keywords Appropriately and in Context?\nThere’s no hard and fast rule but think about this: Write copy with the same tone and style that you would use in normal conversation. The paragraph above about vintage guitars contained a total of 53 words. In that space of words, the keyword phrase was used 8 times for a total of 15% saturation. That’s keyword stuffing – and will most certainly earn you a google penalty. Once that happens, good luck recovering.\nMy advice? You shouldn’t use your keywords more than 3 times within a block of 500 words. Rather than trying to stuff your keywords unnaturally, use related words that make sense, are relevant to the topic and that result in a more readable flow. The result will be a much better user experience. Remember, Google only loves you when everyone else loves your first.\nDuplicate content is content that appears on the Internet in more than one place – for all practical purposes meaning on more than one website. So, what’s the big deal and why does it matter? It confuses search engines. You don’t want to confuse search engines.\nWhy Does it Confuse Search Engines?\nThey don’t know which version(s) to include/exclude from their indices\nThey don’t know which version(s) to rank for query results\nAnd for site owners\nWhen duplicate content is present, site owners can suffer from low rankings and loss of traffic. This happens because search engines won’t show multiple versions of the same content, so they are forced to choose which version is most likely to be the best result. This dilutes the visibility of each of the duplicates.\nThe result is that a piece of content doesn’t achieve the search visibility it otherwise would.\nHow does duplicate content happen?\nSeveral different ways. For example, the website at mycompany.com and www.mycompany.com are technically considered to be two different websites. Another example is http and https. Fortunately, Google gives us the tools to let them know that they should treat the two different versions as one. But I don’t want to get into all the technical aspects of duplicate content here.\nWhat I do want to do is talk to you – website owners and creators of content – about two specific types of duplicate content that you can control and should avoid.\nBeware when using a content writing service – particularly a service you’ve hired to write blog posts for you. Here’s a quick story to illustrate why you need to be careful. I worked with a client who had hired a copy writing service to write weekly blog posts. He thought by satisfying Google’s insatiable appetite for fresh content he was doing the right thing. But noticed that his search rankings weren’t improving. I did some research by extracting bits of content from his posts and entering them into Google’s search field enclosed in quotation marks to ensure that Google would look for exact matches. Here’s what I found: There were multiple websites displaying the exact same blog posts – even down to the publication dates.\nIf you’re writing copy for your own website don’t simply copy and paste whole sections of content from another website. This practice commits two violations – a) it creates duplicate content and b) it’s plagiarism. NOT GOOD.\nHere’s the thing. You can reference other people’s blogs, or you can use small snippets of someone else’s copy to make a point if you credit the original author and link to the original source. This is good etiquette.\nYou can use other people’s content for ideas or inspiration but never simply cut and paste someone else’s work and try to pass it off as your own\nIt’s fine to quote from someone else’s work. Just make sure you properly credit the author and link back to the original source\nIf you’ve hired someone to write copy for you – and that’s perfectly fine – make sure\na) they are not grabbing the content from somewhere else\nb) they are not providing the same content to other clients\nOne last word. Quality. Google is looking for quality and so should you be. Yes, it takes a little more work but it’s worth the effort.']	['<urn:uuid:69c34ded-7f4a-41bd-8fe2-43885f37d367>', '<urn:uuid:436eec7c-7307-424b-b99f-96179912a621>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	12	51	2458
61	As someone collecting all artifacts in Origins, I'm struggling to find all the parts for one of the elemental staffs. Could you tell me where to find everything needed for assembling the Staff of Wind?	To craft the Staff of Wind, you need to collect four parts: three staff pieces and an elemental gem. The three staff pieces are found inside the Giant Robots - you must shoot their glowing foot and let them step on you to access the interior. For the elemental gem, you need to find the yellow record (near Generator 5, by Stamin-Up, or in the lightning path) and the Gramophone (in the Excavation Zone). Take these to the wind tunnel right of Generator 4, place them on the table to access The Crazy Place, and collect the gem from the Wind pedestal.	"['The Staff of Wind is one of four buildable elemental staffs in the Apocalypse DLC map Origins.\nThe Staff of Wind shoots blasts of wind when fired, (similar to the Thundergun), and will instantly kill zombies at point blank range until round 23 and knock back any zombies further away. However, the range is not as far as the Thundergun, so you will have to be a bit closer to kill zombies with it.\nOnce upgraded to the Boreas\' Fury, it functions the same as its previous version, however its blast of wind has more range and a wider area of effect. The player can also hold down the firing button in order to charge it up, at the cost of more ammo per charged shot. When charged and released, it fires an initial blast of wind, then expands rapidly to form a twister, attracting any zombies fairly close to it and dragging them to the center, instantly killing them.\nFurthermore, the Boreas\' Fury has a melee attack that involves swiping with the spikes on the head of the staff. This attack is a one hit kill until round 16. If the One Inch Punch is equipped, its melee attack overrides the staff melee attack.\nAfter upgrading, it gains a secondary ""attachment"" called Sekhmet\'s Vigor which when activated by pressing left on the D-Pad, will cause the player to flip the staff and use the bottom end. This can be used to revive a downed player by ""shooting"" them directly. The ""vigor"" is a slow-moving ball, which will travel in a straight line. It is recommended to make your shots count, because it is very easy to miss with this weapon.\nHow to ObtainEdit\nThere are four parts of the staff that the player must get, Including an elemental gem needed in order to craft the staff.\nIn order to obtain the parts necessary to craft the staff, the player must go into each of the three Giant Robot\'s and retrieve the part inside. In order to access the inside, the player must shoot the glowing foot of a robot, then be stepped on by the foot that has now been opened.\nIn order to reach the elemental gem in The Crazy Place, one must first find the yellow record and the Gramophone. The yellow record can be found near Generator 5, appearing next to the Stamin-Up machine, leaning on stacked boxes in the Giant Robot\'s footprint or just inside the lightning path to The Crazy Place The Gramophone is always located inside the Excavation Zone, on the floor. Once both are obtained, the player must go into the wind tunnel, located to the right of Generator 4, facing the Excavation Zone, and hold the action button on the table at the end of the tunnel to open the gateway to The Crazy Place. Once there, the player must go to the Wind ""pedestal"" and hold the action button to receive the wind elemental gem.\nOnce all the items are gathered, the player must go down the ramp into the excavation zone and place the gramophone on the table when having the black record, which can be found around the outside of the excavation zone, with one location being right next to the excavation zone sign. After a few seconds, the floor around the center pillar will collapse into a staircase, which will lead you to the bottom. At the very bottom, the player must go to the statue that corresponds with the element and craft the staff there, after which any player can pick up the staff via the action button.\nHow to Upgrade to Boreas\' FuryEdit\nOnce the player has picked up the Staff of Wind, they must return to The Crazy Place, and solve the riddle located on the Wind part of the map, where the gateway back is located. Above the floor of the Wind part are four concentric rings with 4 symbols spread evenly on them. The player has to match up the symbols on the rings above with the symbol on the pillar that the symbols are pointing to by shooting each ring with the Staff of Wind in order to rotate it. The symbols are base 4 representations of numbers, with the number of lines in each shape being the value for each power of four (i.e. if there is only one shape in the symbol, the value is simply the number of lines present in the shape. If there are two shapes, the value is the number of lines in the first shape times 4, plus the number of lines in the last shape. If there are three shapes, the number is the number of lines in the first shape times 16, plus the number of lines in the second shape times 4, plus the number of lines in the last shape). The symbols on the pillars represent the total to which each row of symbols in the rings must add up.\nOnce the riddle in The Crazy Place has been completed, the player must return to the original realm and solve the riddle there. There are three stone balls located across the map, that release smoke from the top of it in a single direction. The player must now use the Staff of Wind on the stone balls to direct the smoke towards the Excavation Zone.\nThe player now has to return to the bottom of the Excavation Zone, where there is now a Wind orb. After aligning the rings above the orb via the four switches in the lower section so that all the gems are yellow, the player with the Staff of Wind must shoot the orb, which will cause the orb to fly into the air and return to The Crazy Place. Once done, the player must now go back to The Crazy Place, where the staff can be placed onto the Wind pedestal. The player must kill zombies in The Crazy Place, so that the zombie ""souls"" get attracted to the staff and power it up. After killing a fair amount of zombies, an audio cue by Samantha will indicate to the player that the staff is powered up and upgraded to Boreas\' Fury. The staff can now be picked up by any player.\n- The name of the Staff of Wind when upgraded is named after Boreas, the Greek God of the North Wind\n- The Staff of Wind is Dempsey\'s favorite staff, as stated through a few of his quotes.']"	['<urn:uuid:c60ef069-e84c-462e-a7f9-cb96efe29f95>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	35	102	1085
62	I've been studying ecosystem preservation, and I'm wondering how different protected natural areas handle the challenge of maintaining biodiversity in the face of climate change. Can you explain how areas like the Arctic and the Danube Delta are managing their unique wildlife populations?	Both the Arctic and Danube Delta regions have established significant protection measures to preserve their biodiversity. The Danube Delta was declared a Biosphere Reservation in 1990 and includes strictly protected areas covering 50,000 hectares, with specific zones like Rosca-Buhaiova-Letea (12,000 hectares) protecting pelicans, egrets, and herons. The Delta contains natural reservations such as Letea Wood and Caraorman Wood, hosting rare species of trees and birds. However, Arctic ecosystems face mounting challenges from climate change, with melting permafrost not only threatening wildlife habitats but also potentially releasing trapped diseases like anthrax and bubonic plague. The Arctic's changing conditions are affecting both wildlife populations and indigenous peoples who rely on sea ice for transportation and hunting. These impacts demonstrate how climate change is challenging traditional conservation approaches in both regions.	"['The Danube has been and still is one of Romania’s natural gems. Although it cannot be said it is the largest river on the continent, you should remember Napoleon called Danube “The King of Europe’s rivers”. Danube has a length of 2,860 km, covered from its springs in the Black Forest Mountains in Germany till the Black Sea. It gathers its over 300 tributaries from a surface of 805,300 sq. km, that is 8% of Europe’s total surface and flows into the Black Sea through a Delta that bears its name.\nThe Danube Delta\nThe Danube Delta is an exotic place, hosting more than 1,200 species of trees and plants, 300 species of birds – with unique pelicans’ colonies, 150 fish species, such as the Danube herring and the sturgeon. Out of a total surface of 5,640 sq. km, over 4,340 sq. km belong to Romanian territory. The Delta is an alluvial plane in formation, a land where life is always revived from the beginning in a fantastic interaction between the Danube and the sea. Before flowing into the Black Sea the river has three important branches: Chilia, Sulina and Sfantu Gheorghe, each of them having a maze of large and small lakes, channels, dunes and sand banks, swamps, reeds and groups of willows. An expedition to the Danube Delta means discovering the Letea Grind with its so strange wood, well-known for asymmetrically-shaped trees. It also means discovering the “Birds’ Heaven” – that is the natural parks and the birds’ colonies, such as: Petrisor-Zatone, Uzlina-Crisan, Golbovita and Sahalin Island.\nThe Danube Delta shelters over 3,400 species of vertebrates and invertebrates, many of them unique in Europe or even in the world.\nBirds The bird population of the Delta comprises more than 300 species, 70 of which extra-European. Five main types are registered: a. Mediterranean – heron, glossy ibis, small cormorants, bald eagle, stilt, avocet, tadoma, pelican. b. European – singing birds: reed nightingale, bunting, boicus, sea swallow, seagull, sea eagle, whitetail eagle. c. Siberian – trumpeter swan, plover, common loon, small snipe, crane. d. Mongolian – bald eagle, Danube falcon. e. Chinese – egret, mute swan, big cormorant, mandarin duck. The Danube Delta is “a birds’ paradise”; the meeting place for migratory birds coming from Egypt as well as those coming from Caucasus.\nMammals Among the mammals of the ecosystem the Delta Danube houses: otters, minks, little ermines, wild boars, wild cats, vixen with black belly and during winter time, hares. Recently has emigrated and easily adapted the enot dog. More and more rarely, appear wolfs and vixen. A recent and appreciable spreading has the pheasant.\nFishes 150 species of fishes are known to be living in the Danube Delta. In its branches, common presence are the sterlet, the great bleak, the beluga, the Black Sea sturgeon, the sevruga, the mackerel, carp, the sheat fish, the zander, the pike, the barbel and the rapacious carp. The still water is home for crucian, perch and bream, while the low salinity water is populated by various species from perch and pike to grey mullet and flounder, depending on the salinity degree. The sea sector shelters mostly Acipenserides (beluga, common sturgeon) and Clupeidae (Danube mackerel). Delta’s fame is its sturgeons – beluga, common sturgeon, sevruga, sterlet, grey mullets – in four species of the Mugil genus and the mackerels.\nReptile Sand land is home to the tortoises, vipers and snake colonies.\nDanube Delta’s flora comprises a variety of plants. Let’s just say the flora in this area is more complex and interesting, scientifically speaking, than anywhere else in the world. Visiting the Danube Delta, you will see plants with floating leaves – white water lily (Castalia alba), yellow water lily (Nuphar luteum), frogbit (Hydrocharis morsusrane), water caltrop (Trapa natans), pondweed (Potamogeton natans), rizac (Stratiotes aloides) or riparian and floating reed islet plants – reeeds ( Phragmites and Typha), water fern (Nephrodium thelypteris), sorrel (Rumex hidrolapatum), “Forget-me-not” (Myositis palustris), brook mint (mentha aquatica), water hemlock (Cicuta virosa). There are also land plants – white willow (Salix alba), poplar (Populus), alder (Alnus), ash tree (Fraxinus), mixed woods on the banks. And while you are enjoying your trip, don’t miss to notice the trees variety: oaks, Quercus robur, Quercus pedunculiflora, Fraxinus angustifolia, Fraxinus Pallisae, Ulmus foliacea, Populus alba, Populus canescens, Populus tremul, Shrubs – Prunus spinosa, Cartaegus, Rosa canina, Berberis vulgaris, Ligustrum vulgare, Hyppophae rhamnoides, Tamarix gallica; and the climbing plants: Vitis silvestris, Hedera helix, Humulus lupulus and the most interesting: liana, with a 25 m length in Periploca Graeca.\nWhile you are in the Danube Delta I think you should consider as well its natural reservations.\nNatural Monuments Woods\nTall trees, mostly willows and poplars grow on Delta’s land. But Delta offers you rare species easy to find on natural reservations.\nLetea Wood is the most popular among tourists. Situated 7 km South of the Periprava commune (Chilia branch), it grew on the bank with the same name. I have heard you can find there Mediterranean creepers: white oaks (centuries-old, over 25 m tall), gârnita (a species of oak with scaly bark), elms, alders, white and black poplars, willow, fluffy ash tree (a botanical rarity). Letea is home for white-tailed vultures, snakes or vipers.\nAnother attraction for tourists is Caraorman Wood situated in the Western part of the bank with the same name – somewhere between Sulina and Sfantu Gheorghe branches. Flora and fauna are pretty much the same as in Letea Wood.\nErenciuc is the only natural alder wood in the Delta, located in Southern part of the lake with the same name. It is said to be “where the white-tailed vulture nests are”.\nUNESCO Danube Delta. A Biosphere Reservation\nIn 1990 Romania’s Government declared the whole Danube Delta a BIOSPHERE RESERVATION.\nStrictly protected areas were established with an area of 50,000 hectares.\nRosca – Buhaiova – Letea, extends with an area of 12,000 hectares in the Matita depression, in the Northern part of the Big M (Sulina branch). The lakes Rosca, Merhei and a combination of ponds, reed marshes and floating islets house pelicans, egrets, herons, glossy ibises and spoonbills colonies.\nSacalin – Zatoane stretches South of the Sfantu Gheorghe commune (over 21,000 hectares cover the littoral). It is a succession of banks with isolated lakes, marshy areas, rivers and low salinity waters, sand-clogged ponds, reeds, traversed by parallel dunes. The Zatoane lakes, in particular, are places of transit, stopover and hatching for mute swans, white, red and yellow herons, cormorants, composite colonies including pelicans.\nPeriteasca – Bisericuta – Gura Portitei extends to the South of the above-mentioned reservation (over 4,000 hectares). It distinguishes itself by dry banks washed by the sea or by the Razim lake. The reservation houses especially shore birds used to high salinity. It also serves as a stop for transiting birds.\nBesides the above-mentioned ones, there are also other reservations: Raducu (2.500 ha), Nebunu (115 ha), Rotundu (228 ha), Potcoava (652 ha), Vatafu-Lunguletu (1.625 ha), Caraorman (2.250 ha), Saraturi-Murighiol (87 ha), Erenciuc (50 ha), Belciug (110 ha), Popina (98 ha), Capul Dolosman (125 ha), The banks of Lupilor (2.075 ha), Chituc (2.300 ha) and Istria-Sinoie (400 ha).\nAccording to the above-mentioned protection law, any trip to the zone requires an approval from the Administration of the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve (RBDD).\nDue to its specific character and to the variety of its ecosystems (more than 25 natural ecosystems) the Danube Delta has drawn the attention of international specialized institutions. In 1990 Danube Delta has been included in the UNESCO Program as a “Biosphere reservation”.\nA journey to the Danube Delta offers you the possibility of tasting the specific traditional food which is of course sea food: fish borsch, spitted fish, brine pickle of fish with garlic dressing, fish meat balls, etc. As wine goes well with fish you can try the wines in the region because they are excellent. At Niculitel Vineyard you can even taste white wines of Aligote and Muscat-Otonel types or red wine of Merlot type.\nCelic – Dere Monastery – 29 km from Tulcea, built in 1838\nCocos Monastery – 38 km from Tulcea, built in 1838\nNiculitel tombs – dated XIVth Century B.C.\nGreci – 11 km from Macin. It is famous for the stone polishers of Italian origin. From here you can climb up towards Tutuiatul Peak – 467 m high. On cloudless days, you can see from up there the Danube river and even the Black Sea.\nHistria fortress – 95 km from Constanta. It dates back to the VIIth Century B.C.\nTake my advice: Don’t try to spend the night outdoors, especially in May and June, when mosquitoes are at their busiest time. Don’t drink Danube’s water ! If you have no choice, then decant and boil it. Don’t venture on brooks and branches, unless someone who knows the places well escorts you.', ""When most people think of ice melting at the North and South poles, they automatically think of sea levels rising. But the melting of the ice sheets – and lower ice extents during the winter months – means much more than just additional water in the oceans, as the lack of ice at the poles also changes the ocean’s water currents, the jet streams and how weather forms across the planet. How fast polar ice disappears depends upon the world’s effectiveness at reducing pollution. Without effective programs in place to regulate, reduce and eliminate greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone – oceans across the globe may change more than just sea level.\nConsequences of Ice Caps Melting\nMost people may not know that icebergs in Arctic waters have little to do with rising seas because the ice floats in the water, already displacing it with its size. As the ice melts, the arctic sea levels, and thus the other oceans, stay the same, but the weather changes.\nThe real threat in sea level increases come from the Greenland and the Antarctic ice sheets, which contain close to 99 percent of all the world’s fresh water. When the Antarctic melts, climate experts state that sea levels can rise to 200 feet and more. Greenland’s melting ice sheet will add another 20 feet to sea level rise. So all together, the melting of polar ice caps effects would include sea levels rising 220 feet or more worldwide.\nAccording to National Geographic's projections of a 216-feet increase in sea level, the entire Eastern seaboard, the Gulf Coast and Florida would disappear. The hills of San Francisco would become a series of islands, with an inland sea forming in California’s Central Valley. Los Angeles and San Diego would be underwater, along with Seattle, parts of Portland, Oregon and British Columbia in Canada.\nA recent report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts that by the time a person born in 2017 reaches 33, sea levels could rise as much as 2 to 4 1/2 feet, doubling by 2100. After 2050, how fast sea levels rise depend on multiple factors. With a climate that continues heating up – and coastal erosion – these numbers could radically increase. This not only affects coastal communities around the world, covering London and other low-lying areas, but it damages global economies as well, requiring citizen evacuations and relocation of major shipping ports and businesses.\nPolar Ice, Weather and Global Economies\nThe National Snow and Ice Data Center says that the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets influence both day-to-day weather and long-term climate. The high-altitude tops of the ice caps change storm tracks and create cold downward winds that travel along the ice surface.\nArctic sea ice helps to regulate the climate by keeping it cool. As this sea ice melts, heat from the sun is absorbed by the oceans – instead of being reflected into space – contributing to warming oceans, water expansion and jet stream changes. Even small temperature changes in the Arctic can drastically effect weather all over the world.\nMore Polar Ice Caps Facts\nAs more heat is absorbed by the oceans, it creates a “positive feedback loop” that essentially changes the atmosphere’s and ocean’s circulation. The salt content of ocean water, including arctic waters, changes when polar ice melts, because it doesn’t contain any salt. When glaciers melt in the ocean, the freshwater tends to stay on top because salt water is heavier.\nThis affects ocean currents that normally move the warm water at the equator back to the arctic in a heat-and-salt-water process called t__hermohaline circulation. The completion of the cycle occurs when the colder water at depth begins to move south and then rises again at the equator as it warms. One well-known current that would be affected by this is the Gulf Stream. Changes in the Gulf Stream affects North America and Europe, and could lead to cooler weather over time and radical changes in some weather patterns in just weeks. While the Dennis Quaid movie, “The Day After Tomorrow” referenced this scenario, scientists feel it unlikely that rapid changes that result in a new ice age are unlikely, as the oceans don’t move heat and cold as quickly as the atmosphere does.\nChanges to Wildlife and Indigenous Peoples\nImages of emaciated polar bears floating on small ice blocks in the arctic sea represent some of the more radical effects polar ice melt has on wildlife. But polar bears aren’t the only ones affected. Inuits in the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing reduced hunting seasons because of increased early spring ice melts. Because they mostly live in the coastal regions near the arctic, they depend on sea ice as a means for transportation and hunting. As the ice melts, their means to support themselves decrease. Tribal leaders also point to the last few decades where increased ice melt and global weather changes no longer allow them to accurately predict weather by using clouds, winds and ocean currents.\nConsequences of Melting Permafrost\nIn areas where the ground has stayed frozen for centuries, as in Alaska and Siberia, melting permafrost is also suspected as the cause of new outbreaks of diseases. Anthrax erupted in a small corner of Siberia in August 2016, caused by melting permafrost scientists and doctors theorize. More than 2,000 reindeer became infected and dozens of people hospitalized after a 75-year old reindeer corpse melted and released the spores across the Yamal Peninsula.\nAnthrax is not the only virus frozen beneath the permafrost. Scientists posit that the bubonic plague and smallpox are also buried in Siberia’s frozen ground. Lands within the arctic circle’s also trapped methane and other gases when the ground froze. As it thaws, these greenhouse gases get released back into the atmosphere, and add to the global warming cycle. The only way to stop this vicious cycle is for all governments around the world to adhere to regulations that reduce and finally eliminate the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. If humans don’t stop adding to global warming, in a mere hundred years, the world as it is now known won’t be the same at all.\n- NSIDC: Quick Facts on Ice Sheets\n- NOAA: Global and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States\n- NSIDC: Quick Facts on Arctic Sea Ice\n- NSIDC: Environment: Climate\n- NSIDC: Indigenous People: Introduction\n- National Public Radio: Anthrax Outbreak in Russia Thought to be Result of Thawing Permafrost\n- Yale Environment: The Global Impacts of Rapidly Disappearing Artic Sea Ice\n- Columbia University: How the Warming Artic Affects Us All\n- National Geographic: What the World Would Look Like if All the Ice Melted""]"	['<urn:uuid:ff5347f2-24cb-4084-9217-0638d59f243b>', '<urn:uuid:53490353-048e-416e-910d-46e7fcc412fd>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	43	128	2596

64	What are the key differences between treating a snake bite and an allergic reaction when it comes to what you should and shouldn't do right after it happens?	For a snake bite, you should wash the bite gently with soap and water, keep the affected area lower than the heart, and avoid eating or drinking anything. You should not apply a tourniquet or try to cool the area as this can cause further tissue damage. For an allergic reaction, the immediate response should be to administer epinephrine if available, as antihistamines are slow to act and haven't been proven to stop anaphylaxis. Both conditions require immediate medical attention - snake bite victims need anti-venom within 4 hours for best results, while anaphylaxis victims need emergency care since symptoms can return in a biphasic reaction even after initial treatment.	['Food Allergy Q&A\nDo you have questions about food allergies and anaphylaxis? In every issue, Living Without’s medical experts answer your frequently asked questions, like these:\nCan my doctor predict how bad my next allergic reaction will be?\nProbably not. At present, tests cannot tell doctors how severe a person’s allergic reaction will be. It is also difficult to tell which patients are at risk for a severe reaction.\nEven if your early symptoms seem mild, do not ignore them, especially if you have had a severe reaction in the past.\nCan exercise bring on an asthma attack?\nYes. In susceptible people, asthma can be triggered by exercise. Asthma symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, wheezing and tightness of the chest. Other common asthma triggers are dust mites, pets, pollen, smoking, air pollution, viral infection, chemical fumes and cold weather.\nWhat are the common symptoms of an allergic reaction?\nAn allergic reaction can involve any of the following symptoms, which may appear alone or in any combination. On the skin, there can be hives, swelling, itching, warmth and/or redness. With the respiratory system, there can be coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain or tightness, throat tightness, trouble swallowing, hoarse voice, nasal congestion or hay fever-like symptoms (sneezing, runny or itchy nose, itchy or watery eyes). It can impact the gastrointestinal system with nausea, stomach pain or cramps, vomiting, diarrhea. It can strike the cardiovascular system with dizziness, a weak pulse, a change in skin color (to pale or blue), fainting, shock, loss of consciousness.\nAn allergic reaction can prompt brain-related symptoms, such as anxiety, headaches and feelings of “impending doom” (the feeling that something really bad is about to happen). In women, it can even bring on uterine cramps.\nIs epinephrine dangerous? Are there side effects?\nEpinephrine is safe to use in normally healthy individuals. It rarely causes harm, even if given when not needed. Possible side effects can include rapid heart rate, paleness, dizziness, weakness, tremors and headache. These side effects are generally mild and go away within a few minutes.\nI’m worried about confusing asthma symptoms with anaphylaxis. What if I give my child the wrong medication?\nMany parents worry they might mistake anaphylaxis symptoms for an asthma attack or the other way around. Epinephrine can be used to treat both asthma and severe allergic reaction. Before modern asthma medications were available, epinephrine was used to treat asthma attacks.\nIf you suspect your child is having an anaphylactic reaction, give the epinephrine auto-injector immediately. Keep in mind that antihistamines are slow to act and have not been proven to stop anaphylaxis.Give other medications, such as asthma drugs and antihistamines, after administering epinephrine.\nI have a severe food allergy. Should I be wearing a medical bracelet?\nYes. If you are alone or become unconscious due to an allergic reaction, your identification jewelry can provide others with critical information about your allergy so that you can receive proper medical attention. Medical ID’s are also very important for children who are too young to adequately describe their allergy.\nMy daughter was just diagnosed with severe allergies. I want to explain this to her in a positive way. Can you help?\nYour child learns from you, especially from your attitude and what you do. When your language, behavior and overall attitude show that you are confident, your child will feel the same. The lessons you teach your child when she is young will help her successfully self-manage her allergies as she grows older.\nDo not use terrifying words to describe her medical condition, such as “deadly food allergies,” or “this food can kill you.” Remember that your youngster is listening to conversations that you have with others, too, so be mindful of this when speaking about her allergies to others, especially to caregivers like her teachers or babysitters.\nTalk about the fact that food allergies can be managed. For young children, phrases like “eggs can make you sick” or “peanuts are not safe for your body” may work. As children grow older, they’re more able to understand the role of the immune system. For example, “the immune system, the part of the body that usually fights germs, mistakes the food for something harmful. When the immune system fights back, that causes the allergic reaction.”\nHow fast can a food reaction occur?\nMost allergic reactions happen within minutes but some can occur a few hours after exposure.\nIs it okay to give a second dose of epinephrine?\nIf allergic symptoms come back after the first dose or if they worsen, a second dose of epinephrine can be given as early as 5 to 15 minutes after the first dose. A second wave of anaphylaxis, called a biphasic reaction, can happen after the initial symptoms are resolved. This can occur after the first reaction, even several hours afterwards.\nEpinephrine can wear off and the person may need more, as well as other treatment. This is why it’s important that anyone having anaphylaxis be quickly taken to the emergency department to be seen by a doctor.\nThis information, published in Living Without’s Aug/Sept 2013 issue, was excerpted with permission from Living Confidently with Food Allergy (©2013 Anaphylaxis Canada), a handbook written by Michael Pistiner, MD, MMSc, Jennifer LeBovidge, PhD, and Anaphylaxis Canada (Laura Bantock, director, western region; Lauren James, development coordinator; Laurie Harada, executive director). Living Confidently with Food Allergy is a North American collaborative effort led by Anaphylaxis Canada. This free, easy-to-read handbook uses evidence-based information in a practical way to give parents the tools to keep their children safe, as well as address their emotional needs.

All matters regarding your health should be supervised by a licensed health-care professional.', 'By Rachael Huether\nYou’re walking through a field in some tall grass, when suddenly you hear that distinctive rattle. You are alarmed, but not surprised. Many of us, being in a rural community, have either known someone who has come into contact with a rattlesnake or done so ourselves. What do you do, though, when you hear that rattling in an area where you usually would not find rattlesnakes, say near your home? For many of us, this can cause fear and panic.\nJean Parker, a local woman who lives just south-east of Gordon, has recently had to deal with just this situation. A puppy, which Jean had rescued and was attempting to find a permanent home for, was bitten by a rattlesnake just outside her door. Hearing her dogs barking and then yelping, she went outside to find the snake in her yard, having just bitten the puppy underneath its eye. Having dealt with rattlesnakes before, Jean quickly killed the snake to protect herself and the other animals.\nUnfortunately, by the time Jean got the puppy to the vet, it was too late and treatment would have been useless.\nJean urges other pet owners to speak to their veterinarian about getting anti-venom as a precautionary measure so that they can avoid the tragic outcome of her puppy.\nIf you should come into contact with a rattlesnake, the easiest and safest thing to do is to get out of their way. Only get near the snake if you are going to kill it, which should be done only if you have experience. When the snake is dead, the head should be buried to protect other people, livestock and pets, as the venom remains deadly after the snake is dead.\nIf you or someone you know is bitten by a rattlesnake, the following steps should be taken:\n• Get to safety away from the snake.\n• Call for emergency assistance immediately, as the antivenin should be given within four hours. Anti-venom is usually not effective if given more than 12 hours after the bite.\n• Lie down, rest and keep calm.\n• Wash the bite gently with soap and water.\n• Keep warm and do not try to cool the area of the bite, as this can cause further tissue damage.\n• Remove all jewelry and constrictive clothing in case of swelling.\n• Loosely immobilize the affected area, keeping it lower than the heart.\n• Do not apply a tourniquet.\n• Monitor heart rate and breathing.\n• Do not eat or drink anything.\n• Keep track of what time the bite occurred and what the snake looked like so it can be reported to the attending physician.\n• If possible, draw a circle around the bite so the progression of the bite can be observed.\nThe best thing you can do for your pets to protect them against rattlesnake bites is getting them vaccinated. By getting them the rattlesnake vaccination, the reaction to a bite is reduced and even delayed, though not completely eliminated. Your pet will still need immediate veterinarian care, but will also likely need less anti-venom. Also, you should know the signs that your pet has been bitten:\n• Puncture wounds (with or without bleeding)\n• Severe pain\n• Swelling, restlessness, panting, drooling, lethargy, weakness, collapse, muscle tremors, diarrhea, seizures, or neurological sings including depressed respiration.\nBy Rachael Huether']	['<urn:uuid:66f42301-39e3-4f02-993a-0fd3ecdf0a75>', '<urn:uuid:79edde38-fbd3-4abd-a36f-661a2a5910f5>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	28	110	1535
65	How do sleep needs compare between adults and elementary school children?	Elementary school children (ages 5-12) need about 10 hours of sleep per night, while adults require less sleep, needing 7-9 hours per day. Both groups can experience negative effects from lack of sleep, such as decreased productivity and difficulty concentrating. For elementary school children specifically, demands like homework, sports, and after-school activities can interfere with getting proper sleep, while electronic media and caffeine consumption can also impact their sleep quality.

No doubt, every baby in the St. Louis area is now sleeping soundly through the night, and parents are well rested and refreshed, right? But what about those with older kids?\nPreschoolers usually sleep about 10 to 12 hours nightly. Many will take daily naps through the age of 4 or 5, while others will stop napping by the age of 4. Difficulty falling asleep still is common. Imaginative thought is more prevalent, so dreams (good and bad) can interfere with sleep. Sleep disturbances such as sleepwalking and night terrors also can begin around this age.\nNight terrors are different than nightmares. Nightmares are bad dreams from which you can arouse your child and comfort him. Night terrors are a sleep disturbance from which it’s difficult or impossible to arouse the child. Night terrors are thought to be related to a sleep-rhythm disorder. If your child has night terrors, they often occur at the same time nightly or at the same interval after sleep begins. If you notice this pattern, try waking your child at a time before you expect the night terror to occur. Get him right back to sleep and see if you can interrupt the pattern. Preschoolers, like toddlers, benefit from a routine or nighttime ritual. It’s beneficial for your child to sleep in the same environment nightly.\nChildren of elementary school age (5 to 12) need about 10 hours of sleep nightly. Demands on their time, such as homework, sports and after-school activities, can interfere with bedtime and sleep. Electronic media stimulation (watching TV, as well as time spent on the computer, phone and video games) can all interfere with sleep and should be controlled. Many kids this age begin to consume drinks with caffeine, so this intake should be monitored and limited. Sleep can be aided by keeping the TV out of the bedroom, eliminating caffeine at/after dinner time and providing a dark, quiet room for sleep.\nMany teens experience sleep disturbances and are chronically sleep-deprived. This can affect school and extra-curricular performance, as well as social interaction. Some teens with school problems or depression symptoms are actually sleep deprived. Sleep deprivation adds up: An hour missed every night turns into almost a night missed by the weekend. This is why your adolescent sleeps until noon on Saturday. Sleep deprivation also is dangerous. More than half of all asleep-at-the-wheel accidents involve teenagers. Some sleep-deprived teens seek stimulants or other drugs to overcome the symptoms.\nYou and your teen should understand that it’s natural for them to develop a sleep rhythm, which makes it more challenging to fall asleep at night and more difficult to wake in the morning. Don’t fight Mother Nature. Recognize this natural change in the sleep cycle and follow these guidelines:\n- Avoid caffeine\n- Avoid extra stimulation in the hours before trying to fall asleep\n- Maintain a quiet, dark, temperature-controlled bedroom\n- Realize that teens need eight to nine hours of sleep nightly, and build this time into the day.\nNow that we’ve covered all ages, here’s wishing you and your family a good night’s sleep!\nDr. Joseph Kahn is president of Mercy Kids (mercykids.org), an expansive network of pediatric care dedicated to meeting the needs of every child, every day.']"	['<urn:uuid:590ce588-f228-4c2e-8975-c732438f4390>', '<urn:uuid:1db5c0a9-9ab4-4524-975e-dbf247f3e263>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	11	70	1347
66	I'm planning to redo my upstairs bathroom and love the classic look of old-style tubs - would it be safe to put one of those heavy iron baths on the second floor?	Installing a cast iron bathtub on a second floor requires careful consideration due to their significant weight. Cast iron tubs are extremely heavy, and it's essential to ensure the floor is strong enough to support both the tub's weight and the added weight of water. For example, some cast iron tubs can weigh between 240 and 500 pounds empty, and when filled with water, they can reach up to 914 pounds, as in the case of the Barclay Products Lion Paw Feet Tub. You should have a contractor calculate if the floor needs strengthening to safely support this weight, as even short-term excess weight can cause damage over time, which can become seriously dangerous on upper floors.	['There is nothing as beautiful as a cast iron bathtub in a newly renovated bathroom. However, there are more benefits in having a cast iron bathtub than just the beauty of it. The one thing that you should know is this type of bathtub is really heavy. And, it can be too heavy for just any bathroom floor. Its why you should make about what the cast iron tub weighs. In order for you to know if your floor is strong and durable enough for this type of bathtub. This is everything that you need to know about how much a cast iron bathtub weighs and some other, essential information about these bathtubs.\nBenefits of installing a cast iron bathtub in your bathroom\nFirst of all, why are there so many people that are considering installing a cast iron bathtub in their bathrooms? These bathtubs are a lot more expensive than other tubs that are basically doing the same thing.\nThe first benefit is durability. These tubs are staying in perfect condition for much longer. It doesn’t turn yellow as easily as other, everyday baths. It really looks great, if you are walking into a bathroom and you are seeing a cast iron bathtub. It feels like you can get into the bath and enjoy a long bath right at that moment. They are investments to any home and adding value to the home.\nWhy should you know exactly what a cast iron bathtub weigh?\nIt is essential to know exactly what a cast iron bathtub weight. This is because these baths are really heavy and can damage any floor. You should normally need to strengthen the floor of a bathroom that has a cast iron bath in. And, if the bathroom is on the second floor, it is even more important to know.\nSome cast iron bathtubs are a lot heavier than other cast iron baths, and, this is something to consider if you have a delicate floor, or as said before, if the bathroom is on the second floor. The contractor is normally doing the calculations to ensure that even with a bathtub full of water, the floor will be strong enough to hold the bathtub without any problems.\nDifferent size cast iron tubs weigh differently\nSomething else to know is that different type and different size cast iron bathtubs has different weights. And, it is important to know exactly the weight of the tub that you are going to purchase. Even, if you are hiring a contractor to upgrade your bathroom.\nHe needs to know the weight of the tub in order to strengthen the floor correctly. Just to say to him that you have ordered a cast iron tub, won’t be enough information. He needs to know the exact type of bath that you have purchased and the total weight before and after water.\nSamples if different tubs with their weighs\nHere is some sample of how different cast iron bathtubs can weigh differently. And, this can assist you in finding the right tub that will be the right weight for your bathroom floor. An average bathtub can weigh between 240 and 500 pounds depending on the size and style.\n- Pegasus Claw Feet Tub weight without water is about 247pound and in total it can go up to 738 pounds with water.\n- KOHLER Seaforth Tub has weight without water of about 277 pounds and in total it can go up to 743 pounds with water.\n- Barclay Products Lion Paw Feet Tub has a weight without water of about 364 pounds and with water is can go up to 914 pounds.\nRemember that the water in the bathtub is added to the weight\nIt is really important to calculate the weight of the water in the bathtub as well when you want to find out if the floor is going to be strong enough for the floor. You might say that the water isn’t staying long enough in the bathtub to cause damage, but this is where most people are wrong.\nWith the floor not strong enough, even a small weight difference in a short period can cause damage. And a small amount of damage done over a long period of time can become a lot of damage and become seriously dangerous. Especially, when the bathroom is on the second or third floor. This is why you always should calculate the weight of the water with the tub when you are installing a cast iron bathtub.\nIt is important to know the weight of a cast-iron bathtub before you install it in your newly renovated bathroom. You should make sure that your floor is strong enough to hold this heavy bathtub safely. There are many benefits of having a cast iron bath, but then you should make sure that your bathroom floor is strong enough to take the weight of this heavy bathtub.']	['<urn:uuid:60913687-6e8d-4b8e-af7c-ec1507902310>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	32	117	819
67	ways cities reduce rainwater pollution	Cities can reduce stormwater pollution through green infrastructure, which treats rain where it falls and prevents polluted stormwater from entering sewer systems. Effective tools include green roofs, permeable materials, alternative street designs, trees, rain gardens, and rain harvesting systems. These methods help clean up waterways while also providing benefits like job creation, energy savings, and increased recreational space.	['Source: US Environmental Protection Agency\nGreen advocates on Tuesday rallied to pass legislation that would allow homeowners to pay for energy efficiency improvements through charges on fuel bills.\nThe proposal for what’s known as on-bill financing has been introduced in both the Assembly and the Senate, potentially leading to a new wave of energy efficient projects by easing and simplifying payment.\nSupporters rallied in Merrick for the passage of the bill, arguing it will help lower energy bills, generate construction jobs and give a boost to the home performance industry, one of the state’s fastest growing, if little noted, sectors. Only contractors who obtain certifications accepted by the state would qualify.\nThe legislation would essentially end the need to pay for energy efficiency upfront or through separate installments by creating a mechanism for utilities to collect money on behalf of lenders through energy bills.\n“If we save you 50 percent on energy efficiency and your bills are down, we can space the term of the project over five, 10 or 15 years,” said Dan Kartzman, co-chairman of Efficiency First, an energy efficiency trade group, and president of Powersmith Home Energy Solutions, in Bayshore. “Instead of it being tied to your house and normal credit, it could be tied to your energy bill. It becomes easier for people to understand and handle.”\nThe legislation, which would let people pay off projects through energy bills, follows the New York State Energy Research Development Authority’s earlier launch of a Green Jobs-Green New York program, which set aside $114 million to boost energy efficiency.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is launching a new strategy to promote the use of green infrastructure by cities and towns to reduce stormwater runoff that pollutes our nation’s streams, creeks, rivers, lakes and coastal waters. Green infrastructure decreases pollution to local waterways by treating rain where it falls and keeping polluted stormwater from entering sewer systems. In addition to protecting Americans’ health by decreasing water pollution, green infrastructure provides many community benefits including increased economic activity and neighborhood revitalization, job creation, energy savings and increased recreational and green space.\n“Through this agenda, we’ll help cities and towns across the nation clean up their waters and strengthen their communities by supporting and expanding green infrastructure,” said Deputy Administrator Bob Perciasepe, who announced the agenda at a Green Street, Green Jobs conference focused on fostering green infrastructure in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. “Green infrastructure changes improve the health of our waters while creating local jobs, saving communities money and making them healthier and more prosperous places to raise a family and start a business.”\nStormwater is one of the most widespread challenges to water quality in the nation. Large volumes of polluted stormwater degrade our nation’s rivers, lakes and aquatic habitats and contribute to downstream flooding. Green infrastructure captures and filters pollutants by passing stormwater through soils and retaining it on site. Effective green infrastructure tools and techniques include green roofs, permeable materials, alternative designs for streets and buildings, trees, rain gardens and rain harvesting systems.\nAs part of the strategy, EPA will work with partners including local governments, watershed groups, tribes and others in 10 cities that have utilized green infrastructure and have plans for additional projects. EPA will encourage and support expanded use of green infrastructure in these cities and highlight them as models for other municipalities around the country. The 10 cities are: Austin, Texas; Boston, Mass.; Cleveland, Ohio; Denver, Colo.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Kansas City, Mo.; Los Angeles, Calif.; Puyallup, Wash.; Syracuse, N.Y.; and Washington, DC and neighboring Anacostia Watershed communities.\nEnergy savings is one of the greatest benefits of green infrastructure. On and around buildings, green infrastructure can reduce heating and cooling costs. For example, green roofs reduce a building’s energy costs by 10 to 15 percent, and an additional 10 percent of urban tree canopy can provide 5 to 10 percent energy savings from shading and windblocking. Green infrastructure also conserves energy by reducing the amount of stormwater entering combined collection and treatment systems, which reduces the amount of wastewater processed at treatment plants.\nEPA will continue to work with other federal agencies, state and local governments, tribes, municipalities, and the private sector to identify opportunities for using green infrastructure and provide assistance to communities implementing green approaches to control stormwater. EPA will also provide additional tools to help states and communities leverage green infrastructure opportunities within other innovative environmental projects.\nThis site is protected by wp-copyrightpro.com']	['<urn:uuid:61802574-bdc9-4441-a2e8-65df93d9e7f3>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	5	58	743
68	satellite weight two probes space mission	The two satellites each weighed just less than 1,500 pounds.	"['NASA LAUNCHES RADIATION BELT STORM PROBES MISSION WASHINGTON -- NASA\'s Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP), the first twin-spacecraft mission designed to explore our planet\'s radiation belts, launched into the predawn skies at 4:05a.m. EDT Thursday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla. ""Scientists will learn in unprecedented detail how the radiation belts are populated with charged particles, what causes them to change and how these processes affect the upper reaches of the atmosphere around Earth,"" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA\'s Science Mission Directorate at Headquarters in Washington. ""The information collected from these probes will benefit the public by allowing us to better protect our satellites and understand how space weather affects communications and technology on Earth."" The two satellites, each weighing just less than 1,500 pounds, comprise the first dual-spacecraft mission specifically created to investigate this hazardous regions of near-Earth space, known as the radiation belts. These two belts, named for their discoverer, James Van Allen, encircle the planet and are filled with highly charged particles. The belts are affected by solar storms and coronal mass ejections and sometimes swell dramatically. When this occurs, they can pose dangers to communications, GPS satellites and human spaceflight. ""We have never before sent such comprehensive and high-quality instruments to study high radiation regions of space,"" said Barry Mauk, RBSP project scientist at the Johns Hopkins University\'s Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Md. ""RBSP was crafted to help us learn more about, and ultimately predict, the response of the radiation belts to solar inputs."" The hardy RBSP satellites will spend the next 2 years looping through every part of both Van Allen belts. By having two spacecraft in different regions of the belts at the same time, scientists finally will be able to gather data from within the belts themselves, learning how they change over space and time. Designers fortified RBSP with special protective plating and rugged electronics to operate and survive within this punishing region of space that other spacecraft avoid. In addition, a space weather broadcast will transmit selected data from those instruments around the clock, giving researchers a check on current conditions near Earth. ""The excitement of seeing the spacecraft in orbit and beginning to perform science measurements is like no other thrill,"" said Richard Fitzgerald, RBSP project manager at APL. ""The entire RBSP team, from across every organization, worked together to produce an amazing pair of spacecraft."" RBSP was lifted into orbit aboard an Atlas V 401 rocket from Space Launch Complex-41, as the rocket\'s plume lit the dark skies over the Florida coast. The first RBSP spacecraft is scheduled to separate from the Atlas rocket\'s Centaur booster 1 hour, 18 minutes, 52 seconds after launch. The second RBSP spacecraft is set to follow 12 minutes, 14 seconds later. Mission controllers using APL\'s 60-foot satellite dish will establish radio contact with each probe immediately after separation. During the next 60 days, operators will power up all flight systems and science instruments and deploy long antenna booms, two of which are more than 54 yards long. Data about the particles that swirl through the belts, and the fields and waves that transport them, will be gathered by five instrument suites designed and operated by teams at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark; the University of Iowa in Iowa City; University of Minnesota in Minneapolis; and the University of New Hampshire in Durham; and the National Reconnaissance Office in Chantilly, Va. The data will be analyzed by scientists across the nation almost immediately. RBSP is the second mission in NASA\'s Living With a Star (LWS) program to explore aspects of the connected sun-Earth system that directly affect life and society. LWS is managed by the agency\'s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. APL built the RBSP spacecraft and will manage the mission for NASA. NASA\'s Launch Services Program at Kennedy is responsible for launch management. United Launch Alliance provided the Atlas V launch service. The Mission and the Probes The Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP) is designed to help us understand the Sunís influence on Earth and Near-Earth space by studying the Earthís radiation belts on various scales of space and time. The instruments on NASAís Living With a Star Programís (LWS) Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP) mission will provide the measurements needed to characterize and quantify the plasma processes that produce very energetic ions and relativistic electrons. The RBSP mission is part of the broader LWS program whose missions were conceived to explore fundamental processes that operate throughout the solar system and in particular those that generate hazardous space weather effects in the vicinity of Earth and phenomena that could impact solar system exploration. RBSP instruments will measure the properties of charged particles that comprise the Earthís radiation belts, the plasma waves that interact with them, the large-scale electric fields that transport them, and the particle-guiding magnetic field. The two RBSP spacecraft will have nearly identical eccentric orbits. The orbits cover the entire radiation belt region and the two spacecraft lap each other several times over the course of the mission. The RBSP in situ measurements discriminate between spatial and temporal effects, and compare the effects of various proposed mechanisms for charged particle acceleration and loss. Space weather is the source of aurora that shimmer in the night sky, but it also can disrupt satellites, cause power grid failures and disrupt GPS communications. RBSP will help scientists to understand this region and to better design spacecraft that can survive the rigors of space. As the second mission in NASA\'s Living With a Star program, RBSP will take its place as part of a fleet of spacecraft that may someday help predict space weather before it even impacts Earth\'s environs. While earlier missions have sent back some information about the radiation belts, RBSP is the first to use two spacecraft in tandem. As they speed through the belts at some 2000 mph, the spacecraft will naturally pass through changing conditions. But a single moving spacecraft cannot discern whether any changes it observes are due to traveling disturbances, or if the spacecraft simply flew through two static, but differing, regions. Two spacecraft with identical instruments, however, can distinguish between these possibilities. Planned for launch August 30, 2012, the two RBSP spacecraft must operate in the harsh conditions they are studying. While other satellites have the luxury of turning off or protecting themselves in the middle of intense space weather, RBSP must continue to collect data. The probes have, therefore, been built to withstand the constant bombardment of particles and radiation they will experience in this intense area of space. The Van Allen Radiation Belts swell and shrink over time as part of a much larger space weather system driven by energy and material that erupt off the Sun\'s surface and fill the entire Solar System. Space weather is the source of aurora that shimmer in the night sky, but it also can disrupt satellites, cause power grid failures and disrupt GPS communications. RBSP will help scientists to understand this region and to better design spacecraft that can survive the rigors of outer space. The mission is to gain scientific understanding of how populations of relativistic electrons and ions in space form or change in response to changes in solar activity and the solar wind. The mission\'s general scientific objectives are to: * Discover which processes -- singly or in combination -- accelerate and transport the particles in the radiation belt, and under what conditions. * Understand and quantify the loss of electrons from the radiation belts. * Determine the balance between the processes that cause electron acceleration and those that cause losses. * Understand how the radiation belts change in the context of geomagnetic storms.\nSpacecraft RBSP consists of two spin-stabilized spacecraft to be launched with a single Atlas V rocket. The two probes must operate in the harsh conditions they are studying; while other satellites have the luxury of turning off or protecting themselves in the middle of intense space weather, RBSP must continue to collect data. The probes have, therefore, been built to withstand the constant bombardment of particles and radiation they will experience in this intense area of space. Instruments Because it is vital that the two craft make identical measurements to observe changes in the radiation belts through both space and time, each probe will carry the following: * Energetic Particle, Composition, and Thermal Plasma (ECT) Instrument Suite; The Principal Investigator is Harlan Spence from University of New Hampshire. Key partners in this investigation are LANL, Southwest Research Institute, Aerospace Corporation and LASP * Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite and Integrated Science (EMFISIS); The Principal Investigator is Craig Kletzing from the University of Iowa. * Electric Field and Waves Instrument (EFW); The Principal Investigator is John Wygant from the University of Minnesota.

69	I'm researching Civil War leaders' educational backgrounds - did Colonel Henry King Burgwyn Jr. and General James Longstreet attend the same military institution for their training?	"No, they attended different military institutions. Colonel Henry King Burgwyn Jr. graduated from the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in 1861, where one of his professors was ""Stonewall"" Jackson. James Longstreet, on the other hand, attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1842."	"['Colonel Henry King Burgwyn Jr. (1841-1863) of the 26th North Carolina Infantry Regiment was actually born in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts where his parents were vacationing. He graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1857 and from the Virginia Military Institute in 1861. One of his VMI professors, Thomas Jonathan (later “Stonewall”) Jackson recommended Burgwyn’s appointment as an officer in the Confederate army. When the 26th North Carolina regiment joined the Army of Northern Virginia in in May, 1863, Burgwyn was thought to be the youngest Colonel in the army. He also commanded the largest Confederate regiment, as the 26th North Carolina brought over 800 soldiers to the Gettysburg battlefield. On July 1, 1863, Burgwyn was near the crest of West McPherson’s Ridge when he was shot through both lungs and his abdomen. He died approximately two hours after he was wounded, and was buried north of the Chambersburg Pike in “an empty gun case.” His family had his body exhumed in 1867, and he is now buried in Raleigh, North Carolina’s Oakwood Cemetery.

He entered the University of North Carolina at the age of 15. He excelled in mathematics and was appointed by President James K. Polk as an assistant professor at the United States Naval Observatory. He studied law, traveled around Europe for seven years, and learned to speak and write French, German, Italian, and Spanish. He also learned how to read Greek Hebrew and Arabic. He spent time in the United States’ diplomatic service, and was a member of the South Carolina legislature. At the Battle of Seven Pines, Pettigrew was wounded by a minie ball that damaged his throat, windpipe, and shoulder. While lying wounded he received another bullet wound in his arm and was bayoneted in the right leg. At the Battle of Gettysburg he commanded a brigade of 2500 men. He commanded the division after the wounding of Major General Henry Heth on July 1, 1863. On July 3, 1863 during the Pickett-Pettigrew-Trimble Assault or Longstreet’s Assault or Pickett’s Charge, Pettigrew’s horse was shot from under him and he continued on foot. He was severely wounded in the left hand by a canister ball when approximately 100 yards from the stone wall on Cemetery Ridge. During the retreat from Gettysburg, on July 14, 1863, Pettigrew’s soldiers were attempting to defend the Confederate crossing across the Potomac River at Falling Waters. Pettigrew was wounded in the abdomen and died three days later. General Robert E. Lee remarked, “The army has lost a brave soldier and the Confederacy an accomplished officer.” This image is courtesy of Dr. Richard Goedkoop.\nDr. Richard Goedkoop is standing on East McPherson’s Ridge.

He was appointed to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point by the state of Alabama in 1838 and graduated in 1842. He served with distinction in the Mexican War, was wounded at Chapultepec, and received two brevets and the staff rank of major. He resigned from the U.S. Army on June 1, 1861 to cast his lot with the Confederacy in the Civil War.\nCareer as Confederate General\nLongstreet was already highly regarded as an officer, and he was almost immediately appointed as a brigadier general in the Confederate Army. His assignments included: brigadier general, CSA June 17, 1861); commanding brigade (in 1st Corps after July 20), Army of the Potomac July 2 - October 7, 186 1); major general, CSA (October 7, 1861); commanding division, Ist Corps, Army of the Potomac (October 14-22, 1861); commanding division (in Potomac District until March 1862), Department of Northern Virginia (October 22, 1861 - July 1862); commanding lst Corps, Army of Northern Virginia July 1862 - February 25, 1863; May - September 9, 1863; April 12 - May 6, 1864; and October 19, 1864-April 9, 1865); lieutenant general, CSA (October 9, 1862); commanding Department of Virginia and North Carolina (February 25-May 1863); commanding his corps, Army of Tennessee (September 19-November 5, 1863); and commanding Department of East Tennessee (November 5, 1863-April 12, 1864).\nCommanding a brigade, he fought well at the First Battle of Bull Run, and earned a promotion to major general.\nDuring the Peninsula Campaign in the spring and summer of 1862 he saw further action at Yorktown, Williamsburg, Seven Pines, and the Seven Days. In the final days of the latter he also directed A.P. Hill\'s men. Longstreet\'s career took off when Gen. Robert E. Lee took command of the Army of Northern Virginia. During the Seven Days Battles, Longstreet had operational command of nearly half the Lee\'s army.\nAs a general, Longstreet showed a talent for defensive fighting, preferring to position his troops in strong defensive positions and compel the enemy to attack him. Once the enemy had worn itself down, then and only then would Longstreet contemplate an attack of his own. In fact, troops under his command never lost a defensive position during the war. Lee referred to Longstreet affectionately as his Old War Horse. (Longstreet\'s friends generally called him Pete.) His record as an offensive tactician was mixed, however, and he often clashed with the highly aggressive Lee on the subject of the proper tactics to employ in battle.\nIronically, one of his finest hours came in August 1862, when he commanded what had become known as the First Corps at the Second Battle of Bull Run. Here, he and his counterpart in command of the Second Corps, Lieut. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson, switched their normal roles, with Jackson fighting defensively on the Confederate left, and Longstreet delivering a devastating flank attack on the right that crushed the slightly larger Union Army of Virginia.\nThe next month, at the Battle of Antietam, Longstreet held his part of the Confederate line against Union forces twice as numerous. On October 9, a few weeks after Antietam, Longstreet was promoted to lieutenant general, the senior Confederate officer of that rank.\nHe only enhanced his reputation that December, when his First Corps played the decisive role in the Battle of Fredericksburg. There, Longstreet positioned his men behind a stone wall and held off fourteen assaults by Union forces. About 10,000 Union soldiers fell; Longstreet\'s men lost but 500.\nIn the winter and early spring of 1863, Longstreet bottled up Union forces in the city of Suffolk, Virginia, a minor operation but one that was very important to Lee\'s army, still stationed in devastated central Virginia. By conducting a siege of Suffolk, Longstreet enabled Confederate authorities to collect huge amounts of foodfood that had been under Union controland send it to feed Lee\'s hungry soldiers. However, this operation caused Longstreet and 15,000 men of the First Corps to be absent from the Battle of Chancellorsville in May.\nLongstreet rejoined Lee\'s army after Chancellorsville and took part in Lee\'s Gettysburg campaign, where he clashed with Lee about the tactics Lee was using. Longstreet, who had come to believe in the strategic offense and the tactical defense, was proven right when the Confederate attacks on the second and third days were repulsed. This campaign marked a fundamental change in the way Longstreet was employed by Lee. In the past, Lee had preferred to use Longstreet in defensive roles, which were his strength, and use Jackson and the Second Corps to spearhead his attacks. But Jackson had been killed at Chancellorsville, and now Lee wanted Longstreethis best remaining lieutenantto fill that role.\nLongstreet was willing and capable of doing so, but he argued with Lee a number of times during the battle of Gettysburg, essentially telling Lee that his tactics were going to lead to defeat. Longstreet advocated disengagement from the enemy after the first day\'s battle, embarking on a strategic flanking movement to place themselves on the Union line of communication, and inviting a Union attack. He argued that Lee had agreed before the campaign that this ""strategic offensive, tactical defensive"" would be the proper course. But Lee had settled on the tactical offensive. On July 2, the second day of the battle, Longstreet\'s assault on the Union left nearly succeeded, but on July 3, when Lee ordered Longstreet, against his wishes, to attack the Union center in what became known as ""Pickett\'s Charge"", the Confederates lost 7,000 men in an hour. Longstreet was right, and Lee was wrong and immediately admitted as much, but to many of Lee\'s admirers, such as Jubal Early and the Lost Cause advocates after the war, the lost battle was Longstreet\'s fault.\nLee never blamed anyone but himself for the defeat, and in fact dispatched Longstreet to Georgia that fall in response to a desperate appeal for help from the Confederate Army of Tennessee. That resulted in Longstreet and 14,000 of his First Corps veterans taking part in the Battle of Chickamauga that September. Longstreet led an attack of his men and some of the Army of Tennessee men that routed the Union Army of the Cumberland and won the greatest Confederate victory ever in the western theatre.\nLongstreet soon clashed with the much maligned Army of Tennessee commander, Gen. Braxton Bragg, when Bragg failed to capitalize on the victory by finishing off the Union army and recapturing the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Longstreet became leader of a group of senior commanders of the army who conspired to have Bragg removed. The situation became so grave that Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy, was forced to intercede in person. What followed was one of the most bizarre scenes of the war, with Bragg sitting red faced as a procession of his commanders declared him incompetent. Amazingly, Davis sided with Bragg and did nothing to resolve the conflict. Bragg not only stayed in command, he sent Longstreet and his men on a disastrous campaign into east Tennessee, where in December, they were defeated in an attempt to recapture the city of Knoxville. After Bragg was driven back into Georgia, Longstreet and his men returned to Lee.\nLongstreet helped save the Confederate Army from defeat in his first battle back with Lee\'s army, the Battle of the Wilderness in May, 1864, where he launched a powerful flanking attack against the Union II Corps and nearly drove it from the field. But he was wounded in the processaccidentally shot by his own men not a mile away from the place where Jackson befell the same fate a year earlierand missed the rest of the 1864 spring campaign, where Lee sorely missed his skill in handling the army. He rejoined Lee from October, 1864, to March, 1865, during the Siege of Petersburg, commanding the defenses in front of the capital of Richmond. He surrendered with Lee at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865.\nAfter the War\nAfter the war, Longstreet renewed his friendship with his old friend and adversary, Lieut. Gen. and future President Ulysses S. Grant, and became the only major Confederate officer to join the postwar Republican party. For this, he lost favor with many Southerners, but nevertheless enjoyed a successful second career. He also converted to Catholicism when he married his second wife which also made him less popular in the more Protestant South. Moreover he advised the Southern state governments to extend civil and voting rights to freed slaves, much to the chagrin of his former Confederate comrades.\nLongstreet decided to make New Orleans his first post-War home. He found various business opportunities there, associating himself with a cotton brokerage and soon assumed the presidency of the Great Southern and Western Fire, Marine and Accident Insurance Company. He unsuccessfully sought the presidency of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad but was made president of the Southern Hospital Association.\nUlysses S. Grant appointed Longstreet to the position of surveyor of customs for the port of New Orleans after he was inaugurated President in 1869. In June 1873 he was named to the four-year position on the Levee Commission of Engineers. By 1878 Rutherford B. Hayes had appointed him deputy collector of internal revenue. He remained in the position for only a few months, before accepting the position of postmaster in Gainesville, Georgia.\nIn May 1880, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Longstreet as his ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. President Garfield, another former Union general, nominated him to a four-year term as U.S. Marshall for Georgia, a position he had long desired. He served in that capacity for slightly over three years, but his tenure was plagued by controversy and political intrigue.\nWith the election of President Grover Cleveland Longstreet had no prospects of receiving another position and he went into semi-retirement in Gainesville, Georgia. There he operated the Piedmont Hotel, and enjoyed raising turkeys, tending an orchard, and nurturing his vineyard. His wife, Louise died in December of 1889. He began to write his memoirs, but the task was to take five years.\nLongstreet married Helen Dortch in September of 1897. She was a native Georgian and assistant state librarian at the time of the marriage, and only 34 years old.\nLongstreet served from 1897 to 1904, under Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, as U.S. Commissioner of Railroads.\nLate in life, after bearing criticism of his war record from other Confederates for decades, he refuted most of their arguments in his memoirs entitled From Manassas to Appomattox. The memoir was published in 1896 and created a furor of controversy, which continues today in Civil War circles\nHe attended many military and Civil War related reunions, including the 100th Anniversary of the U.S. Military Academy in 1902 and the Memorial Day Parade of 1902, when he commented ""I hope to live long enough to see my surviving comrades march side by side with the Union veterans along Pennsylvania Avenue, and then I will die happy.""\nHe outlived most of his detractors and died of pneumonia on the morning of January 2, 1904, while visiting his daughter\'s home in Gainesville, Georgia, just six days short of his 83rd birthday. He is buried in Alta Vista Cemetery.\nBecause of criticism from authors in the Lost Cause movement (Jubal Early in particular), Longstreet\'s war career was disparaged for many years after his death. The publication of Michael Shaara\'s novel The Killer Angels in 1974, based in part on Longstreet\'s memoirs, has been credited with restoring his reputation as an outstanding general.\nIn 1990, one of the last monuments erected at Gettysburg National Military Park is a belated tribute to Longstreet. He is depicted on his horse at ground level in a grove of trees in Pitzer Woods, unlike most generals, who are elevated on tall bases overlooking the battlefield. This is indicative of the continuing controversies over the career of James Longstreet.']"	['<urn:uuid:e07355da-19cc-4248-b2dd-93c18e2bbede>', '<urn:uuid:e7d1e680-caf0-4f0b-89f6-66ba3143ff55>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	26	45	3463

71	safety equipment testing methods rock climbing fishing environmental impact comparison	In rock climbing, safety equipment must be rigorously tested through immediate feedback systems. This involves testing each placement by bouncing on the gear with body weight while protected by a backup rope, using daisy chains and etriers to systematically check equipment reliability. For fishing equipment, improper testing and usage leads to environmental consequences. When fishing nets are not properly tested or maintained, they can be lost in oceans, leading to ghost fishing where marine life gets trapped and dies. Additionally, inadequate fishing equipment maintenance can result in oil spills and pollutants that damage marine ecosystems. Both activities require careful equipment testing - climbing for immediate safety, and fishing for long-term environmental preservation.	['Aid climbing is the one Approach to Hasten the trad\nThe strategy has been Zodiac in one push. He spent getting switched on to rate climbing and apprenticing under some climbers.\nI found myself in pitch with Mark barking orders. He had taught me prior to committing to them that there might be no testing of equipment placements. Plug from the bit and give a bounce to it, in any respect.\n“GO! GO! GO! You have 20 minutes to complete the pitch! That is fine –do not examine it, keep moving!”\nI stumbled atop a series of copperheads in my etriers eyeing the few feet of fracture, that afforded in the way of a placement that was good and pinched down. I slotted in a Stopper but could not get it to chair the nut stuck out beyond the rock’s surface.\n“What is the thing?!”\n“Ah, I’ve this one sketchy positioning. Sorry–just have to test it”\nI gave a company bounce to the nut. It held. So, I proceeded up on it. Although I got a shallow but Camalot. Phew! I was back in the stream, putting a decent TCU, another TCU, backcleaning the sole under, putting it, and moving upward. I reached down to pluck my piece.\nThe rope tugged in my own harness. Another tug. I was airborne. At this time my head went blank.\nWhen I arrived, 25 feet snapped under the bit that had held. I was rattled, although unhurt. People were good placements, I believed.\nI jugged up into the rope’s top point and recognized that it was the plucky small nut–the one I had deemed “sketchy” and also the previous bit over the copperheads–that’d ceased my 40-plus-foot plummet and likely kept me off the deck.\nI ended the pitch but took care of all the remaining camera and TCU placements, so we bailed and discovered a new goal. Mark could see that I would not be rushing anything up that day. Though I had been climbing and putting pro for six decades, with a few El Cap ascents under my belt had gaps in my understanding and skill. I’d need to reassess a lot of my possessions.\nIt is possible to think you are doing an adequate job of setting pro when actually you are one slide, one botched sequence, 1 flash pump from disaster.\nEquipment on climbs is we understand. OK, I will not do this again! However, you may direct trad for a whole season, put countless bits, never have a drop, and get very little feedback. You may find the occasional opinion from your second which “among these Aliens was a bit tilted out–to not fret though, you are doing good,” but let’s be true: this sort of gentle review is not exactly what you need when your life is online. The absence of instant consequences for errors may result in naïve overconfidence, which each year ends in many avoidable tragedies.\nTo achieve the expertise, you want to put strong, dependable expert, you want to have that immediate feedback–guide, unfiltered, and unconcerned with your own feelings. The great news is that you do not have to choose 40-foot big-wall whippers to receive it. You need only comply with the time tested (because before free scaling was a thing) methods of systematically and carefully scaling stone via mechanical help.\nThe very first step would be to go locate an available crack from the 5.10 to 5.12 range, one that is clean, steep, and constant, which is exactly what you need for helping. Proceed in an off-hours period, such as when the wall is baking in sunlight. Climbs like this tend to be rather popular; you do not wish to be the gumby putting siege the neighborhood evaluation piece onto a crisp fall weekend.\nOtherwise it’s possible to create your personal, or just fashion a makeshift setup from slings. You will also need knee pads or in least long pants such as jeans or Carhartts. Wear comfy approach shoes, shoes, or trekking boots which you don’t head scuffing up (best to not wear your stone shoes if you risk permanently traumatizing your feet). And do not forget the helmet if you are going to wear this thing, now’s the moment.\nThis report is about the reason you need to devote some time helping than just how especially. There are loads of other articles in addition to books and online videos that describe the many systems. But the basic set up is a set of daisy chains around 5 feet long girth-hitched for your own harness, using an etrier trimmed into a biner in the opposite end of every daisy. You leapfrog them from 1 placement to another, cutting on your rope into the equipment as you move.\n- Climb an etrier as large as clip and reasonable short into the daisy.\n- Set another bit, clip right into it together with another daisy\n- Evaluation the new slice (see below)\n- as Soon as You’re Happy with the positioning, proceed onto it\n- Clip the rope into the prior placement and eliminate your daisy out of it\nLet us say a little more regarding the crucial step in this entire procedure: testing each positioning. Here is where you get this instant feedback on if your ability can save your life. Once you put a bit and feel fairly good about it, clip with your daisy, as I’ve mentioned previously. (Don’t clip your rope into it at this stage –if the bit fails you have that much more rope outside.) Undo your short clip in the daisy on the item you are still weighting and proceed down a step or two at the etrier till you come educated on the new slice. Re-clip into the daisy on the bit that is lower leaving a little slack. Now bounce to the brand-new piece with your weight, changing the angle of pull just as much as possible. (Do not examine the piece at the same time you do so if it pops up.) Your daisy webbing has very small stretch in comparison with a lively rope and it is simple to create the power of a 10- or 15-foot lead collapse with a vigorous bounce evaluation. Voilà, you have just effectively whipped on your equipment.\nWithout needing a visit — You heard something valuable. When it is a placement, it might take you two or three attempts, but you are going to get.\nIt is worth noting here, you must start this clinic with a rope’s safety. On the flip side, as soon as you’ve conducted a lap that are powerful think about of getting a skin the worth. In the end, if you are soon going to be putting ace to while pumping out in a jam that you entrust your life, then you need to be in a position to do while hanging in slings.\nRap off when you reach the anchors and wash out the pitch. There is plenty to learn. 1 thing about scaling you do not need to think about them leaving equipment. Your things it deep into the crack as you possibly can and can over-cam that TCU; they will discover a way. Enhancing your cleaning abilities makes you a climbing spouse that is much better –and you get a rack in the season’s conclusion than you began with.\nGo buy your belayer some beers that are pleasant.\nGear Placement Tips\nExperience those little gadgets socialize with also the laws of physics as well as the stone and you must get out there to keep you secure. However, some important tips can surely help speed you through the steepest (and most damaging) part of this learning curve.\n- Anticipate your equipment to neglect\nIf you’re able to back this slice up in the crux with a positioning. Anytime you are relying on a bit to keep you off the floor or a ledge, or whether you’re anticipating a very long run-out, you need to clip the rope using a locking biner or 2 biners using the gates compared . Sport paths and gyms deliver surroundings where carabiners are nearly percent dependable. Climbers have come to consider these. They are not.\n- A well-seated nut is often your best bet\nCatch hold of the types in the biner after putting a nut, lift them up and yank it. Nuts are made from aluminum that enables the stone hold them and to snack in. You can be certain in, So long as the rock is strong, and the constriction beneath the nut is little enough that it ca blow, you ought to have a bomber positioning. And do not be reluctant to utilize nuts in ways that are imaginative. So, the face is crossing the crack in cracks you can flip a nut 90-degrees. Seated, this can be a placement that is totally acceptable.\n- Cams prefer to walk\nThe publications suggest putting cams. However, speak to manuals and climbers plus they will tell cams to you.\n- Expect your cams to skate\nAmong the causes of mishaps that are rock-climbing is receding from fractures. This is of special concern with sleek stone. If the stone feels or appears slippery, then it’s! So once a positioning is made by you, check real estate there is at the direction of attraction. They have stone When the lobes were to slide an inch or 2 could? Set your cams as much as you can while still enabling your next.\n- Start Looking for camera placements which get narrower from the way of pull\nYou can discover a location where the crack constricts beneath the lobes of the cam. Simple geometry creates the bit less inclined to skate. Where the crack expands from the direction of attraction, you need to be cautious of any positioning.\n- Over-cam the small men\nIn tight, you should retract shake the bit and the cams Together with TCUs and so on. Do not be concerned about getting it stuck; it is more easy to wiggle out compared to the usual bigger piece that was over-cammed. Cams are less tolerant of cracks in which quantities are be retracted by the lobes. Be picky with them these will be the pieces.\n- Use extended slings to Decrease rope drag\nInadequate rope direction is a mistake that is frequent. Cams are more inclined to walk or shift Together with your rope zigzagging up the pitch and nuts may be levered out, and of course that the rope-drag weighs you down, which makes the scaling more likely and more challenging. Use the rope to be kept by slings.\nTrad Leading Essentials\nTwo nut gears\nPrevent annoying experiences with spouses who abandon behind your equipment since they do not possess a nut application. Carry an additional one in your package. Trading one instrument forth and back is debatable; you neglect to create the swap and occasionally you want it to remedy a positioning. As doubling your own harness back, ensuring your spouse has a nut instrument whilst on the floor should become.\nExtra nuts at the Typical dimensions\nA rack doubles – to nuts. Bulk and the weight are minimal and, these men are your bits, because you’ll learn helping.\nTrail specific equipment\nStand up with the dimensions and get the equipment beta you use. Obtaining the kitchen sink gets in the way, weighs you down, making it more challenging to discover. Additionally, it is important that you be aware of what gear and the place the stone will enjoy. Whereas at other areas you may leave those items in the vehicle, for example, in Eldorado Canyon, a pair of RPs is a staple of almost any stand.\nWD-40 and Straightforward Green\nKeep them in your auto if you’ve got a camera that is sticky. Hit it with all the WD-40 to have it working smoothly. Back to fresh.', 'Billions of people depend on fish for their food requirement. Also, there are a lot of people for whom fishing is a source of income. With the growing population, the demand for fish is also going up. This means that on a daily basis, fish are being captured from their marine habitats. Fishing is already a multimillion-dollar industry and a thriving business for many. So, we have technology helping men dive deeper and catch more fish. But are we ‘Overfishing’? If yes, then what are the effects of overfishing?\nWhat is Overfishing?\nHuman beings capture fish for food. But fish also reproduce. Simply put, overfishing occurs when the number of fish being caught is more than the number of fish being reproduced and it is one of the ways humans are effecting ecosystems. With the increase in demand, catching more fish to feed the demand seems obvious. However, we need to be aware of the impact it could have.\nGeneral Effects of Overfishing\nFor many years, human beings have considered oceans as a never-ending source of fish. But it wouldn’t do to ignore that fish, like every other resource on earth, are finite.\nIf the number of fish go down significantly, fishing as a viable option of livelihood is no longer possible or profitable. This could mean closing down of fisheries and loss of business for the stakeholders.\nRisk of losing a food source\nThis is an obvious impact of overfishing. With the number of fish in the oceans dwindling, one day, there might be no fish left for human consumption. This is significant since many people east fish as their staple food.\nPolluting the marine environment\nWith a lot of fishermen out in the ocean, oil spills and other pollutants cause damage to the marine life. Many fish die in the ocean as a result of this.\nSometimes, fishermen lose their nets inside the oceans. Fish inadvertently get caught in these nets and die inside the oceans. With such a large number of fishing activities being carried out, the number of fish dying due to ghost fishing could be significant.\nEven though worrying, the above effects are only the tip of the iceberg. The effects of overfishing on the marine ecosystem are given below.\nEffects of overfishing on the marine ecosystem\nScientists believe that the hazard to the marine ecosystem by overfishing is cause for more concern than other obvious threats like environmental pollution.\nRisk to the marine biodiversity\nUnsustainable and unchecked fishing practices have driven many fish stocks to the verge of collapse. Several species of fish with commercial value such as the Atlantic Tuna fish are now an endangered species on the verge of extinction. Extinction of any living species on the earth causes and imbalance and has a huge impact on the ecosystem.\nThe following list gives the names of some of the species of fish have been put under danger of extinction due to overfishing. There are many others, too.\n- Orange roughy\n- Atlantic sardines\n- Skipjack and Yellowfin tuna\n- Atlantic and Pacific cod\nAlteration of the food chain\nUnchecked overfishing harms the physical environment in the oceans and breaks or distorts the food chain. This impacts all the living organisms in the food chain in some way or the other. The consequences of this disproportion could be widespread, and not good!\nEffect on the well-being of coral reef\nCoral reefs are an important element of the marine ecosystem. Damage to coral reefs has severe impacts on the ocean life and the effects are virtually irreversible.\nAlgae is a part of the marine life and is essential for the balance in the marine ecosystem since many fish and sea creatures feed on algae. However, with declining number of fish, there is a probability of disproportionate algae growth which can be harmful for the oceans.\nThe way ahead\nThe problem of overfishing is not easy. But the risks involved are too high to ignore the problem. Below are some of the solutions to check unregulated fishing. This is already being done, but the rules should be enforced strictly if we really want to see a change.\n- Obviously, efforts need to be taken to restore the marine life balance and to curb the effects of overfishing. All fishing should be appropriately regulated by the governments.\n- Where fishing is the only source of livelihood, alternate rehabilitation of the fishermen should be carried out.\n- Educating everyone involved can also go a long way in bringing down overfishing.\n- Protected areas should be setup in the ocean where fishing is prohibited.']	['<urn:uuid:74cc63a6-9bf6-4ffc-a810-b58ac69aa516>', '<urn:uuid:86fd455d-a807-4e25-a18c-fa0f577f3804>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	10	112	2751
72	ultrasonic mold cleaner frequency options efficiency noise balance what kHz works best	30 kHz provides the best compromise between cleaning ability and noise level. Systems commonly use either 40 or 30 kHz, with some using 25 or 20 kHz. It's important to note that higher frequency ratings result in less aggressive cleaning power, while lower frequencies can be extremely loud and irritating.	['Click Image to Enlarge\nBefore and after shots show how well ultrasonic vibrations remove grease and molding residues with no abrasion and no need for operator attention. (Photos: Blue Wave Ultrasonics)\nIs there a “perfect” cleaning system for molds and tooling that would allow a significant reduction in labor hours and tooling damage while providing consistent cleaning results? If it exists, it would meet these 10 criteria:\nOne cleaning method that comes close to meeting all of the above requirements is ultrasonic immersion cleaning. Nothing has more impact on reducing cleaning time, improving mold-cleaning consistency, and reducing tooling damage than this non-abrasive, user-friendly method.\nUltrasonic cleaning uses high-frequency sound waves to remove mold residues and fouling from tooling and plates that are immersed in a heated (usually 160 to 180 F) aqueous solution. An ultrasonic generator converts standard line-frequency current (60 or 50 Hz) into high-frequency electrical energy (20,000 Hz or more). The generator is connected to small transducers that are mounted to the bottom or sides of a wash tank. These transducers vibrate at ultrasonic frequencies (20 kHz and above) when the current passes through. This causes the bottom or sides of the tank to vibrate like the diaphragm in a speaker, which creates microscopic bubbles that form and collapse in the tank (a phenomenon known as cavitation), which scrub and loosen vent residues and grime. The energy released from these microscopic scrubbing bubbles produces forces at 10,000 F at 7500 psi, which is powerful enough to loosen contaminants without damaging critical edges or surface finishes.\nThe cleaning ability of ultrasonics depends on several key factors:\nMild alkaline solutions also are available that perform well on many residues without the caustic issues. But in general, the friendlier the detergent, the less effective it will be on stubborn contaminants.\nSlightly acidic solutions, such as those containing low concentrations of citric acid, excel at rust and oxide removal, but must be used with caution on some tool steels because they can react with the iron in the steel, turning it gray. This normally does not cause a technical problem but doesn’t sit well with toolmakers.\nThere also are several environmentally safe detergents being used that do a fair job of removing most contaminants left from resins in use today. Combined with a minimal amount of hand scrubbing on heavily contaminated areas, these user-friendly solutions are gaining popularity with companies simply because of their ease of disposal, less mess, and safer working conditions.\nThe higher the frequency rating, the less aggressive the cleaning power. Common systems use either 40 or 30 kHz and a few use 25 or 20 kHz. Thirty kHz is a good compromise between cleaning ability and noise level. Lower frequencies can be extremely loud and irritating.\nThe best transducers also are zero-spaced and silver-brazed to the tank rather than bolted or epoxy-glued, because the latter have more tendency to fail slowly over time. Transducers may be placed at specific locations in the tank to correlate with the size and configuration of plates being cleaned.\nPurchase or build a hinged cover for the top of the wash tank to slow down the evaporation of 180º F water. Also fabricate a tall (about 4 ft) stainless backsplash shield that will run the length of your system and will keep your walls clean and direct any runoff back into the tanks.\nWhen you fabricate or purchase tooling baskets, be sure the handles are tall enough to extend above the surface of the hot cleaning solution and incorporate an eyehook to lift with an overhead chain hoist. Design the baskets to fit side by side across the bottom and make sure the basket material perforations are 0.25 in. or larger so cavitation is not impeded.\nIn the real world, mold plates will get slammed into the sides of the wash tank and baskets full of tooling will be dropped in too fast. Exposed knobs will be ripped off. The tank will run 24/7 because everyone will suddenly have something that needs to be ultrasonically cleaned, as will be evident by the grass clippings and paint residue floating on the surface of the wash tank. And, due to the nature of ultrasonic operations—high heat and constant vibration, the system’s parts can shake loose, wear through, and burn out.\nHeavy-duty, bullet-proof, robust, and solid are the words to keep in mind when shopping for an ultrasonic cleaning system that will perform reliably in a busy mold-repair shop. Unless absolutely necessary, stay away from bells and whistles such as automatic loaders, conveyors, dryers, and fancy cabinetry.\nHowever, do make sure of the following:\nTo see if ultrasonics will work for you, send samples of contaminated tooling to an ultrasonic equipment supplier as a test. This also will help the supplier match your specific contaminants with the proper detergent for efficient removal. Some suppliers will even let you use a trial unit.\nOnce the system is installed, you will see an immediate reduction of labor hours simply because of the speed with which tooling will be cleaned compared with laborious hand cleaning of one piece at a time. As a bonus, there will be no more rounded-over edges or scrubbed-off platings and coatings.\nSteven Johnson worked as a toolmaker for 26 years, rebuilding and repairing multicavity molds for Calmar Inc. and then as mold-maintenance engineer for Hospira Inc., a medical device manufacturer.

73	specific risk systematic risk comparison treasury investments impact	Specific risk and systematic risk affect treasury investments differently. Specific risk is associated with individual investments like default risk on bonds and can be eliminated through diversification. In contrast, systematic risk affects the entire economy and cannot be eliminated through diversification alone - it can only be minimized through international diversification or economic expertise. This distinction is important for treasury investments, where T-bills are considered nearly risk-free due to government backing, while longer-term treasuries like T-bonds are more susceptible to systematic risk due to their longer maturity periods and greater price fluctuations in response to market conditions.	['Risk Aversion in Corporate Finance\nThere are certain risks that no amount of diversification can eliminate. Specific risk is any risk associated with an individual investment and holds the possibility of being eliminated or greatly minimized through diversification. Default risk on a bond, liquidity risk on the corporation underlying a stock, and the risk of a building losing value in the real estate market are all specific risks.\nYou can minimize specific risks through diversification. This strategy can’t stop the entire economy as a whole from going down the toilet, though. Sometimes, no matter how perfect an individual asset is or how well a portfolio is diversified, a nation’s economy goes down the crapper and everything loses value. The risk of that happening is called systematic risk.\nTo minimize systematic risk, you can either diversify internationally (national economies tend to change at different rates just like individual investments), become very good in economics (many people tried to warn everyone about the coming 2007 financial collapse), or just hope to get very lucky.\nYou may ask, though, Didn’t you say something about risk-free investments in the chapter on bonds? Why, yes. Short-term, fixed-rate, highly liquid assets issued by organizations with great credit scores are considered to be risk-free.\nBasically that boils down to T-bills, which mature in as little as a few weeks but no more than one year, are issued by the government (which has a very high credit score), have a fixed return, and can be easily sold. The amount of risk associated with T-bills is so small that they’re considered risk-free.\nThe problem is that they also offer very, very low returns, on par with CDs or some savings accounts at credit unions. Still, you do get a financial return on these without incurring any risk, and risk-free assets are the assets against which all other investments, considered risky assets, are compared.\nThe risk-free rate is the annual return on a risk-free asset, so any investment that has more risk than the risk-free asset must also offer at least proportionally as much return. Otherwise, it’s in the best interest of the investor to buy only risk-free investments.\nHow much risk a corporation takes depends on how risk averse the investing manager of that corporation is. Many people are willing to take on far more additional risk just for the chance of generating a little bit of extra return.\nSome crazy people take on extra risk when they could generate just as much financial yield from a lower-risk investment. Some onlookers think that those individuals are addicted to the risk, kind of like compulsive gamblers.\nOften the amount of risk aversion that a corporation has depends on its timeline. Portfolios with short-term goals are usually more risk averse because they have less time to make up for any losses. Long-term portfolios can ride out any losses from systematic risk by waiting for the economy to regain strength.\nExactly how do you measure an investor’s risk aversion? Well, simply asking investors wouldn’t work. Saying very averse is a bit subjective, so it doesn’t help us mathematically.\nThere are a number of ways to measure how risk averse a particular corporation or investor is. Insurance agents like to measure risk aversion in terms of how much insurance a person needs, often measured as the total potential loss should the insured asset/person experience a worst-case scenario. Many financial advisors measure risk aversion in terms that don’t actually utilize a risk function, instead opting to utilize only their time horizon.\nThey choose the lowest-risk investments available that are likely to generate the necessary returns within the time horizon. Those who simply seek to maximize returns for their client often take the average cyclical duration of investments into consideration; in order to avoid nearing the end of the portfolio time horizon during a recession, they gradually shift the focus of the portfolio toward less risky investments as the end gets closer.\nModern portfolio theory utilizes something called an aversion function. An aversion function is measured by determining how much additional return a corporation must think is possible to be willing to take on just one additional unit of risk. Risk is measured, in this exercise, as the probability of loss (p), while (1 – p) is the probability that no loss will be experienced.\nThis is true because 1 = 100%, and p is any number between 0 and 1. So, if p is 0.4, there’s a 40 percent chance of loss and a 60 percent chance (1 – 0.4) that no loss will be experienced. This strategy is completely hypothetical, however, as a method of measuring risk aversion.\nIn the extreme, a corporation that’s completely neutral to risk — in other words, willing to take on any amount of risk for additional gain — has a risk aversion of 0. This is often true for extremely low-risk assets, such as the difference between a Treasury bill and a Treasury note. A risk aversion of less than 0 means taking on additional risk without the expectation of additional gain, which is insane.\nSo, as a simple matter, the aversion function is a curved line that measures how much additional return must be generated for a single unit of additional risk. The function changes depending on how much risk has already been incurred by the corporation, but is measured by dividing the percentage change in expected returns required by the corporation to take on a percentage change in risk.\nAnother way to measure risk aversion is in terms of the risk premium demanded by an investor. Mathematically, it looks like this:\nA = [E(rm) – rf] / σm\nA = Risk aversion\nE(rm) = Expected returns on risky assets required to attract the investor\nrf = Rate of return on risk-free assets\nσm = The amount of risk in risky assets\nThis method provides more of a spot ratio of risk aversion rather than the dynamic one provided in the previous method. Folks who are mathematically inclined combine the best of both methods. The goal is simply to help you understand the role of risk aversion; that is, that investors who are more risk averse require higher returns to invest in riskier assets than investors with low risk aversion.', 'CBOT Financial Futures T-bonds and T-Notes\nEurodollar Futures Treasury Bond Futures Treasury Note Futures\nIntroduction to Treasuries\nCentral banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve help shape short- and long-term economic growth by restricting or expanding the supply of money circulating in an economy. They do this through the use of debt obligations called treasuries -- such as bills, notes and bonds – in which the government borrows money from the holder for a specified period of time. Because treasuries are viewed as being among safest of all investments, they can be in high demand.\nTreasury futures offer one way to gain exposure without trading the individual securities themselves. Learn the basics behind trading Treasury futures, from the delivery process, contract specifications, key concepts like basis and Cheapest to Deliver (CTD) and more. Discover the different ways these contracts are used, from price discovery to risk management to profit speculation, and how they are intertwined with other financial markets like stocks and currencies.\nTrading Interest Rates Markets\nIt’s the glue. Interest rate markets bind and are tethered to every other financial asset class from stocks to currencies. The US Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks around the globe shape and push economic growth in the short and long term. Central bank moves can tighten or expand the amount of money circulating in an economy, which then impacts the value of a currency, which then affects the value of commodities and companies – across the globe.\nSo you can see the power the Fed has on US markets and beyond. Interest rate futures and options contracts may be used to hedge against risks that can adversely affect portfolios or balance sheets. Yet, they also provide trading and spreading opportunities across many different markets for traders and can be some of the deepest and most liquid futures markets in the world.\nThese markets are primarily event-driven , meaning participants are looking for opportunities and risks in every Fed meeting, announcement, Fed speech or testimony, not to mention key economic reports from employment rates to manufacturing data.. This allows traders to go long or short across the yield curve, from 3-month Eurodollar futures and up the line to 2-year, 5-year, 10-year notes along with 30-year Treasury bond futures and Ultra Treasury bond futures.\nThere are two main differences between these three types of U.S. Treasuries, maturity dates and the way they pay interest.\nTreasury note Futures:\nTreasury notes are issued with maturities of one, three, five, seven, and 10 years, while Treasury bonds (also called “long bonds” and “t-bond”) offer maturities of 20 and 30 years. The only difference between notes and bonds is the length until maturity. The 10-year is the most widely followed of all maturities; it is used as both the benchmark for the Treasury market and the basis for banks’ calculation of mortgage rates.\nTreasury bond Futures:\nOnce T-notes and T-bonds are issued, their prices fluctuate so their yields remain linked to market prices. For example, say the government issues a 30-year bond with a yield of 10% when interest rates are high. In the next 15 years, prevailing rates fall significantly and new long bonds are being issued at 5%. Investors will no longer be able to buy the older T-bond and still receive a yield of 10%; instead, its yield to maturity will fall and its price will rise. In general, the longer the time there is until the bond matures the greater price fluctuation it will experience. In contrast, T-bills experience very little in the way of price fluctuation since they mature in such a short amount of time.\nT Bond futures represent the 30-year maturity on interest rates, which help set rates on home mortgages, among other things.\nOriginally launched in 1977, this contract allows individual traders, banks and institutions to hedge long-term risk as well as profit from shifts in the interest rate markets. The Federal Reserve Bank may have a stronger impact on shorter term rates with its policy moves, but that ripples down to the 30-year bonds as well. Classic T-bond futures carry a remaining maturity of at least 15 years but not more than 25 years, which differ from Ultra T-bonds, which have a remaining maturity of at least 25 years but not more than 30 years.\n30-year Treasury bond futures are among the most liquid and deep interest rate markets in the world, allowing traders efficient ways to enter and exit trades. The contracts are also available to trade virtually 24-hours per day.\nAbout WebOE / Mobile Trader / Open Account / Joss Report / WebOE / Simulated Trading / News / Charts Quotes / Tools / Option Quotes / Seasonal Charts / Interactive Charts /About futures Products / Futures 101 / Options 101 / Technical Analysis / Fundamental Analysis / Contract Specs / Trading Rules']	['<urn:uuid:9986063e-15b8-42c3-93ca-e1fb2e9afc54>', '<urn:uuid:bd5a9d80-65a4-47c2-bb24-5733b2306872>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	8	97	1850
74	What examples show both good and bad treatment of black athletes?	While Shawn Crawford showed remarkable sportsmanship by giving his 2008 Olympic silver medal to Churandy Martin, recognizing Martin's hard work and dedication, Jesse Owens faced discrimination despite his 1936 Olympic success - having to use freight elevators at New York hotels even after winning four gold medals and receiving a hero's welcome.	"[""Too often these days, fans and athletes alike focus on the negative side of sports, whether it's a fight that breaks out on the field or trash talk off the field. Still, there are many instances of athletes taking the high road and doing the right thing. Here are five perfect examples of athletes showing us what sportsmanship is all about.\n1. Bobby Jones, 1925 U.S. Open Assessed himself a one-stroke penalty on the par-4 11th hole for an infraction nobody saw. He’d eventually lose in a playoff. Praised for his honesty, Jones said, “You might as well praise a man for not robbing a bank.”\n2. Armando Galarraga, Detroit Tigers, 2010 With Galarraga one out away from a perfect game, umpire Jim Joyce blew a call at first base to spoil the achievement. Rather than lash out, Galarraga defended Joyce and accepted his apology.\n3. Shawn Crawford, 2008 Beijing Olympics\nFinished fourth, but was awarded silver in the 200 meters after two runners were disqualified for lane violations. Feeling that Churandy Martin of the Netherlands Antilles had rightly earned the honor, Crawford sent him his medal.\n“I know the rules are the rules. You step on the line, you’re disqualified. But when you’re running clear in your position and aren’t impeding in someone’s race and you barely touch the line? I felt that Churandy was robbed. He worked four years just like I did, went to practice and trained — probably threw up at practice like I did — nights of breathlessness and days where you wanted to sleep. For four years... I felt like he ran a second-place race. He beat us by a considerable margin, from second to third. I know I put in the work, and I go out there and expect to earn my position. I felt like I was beat fair and square.\n“When Churandy received my medal, he was surprised. He couldn’t believe that I was doing it. At first, he didn’t accept it. He understood my argument, but wanted to make sure that’s really what I wanted to do. But he has so much respect for me now. We’re really cool, and it’s a great relationship. To me, that’s more important. If I had kept the medal, I probably never would have known much about him. Just ‘hi’ and ‘bye,’ every time I saw him. I like the relationship we have built. It’s important to have good relationships and friendships in life. You only live once, and it’s a short life.”\n4. Mallory Holtman and Liz Wallace, Central Washington University women’s softball, 2008 After Sara Tucholsky of Western Oregon University hit her first career home run, she injured her knee rounding first base. Holtman and Wallace carried her around the bases, so she could receive credit for a four-bagger.\n5. San Francisco Giants, 2010 NLDS After clinching victory in the series at Turner Field, the Giants broke off their victory celebration to join in a standing ovation for manager Bobby Cox, managing his last game of a 25-year run with the Braves."", 'Roy Jones Jr.\'s controversial loss to Park Si Hun at the 1988 Seoul… (Associated Press )\nThe Olympic Games offer competitors the chance to bathe in national glory and international acclaim. The victors — indeed, all the athletes who aspire to victory — are celebrated in the Olympic motto of ""Citius, Altius, Fortius.""\nFaster, higher, stronger.\nYet celebration and aspiration sometimes share the Olympic spotlight with controversy, with scandal and with athletes who train and compete outside the bounds of Citius, Altius and Fortius. One ranking of the 10 least pure moments in the history of the Summer Games:\nNo. 10 (1912): Jim Thorpe never had participated in a decathlon until the 1912 Olympics. He won the pentathlon, then gave the decathlon a try and won gold there too. He was saluted as the greatest athlete in the world, rewarded with a ticker-tape parade in New York and generally revered until the Worcester (Mass.) Telegram reported a few months later that Thorpe had made a few bucks playing minor league baseball — $25 or $35 a week, in the summers of 1909 and 1910. That made him a professional athlete, in the eyes of U.S. Olympic officials, and the International Olympic Committee stripped him of his medals. However, decathlon runner-up Hugo Wieslander of Sweden said he considered Thorpe the fair champion and would not accept the gold medal. The IOC reinstated Thorpe posthumously and awarded his children duplicate gold medals in 1983.\nNo. 9 (1984): At a time South Africa was banned from the Olympics because of its state-sponsored racial segregation, a South African teenager named Zola Budd ran for Britain, after London\'s Daily Mail paid for her to move to England four months before the Games. She had a British grandfather, it turned out, and soon enough she had British citizenship. In the final of the women\'s 3,000 meters, she and American favorite Mary Decker bumped, with Decker tripping on Budd\'s right leg and falling to the ground with a hip injury. She did not finish. Budd, loudly booed at the Los Angeles Coliseum, finished seventh. Budd apologized to Decker, who told her, ""Don\'t bother. I don\'t want to talk to you."" Decker faulted Budd for improperly cutting inside; track officials briefly disqualified her and then reinstated her. Budd had grown up with a poster of Decker on her wall.\nNo. 8 (1904): On a sweltering afternoon in St. Louis, Fred Lorz of the U.S. crossed the marathon finish line with no other runners in sight. The day was so hot and the course so poor — the only water available came from a well 12 miles into the race — that 18 of the 32 runners to start the race did not complete it. As it turned out, neither did Lorz. He tired after about nine miles, then jumped into a car for the next 11. The car broke down, so Lorz ran the rest of the way, and he was greeted as the winner. The fraud was quickly discovered, and Lorz confessed to what he said was a practical joke. He did win the Boston Marathon in 1905.\nNo. 7 (1936): Perhaps the most enduring myth of the Olympic Games is that Adolf Hitler refused to extend a congratulatory handshake to Jesse Owens, a claim for which Olympic historians have found no supporting evidence. It is clear that Hitler was neither pleased nor impressed by the four gold medals Owens won, even as the German crowd cheered him loudly and mobbed him for pictures and autographs. As Owens pierced the Nazi myth of Aryan superiority, his home country acted with regrettable caution, replacing two Jewish sprinters on the U.S. team. Owens got a hero\'s welcome upon returning home, yet as a black man he had to ride the freight elevator to a New York hotel reception in his honor. Once the Olympic glow faded, Owens had to earn money by racing against horses.\nNo. 6 (1968): In the months following the assassinations ofMartin Luther King Jr. andRobert F. Kennedy, black American athletes debated whether to protest strained race relations by boycotting the Olympics. Instead, Tommie Smith and John Carlos offered a silent protest from the medal stand. Smith won gold in the men\'s 200 meters, Carlos won bronze. As the national anthem played, Smith and Carlos bowed their heads and raised a black-gloved fist toward the sky.

75	tycho brahe galileo observation methods difference	Tycho Brahe conducted astronomical observations prior to telescope invention using a quadrant instrument, while Galileo used the newly invented telescope for his astronomical observations in 1609.	['Global Astronomy Month:\nOne People, One Sky\nApril 1, 2011 - April 30, 2011\nThe United Nations established the year 2009 as the International Year of Astronomy. The year marked the 400th anniversary of Galileo’s first use of the telescope to record his astronomical findings. In an effort to continue cultivating the spirit of collaboration across nations, the international astronomy organization Astronomers Without Borders has designated the month of April “Global Astronomy Month.” Its goal is to “bring new ideas, new opportunities and ... enthusiasts together worldwide, celebrating One People, One Sky.” The three books on display in this exhibition demonstrate how astronomers shared ideas, observations, findings and theories (even if not always correct) throughout the centuries, building upon each other’s work to make important contributions of their own. The two manuscripts on display are evidence of the enduring and pervasive fascination that studying the sky has had on amateur astronomers and enthusiasts.\nDialogo di Galileo Galilei . . . Dove Ne i Congressi di Quattro Giornate si Discorre Sopra i due Massimi Sistemi del Mondo Tolemaico, e Copernicano. Fiorenza, Per Gio: Batista Landini, 1632.\nGalileo Galilei (1564-1642) is considered the Father of modern mechanics. Galileo’s Dialogo (Dialogue Concerning the two Chief World Systems) is written as a conversation occurring over a four-day period between three characters, Salviati (representing Galileo arguing the Copernican model), Sagredo (neutral), and Simplicio (Aristotelian and Ptolemaic model). Reducing the argument to the simplest form, the Ptolemaic model asserts a geocentric universe, as opposed to Copernican heliocentric model that Galileo supported. The three characters are depicted in the woodcut shown here in this rare first edition. This work was suppressed by the inquisition in 1633. Galileo was suppose to renounce his work or be burned at the stake, neither of which happened. He was tried, found guilty and sentenced to a life under house arrest. Galileo was pardoned by the Catholic Church in 1922.\nTychonis Brahei, Equitis Dani, Astronomorum Coryphaei. Hagae-Comitum : Ex Typographia Adriani Vlacq, 1654.\nPierre Gassendi (1592-1655) was a French philosopher and scientist.\nThis second edition of Gassendi’s book included a comprehensive\nbiography of the great astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601). Brahe was one of the greatest observational scientists; working prior to the invention of a telescope, he used a quadrant to observe the sky. He made several important discoveries including a supernova (the birth of a new star), measured the shift (parallax) between stars, and could show how some stars were more distant than others, and much further than planets. Brahe’s model of the solar system was a combination of the Copernican and Ptolamaic theories. Although the model was incorrect, his observations on planetary motions formed the basis for Johannes Kepler’s work formulating the still current model of the solar system.\nPhilosophia Naturalis Principia Mathematica. Smith ad Insignia Principis Walliae in Coemiterio D. Pauli, aliosq; nonnullos Bibliopolas, 1687.\nSir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) was a great theorist and the inventor of\ncalculus. Principia played an extremely important role in the develop-\nment of modern mechanics and astronomy. Building upon the great\nworks by philosophers, mathematicians and astronomers including; Nicholas Copernicus, Galileo Galili, Johannes Kepler, and Rene Descartes, Newton developed three laws to show the causes of planetary motion and proved how the gravity of the sun pulls the planets which results in an orbit. The copy on display here is a rare first edition.\nNotes on Astronomy, circa 1860-1862.\nJames Riddle Maxwell (1836-1912) was a civil engineer for the Pennsylvania, Northern and Pacific Railroads and a resident of Newark, Delaware. Between 1860 and 1862 he studied at Delaware College and Polytechnic College. Displayed here is his notebook from an astronomy class. His interest in astronomy continued after college: behind his course notes are additional astronomical observations he made in 1867, 1875 and 1876.\nForcastle Journals, travel log. Journal entry on September 1, 1842.\nArchibald Wilson, a sailor in the 1840s who served aboard merchant ships that made domestic and international voyages, kept a journal while at sea between 1842 and 1843. After the main journal entries, Wilson included “A Journal of Remarkable Incidents at Sea” in which he documented events observed between 1840 and 1842. In the entry shown here, Wilson writes about his experience on deck one night where he witnessed an extremely large and bright meteor or shooting star, which he writes was so bright “that it made me start back a little more scared than hurt, it seemed that the heaven had taken on fire.”', '|Home||Directory||Science Fair Projects||Experiments||Scientists & Inventors||Science Jokes||Warning!|\nTelescope Pioneers, Milestones and Resources\n1608: Hans Lippershey, Jacub Metius, and Sacharias Janssen, Dutch spectacle-makers, build independently simple telescopes based on the discovery that looking through two lenses hold up some distance apart brings objects closer (Galilean telescope concept).\n1609: Galileo Galilei, Italian physicist, mathematician and astronomer, was the first to use the new invented device for astronomical observations: Galileo was the first to see the craters of the moon, sunspots, the four largest moons of Jupiter, the rings of Saturn and the phases of Venus.\n1609: Thomas Harriot, English astronomer, becomes the first person to make a drawing of the Moon by using a telescope, a few months before Galileo..\n1611: Prince Frederick Cesi, Italian telescope pioneer, or Giovanni Demisiani, Greek mathematician coin the term telescope at a banquet held in 1611 by Prince Federico Cesi himself to honor Galileo.

76	care killing animals galapagos hawaii comparison	Both locations employed lethal methods for conservation, but with different approaches to care. In Galápagos, care was expressed through precise veterinary interventions and close monitoring of goats during eradication, while in Hawaii, care focused on legal protection and systematic removal through hunting and aerial culling to protect the Palila's habitat.	['This post builds on the research article “Tangles of Care: Killing Goats to Save Tortoises on the Galápagos Islands,” which was published in the August 2017 issue of the Society’s peer-reviewed journal, Cultural Anthropology.\nAshley Elizabeth Drake and Adhann Iwashita: What brought you to research in the Galápagos, and to the worldings around Proyecto Isabela (PI)?\nPaolo Bocci: After completing my master’s fieldwork in Senegal, I happened to read in the New York Times about clashes between fishermen and park officials on the Galápagos Islands. As I learned more about these islands during the following months, the Galápagos struck me as an overdetermined place: their central role in the history of natural sciences (as the mythical birthplace of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution); the complicated history of colonial and national influences on the making of this archipelago; and their place in the current global landscape of tourism and conservation as one of the last few putatively pristine places. In the face of massive efforts on the part of the international scientific community and the government of Ecuador to “do it right,” I sensed that the picture on the ground was more complicated—in part, because of those very conservation efforts—which brought me to Proyecto Isabela.\nOn one level, what sustained my curiosity during my fieldwork on the goat eradication project was its lasting riddle: the imperative to restore a human-free space by intervening in it with an unprecedented intensity. The higher the moral call to intervene, the starker this paradox. But also, the latter was compounded by the Galápagos National Park’s declaration of success in the form of the (near) disappearance of goats, which did not match with my experience on the Galápagos. By noticing and being surprised by goats on the islands, by asking about their contested presence, and by learning about the incredible complexity of the eradication campaign, I began to unfold the intricate ways in which goats have participated in the making of the islands.\nMultispecies ethnography is a mess and should remain as such, as it opens to important questions about the human and nonhuman that defy simplistic answers.\nAED and AI: Throughout the article, you portray a complex multispecies entanglement among humans, goats, tortoises, dogs, mules, and various endemic plants (just to name a few). Could you say something about the process of conducting ethnographic fieldwork across multiple species? What advice do you have for anthropologists interested in pursuing a multispecies project?\nPB: Don’t sever the knots! The joy of conducting research and writing about goats and Proyecto Isabela lay in traversing geographical and jurisdictional terrains (such as the Park and the rural areas), ecological niches, disciplinary boundaries, and symbolic domains. From “scape-goats,” Mephistopheles, and chimeras, goats already carried a loaded history on their furry backs before their eradication on the Galápagos had begun. And, if Proyecto Isabela cast them as the chief un-doers of endemic nature, they also emerged as a troubling figure of the human species at a time of (concerns about) planetary ecological crisis. My article interrogates this latter figure of the human, as mobilized by goats, through ethnographic inquiry into the composition of the various humans involved, willingly or not, with PI: biologists, ecologists, veterinarians, hunters, farmers, fishermen, and longtime residents. The scrambling of domains and divides is by no means exclusive to conducting research on the Galápagos, though. Multispecies ethnography is a mess and should remain as such, as it opens to important questions about the human and nonhuman that defy simplistic answers.\nAED and AI: As you describe in the article, there was opposition to Proyecto Isabela by hunters, fishers, farmers, and other community members who were marginalized by the expansion of tourist and conservation activities. We’re interested in what more you can say about care in relation to the care shown (or not) to these human populations throughout the eradication campaign—especially given the warlike conditions that the campaign created and the enlistment of local hunters to do the work of massacre-scale killing. If these hunters and other community members can be considered part of the human–nonhuman assemblage created by Proyecto Isabela, then how do these populations inform your ideas about the limits and consequences of care and the hierarchical ranking of life forms—including the uneven ranks of humans—in conservation practices and projects?\nPB: Local hunters unwillingly participated in the care-full killing of goats during the eradication campaign: this is one way that the local population caused me to reflect on the contested nature of care. On the other hand, the goat eradication reactivated practices of care between some segments of the local population and the goats, which had been fading over time (with the archipelago-wide shift from subsistence farming and fishing to tourism). In this article, I am committed to honoring these people’s lifeworlds. But, in the heuristic spirit of tangles, I present their renewed ties with goats as but one of the many remainders unwanted by, and defiant of, Proyecto Isabela: hunters’ acts of defections, goats’ ingenious and adaptive will to live, and the unscheduled course of plant and animal assemblages in the eradicated areas and beyond. Rather than singleheartedly espousing their worldviews, I seek to account for locals’ protests and daily engagements with goats in order to illuminate the always plural nature of care.\nAED and AI: The article describes how “eradication demanded continuous care and an unprecedented intervention into animals’ bodies and sociality.” One of these interventions was the so-called Mata Hari goats, sterile females with hormone implants that prolonged their estrus cycle and thus enhanced gregariousness in their male counterparts. Would you view this as another instantiation of Proyecto Isabela’s mobilization of care—in this case, sociality or care between goats? What were some of the conversations around this manipulation of gender/sexual reproduction? How are such interventions, in your view, part of an ethic of care and multispecies flourishing?\nPB: I view Mata Haris as the pinnacle of this eradication intervention because of their profound reconfiguration of goats’ bodies and interactions with other goats. The result of close monitoring of goats’ responses to other eradication methods, the surgical procedure to create Mata Hari goats enacted unprecedented veterinary and conservation strategies, which I argue are forms of care. At the same time, the forging of Mata Haris dramatically exposes the fraught and morally ambiguous project of killing in order to save other forms of life. With my analysis of Mata Haris and throughout the article, I use the concept of care not as a way out of moral, political, and ecological complications, but, on the contrary, as a tool to fully explore them. I am aware of the unsettling consequences of this choice—for my readers as well as for myself.\nTo care, as the term’s etymology reminds us, is to grieve.1 In an intervention in which hundreds of thousands of animals died and ways of life faced extinction, caring as grieving is an important piece of the story. But caring for the life and death of a species is both a practical and ethical terrain that resists the binary of moral dilemmas about killing or not killing animals. I hope my article offers a counterpoint to the important, but not unproblematic, calls for care in the time of the Anthropocene.\nAED and AI: Finally, where do you hope to take your scholarship next?\nPB: To plants! I have done quite a bit of fieldwork on invasive and endemic plants, and the surprising ways they compose and exceed human and nonhuman assemblages. Another thread of my current research looks at forms of environmental religiosity on the Galápagos. Stay tuned!\n1. From Proto-Germanic *karo-, “lament,” hence “grief, care”; source also of Old High German charon, “to lament,” Old Saxon karon, “to care, to sorrow.”', 'Legal History—Palila goes to court\nThe Endangered Species Act of 1973 protects palila by providing for the conservation of ecosystems upon which threatened and endangered species of fish, wildlife, and plants depend, and prohibiting unauthorized taking, possession, sale, and transport of endangered species. Below is a summary of the colorful history of palila in court—the first species to ever be named as a plaintiff under the Endangered Species Act.\n9th Circuit Judge Samuel King was the first Federal judge of Hawaiian ancestry.\n- 1967—Palila were listed as a Federally Protected Species as a result of a continued population decline due to the degradation of the habitat they depend on.\n- 1973—Palila were listed as a Federally Endangered Species under the newly rewritten Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n- 1978—The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated Critical Habitat on Mauna Kea. Critical habitat is a specific geographic area(s) that is essential for the conservation of a threatened or endangered species and that may require special management and protection.\n- 1979—The landmark case, Palila versus the Hawai‘i Department of Land and Natural Resources, federal judge Samuel King ordered the Hawai‘i Department of Land and Natural Resources to stop maintaining any populations of feral sheep and goats within palila critical habitat on Mauna Kea, and to completely and permanently remove feral sheep and goats from critical habitat.\n- 1986—US District Court, Hawai‘i, decides that mouflon sheep in numbers sufficient for sport-hunting purposes are harmful to palila.\n- 1987—US District Court, Hawai‘i, orders that state must eradicate mouflon sheep and hybrids within one year and reaffirms previous order to eradicate feral sheep and goats.\n- 1998—Defendants and plaintiffs agree to a stipulation and order that DLNR will use its best efforts to minimize migration of ungulates into critical habitat, will continue to include public in eradication by eliminating bag limits and reducing seasonal restrictions and will allow hunting with firearms, guided hunts, and staff hunts, and will conduct semi-annual aerial hunts in which all ungulates seen will be shot.\n- 1999—Hunter organizations intervene and with DLNR move to modify the 1987 order; US District Court, Hawai‘i, denies their motion. The request by the defendants to modify the decision was filed on the grounds that introduced predators were the culprits in the decline of the Palila, and that removal of the sheep would increase the risk of fire since the sheep help to reduce fuel loads from flashy grasses. The court affirmed that palila were endangered due to habitat loss from the sheep, that use of the sheep to reduce the fire risk would prevent forest recovery, and denied the motion to modify.\n- 2000—Hunter organizations file an appeal of the 1999 decision; US Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, dismisses the appeal on the grounds that the group lacks standing.\n- 2009—Earthjustice files motion to enforce the eradication orders of 1979, 1987, and 1998. In its arguments to the court, the State indicated that it would complete the fence work and complete the removal of the sheep in a timely manner.']	['<urn:uuid:d2ee9efe-77be-4db2-965b-39828f46d98f>', '<urn:uuid:83030975-cdc5-47ca-96e8-23385633ffce>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	6	50	1791
77	ventilation airflow low vs blocked registers which worse	Based on the documents, a blocked or closed main damper in registers has a more severe impact on airflow than reduced ventilation flow. While the underperforming supply fan discussed in document 1 reduced airflow by 25-30%, the closed main damper in document 2 restricted airflow so severely that some rooms only received 8-10 CFM compared to properly flowing registers receiving over 100 CFM, representing a much larger percentage reduction.	['Monitoring and maintaining building ventilation rates are now more relevant than ever for occupant health and safety. In this article, I share how our team diagnosed an underperforming supply fan and underscore the importance of routine fan system maintenance.\nIn March of this year, I conducted airflow measurements at a Bay Area building and discovered that the building’s largest ventilation unit was operating at 30% below its design airflow. The supply fan was constant-speed, and airflow measurements from the building’s inception indicated that the unit originally achieved the flowrate it was designed to provide.\nThe other three ventilation units onsite all operated near their design flows. So, what was going on with the largest ventilation unit?\nDiagnosing Reduced Airflow in Your Building Ventilation System\nAt this site, we had a test and balance (TAB) report from when the building was constructed, so we knew the fan speed that corresponded with system operating at near design flow. We measured the fan’s speed to be about 74% of what it was at the building’s inception.\nBecause of the ductwork configuration and difficult under-roof access, we could not conduct a pitot traverse measurement, which is the most accurate method of HVAC airflow measurement. Instead, we used a velocity grid, shown below, to measure airspeed at the inlet of the unit.\nVelocity Grid at Supply Air Intake\nBy multiplying the airspeed at the supply air intake by the cross-sectional area, we calculated the volumetric flowrate in cubic feet per minute (cfm). Our flow measurement was 69% of the design flow, as shown in the chart below.\nComparison of Design and Measured Supply Airflow Rates\nAirflow measurements typically have an accuracy of ±10%, so multiple methods and measurements can lend confidence to an airflow estimate. Given that our speed measurement suggested a 26% reduction in flow and our airspeed measurement indicated a 31% reduction in flow, we were fairly confident in asserting that the building ventilation unit had undergone a 25% to 30% reduction supply airflow.\nCauses of Reduced Flow in Your Building Ventilation System\nWe didn’t see anything choking airflow, but the dramatic drop in fan speed from the design speed was a clue. We didn’t have time to look at the fan’s belt drive, but we asked the building engineer about the reduction in flow before we left.\nHe said there were no changes to the ductwork, but he would inspect the belt drive. A week later he called and told me that the belt was beginning to bottom out in the motor pulley, such as shown in the image below. (Note that in belt drives, pulleys are also sometimes called sheaves (pronounced shiv).) We both agreed that something was likely wrong with the belt, and it should be replaced.\nBelt Beginning Bottom Out in Sheave Groove\nImage Credit: TB Wood’s\nWhen a belt drops into a pulley groove, as shown above, the pulley’s effective diameter is reduced, which reduces belt speed. This results in a reduction in fan shaft speed and airflow. There are several explanations for why this occurs.\nWorn Pully Walls\nFirst, if the pulley walls are worn, the belt will bottom out more easily, and the pulley should be replaced.\nSecond, if the belt is worn, it will drop deeper into the groove and it should be replaced.\nIncorrect Belt Dimensions\nThird, if the belt has the wrong dimensions required by the pulley, it will not fit properly and should be replaced with the correct belt size.\nThe Result: Belt Slip\nAny of these situations can lead to belt slip, which wastes the belt’s energy and creates heat that can quickly degrade the belt’s structural integrity. Typically, the first sign of belt slip is a screeching sound when the motor starts or stops, or if it’s really worn, it may whine continuously. This is why I recommend using all of your senses in an energy audit. What you hear can be as important as what you see. Any time you hear equipment running, it points to waste. If the equipment were efficient, it would be quiet, by definition. Noise represents energy leaking out of a system in a way you don’t want, generally through a friction-prone weak spot like a sheave, belt, or bearing.\nBelt Drive Alignment\nAnother issue affecting power transmission in belt drives is alignment. Poor alignment results in increased friction on the belt and additional stress on the drivetrain, which accelerates wear and can reduce airflow. The diagram below shows common alignment issues with belt drives.\nAlignment Issues in Belt Drive Systems\nImage Credit: TB Wood’s\nOf course, perfect alignment is not always possible. Therefore, many fan manufacturers provide tolerances for deviations from perfect alignment, such as the maximum allowable gaps shown in the image below.\nSheave Alignment Tolerances\nImage Credit: Cook O&M Manual\nThe building engineer reported to us that he carefully inspects for belt drive alignment, so fortunately this was not an issue at his building.\nFan Performance & Energy Impacts\nPulley alignment, belt sizing for the pulley grooves, and belt tension are common causes of underperformance for fan systems. These issues cause more mechanical energy to be dissipated through friction and less energy to be converted into airflow. The motor still consumes relatively high amounts of power, but the fan receives less of that power.\nBelts are the most maintenance intensive aspect of a fan assembly. If the belts are too loose or of the incorrect dimensions, the transmission efficiency of mechanical power is reduced. If the belts are too tight, wear and tear of the system’s belts and bearings will accelerate. Finding the correct belt size and the sweet spot of belt tension will keep your system at optimal performance.\nImprove Your Building Ventilation\nA couple months after my initial measurements, the building engineer called and told me that he had replaced the belt with a new one that was correctly sized and flush with the pulley. Unfortunately, I was not able to re-evaluate the supply airflow to quantify the difference in ventilation, but we both felt more peace of mind knowing that the belt drive on that ventilation unit was restored to good condition.\nRoutine maintenance inspections help avoid performance degradation. Consult the Operations & Maintenance manual of your equipment for recommended maintenance procedures. ASHRAE Standard 180 also provides standard practice for inspection and maintenance of commercial building HVAC systems.\nIf you have questions about building ventilation systems or your building’s energy use, contact us at any time.', 'Residential Airflow Balancing: Why It Matters in Creating More Comfortable Homes\nNear Minneapolis, the Jones family was having serious comfort issues in their two-story colonial.\nEach winter, the upstairs master suite was so cold the owners had to use an electric blanket, while rooms down the hall were too warm. The problem reversed itself in summer, when the master suite overheated and the other bedrooms were too cold. The main level experienced similar issues, with the living room over-conditioned and barely any air reaching the family room.\nComfort problems like these are common in residential HVAC, and can be difficult to diagnose and solve without knowing the airflow of each supply register. Despite challenges of airflow measurement and balancing, this is an essential practice to ensure the long-term comfort and satisfaction of your customers.\nThe Jones home is an ideal example to demonstrate how residential airflow balancing works, how to overcome challenges and how this practice can benefit your business and customers.\nAIRFLOW BALANCING: THE PROCESS, CHALLENGES, AND BENEFITS\nAirflow balancing has typically been limited to commercial HVAC, but there is a growing demand and opportunity to bring this practice to residential HVAC.\nAt its most basic, airflow balancing involves opening and closing supply register dampers to more evenly condition a home.\nTechnicians open or close dampers based on how much airflow each register receives and what is needed to condition a room based on its load calculation. The process starts with all dampers fully open to measure how much air each register delivers, then dampers are closed in rooms that are getting too much airflow relative to the required flow. Airflow capture hoods are the recommended tools to gather flow measurements.\nThere are a number of challenges that greet HVAC technicians who undertake airflow balancing. The cost of equipment is only one part of the equation.\nMost hoods are designed for commercial applications with large 24-by-24-inch openings. This presents a key hurdle in residential testing because there is a wide variety of register shapes and sizes that need to be tested, and they are almost always smaller than typical commercial vents.\nAccessing these registers is another obstacle, with crown molding, toe-kick and other placements making it difficult to achieve a good seal. Residential registers also have lower airflow than commercial ones, which can be more difficult to measure.\nDespite these challenges, there’s an opportunity for residential HVAC companies to set themselves apart in the market by offering airflow balancing. This service can help improve customer satisfaction because new systems deliver air as promised, creating a positive return on investment for your customer and reducing the volume of callbacks for comfort issues.\nDIAGNOSING THE SOURCE OF COMFORT PROBLEMS\nComfort issues plagued the Jones family because their home was poorly balanced, even though their furnace and air conditioner were both functioning properly.\nThe first step in diagnosing the issue from an HVAC perspective was to gather measurements and observations about the 3,100-square-foot home, and test flow at each register.\nThe basement was mostly finished and conditioned, and the home’s walls and attic were well insulated. The home measured a good air tightness of 2.4 ACH50. Air handler flow measured 536 CFM, and static pressure in the supply plenum was 0.53 in W.C. The furnace was located on the western side of the home’s basement.\nWith these measurements, it was time to measure the airflow at each register. This offered a way to diagnose issues and improve airflow on a room-by-room basis.\nIn the Jones home, these tests revealed that airflow was extremely unbalanced both upstairs and downstairs, and room to room. Two registers in the master suite were only measuring a total of 8 cfm, while the bedrooms down the hall measured 114 and 115 each. On the main level, one living room register measured 144 cfm, while the two family room registers measured 10 cfm total. Between upstairs and downstairs, and one side of the house to another, airflow was not sufficiently consistent with the heating and cooling loads. (See Figure 1.)\nThe source of the extreme imbalance was within the duct system. The main damper was mistakenly closed, meaning most air only reached the one or two registers per floor that branched from the center trunk line before the closed damper, and did not reach other areas of the home.\nThe damper was opened, which increased air handler flow by 15 percent and reduced static pressure in the supply plenum to one-fifth of its original measurement. This greatly improved the family’s comfort, although they still reported that flow to the rooms was unbalanced.\nAdditional airflow measurements confirmed the homeowners’ complaint. While airflow via the combined master-bedroom registers had increased from 8 cfm to 42 cfm, the room still felt poorly conditioned compared to the other bedrooms because the airflow was still not sufficient to meet the load. The family room improved from 10 cfm total to 29 cfm, but the living room’s flow was still much higher at 71 cfm. (See Figure 2.)\nAIR FLOW BALANCING TO IMPROVE COMFORT\nWhile opening the damper helped deliver more air more evenly throughout the home, airflow balancing was still needed to improve comfort.\nWith findings from the second airflow test, the technician began closing dampers in the over-conditioned rooms to make sure each room received the appropriate amount of air. This channeled more air into the under-conditioned rooms.\nIdeally, room-by-room calculations should be done first to find the total airflow, in cfm, required to heat or cool each room. Airflow balancing should then set airflow in each room to match the required cfm. However, many homes have airflow that is so poorly distributed that a load calculation is not even necessary.\nIt will be obvious to technicians with some experience that a master bedroom almost twice the size of the bedrooms at the end of the hall, with more exterior wall area and larger windows, will need much more airflow to be properly conditioned. In these cases, even a rough guesstimate of the correct airflow can create an enormous improvement in comfort. This was the case with the Jones home.\nBy adjusting just a few of the dampers, the technician was able to achieve a reasonably well-balanced home. Final testing showed the master bedroom now measures a total 58 cfm, with the other bedrooms at 39 and 38. The living room register that started at 144 cfm is now at 32 cfm, with the family room totaling 37 cfm. The total second floor airflow is 172 cfm, with the main floor at 180 cfm. (See Figure 3.)\nAIRFLOW BALANCING: BENEFITS FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS AND YOUR BUSINESS\nResidential airflow balancing is an important practice to ensure homeowner comfort, and can also benefit your business.\nWhen a customer purchases a new furnace, air conditioner or both, they often expect a level of comfort equal to or better than their old system. In the Jones home example, the homeowner had purchased a new furnace but it hadn’t fixed their comfort issues.\nAirflow balancing can be a natural next step after installing a new appliance. By testing how much airflow travels to different rooms, you can better deliver on a customer’s expectations. This additional service can also improve overall comfort and decrease the chance of callbacks regarding comfort complaints, helping boost overall customer satisfaction.\nPublication date: 10/22/2018']	['<urn:uuid:c61be574-5c36-4629-a8ef-0ca1d141d2ab>', '<urn:uuid:a65f47bc-22c8-4415-b927-faf70190bdaa>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	8	69	2298
78	As someone studying the evolution of jazz worldwide, I'm curious if there were any significant jazz scenes outside the United States in the early 1950s - particularly in Africa?	Bulawayo jazz, which emerged from Bulawayo, Zimbabwe in the early 1950s, was, along with Gypsy Jazz, the only jazz scene existing outside of the USA in the late-1940s/early-1950s. This style of afro-jazz featured alto sax leads in ensembles that included tenor sax, trumpet, guitars, double bass, tubas and trombones. A prominent figure was August Msarurgwa, leader of The African Dance Band of the Cold Storage Commission of Southern Rhodesia, who composed the hit 'Skokiaan' - a song that was later covered by famous artists like Louis Armstrong, The Four Lads, Alma Cogan, Bill Haley and His Comets, and Herb Alpert.	"['- 1 African Popular Music\n- 2 West Africa\n- 3 Music blogs with downloads\n- 4 Sources\nAfrican Popular Music\nThe term African Popular Music doesn\'t refer to any particular genre or sound, it\'s a commonly used generic term to describe all forms of modern music from Africa. Most of these genres incorporate western influences like Rock, Rhythm & Blues and Jazz into the basic sounds of African Folk Music.\nBongo Flava is a creation by Tanzanian youth beginning in the late 1990s. The genre takes roots in Hip Hop from the United States of America and fusing various other genres including Rhythm & Blues, Afrobeat, Dancehall, as well as some of the native Tanzanian music of Taarab and Dansi.\nHighlife originally began in Ghana as a blend of brass band music with the more danceable and less ""official"" rhythms of rumba and Calypso in the 1930s. Later the genre became more Jazz & Swing influenced and has often been somewhat incorrectly called a jazz subgenre. Highlife is very popular in Nigeria, Ghana and their neighbouring countries and also paved the way for the globally better known Afrobeat.\nNotable artists: Sir Victor Uwaifo, Eddie Quansah, Otarus, Celestine Ukwu, The African Brothers, Gasper Lawal, Chief Stephen Osita Osadebe, The Anambra Beats.\n- Rough Guide To Highlife This Rough Guide is jam-packed with some of the biggest hitters in highlife history. Enjoy Victor Uwaifo’s Nigerian joromi stylings, the gentle Ghanaian palm-wine of Koo Nimo, and even an early recording of Afrobeat superstar Fela Kuti presenting a firmly highlife vibe. Listen on: Deezer, Rdio Spotify\nA style of Nigerian pop music derived from Yoruba music traditions and influenced by Western rock, funk and reggae. More percussive oriented, no horn section, much more psychedelic then Afrobeat.\nNotable artists: King Sunny Adé, Ebenezer Obey, Tunde Nightingale.\nA blend of Cuban rumba and other Latin American music with the folk music of the Congo area. Originally called just ""African rumba"", the name soukous is now used for the various rumba derivatives of Central Africa.\nSouthern African popular music encompasses popular music genres from Southern African regions such as a cappella Mbube, jazz genres like Marabi, Mbaqanga, Kwela and Cape Jazz, local Electronic Dance Music styles Kwaito and Shangaan Electro, and other local popular genres. These popular music styles mainly consist of a combination of a worldwide popular genre like Jazz, Gospel, Rock or Electronic music, with the melody, the rhythm, the traditional instruments, etc. of a local, regional or ethnic Southern African traditional music, for examples Zulu, Sotho, Afrikaan or San (Bushmen) folk music leading to local specific style, playing and interpretation.\nBulawayo jazz is a style of afro-jazz that emerged from the city of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe in the early 1950s. The lead is assured by the alto sax in ensembles including tenor sax, trumpet, guitars, double bass, tubas and trombones.\nBulawayo jazz has been brought in the occidental world by Hugh Tracey, who recorded the material of Bulawayo Jazz: Southern Rhodesia, Zimbawbe 1950, \'51, \'52 in the early 1950s. Along with Gypsy Jazz, it\'s the sole jazz scene existing outside of the USA in the late-1940s/early-1950s.\nA prominent Zimbabwean jazz player from the 1950s was August Msarurgwa. Msarurgwa was the leader of The African Dance Band of the Cold Storage Commission of Southern Rhodesia and composed the hit ""Skokiaan"". This may be the most well-known Bulawayo jazz song and has been covered by such artists as Louis Armstrong, The Four Lads, Alma Cogan, Bill Haley and His Comets and Herb Alpert, among many others.\nThe style is no longer leading the scene in Zimbabwe, replaced by modern popular genres like Kwaito. Nevertheless, some artists like The Cool Crooners are still playing Bulawayo jazz in clubs in Bulawayo and Harare.\nEmerging from South Africa in the early 1990s, Kwaito is a music genre that takes influence from Disco, Hip Hop, and - most obviously - American and British House music. Its songs usually feature deep basslines, looped samples from more traditional styles of African music, and often sung or rapped vocals, which are usually male.\nThis sound from South Africa emerged from Marabi in the early 1950s. Kwela is rooted in Malawi and local South African traditional music such as Zulu music, and is influenced by Jazz as well. The four bar themes get repeated and mildly varied. The happy melodies of Kwela are mostly played by different flutes such as pennywhistle flutes and are often accompanied by banjo or guitar. Kwela became popular in Malawi as well and was prominent worldwide in the 1950s. The most significant artists are South African Lemmy ""Special"" Mabaso and Spokes Mashiyane, Malawian Donald Kachamba, as well as South African Elias & His Zig Zag Jive Flutes who performed in 1958 the internationally famous song Tom Hark.\nMarabi is a Jazz and Southern African Popular Music style with origins in the 1920s. This genre came to existence in the ghettos and the shebeens of Johannesburg and is rooted in traditional South African music. The formerly simplistic organ and piano style (resembling Ragtime to a certain extent, and often accompanied by different percussion instruments and later on also played by reeds) was brought to a larger audience and taken to a higher artistic level by artists such as Abdullah Ibrahim, Johnny Dyani, Basil Coetzee, The African Jazz Pioneers, Miriam Makeba (early period) and others. This sound came to prominence as it was used as a form of protest against the exploitation of the people of South Africa. From a more Swing-based Marabi combined with Zulu and Xhosa cultures emerged Kwela and Mbaqanga. These made the international popularity of Marabi music genres increase respectively in the 1950s and the 1960s.\nMbaqanga is a popular Zulu genre of South African music, that emerged from the traditional Marabi Jazz and Swing as well as Kwela popular South African genres. Mbaqanga is much more based on Big Band Swing. It appeared in the early 1960s from South African shebeens. Like Kwela, Mbaqanga has rural Zulu roots and continues to influence musicians worldwide today. The early prominent Mbaqanga artists were Makgona Tsohle Band, Mahlathini and Mahotella Queens, Sipho Mchunu accompanied by Johnny Clegg with Juluka band. Today this genre is less active although Mahotella Queens reduced to three members are still performing.\nMbube is a form of Southern African Popular Music, traditionally performed A cappella in a powerful and loud way.\nNotable artists: Solomon Linda, Miriam Makeba, Ladysmith Black Mambazo.\n- Soweto Never Sleeps: Classic Female Zulu Jive\n- Mbube Roots - Zulu Choral Music from South Africa, 1930s-1960s\nShangaan electro is an Electronic Dance Music genre from South Africa with very fast BPM (around 180) and features MIDI keyboard sounds and marimba. The genre took form around 2005 with the productions of Richard ""Nozinja"" Mthethwa who wanted to make marimba-based Shangaan music but with a faster pace.\nNotable artists: Penny Penny, Tshe-Tsha Boys, Mark Ernestus, Anthony Shake Shakir.\n- Living Is Hard: West African Music in Britain, 1927-1929 LIVING IS HARD… is the first in a series of compilations drawing on the exquisitely rare 78s housed in EMI’s Hayes Archives. While the archives represent a staggering diversity of music from all corners of the globe, for this outing, the producers at Honest Jon’s choose to focus on West African transplants residing in the British Isles during the height of the modern colonial era. Serving as a unique snapshot into the immigrant experience, the music represented is a window into the folk and community-based traditions of the African Diaspora--and a revealing look at the beginnings of modern-day genres such as high-life. Listen on: Deezer, Rdio Spotify\n- Marvellous Boy - Calypso From West Africa The inter-war dance bands of British West Africa are often strikingly similar in sound to Trinidadian orchestras like Lovey\'s String Band (credited with the first calypso recordings, in 1912). However, the first West African calypso recordings in the modern style are from Freetown, Sierra Leone in the early 1950s, by Ebenezer Calendar and Famous Scrubbs. In arrangements blending African and European instruments, the brass plays out the legacy of colonial military bands, albeit hair-down and a little ramshackle now; and the beautiful creole lyrics are as upful, quick, current, musical and intimate as any classic calypsonian\'s.

79	wildlife conservation laws effects management options	Conservation laws and management now focus on balancing wildlife populations through regulated hunting and damage prevention programs, as evidenced by Wisconsin's Wildlife Damage Abatement and Claims Program for deer management. This represents a significant improvement from historical cases where lack of regulation led to extinctions, such as the Passenger Pigeon and Carolina Parakeet, which were both hunted to extinction by 1918.	['When we watch the looting and destruction during recent rioting, we wonder why anyone would want to destroy their neighborhood and the future of their community for the short-term gain of a few stolen items from a smashed store window. But then, I feel the same way when I hear of a poaching case involving the wildlife of Indiana.\nThis is a segment of society that is ignorant or apathetic to the reason behind Indiana’s regulated hunting and fishing. We have a rich and beautiful ecological tapestry, but its resources are not infinite. We only have to look back at our history to see what we have lost forever. The slaughter of our wild Passenger Pigeons and Carolina Parakeets are just two examples.\nIn the early 1800s the Passenger Pigeon, a larger cousin of the Morning Dove, seemed as numerous as the stars. It is estimated that three to five billion Passenger Pigeons lived in eastern North America in the late 18th Century. Newspapers of the day told of flocks in unfathomable numbers that darkened the sun for hours as they migrated.\n“[My father] says, in 1831-2, the pigeon roosts in the vicinity of Vernon, which had become noted as the most extensive in that part of the State, were occupied by great numbers of pigeons. They moved in flocks so large the sky could not be seen in any direction as far as the eye could reach. They also nested in that locality in great abundance.” Amos Butler, Birds of Indiana (1897) (Project Passenger Pigeon, n.d.)\n“In the early seventies of the last century, wild pigeons were plentiful in Dubois County. They flew over Jasper in flocks long enough to hide the sun, often in what seemed a quarter of a mile wide and twice as long.” George Wilson, Historical Notes on DuBois County, Vol. VII, date unknown, Jasper, IN Public Library (courtesy of Theresia Schwinghammer) (Project Passenger Pigeon, n.d.)\nTheir combined weight would bend and break tree limbs as they roosted.\n“The pigeons came in such flocks [in Wabash County] that we frequently found places where they had settled so thickly on the branches of trees having brittle wood, such as maple and beech, that quite good-sized limbs had been broken down from the weight of the pigeons that swarmed over then to brood by night. In my childhood it was customary for men to take long poles and big bags and lanterns and go searching through the woods until they found of these perching places of the pigeons. The half-a-dozen men would flash the lanterns in such a manner that the light would blind the birds, and with the clubs others would beat the birds from the limbs, strike them down and gather them up by the bagful.” Gene Stratton-Porter (mid 1870s), Tales You Won’t Believe (1925) (Project Passenger Pigeon, n.d.)\nTheir numbers seemed endless as farmers suffocated them with smudge pots by the thousands as they roosted, just to feed their hogs with the lifeless bodies. Markets hunters would follow the flocks and slaughter as many as they could to sell by the barrel to the hungry city dwellers back east.\nEven as conservationists started sounding the alarm that the Passenger Pigeon was rapidly vanishing, train loads of people would follow the remaining flocks to kill their share of the wild pigeon. While legislation did get passed to halt the slaughter, it was too little, too late. What they didn’t realize is that the passenger Pigeon needed large numbers of birds to continue breeding. Many hunters refused to believe that they should change and continued killing as many as they could.\nIn 1914 the last Passenger Pigeon died in captivity in the Cincinnati Zoo.\nFew Hoosiers realize that a species of brightly colored parrot used to call Indiana home. Huge flocks of the noisy Carolina Parakeet searched our forests for mast and fruit. As pioneers moved west, the parrots found the lush orchards of Hoosier farmers perfect for a meal. Understandably, the farmers didn’t appreciate having the fruits of their labors consumed by 200-300 parrots at a time. War was declared.\nAlong with the anger of the farmers, women’s fashions turned to brightly colored feathers to decorate hats and dresses. The markets hunters didn’t have to go to the tropics to find them, and the Carolina Parakeet was the perfect prey. When one bird was injured, the rest of the flock tried to protect their flock member and stayed close by for support. The market hunters easily slaughtered entire flocks at a time\nLike the Passenger Pigeon, the last one died in captivity at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1918.\nA true hunter is ethical and respects the life that they take. They do everything in their power to assure that the species they hunt more than survives, it must thrive. If a person is just out for the thrill of killing something or to destroy a resource, then let’s call them what they really are, a criminal, because they are robbing future generations of something wonderful; a thread in our rich tapestry.\nMany of our natural resources are already under siege. As grain commodities rise, more and more marginal land is drained, cleared, and tilled. Urban sprawl infects places that once held quail and grouse. Change of land use is inevitable, but there is one act that should never be tolerated, and that is the sense poaching of our wild creatures.\nThe dominate image that comes to mind when poaching is brought up is of a husband and father trying to provide a meal for their family. In ninety-nine percent of the cases, this is simply not true. Studies from neighboring states have shown the vast majority of poachers are after monetary gain, a trophy to mount on the wall, or simply for the lust of destroying another creature.\nRegulated hunting is sustainable. The IDNR strives to find a balance in the interaction of man and beast, fish, and fowl. Poaching circumvents the balancing act and hurts Hoosiers in many ways.\nThe most obvious is the loss of endangered animals. Ruffed grouse are on the brink of becoming extirpated across much of its range, including Indiana. The poaching of just one or two grouse can cause generations of damage. While there has been some progress in revitalizing ruffed grouse habitat in some southern counties, it means nothing if there are no ruffed grouse left to use it.\nAnother danger of poaching is the disenfranchising of existing hunters and fishermen. Some of Indiana’s wildlife, such as wild turkey, are extremely easy to kill in mass, if a poacher knows how. Indiana’s turkey are already in decline due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Wiping out an entire flock could cause the loss of regulated hunting opportunities for generations. In such a case, hunters often give up hunting and do not pass their knowledge and passion on to future generations. The loss of any hunters lessens our collective voice in the statehouse on matters that concern Indiana’s natural resources.\nPoachers are rarely good land stewards. They usually commit other unlawful acts such as property theft and property damage as they steal our wild game. The frustration of dealing with cut fences, stolen tools, vandalized farm implements, and damage to valuable hardwoods often hardens a property owner’s heart to legal hunting. The non-hunting public has a tendency of painting hunters with a broad brush of irresponsibility and mayhem.\nNot to mention every time a Bald eagle, Sandhill crane, or some other high-profile game or non-game animal is poached, the media impugns the integrity of all hunters, which further hardens the public’s’ hearts and minds.\nWhy am I sounding the clarion trumpet? As I travel the state and talk to the IDNR biologists and Conservation Officers, I hear the stories of the senseless waste of our natural resources and have to question the direction segments of our society are taking. We should all be passionate about conservation, and what we pass down to our children and grandchildren. Along with protecting our freedoms, we should also be protecting their heritage. Stamping out poaching is just one arrow we have in our quiver to assure that future Hoosiers will hear the springtime drumming of grouse, watch the soaring of an eagle, or feel the tug of a massive flathead catfish.\nThis last year an amazing and wonderful part of our history has been returned to Hoosiers. As many of you know, a black bear has taken up residence in southern Indiana. Many of us hope it is the beginning of the re-population of an animal that has been too long gone from our forests and hills. There are others that would like nothing better than to seek it out and kill it.\nWhen something wild is lost, like the Passenger Pigeon or Carolina Parakeet, we lose part of ourselves. To have the possibility to regain something wild is almost magical. We need to do everything we can to assure that struggling species survive, and with them, our hunting heritage.\nHow can you help? If you see something, say something. It’s that simple. Whether it’s on social media, an Internet discussion board, or the local coffee shop, poachers seem to love to brag about their exploits. If you hear or see something, just call in. It couldn’t be easier with the TIP program.\nWhat is TIP?\nTurn in a Poacher, Inc. (TIP) is a non-profit conservation organization that works hand-in-hand with Indiana DNR Law Enforcement to protect our fish and wildlife resources by increasing public support and involvement in bringing violators to justice.\nA poacher is a thief who illegally steals wildlife that belongs to each Indiana citizen. Poachers rob licensed, ethical hunters and anglers from recreational opportunities they bought through license fees.\nCitizens can help stop poachers in two ways:\n- Call 1-800-TIP-IDNR if you see, hear or learn about a poacher or another fish and wildlife violation. If your “TIP” leads to an arrest, you may receive as much as a $200 reward, and you can remain anonymous.\n- Become an honorary member of the Turn in a Poacher Advisory Board (tip.wildindiana.com). Annual and lifetime memberships are available, and all proceeds from memberships go directly to assisting Indiana DNR Law Enforcement with catching poachers. (TIP hats and gear also available).\nMore information is available at www.in.gov/dnr/lawenfor/2745.htm.', 'White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are perhaps the best known species of big game wildlife, especially in the state of Wisconsin. They are a native species and therefore belong on the landscape. In addition, they have intrinsic value, such as providing a host of ecosystem services (seed dispersers), and being a valuable part of the food chain in terms of prey for predators. Aside from these benefits, their extrinsic values are also numerous, for example, people get immense enjoyment from feeding, seeing, photographing, and painting pictures of deer, especially mature bucks with a full set of antlers. Undoubtedly however what gets many the most excited is the opportunity to harvest a deer for the meat and taxidermy mount, plus the stories that go with each deer season. And accompanying deer harvest is a very generous boost to the state’s economy. According to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR), hunting generates $2.5 billion dollars annually from hunting license sales, purchase of hunting gear, and food, fuel, and lodging/trip expenses to access hunting areas; in addition to jobs directly and indirectly associated with hunting. Eighty-eight percent of the $2.5 billion total each year comes from the 9-day deer gun season, according to the WDNR.\nDespite all of the benefits associated with white-tailed deer, negative consequences result from deer on the landscape. Deer can create problems, for example, for nursery and Christmas tree growers and arborists, primarily through browsing activity and during the mating season when they tend to rub woody vegetation with their antlers. Being herbivores deer eat a wide variety of plant and woody vegetation. Having permanently lost the incisors (front teeth) on their upper jaw, deer pinch vegetation between the incisors on their bottom jaw and the incisor-free upper jaw as they chew and pull on the plant material, leaving a square or ragged break where the browse occurs. Male deer (bucks) grow antlers, beginning in late spring each year. Antler growth is regulated by increasing hormone levels (mostly testosterone) in the male’s body, and hormone levels are regulated by increasing day length in the spring and decreasing day length in the fall. By end of each summer, antler growth is nearly complete. Most antler damage to woody vegetation occurs in the fall when bucks rub trees to remove velvet (hair-like material) from their antlers and to scent-mark their territory. Buck rubs can be seen between ground level and about 3-4 feet above ground level; tend to occur most commonly on smaller diameter trees; and have the appearance of the outer bark being shredded or removed, exposing the inner bark. Buck rubs can be unsightly, especially on trees for sale, but also expose the tree to insect and disease damage.\nThere are a range of management options to reduce or eliminate deer damage, but it is most effective to choose the best practice based on the specific situation and location. Where possible the most cost-efficient management option for deer damage is almost always to harvest deer to reduce the local population, thereby potentially reducing the amount of damage. If you’re able to harvest deer on your property, a number of deer seasons occur throughout the fall and into early winter. It is important to understand the buck to doe ratio in your area; for example, if there are four does (or antlerless deer) for every buck, you should harvest at least four does for every buck harvested on your property in order to at least stabilize the growth of the deer population. Harvesting five or six does for every buck would help to decrease the deer population on your property. In addition, you may be eligible for deer depredation permits depending on your location and the types of agricultural crops (including trees) you grow. Depredation permits allow you to harvest deer outside of defined deer seasons. Check with your county biologist with the WDNR to see if you’re eligible for depredation permits.\nOutside of the lethal option of harvesting deer, a number of non-lethal management practices also exist. The most effective non-lethal option to protect trees from both browse and rub damage is some type of fencing to prevent deer from accessing the plant material. Fencing may be relatively inexpensive and temporary, like electric fencing, or more permanent (up to 30 years) and relatively expensive like 8-foot tall, high-tensile woven wire fencing. Electric or high-tensile fencing can be used to exclude deer from a relatively large area; in addition to fencing off large areas, individual trees may be protected using tree guards. Tree guards can be purchased commercially or made from a variety of materials, including screen, chicken wire, or chain link fence, among other materials.\nManagement practices other than fencing, like repellents and an assortment of harassment measures may be effective, depending on the situation. However, these type of management options tend to be relatively short-term in their effectiveness, can be relatively expensive, and labor intensive.\nLastly, you may be eligible for the Wisconsin Wildlife Damage Abatement and Claims Program (WDACP), a state program that cost-shares non-lethal management practices like deer fencing and financially compensates the land owner for deer damage. Check with your county biologist with the WDNR to see if you’re eligible for the WDACP.\nArticle by: David Drake, Extension Wildlife Specialist / Professor, Dept. of Forest and Wildlife Ecology, University of Wisconsin-Madison']	['<urn:uuid:4f36fed2-1074-46d2-aa1c-fedba1d6f3b3>', '<urn:uuid:9f78165a-0487-4c05-8c3e-92dcf23f89fb>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	6	61	2610
80	how qualified surgeons reduce surgery risks preparation postoperative care microvascular reconstructive	Qualified surgeons must be board certified and experienced in specific procedures like microvascular surgery. Risk reduction involves proper surgical preparation and detailed postoperative care, including taking prescribed medications and attending follow-up appointments. For procedures like microvascular reconstruction, success depends on precise surgical technique using microscopes and ultra-fine sutures, typically allowing for single-procedure treatment.	['Our multidisciplinary team allows us to provide the best possible care for our reconstructive patients. The surgical team includes board certified physicians with training in oral maxillofacial surgery, microvascular surgery, cosmetic surgery, maxillofacial prosthodontics, anaplastology, and general dentistry. Maxillofacial prosthodontics specialists are available for facial and oral prosthetic rehabilitation, including replacement of missing teeth using dental implants. Our anaplastologist can create any structure within the face including prosthetic noses, ears, and eyes. Further information regarding maxillofacial prosthetics and anaplastology can be found on the Center for Maxillofacial Prosthodontics page.\nMicrovascular surgery is a technically demanding procedure during which tissue grafts harvested (taken) from the arms, legs, abdomen, or back are transferred to the mouth, throat, or face to replace missing tissues.\nCandidates for this type of surgery include patients who require surgery for oral/head and neck cancer, or suffer from the effects of radiation therapy given to treat head and neck cancer, as well as patients with severe traumatic injuries of the face or neck. Areas commonly reconstructed include the jaws and mouth, the throat, and all areas of the face, scalp, and neck.\nA successful outcome in this type of reconstructive surgery depends upon meticulous suturing of one to three milimeter blood vessels using a microscope and sutures that are finer than human hair to reestablish blood flow to the tissue graft. For patients undergoing surgery to remove a cancer, use of this technique allows for immediate reconstruction of the bone or soft tissue defect and generally ensures that the patient undergoes only one surgical procedure.\nOur oral and maxillofacial surgeons are experienced in reconstructing nasal injuries or deformities and functional breathing problems arising as a result of a broken nose, previous nasal surgery, treatment of nasal skin cancer, and congenital problems, including the nasal deformity commonly associated with cleft lips.\nPatients who have suffered a recent broken nose are advised to be evaluated between 5 to 10 days after the injury has occurred, as they may be candidates to undergo reduction of a displaced nasal bone fracture in the office setting, potentially avoiding the need for surgery. Patients with longstanding nasal fractures resulting in a nasal deformity or nasal breathing difficulty may be considered for reconstruction of their problem by means of septorhinoplasty. Our surgeons can also perform revision surgery for patients with unsatisfactory results after previous nasal surgery.\nFacial Bone Reconstruction\nSurgical team members are highly skilled and experienced in treating patients who have suffered fractures involving the jaw bones, the cheek bones, the orbital bones, and the skull. Surgery can often be accomplished using incisions which are well hidden by placement inside the mouth, in hair bearing scalp skin, and on the inside of the eyelids, often avoiding visible facial scars. Patients with recent fractures or problems that persist after remote facial fractures are often considered to be candidates for reconstruction.\nMohs Reconstruction of the head and neck is a procedure that may be performed by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon after Mohs Surgery is performed to remove skin cancer. A Mohs procedure offers the best cure rates. Sometimes these defects after removal of skin cancer are large and require sedation or general anesthesia for reconstruction. We have extensive experience surgically closing these large defects while the patient is under comfortable anesthesia.', 'Cosmetic surgery has become increasingly popular over the years, offering individuals the opportunity to enhance their physical appearance and boost self-confidence.\nHowever, these procedures come with certain risks. In this article, we will explore what cosmetic surgery is, the factors determining the risk involved, and the most riskiest cosmetic surgery procedures.\nFinally, we will discuss ways to reduce the risks associated with cosmetic surgery.\nWhat is Cosmetic Surgery?\nCosmetic surgery is a branch of plastic surgery that focuses on improving one’s appearance through surgical and medical techniques.\nThese procedures can be performed on various parts of the body, including the face, neck, and body.\nTypes of Cosmetic Surgeries\nSome common types of cosmetic surgeries include:\nFactors Determining Risk in Cosmetic Surgery\nThere are several factors that contribute to the risk involved in cosmetic surgery.\nThese include surgical complications, anesthesia risks, infection and scarring, and psychological factors.\nComplications may arise during the surgery itself, such as excessive bleeding, nerve damage, or blood clots.\nSome of these complications can be life-threatening or lead to permanent damage.\nAnesthesia is used during many cosmetic surgeries to ensure the patient’s comfort.\nHowever, it comes with its own set of risks, including allergic reactions, breathing difficulties, and even death in rare cases.\nInfection and Scarring\nInfections are a common risk associated with any surgery, including cosmetic procedures.\nIn some cases, infections can lead to scarring, which may negatively impact the desired outcome of the surgery.\nThe patient’s mental health also plays a significant role in the overall risk of cosmetic surgery.\nUnrealistic expectations and dissatisfaction with the results can lead to psychological distress and depression.\nThe Most Riskiest Cosmetic Surgery\nWhile all cosmetic surgeries carry some level of risk, the following procedures are considered to be the most riskiest:\nBody Lift Surgery\nWhat is Body Lift Surgery?\nBody lift surgery is a procedure that involves the removal of excess skin and fat from various areas of the body, typically following massive weight loss.\nRisks Associated with Body Lift Surgery\nThis extensive surgery has a higher risk of complications due to its invasive nature. Potential risks include excessive bleeding, infection, blood clots, and prolonged healing time.\nAdditionally, patients may experience dissatisfaction with the results, leading to a negative impact on their self-esteem and mental health.\nWhat is Liposuction?\nLiposuction is a cosmetic procedure that removes unwanted fat deposits from specific areas of the body, such as the abdomen, thighs, hips, and arms.\nRisks Associated with Liposuction\nAlthough liposuction is a popular procedure, it carries several risks.\nThese include infection, bleeding, and damage to surrounding tissues. In rare cases, complications may lead to fat embolism, a life-threatening condition in which fat enters the bloodstream and blocks blood vessels.\nWhat is Rhinoplasty?\nRhinoplasty, or nose reshaping surgery, is a cosmetic procedure that alters the size or shape of the nose to improve facial balance and aesthetics.\nRisks Associated with Rhinoplasty\nRhinoplasty is considered one of the most complex and riskiest cosmetic surgeries due to the intricate anatomy of the nose and its central role in breathing.\nPotential risks include bleeding, infection, scarring, breathing difficulties, and dissatisfaction with the results.\nReducing the Risks of Cosmetic Surgery\nTo minimize the risks associated with cosmetic surgery, consider the following:\nChoosing a Qualified Surgeon\nEnsure that your surgeon is board-certified and experienced in the specific procedure you desire. This can significantly decrease the likelihood of complications.\nProper preparation before surgery, such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and discussing all aspects of the procedure with your surgeon, can help reduce risks.\nProper Postoperative Care\nFollow your surgeon’s postoperative instructions closely, including taking prescribed medications, attending follow-up appointments, and avoiding strenuous activities until fully recovered.\n1. What factors contribute to the risks associated with cosmetic surgery?\nFactors include surgical complications, anesthesia risks, infection and scarring, and psychological factors.\n2. Which cosmetic surgeries are considered the most riskiest?\nBody lift surgery, liposuction, and rhinoplasty are considered the most riskiest cosmetic surgeries.\n3. How can I reduce the risks of cosmetic surgery?\nChoose a qualified surgeon, prepare properly before surgery, and follow postoperative care instructions.\n4. Are there any alternatives to high-risk cosmetic surgeries?\nNon-surgical alternatives, such as dermal fillers or non-invasive body contouring treatments, may be available depending on your specific goals. Consult with a qualified professional to discuss your options.\n5. Can cosmetic surgery risks be completely eliminated?\nNo, all surgeries carry some level of risk. However, by taking steps to minimize risks, such as choosing a qualified surgeon and following postoperative care instructions, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of complications.\nConclusion and final thoughts 💭\nWhile all cosmetic surgeries carry inherent risks, body lift surgery, liposuction, and rhinoplasty are considered the most riskiest.\nBy understanding the potential risks and taking steps to minimize them, you can make an informed decision about your cosmetic surgery journey.\nAlways consult with a qualified surgeon and follow their advice to ensure the best possible outcome.']	['<urn:uuid:73d61239-2a32-4869-831d-15bf063f69db>', '<urn:uuid:6959474d-3c0d-47bb-9978-0373a16970d5>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	11	53	1364
81	Is there a recommended way to spot those Native American amulets in the game when it's dark outside or when they're hard to see?	"Players can activate the ""Dead eye"" ability, which will highlight the dream catcher in yellow. Without this special skill, finding the dream catchers at night is almost impossible, even when knowing their approximate location."	"['RDR2 - Dreamcatchers | Locations | Guide\nDreamcatchers are ancient Indian amulets. In some tribes they were also called ""spiders"". Talismans were made of wicker, which was covered with deer veins and harsh threads, forming a beautiful web. The main purpose of dream catchers is to “capture” bad dreams in your own chains, which evil spirits send to people, and to let in good dreams. The last of the beliefs of the Indians could be embodied in reality. Dream catchers traditionally hang over a berth as a guardian. They are universal, that is, they do not sharpen for any particular person. In Red dead redemption 2 they hang on trees in different locations. These are collectible items. They need to be collected if the player plans to complete the game 100%. Although many lovers of hunting for different things will be delighted just from the prospects to replenish their game collections. Purposefully go on a journey to collect catchers is not worth it, because it is a waste of time. They can be picked up on the road while traveling to perform other major and side missions. In the guide, we will tell you about where dream catchers are hidden in the open spaces of the game world, so that the player can easily navigate.\nLittle about Game Catchers\nIn the Wild West, clashes with Indians were commonplace. The new population of America was actively crowding out the natives, freeing themselves of space for life. In the game there are items that can be considered the heritage of Indians: bow and arrows, tomahawks and dream catchers. You can start searching for the latter immediately after the beginning of the second story chapter.\nThere are only 20 dream catchers in Red dead redemption 2. They can be found only on the branches of trees, so you need to look upward more often. They will differ from each other in size and design. One is easy to see with the naked eye among the bare branches, while others will successfully mask under the protective cover of foliage. Most plays and time of day. At night, without special skills to find the catcher, even knowing his approximate location, it is almost impossible.\nIf a player is afraid to miss a collection item, then you need to activate the ""Dead eye"", which will highlight the desired catcher in yellow. You can collect them in any order, which allows you to include this task in other missions and not spend too much time on consecutive searches. In order for the find to be counted, you need to get close to the tree on which branch the catcher hangs, and press ""Y / triangle"" (depending on the console). Collecting all catchers will add 2% to the game progress and will open the skill Ancient Arrowhead. Useful bun, which when using onions will reduce the endurance consumption by half. Here, the game developers made a nod to the native people of America, linking their traditional amulet and traditional weapons.\nLocation of catchers\nIt is time to start the hunt for hunters. Although below they will be designated as ""first"", ""second"", ""third"", this is done for convenience of listing. The order does not matter. You can first go for the ""tenth"", and then pick up the ""fifth"".\nFor the first catcher you need to go to the neighborhood of Annesburg. The sought is on the river bank. A small catcher will hang on the lower branch of a gigantic tree, which is no different from its neighbors. Landmark can only be a large boulder nearby.\nThe second is located near the location of the first. To reach it, you need to move in the north-west direction. On the map the place is located next to the letter ""o"" in the name of the location ""Ambarino"". The catcher hangs on a thick branch of an old, withered tree. To see it, you have to raise your head.\nThe third is also hidden near Anneseburg. To search you need to move to the south of the location. The catcher hangs low enough on one of the trees on the slope.\nThe location of the fourth dream catcher is between Annesburg and New Hanover. On the card, you can navigate the inscription ""New Hanower"", the dream catcher will be hung on a tree near the letter ""e"". The player needs a fairly wide clearing, surrounded by a young forest. Among the thin trees will be allocated one with a spreading crown. On its lower branch and hangs the desired. Unlike previous catchers, this has a diamond shape.\nFor the fifth one, you must again go north to Annesburg itself. The player needs one of the roads leading to the suburbs. The path lies through the hills on the slopes of which there is a rare forest. The catcher hangs on an old, withered tree. In color, it merges with the bark, so you can see the object only from a certain angle.\nThe sixth is also safely hidden near the location of New Hanover. For his search, it is easier to focus on the inscription on the map. Need a place located right in the center of the letter ""o"" in the inscription ""New Hanower"". There is a dreamcatcher in a rare forest that borders a rough road. It will hang on the bottom branch of a strong tree. The catcher can be seen with the naked eye, as there are bright yellow, blue and red garters on the circle. At night, it’s almost impossible to see what you are looking for without special skill.\nThe seventh catcher is also hidden in the vicinity of Annesburg, or rather just south of the city. It can be found on a steep slope on one of the lower branches of an old tree, of which only a dried, rotten skeleton remains. This ""pillar"" is visible from afar.\nThe eighth was lost between the swamps of Lemoyna and New Hanover. The player will have to get to the Aberdeen pig farm to find a wide clearing with a lonely tree. A large dream catcher is suspended on its green branches. If you walk under a tree, it’s impossible not to bang your head against it.\nThe ninth quietly hangs on the branches of a dried, but not yet lost all branches, tree near the ranch Emerald. If a player happens to be in this location by accident, he will fail to notice the catcher.\nTo search for the tenth you need to go to the location of Heartlands, which borders West Elizabeth, Cumberland Forest and Lemoyn. The catcher hangs on a lone tree that grows in the midst of a bare plain landscape. It has long dried up, so finding a catcher of labor will not make up even without a special skill.\nFor the eleventh player will have to go just north of Heartlands. In this case, the easiest way to navigate the map. The desired tree, on which the triangular catcher will hang, is located in the gap between the letters ""N"" and ""e"" in the inscription ""New Hanower"".\nTo find the twelfth, you will have to move towards the Bluewater Marsh swamps. The place is located just north of the location. The player will have to find a rare thicket in which a noticeable old tree will grow. This dream catcher is also different from the rest. It is made very elegantly and resembles the interweaving of cobwebs with three colored feathers.\nThe location of the thirteenth lies northeast of Valentine. A very perceptible colored dream catcher hangs on a branch of a tree that grows on a slope above the railway. There is a bridge nearby.\nThe fourteenth dream catcher hid to the west of the Heartlands location. It can be seen with the naked eye on one of the trees on the rocky shore that frame the turbulent river.\nThe fifteenth catcher can be found northwest of New Hanover. The tree with the desired object grows close to Caliban\'s Seat. The catcher is easily recognizable by its bright blue-green feathers.\nFor the sixteenth player to go to the location of Lemoyne. The sought-after is hidden west of the Bluewater Marsh swamps in one of the numerous meadows. The catcher will hang on the lower branch of the dried tree.\nFor the seventeenth you need to get to the mountains of the Grizzlies. A colorful catcher hangs on the lower branch of a dried tree trunk among the rocks on one of the slopes of the mountain range.\nThe eighteenth is located in the Ambarino location near Cotorra Springs. The player needs a wide clearing with a lonely old tree. It will be difficult to notice the dream catcher even in the daytime, so it is better to apply the skill in advance.\nFor the nineteenth, you need to move in a westerly direction from Valentine. On the road, you need to turn to the side of the road and go deep into the thicket of forest. Finding this dream catcher is very difficult. It blends in color with the bark of the tree and only slightly stands out with a blue feather. The tree must be looked for dry, without leaves.\nTo search for the twentieth you need to go to the border of the Grizzly Mountains and the Cumberland Forest. Dreamcatcher hanging on a tree that grows on a steep rocky slope.']"	['<urn:uuid:66f3003f-17e2-4830-b459-1a1ac7070b1e>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	24	34	1574
82	What compensation can I get if I win a discrimination case?	If you win a discrimination case, you may be entitled to several types of compensation: back pay for lost earnings, front pay for future lost earnings, lost benefits (including health insurance, pension, stock options), compensatory damages for mental/emotional injuries and medical expenses, punitive damages in cases of malicious discrimination, and coverage of attorney fees and legal costs. There are limits on compensatory and punitive damages. Additionally, if you faced discrimination in hiring, firing, or promotion, you may be placed or reinstated to the desired position.	['Federal and state laws prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on the following characteristics:\nThe law also prohibits harassment that is based on these protected classes, and employer retaliation for asserting the right to be free of discrimination. These laws apply to hiring, promotion, job assignment, termination, and compensation.\nWhich Employees Does the Law Protect?\nFor most types of discrimination, a private employer is not subject to anti-discrimination laws unless it has had 15 or more employees for at least twenty weeks in the past year. For age discrimination, a private employer must have 20 or more employees, and with the Equal Pay Act virtually all employers are covered.\nWhat Evidence Is Required to Prove Employment Discrimination?\nThe best way to prove discrimination is direct evidence against an employer, such as a statement, e-mail, letter, or memo that shows the employer took action against you based on a discriminatory motive. In most cases, though, direct evidence isn’t available. Instead, you have to rely on circumstantial evidence to prove your case.\nCircumstantial evidence is evidence that would make a person believe discrimination occurred but is not direct proof of it. To win a case using either direct or circumstantial evidence, you need to show that a discriminatory reason more likely than not motivated your employer’s action against you. When circumstantial evidence is involved, a three-step test called the McDonnell Douglas framework is typically used.\nSteps for Proving Most Employee Discrimination Claims\nFirst, an employee must make a “prima facie” case of discrimination by showing that certain circumstances existed that would lead a person to presume that the employer’s action was based on discrimination.\nSecond, if the employee makes a prima facie case, then the employer must provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action.\nThird, if the employer provides a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, then the employee needs to show that the employer’s stated reason is merely “pretext,” or a cover-up, for discrimination.\nLearn more here and by clicking on the individual types of discrimination.\nWhat Remedies Are Available in a Discrimination Case?\nAn employee who wins a discrimination case may be entitled to the following, depending on the type of case and the severity of the discrimination:\n- Back pay: lost earnings resulting from the discrimination;\n- Front pay: lost future earnings resulting from the discrimination;\n- Benefits: lost benefits resulting from the discrimination, including health and dental insurance, pension or 401(k) plans, stock options, and profit sharing;\n- Compensatory damages: mental or emotional injuries (i.e. pain and suffering), medical expenses, job search costs, etc. resulting from the discrimination;\n- Punitive damages: a monetary award in malicious or reckless cases, which is designed to punish the employer and deter the employer from repeating its discrimination;\n- Attorney fees and costs: an award to cover attorney fees and costs, such as court fees and expert witness fees.\nThere are limits on the amount of compensatory and punitive damages available. Also, an employee who was discriminated against in hiring, firing, or promotion may be placed or reinstated to the desired position.\nWhat Protections Does the State of Nevada Have?\nNevada has similar laws that prohibit discrimination. The requirements depend on the type of discrimination. An employee may have a claim under both federal and state law, or, in some cases, just one or the other.\nWhat Is the Process for Filing a Discrimination Complaint?\nEmployees who wish to file a lawsuit against an employer for discrimination must first file a charge either with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) or the Nevada Equal Rights Commission (“NERC”). There are a couple of exceptions. In most cases, an employee must file a charge with the EEOC or NERC within 300 days of when the discrimination occurred.\nThe EEOC or NERC will review the charge, investigate, and in most cases issue a “Notice of Right-to-Sue,” which allows an employee to file a lawsuit. In egregious cases of discrimination, the EEOC will file a lawsuit on an employee’s behalf; otherwise, the employee should hire an attorney.\nAn employee has 90 days to file a lawsuit after receiving the Notice of Right-to-Sue, with some exceptions.\nWhat to Do?\nContact me today if you believe you have a claim of employment discrimination, or if you are an employer who needs to defend against an employment discrimination claim.\n- What Is Required to Prove Discrimination in the Workplace?\n- What Are the Time Limits for Filing a Charge of Discrimination and a Lawsuit?\n- Which Employers Are Subject to Workplace Discrimination Laws?\n- Can I Request My Personnel File from My Employer in Nevada?\n- Can Nevada Employers Ask About Your Salary History?\n- Can Your Employer Discipline or Fire You for Using a Legal Product Off Duty?\n- Can an Employer Refuse to Hire an Applicant with a Criminal History?']	['<urn:uuid:8650fd93-a085-4d7f-a7a7-c7c944866cc7>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	11	85	802
83	As an IT administrator in healthcare, I'm concerned about both patch management scope and medical device cybersecurity - what common mistakes should be avoided when selecting applications for patching, and what specific vulnerabilities should be considered for networked medical devices?	A common mistake in patch management is focusing exclusively on Microsoft patching, when applications from all vendors need to be kept up-to-date as unpatched vulnerabilities in any application can pose security risks. For networked medical devices, specific vulnerabilities arise when devices can connect wirelessly or via hard-wire to other devices, networks, or portable media like USB drives. These vulnerabilities can allow unauthorized access, data modification, misuse, denial of use, or unauthorized transfer of stored information, potentially impacting patient safety. The risk level depends on factors like the device's intended use, electronic data interfaces, environment of use, and likelihood of exploitation.	"['The first item on an administrator’s to-do list is generally patch management. If done incorrectly patch management can be a risk for the organization instead of a risk mitigator. A few simple best practices however easily eliminate all of these risks as well as ensure that the process is finished quickly and efficiently.\nMonitor the patch status of all your applications\nThe first step in patch management is to be aware when new patches are needed. The easiest way to accomplish this is by employing a solution that monitors your network patch status and notifies you automatically when patches are available. If budget is an issue another possibility is to keep track of what applications you use and periodically check the respective websites for new issued updates.\nCaution: A common mistake here is that administrators sometimes focus exclusively on Microsoft patching only. This might be due to convenience because Microsoft have efficient patch management solutions or due to a genuine belief that this is enough. This however is a misconception, as applications from other vendors that have vulnerabilities left unpatched can pose a security risk just as much as any Microsoft application. Administrators should ensure all their applications are kept up to date.\nTest patches before deploying\nOften this step is skipped completely. When deploying patches without properly testing them out you risk that one of the patches might conflict and cause issues on the organization’s infrastructure.\nYou have to keep in mind that patches are pieces of code that change the existing code of the application they apply too. The changes can be numerous including a change in the behaviour of that application and/or its underlying libraries. In some cases these changes could conflict with other applications deployed on that system that make use of this functionality thus causing malfunctions which, in some cases, can be system wide.\nThere are reported cases in which patches cause a system to blue screen on boot up requiring a complete system reinstallation to recover.\nSuggestion: Ensure optimum patch testing before patch deployment – it is good practice to keep a standardized installation on companywide workstations and servers. Ensure that you keep perfectly mirrored test machines with the same exact software and same versions of your production network. When you test the patches successfully on your test setup prior to patch deployment you can rest easy that no problems will be experienced when deploying on your production network.\nCaution: For proper testing in this context it is essential that users are restricted from installing software indiscriminately. If a user installs a piece of software that the administrator is not aware of it might conflict with the patch about to be deployed.\nPatch management can be a time consuming operation. There are plenty of patch management solutions that can help with automating this deployment process for both Microsoft and non-Microsoft patches thus minimising administrator interaction.\nIf budget is an issue there are free solutions by Microsoft that can help automate patch management for Microsoft products; however, as mentioned earlier it is still essential to patch non-Microsoft products even if this needs to be done manually.\nAnother important, yet often overlooked, best practice is to have a disaster recovery plan should your patch management fail and cause problems. Backups are the easiest option and they can also be used to mitigate other risks such as a virus infection or intrusion.\nCaution: When employing testing before deployment it might be tempting to think that disaster recovery from a botched patch is redundant as this risk would have been mitigated; however, there are various scenarios in which some subtle differences (perhaps even in hardware or a user installing an application without the administrator’s knowledge) might cause issues when the patch is deployed on the production environment yet have no issues on the testing environment itself.', 'This paper is an exploration of what could be a subset of data integrity, with added dimensions -cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is a growing concern for all, whether you work in the legal, financial or consumer industries. It could affect you personally.\nCybersecurity is a recent concern for the medical products industries, a result of their increased reliance on networked electronic software, records and signatures. Initially there were regulations such as 21 CFR Part 11 in the U.S. and Annex 11 in Europe. But more must be done to ensure the integrity of CGMP documents / records. Cybersecurity is an issue that will only increase over time, as records become more electronic, and communications are more networked or accessible.\nAs a result, the US FDA has issued the following Guidances for Industry:\n- “Cybersecurity for Networked Medical Devices Containing Off-the-Shelf (OTS) Software Document”, issued on: January 14, 2005; and\n- “Content of Premarket Submissions for Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices”, issued on: October 2, 2014; and\n- “Postmarket Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices” -- Draft Guidance, issued on: January 22, 2016\nAs the titles above indicate, the focus is on medical devices. But the principles can and should be applied to a company’s computerized systems as well. In this article, we will also focus on devices, but will also draw attention to company computerized systems where appropriate, to flag related potential problems with an e-records based QMS, computer-facilitated production and/or test / lab equipment / systems.\nOf necessity, cybersecurity in the medical products industries is coming under increased regulatory review. Regulatory agencies leave the ""how"" of cybersecurity compliance up to the manufacturer, as long as the principles in the guidances are met in the resulting product and/or system. Related issues are primarily addressed by the CGMPs, specifically design control (21 CFR 820.30) for devices, and post-production by the CAPA system, among others.\nCybersecurity – Why?\nFDA and news media have emphasized the prevalence of cybersecurity issues, such as data / identity theft, and hacking which pose hazards to many activities and businesses / industries. Our, and the FDA’s and EU’s concern, is with medical products’ users.\nFurther adding to the problem is the industrial growth of BYOD – “Bring Your Own Device” (laptop, tablet, smart phone, or similar “smart” device) – in the workplace. This growing trend poses a problem to cybersecurity, including unintentional and intentional malware introduction.\nThe increasing use of cloud (Internet)-based software to accomplish CGMP tasks, store / retrieve data (data warehousing) and similar uses poses another two-fold concern. In many cases, the updates, upgrades, new revisions / releases, service packs, and similar are automatically uploaded to a company’s systems, which can pose:\n- Security risks, with the potential for introduction of compromised code, retrieval of confidential data, data integrity issues (discussed in our previous article), and similar; and\n- Render previous computer systems’ verification and validations worthless (no change control / “line drawn in the sand”).\nSuch issues are troubling because ensuring data integrity / cybersecurity is an important component of industry’s responsibility to ensure the safety, efficacy, and quality of medical products, the records documenting their manufacture and use, and consequently, of FDA’s ability to protect the public health.\nA growing number of medical devices are designed to be connected to computer networks, or facilitate the use of removable storage, such as flash or thumb drives. Such “networked” medical devices incorporate use software (off-the-shelf or custom) that is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, such as viruses and worms, phishing, and similar unauthorized or unknown intrusions.\nSuch vulnerabilities pose a risk to the safe and effective operation of such medical devices. This mandates an ongoing maintenance effort throughout the product life cycle to assure an adequate degree of protection. FDA issued their Cybersecurity Guidance to clarify how existing regulations, including the Quality System (QS) Regulation, 21 CFR 820 (medical device CGMPs), 21 CFR Part 11, Electronic Records / Electronic Signatures, apply to such cybersecurity maintenance activities. It discusses the basic principles the FDA expects of companies producing products containing networked software / firmware. Though geared to medical devices, the principles apply to all regulated industries with networked and/or portable memory accessible software / firmware (e.g., flash / thumb drives, BYOD access) computerized systems – records maintenance, production and test equipment and similar.\nHowever, the Cybersecurity Guidance specifically targets devices that incorporate off-the-shelf (OTS) software. Therefore, it primarily applies to device manufacturers who incorporate OTS software in their medical devices. The QS Regulation, 21 CFR Part 820, applies to software maintenance actions. This is in addition to the other guidance documents the Agency has issued in the past on software. Companies using SOUP (software of unknown pedigree) in their products (or systems) should also be aware of and address similar concerns.\nThe FDA recommends that medical device manufacturers consider the “NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity” framework core functions to guide their cybersecurity activities:\n- Respond; and\nIdentify and Protect\nMedical devices capable of connecting (wirelessly or hard-wired) to another device, to the Internet or other network, or to portable media (e.g. USB or CD) are more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats than devices that are not connected. However, never assume invulnerability, verify to challenge vulnerability, and document such verification.\nThe extent to which security controls are needed will depend on the following:\n- The device’s / systems intended use;\n- The presence and intent of its electronic data interfaces;\n- Its intended environment of use;\n- The type of cybersecurity vulnerabilities present;\n- The likelihood the vulnerability will be exploited (either intentionally or unintentionally); and\n- The probable risk of patient harm due to a cybersecurity breach.\nManufacturers should also carefully consider the balance between cybersecurity safeguards and the usability of the device in its intended environment of use. See also the newly revised standard IEC 62366-1 (2015) and -2 (2016), Usability Engineering, for such a process.\nEnsure Trusted Content\nRestrict software or firmware updates to authenticated code. One authentication method manufacturers may consider is code signature verification. Use systematic procedures for authorized users to download version-identifiable software and firmware from the manufacturer. Ensure capability of secure data transfer to and from the device, and when appropriate, use methods for encryption.\nDetect, Respond, Recover\nImplement features that allow for security compromises to be detected, recognized, logged, timed, and acted upon during normal use. Develop and provide information to the end user concerning appropriate actions to take upon detection of a cybersecurity event. Implement device features that protect critical functionality, even when the device’s cybersecurity has been compromised. Provide methods for retention and recovery of device configuration by an authenticated privileged user.\nVulnerabilities and Risk\nFDA states that a cybersecurity vulnerability exists whenever the software provides the opportunity for unauthorized access to the network or the medical device. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities open the door to unwanted software changes that may have an effect on the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. Failure to properly address these vulnerabilities could result in an adverse effect on public health. A major concern with OTS software is the need for timely software patches to correct newly discovered vulnerabilities in the software.\nThe FDA recommends that the manufacturer conduct a vulnerability analysis, both initially (premarket) and ongoing (post-market). The approach should appropriately address the following elements:\n- Identification of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities;\n- Assessment of the impact of threats and vulnerabilities on device functionality and end users / patients;\n- Assessment of the likelihood of a threat and of a vulnerability being exploited;\n- Determination of risk levels and suitable mitigation strategies; and\n- Assessment of residual risk and risk acceptance criteria.\nAs mentioned above, and especially software / firmware, initial design and subsequent continuous improvement activities must consider hazards / risk, per ISO 14971. Such risk is focused on the end user – patient and/or clinician. The hazard analysis should address both “normal"" as well as “fault” risks, i.e., not just failure mode risk, the most prevalent approach, but also risk posed by the proper function of the product. In such an analysis, the manufacturer must also consider cybersecurity as part of this regular hazard analysis. Exposure to the web, as in the networked devices focused on in this guidance, increases such cybersecurity risks to the patient / clinician. Hazard / risk analysis’ goal is risk mitigation, documented in the Risk Management File and Report (ISO 14971), as well as in the Design History File (21 CFR 820.30). Consider system boundaries and connections to the external environment. In all such analysis, software must be considered with its associated hardware.\nThe above is to be supplemented by on-going monitoring of actual and potential vulnerabilities, consistent with the Quality System Regulation (21 CFR part 820), including complaint handling, internal quality audits, CAPA (corrective and preventive action), software validation and risk analysis, and servicing. Such programs should emphasize addressing vulnerabilities which may permit the unauthorized access, modification, misuse or denial of use, or the unauthorized use of information that is stored, accessed, or transferred from a medical device to an external recipient, and may impact patient safety.\nThe Agency defines critical components of such a program to include:\n- Monitoring cybersecurity information sources for identification and detection of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risk;\n- Understanding, assessing and detecting presence and impact of a vulnerability;\n- Establishing and communicating processes for vulnerability intake and handling;\n- Clearly defining essential clinical performance to develop mitigations that protect, respond and recover from the cybersecurity risk;\n- Adopting a coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy and practice; and\n- Deploying mitigations that address cybersecurity risk early and prior to exploitation.\nPostmarket cybersecurity information may originate from an array of sources including a company’s own CAPA / warranty / complaint system, independent security researchers, in-house testing, suppliers of software or hardware technology, health care facilities, and information sharing and analysis organizations. To manage postmarket cybersecurity risks for medical devices, a company should have a structured and systematic approach to risk management and quality management systems consistent with the CGMPs.\nPer the guidance, it is the device manufacturer who incorporates software in their medical device, that bears the primary responsibility for the continued safe and effective performance of the medical device / system, including the performance of the software that is part of the device / system. This is instead of the user or a contract programmer / software developer. FDA recommends that purchasers and users of medical devices who may be subject to a cybersecurity vulnerability contact the manufacturer with their concerns. Even when there are times when it is appropriate for the user to become involved, the user should not attempt to make changes without seeking the manufacturer’s advice and recommendations.\nSoftware patches that address cybersecurity vulnerabilities are addressed in general in the CGMPs. For example, the need to be vigilant and responsive to cybersecurity vulnerabilities is part of a company’s obligation under CAPA. The preamble to the QS Regulation explains that actions taken should “be appropriate to the magnitude of the problem and commensurate with the risks encountered”, i.e., “risk-based.” Design validation requires that devices conform to defined user needs and functional requirements, including an obligation to perform software validation and hazard / risk analysis, where appropriate.\nSoftware changes to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities are design changes, and thus must be verified / validated before approval and issuance. However, FDA premarket review is not usually required prior to implementation of a software patch to address a purely cybersecurity vulnerability for a previously cleared / approved device.\nIn general, FDA review is necessary when a change or modification could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the medical device (see also FDA Memorandum K 97-1, and their two recent draft guidances on changes to a device having a 510(k), one specifically addressing software). This is to allow an FDA review of any issue that affects a risk to health posed by the device, and should be the key determinant in making such a decision on the need for an new regulatory review.\nThus, it is possible, but unlikely, that a software patch will need a new 510(k) submission. And the more robust the V&V of the patch / change, the less likely the requirement for a new submission would be. As with all changes made to devices, a company must document the basis of its decisions in the Design History File (DHF) and/or related CGMP documentation.\nHowever, for medical devices approved under Premarket Approval Application (PMA) (21 CFR Part 814), a PMA supplement is required for a software patch, if the patch:\n- Results in a change to the approved indications for use; or\n- Is deemed by the manufacturer to have an adverse effect on the safety and effectiveness of the approved medical device.\nNote: The two points above are also “red flags” for changes to devices covered by a 510(k) that would probably also require a new 510(k).\nOtherwise, the company should report its decision to apply a software patch to its PMA device to the FDA in its annual reports.\nIn all cases, validation of software changes made to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities is required. All software design changes must be verified / regression tested / validated, including those computer software changes to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This would be in accordance with an established protocol, before approval and issuance. However, for most software changes intended to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities, analysis, inspection, and testing – documented -- should be adequate and clinical validation should not be necessary.\nThe manufacturer should always maintain formal business relationships with their OTS software vendors to ensure timely receipt of information concerning quality problems and recommended corrective and preventive actions – perhaps by means of the contract or a Quality Agreement. Because of the frequency of cybersecurity patches, the FDA’s Guidance recommends that the company develop a single cybersecurity maintenance plan to address compliance with the QS Regulation and the issues discussed in the guidance document.\nAlthough the guidance recommends that the medical device manufacturer to perform these software maintenance activities, there may be situations in which it is appropriate for the user facility, OTS vendor, or a third party to be involved. The software maintenance plan should provide a mechanism for the manufacturer to exercise overall responsibility while delegating specific tasks to such other parties. The vast majority of healthcare organizations will lack detailed design information and technical resources to assume primary maintenance responsibility for medical device software and will have to rely on the manufacturer to assume the primary maintenance responsibility.\nLifecycle considerations require that the expected growing knowledge of the science of the product and its manufacturing process / equipment translate into manufacturing improvements, and reduction in variation, consistency / homogeneity within lots, and consistency / homogeneity between lots, improved product quality, all reflected in subsequent V&V activities. See FDA’s Guidance on Process Validation.\nThe training of personnel in detecting data integrity issues is also required as part of a routine CGMP training program. Training personnel to detect data integrity issues is viewed as consistent with the personnel requirements discussed in the CGMPs.\nAs stated at the outset, Cybersecurity is a relatively new term for the CGMP community. As hacking of networked electronic systems has become more prevalent, cybersecurity requirements are also being added. Increasingly, manufacturers and users will have to demonstrate their ability to provide for cybersecurity to achieve full CGMP compliance when such vulnerabilities exist in their systems. This is the expectation and demand of all such systems / records stakeholders, not just regulatory agencies.\n# # #\nCAPA Corrective and Preventive Action (see 21 CFR 820.100)\nCDRH U.S. FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health\nCGMPs Current Good Manufacturing Practices (for devices it is 21 CFR Par 820,\nQuality System Regulations)\nCFR The U.S. Code of Federal Regulation\nFDA The United States’ Food and Drug Administration\nISO International Standards Organization\nNIST U.S. National Institute of Science and Technology\nOTS Off-the-shelf [software]\nQA Quality Assurance\nQC Quality Control\nQMS Quality Management System\nQS Quality System\nR&D Research and Development\nSOP Standard Operating Procedure\nV&V Or V[T]&V; Verification [Testing] and Validation.

84	difference between digital sovereignty eu china strict data rules	The EU and China have different approaches to digital sovereignty and data rules. The EU focuses on strategic autonomy, aiming for resilience and reduced dependence while maintaining an open internet that enables cross-border exchange. The EU's approach encompasses personal data protection, industrial confidentiality, and political autonomy for EU institutions. In contrast, China has implemented a more restrictive approach through its Data Security Law, which imposes strict control over data processing activities, requires security assessments for cross-border data transfers, and establishes a hierarchical classification system for data importance. China's law also allows the state to conduct national security assessments with final determinations that cannot be challenged, and includes provisions for reciprocal measures against countries that impose restrictions on China's data-related activities.	['A Call for a Value-Driven Approach to ‘Digital Sovereignty’\nThe Internet has been labelled as an independent and universal space throughout the 1990s and until today many believe it should be run by a special set of rules. Concrete examples include cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum) and ‘self-sovereign’ digital identity management. However, the discussion whether countries should pay more attention to ‘Digital Sovereignty’ has intensified over the last decade. In the 2020 programme for Germany’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU), it proposed that Digital Sovereignty should become a guiding objective (‘Leitmotiv’) for future policies. Some believe it is necessary to reassert authority over the internet and protect citizens and businesses from the manifold challenges to self-determination online. The dependency on large corporations and their platforms to engage in all aspects of social and economic life was already much discussed before the pandemic, but has only increased with the need for physical distancing. Data is vital to understand and mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and the reliable accessibility of data infrastructure is a key concern as the ‘Digital Divide’ grows. Unresolved national security concerns, such as the persistent threats of surveillance and cyberattacks, combined with the inability of the multi-stakeholder community to address them fuel the desire of many to ‘take back control’. The simple idea that sovereignty needs to be perfectly aligned between national territory and cyberspace is appealing at first. However, it undermines the privileges of those who are fully accustomed to the social and economic benefits of an open internet that enables cross-border exchange.\nWhat is Digital Sovereignty?\nAt the moment, there is no universal definition of Digital Sovereignty and the concept is mainly used to frame political demands. In a speech from 3 February 2021 EU Council President Charles Michel defined the quest for Digital Sovereignty as essential for ‘strategic autonomy’, which […] ‘means more resilience, more influence, and less dependence.‘ In a recent report the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) linked the concept of Digital Sovereignty to Digital Strategic Autonomy. It consists of the\n- personal aspect, such as data protection and privacy;\n- industrial aspect, such as confidentiality and security for a data-driven industry;\n- political aspect, such as autonomy and cybersecurity for EU institutions and Member States.\nENISA defines ‘digital strategic autonomy as the ability of Europe to source products and services that meet its needs and values, without undue influence from the outside world.’ Here – as for any other political actor – this describes the capability to operate as an autonomous society in the 21st century. To give a concrete example, recently a discussion emerged in the Netherlands on whether the outsourcing of core management tasks of mobile telecommunication networks results in concerns of intrusive surveillance by Chinese entities. Even senior members of governments were using this mobile network, while it was not clear how the national provider could ensure that there was no unwanted surveillance by Huawei.\nArguably, Digital Sovereignty and strategic autonomy are particularly urgent for those political entities that pursue models of differentiated political integration, such as the EU or the United States. Citizens fear the loss of control over their data, but also of their capacity to innovate. Additionally, with the increased dependence on digital platforms developed and maintained by private corporations following their own rules, there are concerns about the relevance of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. At the same time questions emerge how new regulatory frameworks of the EU such as the Data Governance Act, the General Data Protection Regulation, or the proposed regulation of Artificial Intelligence affect international trade.\nConceptual approaches to ‘Digital Sovereignty’\nA traditional approach to sovereignty can be found in the work of German philosopher Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel, who suggested that it needs to manifest through an individual with absolute powers, such as the Prussian monarch. Later in the 19th century legal scholar Georg Jellinek proposed the ‘three elements doctrine’. Accordingly, territory, population and sovereignty are essential to becoming a state. The element of sovereignty has an internal and external dimension and the sovereign has the duty to control both. As long as all three elements are intact a state is formally considered independent from other political actors. All states have equal rights, regardless of the size of their population and territory. However, with more political and societal interdependence and enhanced cooperation among states, as well as the division of labor and the globalization of the economy, Digital Sovereignty has become a much more encompassing concept. Today, it is not only addressing issues relating to ‘hard infrastructure’ such as internet communication, connection and technological capability. Rather, it also relates to the digital transformation of society as such.\nBack to protectionism?\nThis interconnectedness and interdependence challenges command and control structures which are central to traditional conceptions of sovereignty, and questions around the feasibility of networked governance. At the moment, states struggle to translate the rule of territorial sovereignty into the 21st century. One of the main concerns about Digital Sovereignty is that it will result in the fragmentation of cyberspace, or the emergence of the ‘splinternet‘. In 2018 O’Hara and Hall already argued that there are four internets, whereas the permanent tensions between the People’s Republic of China and the United States about issues such as the governance of social media platforms like TikTok, or the role of corporations such as Huawei in future 5G networks do little to reverse this trend.\nThis is particularly problematic for European countries, which have to review their strategic dependency on cost-effective solutions. At the same time projects to establish independent European cloud infrastructure such as GAIA-X progress slowly and it remains vague who should be able to shape them. The role of non-European partners such as Amazon and Microsoft is controversial and European states are also concerned about the power balance between themselves. Some states such as Germany seem not to have the patience for lengthy discussions, and rather turn to traditional means when establishing their own federal cloud infrastructure. However, this increases their dependency on the private sector, which is a trend that can also be witnessed in states such as Israel.\nWhile protectionism might appear as an attractive political alternative that allows to avoid the cumbersome process towards multilateral agreement, it cannot deliver sustainable long term solutions. With the scale of specialization required to effectively develop and maintain competitive infrastructure in the Digital Age, it is increasingly important to be able to pool skills and resources. This can only be achieved on the basis of shared objectives and values between states and societal stakeholders. Their establishment can start with an agreement on detailed standards, preferably in the form of multilateral treaties on the level of international organizations such as the Council of Europe. The Council has a long-standing tradition of addressing data protection and cybersecurity. It is currently working on new standards for Artificial Intelligence. The conventions of the Council are also open for non-member states all across the world.\nWhy a value-driven approach matters\nWhat the European Union – and in fact all political actors – need are overarching strategies that define how the digital domain integrates into policies on all governance levels. This means that future policies for trade, industrial development, or security accept that both the physical and virtual domain require an overarching and holistic strategy. For instance, organized crime such as drug trade needs to be tackled with a plan that addresses national and international smuggling, selling of drugs in cities and public spaces, but also online via ‘Dark Web’ platforms. All these elements are part of the same problem, and some only exist online.\nSimple designs for such governance strategies mirror the physical and territorial borders of countries into the digital domain. This results in re-territorialization of the Internet (e.g. Russian Federation), extended Internet shutdowns and censorship (e.g. India, Uganda) or increased surveillance and control of social life (e.g. People’s Republic of China). While this seems to work from traditional governance perspectives as advanced by Hegel, it can hardly be a valid option for European states, the United States and many others. Their social and economic prosperity is closely tied to the ability of operating cross-border. Their citizens expect a large degree of autonomy that is no longer limited by territories. If it is desirable to keep and expand these abilities throughout the Digital Age, more agreement on multilateral governance frameworks is essential. Such frameworks have to be principle-based to provide long-term stability. Ultimately, we should not only care about ‘hard infrastructure’ and technical capabilities, but explore how values effectively guide the efforts to create, operate and maintain them.\nThe Israel Public Policy Institute (IPPI) serves as a platform for exchange of ideas, knowledge and research among policy experts, researchers, and scholars. The opinions expressed in the publications on the IPPI website are solely that of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of IPPI.\nUpdating Democracy for Future Generations: Adding a Fourth Branch to the Separation of Powers Model\nOver the past two decades, political science has engaged in a lively debate about the “presentism” of democracies,…\nExplaining (non-)cooperation on disputed maritime resources\nJoint development agreements, disputed territory, and lessons from the Falkland Islands In maritime disputes such as the South…', 'China Adopts Data Security Law\nOn June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China adopted the Data Security Law (DSL), which will become effective on September 1, 2021. Together with the Cybersecurity Law (CSL) and the Personal Information Protection Law (Second Draft) (PIPL), these legislative developments demonstrate China’s effort to build a comprehensive regulatory system to address the protection and processing of data with an increased focus on national security.\nScope and Extraterritorial Applicability\nThe DSL regulates all types of data processing activities carried out within the territory of China, including the collection, storage, use, refining, transmission, provision, and disclosure of data. For data processing activities performed outside of China, the DSL also applies to both foreign and Chinese organizations and individuals if they conduct the above data-related activities that could jeopardize national security, the public interest or the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and organizations in China.1 Under the DSL, “data” is defined as all electronic and non-electronic records of information.2\nThe DSL authorizes the State to conduct national security assessments on data processing activities that affect or may affect national security, and stipulates that the security assessment determination made in accordance with law will be final.3 As the State has broad authority to interpret the legal basis for conducting a security assessment, the practical ability to challenge or appeal an adverse determination appears to be quite limited. The use of security assessments in the DSL follows a similar approach taken in the CSL and the PIPL, which utilize security assessments as a way to legitimize cross-border data transfers for Critical Information Infrastructure Operators (CIIO) and personal information processors that are subject to data localization requirements.\nThe DSL imposes data security obligations similar to those already required under the CSL, including engaging in risk monitoring, immediately taking remedial measures against data security vulnerabilities and data security incidents, and timely notifying users and reporting to relevant regulators of data security incidents.4 However, like the CSL, the DSL does not specify what is a data security incident that requires notification to users and reporting to regulators, nor the timing of when such notification and reporting needs to be made.\nHierarchical Classification and Categorization of Data\nThe Chinese government intends to classify and regulate data based on its importance to economic and social development, and the degree of harm to national security, the public interest, and the legitimate rights and interests of individuals and organizations if it is misappropriated.5\nCertain sectoral regulators have already experimented with data classification as an approach to data governance. In March 2020, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), released the Classification and Grading of Industrial Data (Trial), which provides guidance for the classification of data generated and applied throughout the life cycle of industrial products and services. MIIT’s classification categorizes data into three levels according to the potential impact that the data may have on industrial production and economic benefits if misappropriated.6 In the financial sector, under the Financial Data Security – Guidelines for Data Security Classification released by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in September 2020, financial data-defined as various types of data that are collected or generated by financial institutions in the course of their operations-is to be classified into five levels based on the impact on national security, the public interest, the interests of personal information subjects, and the lawful interests of enterprises if such data is damaged. Regulators in other sectors, including health care and telecommunications, are also expected to develop their own data classification standards and requirements.\nUnder the new DSL and the existing CSL, any data processing activities through information networks including the Internet will need to comply with the new data classification and data security obligations for data under the DSL and the existing multi-level protection scheme for network security established under the CSL.7\nImportant Data and Core State Data\nThe DSL includes a legal mandate to the central and local governments to enhance their oversight over important data and core state data. The concept of important data was first introduced in the CSL and remains a vaguely defined but important concept-as it is linked to data localization requirements and enhanced network and data security obligations for CIIOs under the CSL. The DSL further builds out the governance framework for important data by delegating the determination of what is important data to local governments and departments through the establishment of important data catalogues.8 This decentralized approach raises concerns that different local governments and departments will develop different catalogues of important data, making compliance more costly and challenging. Notably, the DSL introduces a new category of data-core state data-a vaguely defined term that includes data that relates to national security, the lifeline of the national economy, people’s livelihoods and major public interests, for which central and local governments are required to apply more stringent regulatory control. It remains unclear what the requirements are for businesses in respect of core state data.\nThe DSL also requires processors of important data to regularly conduct risk assessments and submit risk assessment reports to regulators.9 These risk assessments reports are required to include the types and quantities of important data processed, details of the data processing activities being undertaken, and data security risks and countermeasures.10 This new requirement expands regulation of important data-which under the CSL was limited to CIIOs-to all businesses that process important data. Consequently, in order to comply with the requirements of the DSL, it will be necessary for businesses to determine whether they process important data, to monitor the important data catalogues that are expected to be published by local governments and departments, and to ensure risk assessments and reporting thereof to regulators are performed. Businesses will also potentially have to disclose to regulators business-sensitive or network-security-sensitive details regarding their processing of important data.\nCross-Border Data Transfer\nThe DSL introduces separate frameworks for the regulation of cross-border transfers of important data by CIIOs and non-CIIOs.11 For CIIOs, the export of important data collected and generated in China is governed by the CSL and requires passing a security assessment by relevant regulatory authorities. For non-CIIOs, the DSL specifies that the rules regulating the export of important data collected and generated in China will be developed by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC)-China’s top cyberspace regulator-in conjunction with the relevant departments of the State Council. Since what constitutes important data remains unclear, the expansion of the regulation of cross-border transfers of important data to cover non-CIIOs under the DSL creates significant uncertainties to Chinese and multinational businesses that rely heavily on cross-border data transfers for their business operations and for their existing data-sharing arrangements.\nIn the case of any request made by foreign judicial or law enforcement agencies for data stored in China, domestic organizations and individuals must obtain an advance approval from the relevant Chinese governmental authorities in order to release such data. The DSL provides little detail on which Chinese authorities are responsible for issuing approvals and the approval procedures, and so it is unclear how businesses can meet this requirement without additional implementing regulations, measures or guidelines.12 Moreover, the requirement could put businesses at odds with judicial and law enforcement agencies in their home jurisdictions as it relates to data stored in China, increasing legal compliance risks. It is worth noting that the PIPL proposes a parallel prohibition on transferring personal information that is stored in China to judicial or law enforcement agencies outside of China without approval.13\nOrganizations and individuals directly in charge or directly liable for non-compliance can be fined for violations of these requirements at amounts specified in the DSL, which can be significant.\nGovernment Data Access, Export Control and Geopolitical Tensions\nThe initial draft of the DSL was released at the beginning of July 2020 just after India banned TikTok and WeChat, citing data privacy and security concerns. The United States quickly followed with corresponding bans on similar grounds. The geopolitical tensions underlying these events are reflected in the DSL, which includes provisions that expand China’s export control regime to cover the export of data14 and provide a legal basis for China to impose reciprocal measures on any country or region that imposes discriminatory prohibitions, restrictions or other similar measures against China in terms of investment and trade related to data and data development and use technologies.15 Accordingly, the DSL lays the foundation for the active use of data sovereignty by the Chinese government to protect its national security and to achieve its industrial and foreign policy objectives. The traditional focus of export control regimes has been technology, but the export control of data under the DSL clearly reflects the growing strategic importance of data globally.\nOngoing concerns around the Chinese government’s access to data of businesses are likely to persist with the DSL. The DSL includes specific provisions requiring businesses and individuals to cooperate with public security and State security bodies that need to access data for the purpose of safeguarding national security or investing crimes.16 Organizations and individuals directly in charge or directly liable that fail to cooperate can be fined for any violations at amounts specified in the DSL. Consequently, the legal bases for exporting data to China from jurisdictions that require strong legal protections against government access to personal information in the destination country will need to be reviewed in light of the DSL.\nThe DSL introduces a dual penalty system for violations. Both organizations in violation and individuals directly in charge or directly liable can be fined.17 For breach of data security obligations, organizations in breach could face a fine of up to CNY 2 million, as well as suspension of the relevant business and/or revocation of the relevant business license. Responsible individuals can face fines of up to CNY 200,000. For violations of the national management system for core state data, violators can face fines of up to CNY 10 million, as well as suspension of the relevant business and/or revocation of the relevant business license. Criminal liability may also apply if such activities constitute a crime. For violations of the requirements for the cross-border transfer of important data, organizations can face fines of up to CNY 10 million, suspension of the relevant business and/or revocation of the relevant business license, and criminal liability if such activities constitute crimes. Responsible individuals can also face fines of up to CNY 1 million. For unauthorized provision of data to overseas law enforcement or judicial authorities, organizations can face fines of up to CNY 5 million, and responsible individuals can face fines of up to CNY 500,000.\nWhat to Expect\nThe new DSL represents a strategic move by the Chinese government to regulate the processing and cross-border transfer of data and assert its data sovereignty. However, many of the requirements and concepts require further implementation and clarification from regulators. We expect that in the upcoming months, relevant governmental authorities in China will issue a series of ancillary measures, regulations and policies to interpret and implement the provisions of the DSL. Foreign businesses that need access to or process data stored in China, or that process data relating to their China operations offshore, should pay close attention.\n- DSL, Article 2.\n- DSL, Article 3.\n- DSL, Article 24.\n- DSL, Article 29.\n- DSL, Article 21.\n- Classification and Grading of Industrial Data (Trial), Chapter 3 (available at http://www.cac.gov.cn/2020-03/08/c_1585210563153197.htm).\n- DSL, Article 21\n- DSL, Article 21.\n- DSL, Article 30.\n- DSL, Article 30.\n- DSL, Article 31\n- DSL, Article 36.\n- PIPL, Article 41.\n- DSL, Article 25.\n- DSL, Article 26.\n- DSL, Article 35.\n- DSL, Chapter 6. back to top']	['<urn:uuid:e6b7e683-89ce-4e47-9219-6b5df96b10ac>', '<urn:uuid:84037f1e-552b-4aa6-9329-e55fcd4d067d>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	9	120	3488
85	brain size intelligence animals link	The relationship between intelligence and brain size is not direct, but rather depends on the ratio of brain weight to body weight. In humans this ratio is about 1:50, while in other mammals it's closer to 1:80 or 1:200. The smaller the ratio, the more intelligent the animal.	"['Five examples of neurological nonsense you can forget about for good.The human brain has received unprecedented press coverage in the past few years, thanks in large part to big leaps in science\'s understanding of what goes on in the space between our ears. Yet, some stubborn myths remain.[via msn]\nFor this special installment of Brain & Body, we\'re offering insights into which commonly held beliefs stem from reliable studies in neuroscience—and which are just plain mindless. For further information on these fallacies, we\'ve consulted our favorite research neuroscientist and go-to brain guy, Istvan Molnar-Szakacs, Ph.D., of the Semel Institute\'s Tennenbaum Center for the Biology of Creativity at UCLA.\nMyth: Listening to Mozart makes you smarter.\nReality: It may make you feel superior, but listening to Mozart won\'t make you any smarter than bumping along to the latest cut by Lil\' Wayne. The Mozart idea first took hold following a 1993 study published in Nature that showed that 12 students scored higher on a spatial IQ test after listening to a Mozart sonata. Author Don Campbell ran with the notion in his pop-psychology book The Mozart Effect, and a multi-million–dollar industry arose selling CDs and videos to parents holding out hope their little ones would harness the intellectual power of Amadeus.\nHowever, subsequent research failed to replicate the (small) study\'s results. And the original researchers later re-emphasized the qualifications in their findings; notably, that the effect was temporary, not extending beyond 10 or 15 minutes. ""The myth does bring attention to the value of music as a tool for stimulating the brain,"" says Molnar-Szakacs. ""We know that playing a musical instrument in childhood improves performance in academic areas other than music. But just listening to Mozart while cramming for a test is no reliable way to improve your score, let alone your IQ.""\nMyth: People with autism have genius talents.\nReality: There\'s not a great deal known about savant syndrome, the very curious condition in which people with developmental disorders such as autism show astonishing skills in music, art, or math. But we do know that the widespread misconception about its prominence is traceable to the 1988 film ""Rain Man,""and that the movie\'s hero would be exceptionally skilled, and exceptionally rare, even among savants. According to Darold A. Treffert, M.D., of the Wisconsin Medical Society—a recognized expert on savant syndrome— approximately one in 10 people with autism spectrum disorder has some savant skills. (Among those with other developmental disabilities, fewer than 1 in 100 are savants.) Treffert estimates that no more than 50 people in the world are ""prodigious savants"" like the toothpick-counting character portrayed by Dustin Hoffman.\nBeware the characterization of genius, too. The famous ""calculating twins"" written about by Oliver Sacks, M.D., in The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hatcould see prime numbers in a fallen stack of matches or tell you which day of the week July 4 would fall on in the year 3024, but they couldn\'t do simple multiplication.\nMyth: Smarter animals have bigger brains.\nReality: A sperm whale\'s brain is more than five times the weight of a human\'s—yet the animal with the world\'s largest brain still can\'t play a decent game of chess. What gives?\n""The relationship isn\'t directly between brain size and smarts, but rather in the ratio of brain weight to body weight and smarts,"" explains Molnar-Szakacs. ""In a human, whose brain weighs around 3 pounds, the ratio is about 1:50. But in other mammals it\'s closer to 1:80 or 1:200. So, the smaller the ratio, the more intelligent the animal.""\nMolnar-Szakacs adds that, even beyond the brain-to-body weight ratio, it is what\'s inside the cranium that counts. ""The parts of the human brain that control higher cognitive functions are the cerebral cortices,"" he says. ""These are the areas responsible for the uniquely [high-functioning] human abilities of language, memory, and planning for the future. The cerebral cortices enable us to learn and adapt our responses to our environment in much more sophisticated ways than other animals. For example, we have the capability to override predominant, stimulus-driven responses, so that we can say \'no\' to chocolate cake if it\'ll break our diet even if we are still hungry and know it would taste really good.""\nMyth: Drink enough alcohol and you\'ll start killing brain cells.\nReality: Drunken frat boys head-butting one another in a bar may give you pause to consider this one, but alcohol does not kill neurons or create holes in the brain. However, there\'s no denying that alcohol and other drugs of abuse impact brain systems. It\'s their effect on the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin that goose the brain\'s reward system, leading to feelings of euphoria—and, when more of the drug is needed to create the same effect, to tolerance and addiction.\n""Over the short-term, alcohol and drugs alter brain function rather than affecting brain structure,"" Molnar-Szakacs clarifies. ""Slurred speech, impaired motor response, and impaired judgment are all symptomatic of compromised frontal lobes, the centers of the brain that direct higher-level decision making.""\nRarely, a chronic drinker may develop Wernicke-Korsakoff\'s Syndrome, a condition characterized by atrophy or shrinking of the thalamus and hypothalamus and the inability to recall or form memories. This syndrome\'s not a direct effect of drinking, but rather a secondary result of alcohol abuse so severe that absorption of vitamin B-1 is prevented, leaving the brain malnourished.\nMyth: Most people use only 10 percent of their brain.\nReality: A quote from William James that\'s been mangled, misinterpreted, and misused may explain the myth\'s origins. In making a general point about human potential, the philosophical psychologist said that people ""make use of a very small portion of their possible consciousness, and of their soul\'s resources in general."" Anecdotal evidence of individuals suffering physical damage to the brain and continuing to function, such as the famous story of Phineas Gage, may also have contributed over the years.\nThanks to the development of neuroimaging technologies—machines that allow us to view not only structures but functions of the brain at work—this myth is handily debunked. While we may not use all of our brain all of time, multiple areas are simultaneously recruited for every task we undertake. For example, all the different parts of the brain responsible for vision, sensation, planning, motor coordination, muscle activity, and homeostasis are required to play a game of tennis or write words on a page.

86	How do modern farming systems deal with space limitations, and what mathematical methods can we use to evaluate if new agricultural approaches will work better than traditional ones?	Modern vertical farming systems address space limitations by expanding production vertically in multilayer indoor facilities, requiring significantly less horizontal space than conventional agriculture's 1.5 billion hectares. To evaluate if new approaches will work better, one can multiply the chance of success by the confidence level in the prediction. For example, if you believe a new system has a 70% chance of success and your prediction accuracy is 60%, the actual probability of outperforming is 54% (calculated as 70%*60%+30%*40%).	['This article is the fifth in a ten-part series loosely based on Michael J. Mauboussin’s white paper “Thirty Years: Reflections on the Ten Attributes of Great Investors.” See “Part One: Be Numerate,” “Part Two: Understand Value,” “Part Three: Properly Assess Strategy,” and “Part Four: Compare Effectively” for previous installments. And please keep in mind that although I’m basing my work on Mauboussin’s, I am departing from his ideas on occasion.\nWhenever you come up with a new investment idea—whether it’s a new security to buy, a new factor to consider, or a new strategy to implement—you naturally ask yourself whether this new idea will increase your portfolio returns or cause you to lose money (and, of course, how much). Thinking probabilistically involves assessing the probabilities and coming up with a reasoned answer. In this article I’ll tackle strategies and factors first before dealing with individual securities.\nAssessing the Odds of a New Factor or Strategy\nIf you’re assessing the new factor or strategy on the basis of past performance, this involves three steps: assessing how well it would have worked in the past; assessing how correlative past results are to future (out-of-sample) results in general; and assessing whether the new factor or strategy will have better odds than the factor or strategy it is replacing (assuming you have to take the money from one in order to implement another).\nIf, on the other hand, you think that past performance is irrelevant to assessing future success, or that the correlation between past performance and future performance is unknowable, negative, or minimal, then you have to come up with another way of assessing future performance. But even in this case, you should also factor in your estimate of the correlation between your ideas and their future performance.\nSo let’s take a concrete example. Let’s say I want to replace a microcap-only strategy with a similar strategy that invests in stocks of all sizes, and that I believe that backtesting its past performance will give me some relevant results.\nThe first step is to test using robust methods. Test both systems on subsets of the universes you’re going to be investing in, and on subsets of the time period you’re backtesting. Try to make the tests as similar as possible to each other.\nSo, for this example, I’m going to backtest my strategies using Portfolio123. I’m going to make the two strategies as similar to each other as possible except that one will emphasize microcaps and the other won’t. In addition, I’ll program my slippage costs for the microcap model to be more than double my costs for the other.\nIt turns out that in 14 out of 16 tests, my new strategy (all caps) gives worse results than my old one (microcaps). That gives me only a 12.5% chance that my new strategy is an improvement.\nNow I estimate that the correlation between past performance and out-of-sample performance of stock strategies is around 0.2 (using Kendall’s tau; 0.3 using Pearson’s r). To get at that number I took fifty strategies that I had not backtested that were loosely based on screening rules that were written by others. I did so in order to minimize the chance of using factors that I had already developed or tested, since those might contaminate the experiment. I tested and compared these strategies’ performance over various time periods.\nThis 0.2 correlation translates to a 40% chance that the past relative performance of any two strategies will reverse. (Here’s the math, if you’re interested; if not skip to the next paragraph. Kendall’s tau is calculated by looking at every possible pair in the two series and classifying them as concordant or discordant, depending on whether they’re in the same order or not. You then take the number of concordant pairs, subtract the number of discordant pairs, and divide by the total number of pairs. For example, let’s calculate the correlation between 1 2 3 4 5 and 1 3 5 2 4. Each series has ten pairs. 1 2 is concordant, 1 3 is concordant, 1 4 is concordant, 1 5 is concordant, 2 3 is discordant, 2 4 is concordant, 2 5 is discordant, 3 4 is concordant, 3 5 is concordant, and 4 5 is discordant. The correlation is thus (7 – 3)/10 = 0.4, and the chance that the relative position of a pair will reverse—a discordant pair, in other words—is three out of ten, or 30%. If the correlation had been 0.2, that would have been the result of (6 – 4)/10, and the chance of a discordant pair would be 40%.)\nTo calculate the chance of an event occurring with a certain level of confidence (or a certain correlation), you multiply the chance that the event will occur by the chance that you’re right, multiply the chance that it won’t occur by the chance that you’re wrong, and add them up. (The weird corollary is that if you’re right precisely half the time—a correlation or confidence level of zero—the probability of an event occurring will always be 50%, no matter how likely or unlikely it is.)\nThe probability that my new system will work better than my old one, then, is actually 42.5%. (The formula is 12.5%*60%+87.5%*40%.) This is still not high enough to bank on . . .\nNow let’s say you consider past performance a completely unreliable measure of the success of a strategy. And let’s say you think your new strategy has a 70% chance of performing better than your old strategy. Well, the other number to take into account is the correlation between your predictions and what actually happens in the future.\nIn other words, how good a strategy designer are you? Let’s say you design ten strategies, and you judge one of those to be better than another. What is the chance that if you invest in both those strategies you’ll be right? Try to be as objective as you can here.\nSo let’s say that you think that this chance is about 60% (again, this represents a correlation of 0.2). Do the math again (70%*60%+30%*40%). It turns out you have a 54% chance of outperforming, not a 70% chance. So you might want to balance your investment between the two strategies, or combine them into one somehow.\nSo far, we’ve been discussing new strategies; but we can apply the same line of thinking to new factors. With factors, we have additional tools at our disposal because we can combine them using ranking and weighting. (We can combine strategies too, of course, but it’s not as easy to do.)\nThere are lots of ways to assess the effectiveness of a factor. The most traditional is to rank stocks in terms of the factor and see how well each quantile performed in the past. Many scholars simulate shorting the bottom quintile or decile and going long the top quintile or decile, but with some factors the middle quantiles may have performed the best.\nLet’s look, once again, at a concrete example. I have a four-factor ranking system and I’m considering adding a fifth factor to it. The decile returns for my four-factor system over the universe of stocks that I invest in, with a one-month holding period, over the last ten years, looks like this:\nIf I add my new factor, I get a chart like this:\nClearly, the second system, with five factors, works better than the first.\nBut if you look at probability, there’s a problem with this way of thinking. You could keep adding factors and varying their weights ad infinitum until you had a system that was perfectly optimized according to the tests that you run on it. Your system will look something like this:\nOr, taking a more granular view with thirty quantiles rather than ten:\nYour system will be optimized precisely for the time period that you are testing it for.\nWhat is the probability that a system optimized for a specific period of time will outperform a non-optimized system in a different time period?\nI’m not sure. But I want to offer an analogy.\nLet’s say you’re designing a robot to play poker. In order to do so, you want the robot to play against real poker players so that it can learn from practicing the game. So you collect the five best poker players in your hometown and the robot plays poker with them. It soon gets so good that it can beat them at any game anytime. Now what would happen if you sat it down with five different poker players? It would probably fail miserably. Why? Because it would have learned how to beat the first five players based on their reactions to the cards and to each other, on their tells and on their strategies. On the other hand, if you had simply taught the robot the rules of playing poker and had fed it a variety of different examples and made it think about things more abstractly, it probably wouldn’t have won nearly as handily against the first five players, but would probably have performed better against the second five.\nThe analogy is imperfect, I admit. Poker doesn’t change as much as the stock market. A stock-market strategy or factor that worked really well in the 1960s may not have as much relevance in the 2020s as one that worked well in the 2010s.\nAt any rate, I recently ran an experiment. Remember those fifty strategies I told you about earlier? I took the ones that had performed best over a certain time period and tested them over a subsequent time period. Some of them did well, others did not. When I combined the ones that had done best in the first period into one comprehensive system, it did quite well in the second—better than most of those that had performed best in the first. When I optimized the one that had done best in the first period, fiddling with the factor weights until its performance was greatly improved, it didn’t do as well as the combined system in the second period. When I optimized the combined system to improve its performance in the first period, its performance in the second period got worse. Now this is a very small and limited experiment, and my results are hardly representative. It would take me many months to optimize dozens of systems over different time periods and test them all. But this does indicate that optimization may not be the best idea.\nThe other reason to be wary of optimization is the fact that with low correlations, what outperforms in one period is likely to suffer from mean regression and underperform in another period. In my previous article, “How to Bet,” I published the following correlation table.\nLet’s say seven players play a tournament and player 1 wins, player 2 comes in second, and so on. The top row lists Kendall’s correlation; the other rows list the chance of each player winning in a second tournament. (I created the table by taking every possible order of seven players and grouping them according to their correlation with the first order.) You’ll see that with a correlation of 0.333 or higher, the top player has the best chance of winning; with a correlation of 0.238, the top two players have an equal chance of winning; with a correlation of 0.143, the top player has a lower chance of winning than the second- and third-place winners; and with a correlation of 0.048, the top player has an equal chance of winning as the sixth player, with the second, third, fourth, and fifth all having a better chance. This is due to the fact that absent a perfect correlation, there will always be some element of mean regression.\nAssessing the Odds of a Security’s Future Price Increase\nLet me start out by saying forthrightly that I believe that there is no way to do this. If there were, stock picking would be simple and profitable. And it’s definitely not. Instead, your best bet is to think about your strategy’s odds rather than the odds of an individual stock or ETF.\nMauboussin has a few pointed words about this. “When probability plays a large role in outcomes, it makes sense to focus on the process of making decisions rather than the outcome alone. The reason is that a particular outcome may not be indicative of the quality of the decision. Good decisions sometimes result in bad outcomes and bad decisions lead to good outcomes. Over the long haul, however, good decisions portend favorable outcomes even if you will be wrong from time to time. . . . Learning to focus on process and accept the periodic and inevitable bad outcomes is crucial.”\nAllow me to add a few words about stock-return odds in general.\nI recently took tens of thousands of random samples of 1-year returns of stocks over the last twenty years (with a minimum market cap of $50 million and a minimum price of $1.00, and with no survivor bias). For such stocks, here are the decile median returns:\nIn other words, a randomly chosen stock out of this group will have a ten percent chance of a 93% gain, a ten percent chance of a 78% loss, and a ten percent chance of each of the other numbers in-between.\nHere is a graph of the returns distribution (the rightmost bar represents stocks with a return greater than 250%).\nThe median stock gets a 5.35% return and the average stock gets an 8.12% return. If you were to randomly choose twenty stocks a year and then do so again and again thousands of times, your compounded annualized return would likely be between 3.9% and 8.7%. On the other hand, if you were to randomly choose just one stock a year and then do so again and again thousands of times, your compounded annualized return would likely be a 100% loss, because at some point you’re going to choose a stock that goes bankrupt. (This is the key to understanding why some small amount of diversification is essential: you need to minimize the probability of losing all your money. Because of this risk, I would advise you to never put all your money into fewer than four stocks.)\nThe best you can hope for when you choose a stock is a returns distribution that is somewhat better than that of the average stock. Some writers, when they talk about choosing stocks, discuss “expected return.” But doing so without considering the entirety of the returns distribution can lead to gross errors such as the one Harry Markowitz made at the outset of his seminal 1952 paper “Portfolio Selection,” the foundation of Modern Portfolio Theory, in which he incorrectly “proved” that to maximize the expected return of a portfolio you should put all your money into the one security with the highest expected return. Markowitz ignored the laws of probability, as does MPT in general.\nBut that will be the subject of a future article . . .', 'Agricultural systems around the world need to adapt to the rapidly changing environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic landscapes, and new alternative practices, such as vertical agriculture, may offer new opportunities to accelerate such adaptation.\nNext Gen Farming Without Soil and 90% Less Water | GRATEFUL\nWhat is vertical farming and why is it important\nModern agricultural systems encompass an estimated 1.5 billion hectares of the world’s surface area. With a growing population and resource needs, the availability of arable land is shrinking rapidly.\nSince the agricultural revolution, conventional agriculture has focused on practices requiring considerable quantities of space, water, fertilizer, and pesticides. The past 50 years have seen an accelerating rate of increase in these requirements as modern food production aims to increase productivity in the hopes of addressing growing food insecurity.\nLooking into the future, yield production is forecasted to decrease due to widespread environmental and socioeconomic changes that will generate unpredictable consequences on food systems.\nIn response, many strategies have been developed as alternatives to conventional agricultural practices. These strategies have focused on key principles and their combination to be effective: require less space, less water, and increase yield per unit of area. Moreover, due to the negative effects of agrichemicals, modern practices have also aimed to use significantly less to avoid potentially adverse effects for humans and animals.\nOne such alternative is the development of vertical agriculture, also referred to as vertical farming. As the name implies, vertical agriculture relies on expanding production vertically and not horizontally. Vertical agriculture is a multilayer indoor plant production system that allows for precise control of growth factors, such as light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, water, and nutrients.\nThis allows for the growing and production of crops year-round, completely independent of solar light and other external conditions. Indeed, vertical agriculture makes use of key concepts within ecology and physiology to optimize growing and fertilization within controlled conditions. For instance, elements of photobiology, thermomorphogenesis, hydroponics, and genetic breeding, are all used commonly across systems of vertical agriculture.\nBenefits, challenges, and disadvantages moving from horizontal to vertical farming\nAs a result of tight control over crop breeding, growing, and harvesting, vertical farming provides several benefits relative to conventional methods of ‘horizontal’ food production. This was the topic of a literature review by Kalantari et al. published in 2016 in the Journal of Landscape Ecology.\nFrom a systems perspective, the enclosed design prevents pests and diseases from entering by the adoption of a high level of hygiene, continuous monitoring, and non-chemical disinfection, providing security from crops. Moreover, recent technology has also allowed for automated control over environmental conditions by using sensors and imaging techniques in combination with crop simulation models and artificial intelligence, limiting the need for physical labor.\nVertical farming also allows for flexible organization, with designs ranging from large vertical walls covered with crops to large hangars or re-used shipping containers that can be transported. Consequently, vertical agricultural systems, can comprise many varying sizes and be located within many different areas from the middle of highly urbanized cities to more suburban or rural areas.\nMoreover, the verticality element of this system also provides nutrient and water flow, helping to reuse costly resources. The reduction in space also means there is a significant increase in yield per area, holding extensive potential for a future world of urbanization.\nFrom an economic perspective, vertical farming also provides for more jobs in localized areas and is community-focused by addressing the needs of immediate areas, which in turn can provide food at a lower price. Finally, the optionality of location for vertical systems also allows producers to reduce transport costs, as consumers may access them within urban areas, or transport can be minimized to nearby areas.\nHowever, despite the design, environmental, and economic advantages, vertical farming also incorporates several issues that remain a challenge to its broader implementation as a system.\nVertical farming has a high energy requirement and needs extensive investment costs to implement and develop successfully. Moreover, indoor issues relating to excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage may have unpredictable repercussions for plant growth.\nAdditionally, vertical systems are difficult to adapt to a larger scale. They are costly to build and maintain and have yet to demonstrate the ability to provide food for larger areas than community-scale populations. This would make it difficult to implement in areas at higher risk of food insecurity, such as developing agricultural nations.\nThe lack of empirical research on a broader scale has meant that vertical farming has yet to develop past the concept stage on community levels, as persistent issues make it difficult to break through to a larger scale.\nImage Credit: YEINISM/Shutterstock.com\nGrowing skywards - the implications of vertical farming in a rapidly populating and changing world\nAmong the development of alternative agricultural practices, vertical agriculture provides a promising solution for many of the challenges facing current agricultural policies. However, for vertical systems to be integrated on a larger scale requires further technological progress and economic investment.\nNevertheless, gradually implementing more verticality, or combining it with other practices aiming for more sustainable practices may be promising. For instance, the combination of verticality with other practices such as intercropping may be particularly beneficial for developing more sustainable food systems.\nIncorporating technological progress into vertical systems also holds promise, with automated sensors and machinery able to operate near-independently. Progress in gene editing and plant genome modifications will also allow for faster, bigger, and healthier crops, allowing vertical agriculture to produce more over time.\nThroughout agricultural history, farming systems have typically spread over large spans of land, yet the reduction in arable land, as well as the increase in demand to house growing populations, means that such strategies need to be reconsidered, and vertical agriculture may play a role looking into the future.\nContinue Reading: Benefits of Vertical Agriculture and Hydroponics\n- Beacham, A.

87	How do wool rugs resist dirt, and what sizes work best?	Wool rugs are naturally dirt-resistant because their opaque fibers hide dirt better than brighter man-made fibers. Additionally, wool rugs are easy to maintain and cost-effective. Regarding size, it's crucial to choose appropriately - in living rooms, the rug should be large enough for furniture's front legs to rest on it, while in dining rooms, it needs to accommodate pulled-out chairs. A rug that's too small can look out of place, while one that's too large can overwhelm the space.	['Just like any other investments, rugs should be taken care of if you want them to last longer. Fortunately enough, your wool rugs are easier to clean because wool rugs are dirt-resistant in composition. Wools fibres are opaque and dirt doesn’t show as much as with some clearer, brighter man-made fibres. It’s true that wools are probably one of the most cost-effective types of rugs because they are easy to maintain. However, that fact doesn’t exclude the need of cleaning them once in a while.\nSome people say that vacuum has the most damaging effect on rugs. High powered vacuums can even pull the threads out of the back of rugs and cause sprouts to appear. But for wool rugs, that is not the case. Vacuuming your wool rugs twice a week will save you the penny to buy new one. However, for other rugs, it can still be advised to use vacuum cleaners for as long as the beater bars in the cleaner are removed.\nAnother way of taking care of your rugs is by becoming sensitive about the dirt that your rugs get. If your kids or pets had soiled your rugs, be sure to clean the dirt rightaway. Or in other cases, if the stain is caused by foods, scoop up the food residues and try to absorb the liquids the moment they spill onto your rug. It’s important to note that you should only use a paper towel or cloth to blot stains. Letting the stain dry on your rug will cause you extra work will only damage your rug -- both causes additional bother to us.\nSteaming can be a very effective way for wool cleaning. By letting the steam get into the fibres of your wool, the residues or dirt will let loose on the fibres of your rug. This can make your rug extra easy to clean. Furthermore, it is strongly discouraged that you rub your rugs because it can cause pilling and matting. It’s not advisable to soak your wool rugs in water. Wool rugs have fibres that can absorb more water than synthetic fibres. Soaking them and then letting them dry would take time. Wool rugs will become evidently heavy as well. Excess soap and water can ruin your rug, too.\nEvery rug owner should know the practice of rotating their rugs 180 degrees every six months to ensure even wear. Exposure to direct sunlight will always be a factor to consider when placing a rug in a room. Rotating the rug will help your rug looks balanced in colour. Besides, all fibres, dyed or un-dyed will normally change over time.\nBut above all these, it’s safe to say that the easiest, safest and effective deep cleaning solution for any type of area rugs is to have them rolled up and taken away for cleaning by experts. Not all wool rugs are the same for they have different fibre thickness. The best way to extend the life of your rugs is by reading the cleaning instructions for your rugs carefully before setting up the piece of art in any area of your room.', 'Rugs significantly contribute to the beauty and coziness of our living areas. They bring in vibrant colors, diverse textures, and a sense of warmth, transforming a mere house into a welcoming home. However, the journey doesn’t end with just picking any rug; it involves careful selection and ongoing maintenance to guarantee that these rugs not only elevate the appearance of your space but also endure over time. Understanding the critical factors in choosing the ideal rug and following effective maintenance strategies are vital steps in this process.\nUnderstanding Rug Selection for Your Space\nChoosing the right rug for your space can greatly enhance the look and feel of a room. It’s important to consider various factors to make the best choice.\nThe size of the rug is crucial. It can define a room’s look. A small rug in a large room might look out of place. On the other hand, a rug that’s too large can overwhelm the space. Generally, in a living room, a rug should be large enough for the front legs of the furniture to rest on it. This helps to unify the look. For a dining room, ensure that the rug is big enough to accommodate the chairs, even when you pull it out. In a bedroom, a rug that extends around the bed creates a cozy atmosphere.\nColor and Pattern\nThe color and pattern of the rug play a significant role in setting the mood of your space. If your room already has a lot of colors and patterns, you might want to choose a rug with neutral tones and simple designs. This helps to balance the room’s appearance. Conversely, if your room has more neutral shades, a rug with bold colors or intricate patterns can add a touch of vibrancy. Remember, light-color rugs make a room appear more spacious, while dark-color rugs create a cozier feel.\nThe material of the rug is another important aspect. Different materials offer different textures and durability. Wool rugs are popular for their softness and durability. They are ideal for high-traffic areas like living rooms. Cotton rugs are lighter and easier to clean, making them suitable for kitchens or children’s rooms. Synthetic materials like nylon or polyester are stain-resistant and affordable, perfect for busy households. Natural fibers like jute or sisal offer a rustic look and are eco-friendly.\nComfort and Maintenance\nComfort is key, especially in areas where you spend a lot of time. Plush, soft rugs are great for bedrooms or living rooms where you might walk barefoot. For areas that require frequent cleaning, like dining rooms or entryways, choose rugs that are easy to clean and maintain. It’s also important to consider if anyone in your home has allergies. Some materials, like synthetic rugs, are hypoallergenic and a good choice for allergy sufferers.\nBalancing with Furniture and Decor\nThe rug should complement your furniture and remodeling. It acts as a connecting element in the room. Consider the style of your furniture and decor when choosing a rug. A traditional Persian rug might suit a room with classic furniture, while a contemporary geometric rug is better suited for modern decor. The rug should tie the room together, not clash with it.\nEssentials of Rug Care and Maintenance\nMaintaining and caring for rugs is key to ensuring they last long and stay beautiful. This article provides simple and effective tips for rug care and maintenance. Understanding these tips can help you keep your rugs in great condition.\nRegular Cleaning is Crucial\nRegular cleaning is essential for rug upkeep. Dirt and dust can accumulate over time, damaging the rug fibers. Vacuum your rug at least once a week. Be gentle when you vacuum. Avoid vacuuming the fringe, as it can cause damage. For high traffic areas, you may need to vacuum more frequently.\nSpot Cleaning Spills and Stains\nAccidents happen, and quick action is important. Blot spills immediately with a clean, dry cloth. Do not rub, as this can push the spill deeper into the rug. Use a mild detergent and water for spot cleaning. Test any cleaner on a small, hidden area first to ensure it does not harm the rug.\nProfessional cleaning is high priority for traditional rugs Virginia every one to two years. Experts possess the necessary tools and expertise to clean these rugs without causing any damage. This is particularly crucial for high-value or antique oriental rugs, where improper cleaning can lead to irreversible harm. Professional cleaning effectively removes deep dirt and helps in restoring the original beauty of wholesale oriental rugs, preserving their quality and appearance for the long term.\nAvoiding Sun Damage\nSunlight can fade rugs over time. To prevent this, rotate your rug periodically. This ensures even exposure to sunlight. If possible, use curtains or blinds to reduce direct sunlight on the rug.\nDealing with Moisture and Humidity\nMoisture can be harmful to rugs. It can lead to mold and mildew. Ensure not to expose the rug to constant moisture. In humid conditions, use a dehumidifier to maintain a healthy level of humidity in your home.\nWhen storing a rug, clean it first. Roll it instead of folding to avoid creases. Wrap the rug in a breathable fabric, like cotton, to protect it from dust. Avoid plastic, as it can trap moisture. Store the rug in a cool, dry place.\nRotating Your Rug\nRotating your area rug in the living room every few months can prevent uneven wear. This is especially important in high-traffic areas. Rotating helps in distributing wear and tear evenly, prolonging the rug’s life.\nPadding for Protection\nUsing a pad under your rug can extend its life. Pads reduce wear by absorbing the impact of footsteps. They also provide additional comfort and prevent the rug from slipping.\nBeing Mindful with Furniture\nHeavy furniture can damage rugs. Use coasters under furniture legs to distribute the weight. This prevents the fibers. Be careful when moving furniture on the rug to avoid tearing or stretching the rug.\nImmediate Action on Pet Damage\nIf you have pets, be vigilant. Address pet accidents immediately. Use cleaners specifically for pet stains. Trim your pet’s nails to avoid pulls or tears on the rug.\nRugs are more than just decorative items; they are investments in the comfort and aesthetic of our homes. Choosing the right rug involves understanding the interplay of size, color, pattern, and material with your existing decor. Maintaining Persian rugs VA through regular cleaning, proper handling, and protective measures ensures their longevity and beauty. By giving thought to both selection and care, you can enhance your living space and enjoy the warmth and style that a well-chosen rug brings to your home.']	['<urn:uuid:e5307711-7213-4742-baf6-9e443dfb7153>', '<urn:uuid:adda58bf-f57c-459e-b35a-27aa2c2a88e1>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	11	79	1630

"['- Music is arranged in reoccuring patterns called octaves.\n- Octaves to the right have higher pitches than those to the left.\n- There are 12 tones within an octave.\n- These 12 tones are repeated in higher and lower pitches.\n- When you select a key, you are deciding which of the 12 tones will serve as the anchor point for the song.\n- The key is the lowest tone.\n- In this example, we have chosen E as the key.\n- Now the octave will begin on E.\n- Selecting a scale defines which 7 of the 12 tones you will use for creating chords and melodies (Scale Tones).\n- The scale defines the intervals between each tone that is used.\n- Here we have chosen a Major scale.\n- When multiple tones are played together, they form a chord.\n- A different chord starts on each scale tone, each identified with a Roman numeral.\n- The spacing between the tones in each chord define whether the chord is MAJOR, minor, diminished* or AUGMENTED+.\n- Most chords start with the root tone, and then skip scale tones (1-3-5-7-9-11-13).\n- In this example we are playing the I chord, with the root of E.\n- Triads contain 3 tones (1-3-5).\n- Sevenths contain 4 tones (1-3-5-7).\n- Extended chords can include the 9, 11 and/or 13 positions.\n- The root of every chord becomes the 1 position of that chord, regardless of scale tone position.\n- In the second example we play an A (IV) chord, where the A becomes the 1 position.\n- Inversions are used to keep different chords in the same pitch/frequency range.\n- Here we take the 5 (E) and 7 (G#) positions of the chord and place them ahead of the 1 position (A).\n- This changes the chord\'s pitch without changing it\'s character.\nA melody is a sequence of individual tones, played from the selected scale. Most melodies focus on the same tones that are used in the chord that is being played. They are called chord tones. When playing a melody, chord tones will work pretty much anywhere in your pattern. AutoTheory\'s Smart Scale makes it very easy to focus on chord tones, as it allows you to keep your hand in the same position while chord tones shift to the same spots with each chord change. Chord Tones are indicated with color stripes at the bottom edges of the Smart Scale keyboard display.\nWhile Chord Tones will always sound good in a melody, you might want to utilize the scale tones in between them as well. This will provide you with ""step movement"", which is smoother than the leaps that occur between each chord tone. Non chord tones should be used in a subtle manner however. If your melody utilizes too many non chord tones, it probably won\'t sound that great. This is often the difference between a mediocre musician and a high level musician. It is probably a good idea to avoid using non chord tones during strong beats (kick drums) or when a chord is initially played. You are better served to slip them in on snares or hi hats.\nBasslines usually focus on the ""root"" tone of the chord that is being played. AutoTheory\'s Smart Scale shifts the ""root"" to the first white key in the ""Chord Tones"" and ""Dynamic Scale"" mappings.\nWhile using a simple ""root"" oriented bassline works well alongside a more complex melody, sometimes you want your bassline to have more movement. When doing this you still want to emphasize the ""root"", while implementing the same melody techniques mentioned above regarding chord tones and non chord tones.\nWhen using a bassline that has a lot of movement, it is probably a good idea to limit the movement of your melody. A simple melody with less tones that sustain longer will complement an active bassline well. When your melody and bassline are both moving around a lot, it often leads to conflict. A good technique to use is going back and forth between an active melody, and an active bassline.\nWhen you look at music theory, there are certain trends that are highly prevalent in most forms of popular music. Many songs utilize three different chords. The i chord is often emphasized, serving as the center piece of many songs. The iv and v chords are also very important, as they form ""strong progressions"" from the i chord. Strong Progressions occur with changes of chords that are three or four scale tones apart, they will always sound good. Weak progressions occur with changes of chords that are one, two, five or six positions apart. Weak progressions are good for breaking up the predictability of strong progressions.']"	['<urn:uuid:c52d5731-fbb8-475f-9978-5b23d06e5a4d>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	10	21	790
89	How many properties did Japanese buyers purchase in 2018?	Japanese buyers purchased 581 homes on O'ahu in 2018.	['Luxury real estate in Hawaii remains a seller’s market despite higher inflation and interest rates, and the relative absence of Japanese buyers.\nOn each of Hawaii’s four largest islands, the number of single-family homes sold in May for $1.75 million or more was at least double what it was in the months before pandemic restrictions began. Yet the number of homes in this “luxury” price range available for sale was 40% below average; low inventory generally gives sellers an advantage in a real estate market.\nThese are two highlights from the luxury market report published in June by Corcoran Pacific Properties. Here’s what the O’ahu Luxury Market Report says:\n- 57 luxury single-family homes sold in May, down from 60 in May 2021. The median price for these homes was $2.38 million, down 6% from May 2021\n- In the condo market selling for $750,000 or more, sales rose 74% in May to 153 units sold, from 88 in May 2021. Interestingly, the median price in this luxury range fell 9% to settle at $890,000.\n“Solid first quarter”\nGregg Antonsen, recently appointed senior vice president of luxury sales at Corcoran Pacific Properties, said that although the Oʻahu market is facing headwinds due to economic and geopolitical factors, sales of high-end homes are always strong.\n“We had a very strong first quarter and May was a continuation of that, but we started to see mixed signals,” he says.\n“It’s still a seller’s market and it will remain a seller’s market, but I think we’re going to see the price increases start to come down, sort of stabilize. We will see an increase in inventory, which is actually a healthy thing.\nInventory, the number of homes for sale, has been tight since Hawaii’s real estate market took off a few months after the pandemic hit in early 2020.\nInventory of single-family homes priced at $1.75 million and above on Oʻahu was 145 in May 2022, down 14% from May 2021. However, inventory of condos for sale at 750 $000 or more statewide in May 2022 was 326 units, 8% higher than May 2021.\nFewer offers from buyers\nThe number of offers is an indication that the market may be shrinking: in the past two years, a real estate advertisement has sometimes received a dozen or more offers.\n“We always see a lot of activity, it’s just that instead of getting five or six offers, you can get one or two,” says Antonsen. “You always get offers. I just think the speed and pace will slow down.\nHe says luxury home buyers are mostly from the mainland – usually from California. Many are cash buyers who may not be as sensitive to higher mortgage rates as buyers of cheaper homes.\nShoppers from Japan are still somewhat absent, who have yet to return to Hawai’i in large numbers since the onset of Covid. Last year, Japanese buyers purchased 211 properties on O’ahu; that’s up from 114 in 2020, but only a fraction of the 581 homes they bought in 2018.\n“It’s a big question mark,” Antonsen said. “Are they going to come back with a request or not?”']	['<urn:uuid:4cbfa02b-2e9d-43bc-9a6d-454b6320a470>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	9	9	524
90	How do homeowners' associations work in condos vs townhouses?	In both condos and townhouses, residents must pay monthly HOA fees. For condos, the HOA manages the building, its grounds, and interior common spaces. In townhouse communities, the HOA manages common areas, including general grounds and sometimes roofs and building exteriors. HOAs also establish rules for residents, which may include restrictions on renting, noise levels, and property modifications. The rules and fees can vary significantly between properties.	"['When buying a home, there are so many choices you have to make. From area to cost to whether or not a badly out-of-date kitchen is a dealbreaker, you\'ll be required to think about a lot of aspects on your course to homeownership. One of the most important ones: what kind of home do you desire to live in? You\'re most likely going to find yourself dealing with the condo vs. townhouse dispute if you\'re not interested in a detached single household home. There are rather a couple of similarities in between the two, and rather a couple of differences. Deciding which one is finest for you refers weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each and balancing that with the remainder of the choices you have actually made about your ideal home. Here\'s where to begin.\nCondominium vs. townhouse: the essentials\nA condominium resembles a home because it\'s a specific system living in a structure or neighborhood of structures. Unlike an apartment or condo, a condominium is owned by its resident, not leased from a proprietor.\nA townhouse is an attached home also owned by its resident. Several walls are shared with an adjacent attached townhouse. Believe rowhouse rather of house, and expect a bit more privacy than you would get in a condo.\nYou\'ll find apartments and townhouses in metropolitan areas, backwoods, and the suburban areas. Both can be one story or multiple stories. The greatest distinction between the 2 comes down to ownership and costs-- what you own, and how much you spend for it, are at the heart of the condo vs. townhouse difference, and frequently end up being essential factors when making a choice about which one is an ideal fit.\nWhen you purchase an apartment, you personally own your private system and share joint ownership of the building with the other owner-tenants. That joint ownership consists of not just the building structure itself, but its typical locations, such as the gym, swimming pool, and grounds, in addition to the airspace.\nTownhouse ownership is more in line with ownership of a separated single family home. You personally own the land and the structure it sits on-- the difference is simply that the structure shares some walls with another structure.\n"" Apartment"" and ""townhouse"" are regards to ownership more than they are terms of architecture. You can live in a structure that resembles a townhouse but is in fact a condo in your ownership rights-- for example, you own the structure but not the land it sits on. If you\'re searching primarily townhome-style properties, make certain to ask what the ownership rights are, specifically if you want to likewise own your front and/or yard.\nHouse owners\' associations\nYou can\'t speak about the apartment vs. townhouse breakdown without mentioning homeowners\' associations (HOAs). This is one of the greatest things that separates these kinds of homes from single household homes.\nYou are needed to pay regular monthly fees into an HOA when you purchase a condo or townhouse. The HOA, which is run by other occupants (and which you can join yourself if you are so likely), deals with the day-to-day upkeep of the shared spaces. In an apartment, the HOA is handling the building, its premises, and its interior typical spaces. In a townhouse neighborhood, the HOA is managing typical areas, which includes basic grounds and, in many cases, roofing systems and outsides of the structures.\nIn addition to managing shared residential or commercial property upkeep, the HOA also develops guidelines for all tenants. These might include guidelines around renting your home, noise, and what you can do with your land (for instance, some townhouse HOAs forbid you to have a shed on your residential or commercial property, although you own your backyard). When doing the condo vs. townhouse comparison for yourself, inquire about HOA guidelines and fees, since they can vary commonly from home to property.\nEven with monthly HOA fees, owning a townhouse or a condo generally tends to be more budget friendly than owning a single household house. You need to never ever purchase more house than you can manage, so apartments and townhouses are frequently fantastic choices for novice homebuyers or anyone on a budget.\nIn regards to apartment vs. townhouse purchase costs, condos tend to be cheaper to purchase, because you\'re not purchasing any land. Condominium HOA fees likewise tend to be higher, since there are more jointly-owned areas.\nHome taxes, home insurance, and house inspection costs vary depending on the type of property you\'re buying and its area. There are likewise mortgage interest rates to consider, which are typically greatest for apartments.\nThere\'s no such thing as a sure investment. The resale value of your house, whether it\'s a condominium, townhouse, or single official site household separated, depends upon a variety of market aspects, a lot of them outside of your control. But when it concerns the consider your control, there are some benefits to both condo and townhome properties.\nA well-run HOA will ensure that common locations and basic landscaping always look their best, which means you\'ll have less to stress over when it concerns making a good very first impression concerning your building or building neighborhood. You\'ll still be accountable for making sure your house itself is fit to offer, however a spectacular pool location or well-kept premises may include some extra incentive to a possible buyer to look past some small things that may stand apart more in a single household home. When it comes to gratitude rates, condos have actually normally been slower to grow in value than other kinds of residential or commercial properties, however times are changing. Just recently, they even surpassed single household homes in their rate of appreciation.\nFinding out your own response to the condo vs. townhouse argument comes down to determining the distinctions in between the 2 and seeing which one is the finest fit for your family, your budget plan, and your future strategies. There\'s no genuine winner-- both have their pros and cons, and both have a fair amount in common with each other. Discover the property that you desire to buy and then dig in to dig this the details of ownership, charges, and cost. From there, you\'ll be able to make the very best decision.']"	['<urn:uuid:85c30e88-b99b-464e-a538-8d5e54f3e654>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	9	67	1047

92	kid car laws information age weight both florida oregon	"In Florida, children 3 years old or younger must be secured in federally approved child restraint seats. Children between 4-5 years old may use either a child restraint seat or safety belt. Children weighing 40-80 pounds and around 4'9"" in height must use booster seats. In Oregon, infants must use rear-facing seats until age 2 and the car seat's weight limit. Children under 40 pounds must use approved child safety seats, while those over 40 pounds must use booster seats until they're either 4'9"" tall or 8 years old. Both states emphasize that drivers are responsible for child safety and require proper restraint systems based on age and weight."	"['Different laws have been passed by the Florida Government to ensure child safety when travelling by vehicles. As a matter of fact, child safety laws exist in all the 50 states and the District of Columbia. However there are some differences between the child safety laws imposed by the Governments. These laws are generally targeted to the children of a particular age and weight. While some stats demand that cars have seats specially reserved for children up to 8 years of age, others may keep the limit until age 4 or less.\nFor example, Florida requires car seats for children until they are 3 years old while other states require car seats for children until they are at least 4 years old. The child safety rules of Alaska and Arizona are also a tad different from those of Florida. In Alaska, they demand that there should be car seats for children who are at least one year old and whose weight is near 20 pounds or less. The children should sit in the rear facing seats. Arizona child safety laws do not take the weight of a child into consideration.\nWhy are child safety seats and seat belts important?\nWhile travelling by a vehicle, it is of utmost importance to provide child safety arrangements. And this can be achieved by the use of child safety seats and seat belts. Child safety seats protect the child from being thrown in case of an auto accident. Seat belts also serve the same purpose thus saving and should be worn by all people.\nFlorida Child Restraint Requirements\nThere are the following rules which should be followed for child safety in a vehicle:\nChildren who are 3 years old or younger should be secured in child restraint seat which has been federally approved. This is one of the major child safety laws.\nChildren who are between the age group of 4 to 5 years old may be secured either in a child restraint seat, which has been federally approved, or by a safety belt. In case the safety belt is too tight or loose, then a booster set may be used and then the child should be correctly positioned.\nA child whose weight lies in the range of 40 to 80 pounds and height is anywhere around 4’9” must ride in the booster seats.\nThe driver of the vehicle is responsible for the child safety and it is his/her duty to buckle up the child before any journey.\nInfants should ride facing the rear until and unless they reach a minimum age of 1 year old and weight of 20 pounds. The infant should be placed in a semi upright position with an angle of not more than 45 degrees. An older child who is facing in the forward position should sit in the upright position. This is another very important child safety law which everyone should adhere to.\nOne should remember not to place a child (irrespective of age and weight) in the front seat of a car which has an air bag deployment feature. This can cause serious damage to a child in case of an accident. So it is preferable to use the seats at the back for child safety.\nThere are penalties imposed if child safety laws are not followed. These penalties depend upon several factors like age of the child, weight of the child, placement of the child etc. Typical punishments for not adhering to child safety rules include fines of different amounts. Generally a fine of $60 is imposed and along with that 3 points are deducted from the driving record.', ""Traffic Safety Laws in Oregon\nWhat are the Seat Belt Laws in Oregon?\nSeat Belt Laws for Adults\nOregon requires all adult drivers and passengers to wear a seat belt at all times while the vehicle is in motion. Vehicle owners have the responsibility to maintain proper seat belt equipment. While there are a few exceptions, this law applies to most vehicles, such as cars, pick-up trucks, and motor homes.\nChild Car Seat Laws\n- Infants must ride in a rear-facing child seat until they are 2 years old and reach the upper weight limit for the car seat.\n- If your child weighs 40 lbs or less, you are required to use an approved child safety seat.\n- If your child weighs over 40 lbs, or they reach the upper weight limit of their child safety seat, you are required to use a booster seat until they reach 4 ft 9 in tall or they turn 8 years old. (They must fit the adult seat belt properly.)\nElectronic Devices & Texting While Driving in Oregon\nOregon takes distracted driving very seriously; as such, the laws and penalties have become much broader in recent years for drivers caught driving while using any electronic device.\nIn Oregon, a mobile electronic device is defined as an item that:\n- Is NOT permanently installed into your car.\n- Is capable of such communications like calling, texting, emailing, accessing websites, and providing GPS navigation.\n- Offers entertainment features such as music, video, etc.\nRestrictions include the following:\n- Drivers of all ages are prohibited from using a hand-held mobile communication device while driving.\n- If you're at least 18 years old, you may use a hands-free accessory ONLY. This accessory MUST allow you to keep both hands on the wheel when using it.\n- All drivers under 18 years old are banned from all electronic devices while driving. This includes any hands-free device.\n- Texting and driving is completely prohibited, regardless of your age.\nYou could be fined up to $1,000 just for a 1st offense, and the penalties only get steeper from there. You may be able to take an approved Distracted Driving Avoidance course, depending on your situation, but the easiest way to avoid any of these penalties is to put your phone away while you drive.\nOregon Bicycle/Motorcycle Helmet Laws\nRegardless of age, anyone riding on a motorcycle must wear a helmet.\nAlso, if you're under 16 years old, you must wear a helmet when riding a bicycle.\nOR Headlight Laws\nOregon state law requires you to have your headlights turned on:\n- From sunset to sunrise.\n- Any time visibility is reduced to less than 1,000 feet.\nWhile it is not required by law, it is a good idea to have your headlights on whenever you need to have your windshield wipers on due to the weather.\nReporting Unsafe/Drunk Drivers\nCall 911 to report a driver who may be intoxicated, or who is driving so erratically that lives may be in danger.\nIf outside city limits, drivers may also call (800) 243-7865 ((800) 24DRUNK) to report suspected drunk drivers.\nWhile Oregon doesn't have any statewide laws specifically concerning the issue of leaving children or pets unattended in a vehicle, some jurisdictions have rules covering these matters. So, contact local authorities to determine if such rules exist in your area.\nHowever, leaving a child unattended long enough that it poses a threat to the child's safety is considered to be child neglect by the state, a second-degree offense.""]"	['<urn:uuid:7e38f126-dc35-4cb7-aa6d-3ac688701721>', '<urn:uuid:76243137-b77a-43e8-aa0c-4a3724621152>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	9	109	1190
93	I've heard about past changes in Earth's climate - how does the speed of today's climate change compare to what happened during the Little Ice Age in Europe?	The current rate of climate change is much more rapid than what occurred during the Little Ice Age. During the Little Ice Age (15th-18th centuries), temperatures dropped by 1.8-3.6 degrees Celsius over several centuries. In contrast, recent climate change is happening at an unprecedented rate - there is no evidence of comparable global temperature increases over the last 50 million years. Additionally, while the Little Ice Age was caused by natural factors like lower solar energy and volcanic activity, most of the warming of the past 50 years is attributable to human activities, particularly the rapid rise in CO2 concentrations to levels not seen in at least 650,000 years.	['Anthropogenic climate change is the defining challenge of this century. Understanding how societies respond to it can help us anticipate and mitigate its consequences. Most academic literature to date has focused on the short-term effects of weather shocks and natural disasters (see review by Vally Koubi). This approach has generated important insights, but does not speak to the consequences of gradual and irreversible climate change.\nIn this post, I advocate a more historic and long-run approach to understanding the effects of climate change. Weather anomalies and climactic shifts have been common throughout history. Examining their impact, in all of its complexity, can enrich our understanding of how societies adapt to a changing climate. It can also help us identify tipping points – both environmental and societal – that generate systemic change.\nI review recent work on a fascinating period of European history: the Little Ice Age that lasted approximately from the early Renaissance to the Enlightenment. These studies show not only the disastrous consequences of a changing climate, but also the remarkable resilience and ingenuity societies can muster. I also discuss the challenges of attributing political and economic outcomes to the weather.\nDid the Little Ice Age Even Happen?\nFrom the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries, temperatures dropped on average by 1.8-3.6 degrees Celsius. The River Thames froze over nine times in the 17th century alone (see image of a frost fair in London). The weather also became unpredictable, with prolonged cold spells, excessive precipitation, droughts, and frequent storms. The so-called Little Ice Age is generally attributed to a combination of lower solar energy, changing patterns of atmospheric circulation, and heightened volcanic activity, which prevented the sun’s radiation from reaching the earth. Contemporaries blamed it on the configuration of stars and planets, divine punishment, and witchcraft.\nDocumenting the Little Ice Age is no simple task. Thermometers were not invented until the 17th century. To analyze climate in the more distant past, climatologists have examined “natural archives” — ice cores, tree rings, cave deposits, and lake sediments. Historians have also studied ship logs, letters, diaries, and other written accounts, which help to link broader climactic trends to local weather. These sources offer subjective but vivid images. For example, a messenger approaching Istanbul in March 1640 experienced “such a frost that I caught two frozen birds on the way simply with my own hand.” In England in 1658, the winter was so severe that “the crow’s feet were frozen to their prey; islands of ice enclosed both fish and fowl frozen, and some persons in their boats.” Indirect evidence of the changing climate was also found in the prevalence of winter landscapes and the stunting of human growth.\nThe precise timing and scope of the Little Ice Age is disputed. Not everyone even agrees that the cooling occurred. In 2013, Kelly and Ó Gráda controversially argued that the Little Ice Age is a product of a statistical artefact called the Slutsky effect: the practice of smoothing data on European weather with a moving average prior to analysis generated an appearance of cooling. As for the freezing of the Thames? It may have been caused by the clumsy arches of the London Bridge, which dammed up the river. (See Kelly and Ó Gráda’s article and their rebuttal by Sam White.)\nSince then, other research has argued that while there was cooling, it was punctured by multiple periods of milder weather and confined to specific regions. For instance, recent global palaeoclimate reconstructions by Neukom et al. suggest that only northwestern Europe and southeastern North America experienced colder temperatures in the 17th century.\nThe Little Ice Age and Crises in Europe\nTaking the Little Ice Age as a given, historians were the first to marshal qualitative evidence to study its consequences for states and societies. Many of these early studies focused on the worst-case scenarios and adopted a broad-brush approach. For example, in Global Crisis: War, Climate Change and Catastrophe in the Seventeenth Century, Geoffrey Parker argues that the succession of extreme climate events, famines, and epidemics that started in 1618 killed up to one-third of Europe’s population.\nConclusively establishing causality between climactic anomalies and macro-level political crises is extremely difficult. This is why studies in quantitative social science took a narrower frame, exploring the relationships between weather shocks and smaller episodes of violence. For example, De Juan and Wegenast show that colder temperatures increased the frequency of food riots in England, but only in the 18th century. Problems of interpretation remain even in these narrower studies. For instance, Emily Oster found a link between cooler weather and an increase in witchcraft trials. She argues that lower temperatures produced food shortages and the search for scapegoats. However, Leeson and Russ (2018) attribute the increase in witch trials to the competition of Catholic and Protestant churches for influence in concessionally contested regions rather than the weather.\nConflicts and crises may be easier to spot because they leave more traces in the written record; they also resonate with growing anxiety about our warming atmosphere. However, as Dagomar Degroot and his coauthors argue in this recent Nature article, resilience in the face of an adverse climate has been the rule rather than the exception. Examining a broader range of outcomes, combining multiple methods, and adopting a longer-term view is particularly important for understanding the role of institutions, technology, and culture in human adaptation to a changing environment.\nHow Europeans Adapted to the Changing Climate\nIf we look closely, the Little Ice Age also supplies many examples of ingenuity and resilience. Societies learned to diversify their crops, build storage facilities, manage flood risk, or trade with others. Necessity was the mother of invention. Using data from over 5,000 documented innovations and discoveries over 500 years of European history, De Dreu and van Dijk find that cold spells increased rates of innovation.\nThanks to their innovative spirit and geography, some societies grew wealthier and more developed despite the adverse climatic conditions. In The Frigid Golden Age: Climate Change, the Little Ice Age, and the Dutch Republic, 1560–1720, Dagomar Degroot argues that the Dutch prospered by developing new technologies and ways of living, including more sophisticated ship building and the construction of canals for transportation. Importantly, the Dutch economy did not depend on agriculture and the republic imported much of its food. Colder and stormier seas wound up (literally) adding wind in the sails of the Dutch fleet. Degroot also offers a fascinating account of how the shifts between westerly and easterly winds influenced the outcomes of the Anglo-Dutch battles in 1652–1688, though he is careful to emphasize that “no wars were ever won or lost solely because of climate change” (p. 247).\nEconomic pressures and resource scarcity also increased international trade. Maria Waldinger analyzes panel data for 2,120 European cities, combining temperature reconstructions with data population size, agricultural yields and prices, and trade from the Registers of the Sound Toll. As expected, she finds that cooler temperatures shortened growing seasons and thus reduced agricultural yields and increased grain prices. Reduced agricultural productivity, increased mortality, and outmigration all lowered urban populations across Europe. At the same time, cities responded to climate change by increasing their volume of trade, as measured by the number of incoming ships and total taxes paid to the Danish government on goods arriving in each port (yet another way in which the Dutch benefited during the Little Ice Age). Waldinger also finds that regions less affected by temperature changes adjusted their land use to take advantage of their comparative advantage in agriculture.\nThis strategy was pursued by early modern Poland as well, where the amount of land under cultivation increased as forests were cleared to cultivate rye for export. As discussed in the PNAS article by John Haldon and co-authors, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth experienced an economic and cultural revival as a result. In the mid-seventeenth century, however, the destructive wars with Sweden and Russia reduced the population of the Commonwealth by a third, shrank the amount of cultivated land, and eventually crippled the economy. The economic and cultural decline of the Poland seems to have been caused not by the cooling temperatures, but by the convergence of economic and political crises. It is up for debate whether environmental challenges were the last straw.\nChallenges and Opportunities in Studying Historic Climate Change\nStatistically significant relationships between climate shocks and historical outcomes are not sufficient to prove causality. The use of the weather as an exogenous source of variation is also problematic. Frequently used as instruments for income shocks, grain prices, institutional weakness, or migration patterns, weather shocks may be bad instruments (see Ali’s recent post here). The exclusion restriction is likely to be violated given the many outcomes affected by the weather. Relatedly, our weather measurements may themselves be a product of development or state capacity (see this article by Schultz and Mankin). Paleoclimate data are immune to this, but such data are less precise and require expertise in natural sciences to interpret. Ideally, we would combine data from many sources to develop more accurate and high-resolution measures of weather patterns and consider multiple channels through which weather affects human livelihoods.\nMost importantly, economic and political crises have multiple causes, so explaining their occurrence requires integrating endogenous factors other than the weather. While the link between climate and the upsurge in conflict in 17th century Europe sounds fascinating, for example, it is incomplete without considering the Protestant revolution, the rise of the modern state, changing agricultural and military technology, and other endogenous variables.\nGiven that the current challenges of climate change are global in nature, scholarship on historical, long-run effects would also benefit from a wider geographic scope. Our understanding of the consequences of the Little Ice Age, for example, is largely confined to western and northern Europe. There is fertile ground to study how the Little Ice Age impacted societies in central and eastern Europe, which exported grain to western and northern Europe during that time.\n The term was coined by geologist F.E. Matthes in 1939, though it originally referred to the entire 4,000-year period of mountain-glacier expansion and retreat.\n Reconstructing past climate is a complex and imprecise process, and estimates vary by study and period.\n Quoted in Geoffrey Parker, Global Crisis, p. 5.\n John Evelyn quoted in Parker, Global Crisis, p. 6.\n The Toll was levied by the King of Denmark on shipping through the strait between Denmark and Sweden.', 'Frequently Asked Question 6.2\nIs the Current Climate Change Unusual Compared to Earlier Changes in Earth’s History?\nClimate has changed on all time scales throughout Earth’s history. Some aspects of the current climate change are not unusual, but others are. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has reached a record high relative to more than the past half-million years, and has done so at an exceptionally fast rate. Current global temperatures are warmer than they have ever been during at least the past five centuries, probably even for more than a millennium. If warming continues unabated, the resulting climate change within this century would be extremely unusual in geological terms. Another unusual aspect of recent climate change is its cause: past climate changes were natural in origin (see FAQ 6.1), whereas most of the warming of the past 50 years is attributable to human activities.\nWhen comparing the current climate change to earlier, natural ones, three distinctions must be made. First, it must be clear which variable is being compared: is it greenhouse gas concentration or temperature (or some other climate parameter), and is it their absolute value or their rate of change? Second, local changes must not be confused with global changes. Local climate changes are often much larger than global ones, since local factors (e.g., changes in oceanic or atmospheric circulation) can shift the delivery of heat or moisture from one place to another and local feedbacks operate (e.g., sea ice feedback). Large changes in global mean temperature, in contrast, require some global forcing (such as a change in greenhouse gas concentration or solar activity). Third, it is necessary to distinguish between time scales. Climate changes over millions of years can be much larger and have different causes (e.g., continental drift) compared to climate changes on a centennial time scale.\nThe main reason for the current concern about climate change is the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration (and some other greenhouse gases), which is very unusual for the Quaternary (about the last two million years). The concentration of CO2 is now known accurately for the past 650,000 years from antarctic ice cores. During this time, CO2 concentration varied between a low of 180 ppm during cold glacial times and a high of 300 ppm during warm interglacials. Over the past century, it rapidly increased well out of this range, and is now 379 ppm (see Chapter 2). For comparison, the approximately 80-ppm rise in CO2 concentration at the end of the past ice ages generally took over 5,000 years. Higher values than at present have only occurred many millions of years ago (see FAQ 6.1).\nTemperature is a more difficult variable to reconstruct than CO2 (a globally well-mixed gas), as it does not have the same value all over the globe, so that a single record (e.g., an ice core) is only of limited value. Local temperature fluctuations, even those over just a few decades, can be several degrees celsius, which is larger than the global warming signal of the past century of about 0.7°C.\nMore meaningful for global changes is an analysis of large-scale (global or hemispheric) averages, where much of the local variation averages out and variability is smaller. Sufficient coverage of instrumental records goes back only about 150 years. Further back in time, compilations of proxy data from tree rings, ice cores, etc., go back more than a thousand years with decreasing spatial coverage for earlier periods (see Section 6.5). While there are differences among those reconstructions and significant uncertainties remain, all published reconstructions find that temperatures were warm during medieval times, cooled to low values in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, and warmed rapidly after that. The medieval level of warmth is uncertain, but may have been reached again in the mid-20th century, only to have likely been exceeded since then. These conclusions are supported by climate modelling as well. Before 2,000 years ago, temperature variations have not been systematically compiled into large-scale averages, but they do not provide evidence for warmer-than-present global annual mean temperatures going back through the Holocene (the last 11,600 years; see Section 6.4). There are strong indications that a warmer climate, with greatly reduced global ice cover and higher sea level, prevailed until around 3 million years ago. Hence, current warmth appears unusual in the context of the past millennia, but not unusual on longer time scales for which changes in tectonic activity (which can drive natural, slow variations in greenhouse gas concentration) become relevant (see Box 6.1).\nA different matter is the current rate of warming. Are more rapid global climate changes recorded in proxy data? The largest temperature changes of the past million years are the glacial cycles, during which the global mean temperature changed by 4°C to 7°C between ice ages and warm interglacial periods (local changes were much larger, for example near the continental ice sheets). However, the data indicate that the global warming at the end of an ice age was a gradual process taking about 5,000 years (see Section 6.3). It is thus clear that the current rate of global climate change is much more rapid and very unusual in the context of past changes. The much-discussed abrupt climate shifts during glacial times (see Section 6.3) are not counter-examples, since they were probably due to changes in ocean heat transport, which would be unlikely to affect the global mean temperature.\nFurther back in time, beyond ice core data, the time resolution of sediment cores and other archives does not resolve changes as rapid as the present warming. Hence, although large climate changes have occurred in the past, there is no evidence that these took place at a faster rate than present warming. If projections of approximately 5°C warming in this century (the upper end of the range) are realised, then the Earth will have experienced about the same amount of global mean warming as it did at the end of the last ice age; there is no evidence that this rate of possible future global change was matched by any comparable global temperature increase of the last 50 million years.']	['<urn:uuid:ff5930d6-0c6d-481d-9e2c-e98e9730c1e5>', '<urn:uuid:3504e0be-1f20-4313-b40b-aa594b9e43e5>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	28	109	2755

At terminal velocity, gravity force (mg) equals air resistance force (1/2 Cd A r v2), where A is cross-sectional area, r is air density, v is speed, and Cd is drag coefficient. Mathematical modeling complements theory and experimentation in scientific research, being particularly useful when experiments are too large, expensive, dangerous, or time-consuming. It serves as a powerful tool for studying various problems in scientific research and integrates both theoretical understanding and experimental data.	"[""Hopefully you won't meet too much resistance while doing this activity\nDrop a single filter from 1 meter and a double filter from 1.4 m.\nA basket type coffee filter will reach terminal velocity after falling a very short distance.

95	business reputation damage ethical practices financial records impact	Poor ethical practices can damage business reputation as lying to customers and failing to support advertising promises hurts both the business and surrounding businesses, particularly in shared locations like malls. On the financial side, inaccurate records and improper accounting can destroy the company's credit rating, leading to financing restrictions and obstacles when seeking capital for new ventures. Both ethical misconduct and poor financial management can result in long-term business failure.	"['ETHICAL BEHAVIOR IS GOOD BUSINESS\nEthical business practices include assuring that the highest legal and moral standards are observed\nin your relationships with the people in your business community. This includes the most\nimportant person in your business, your customer. Short term profit at the cost of losing a\ncustomer is long term death for your business.\nA reputation for ethical decisions builds trust in your business among business associates and\nsuppliers. Strong supplier relationships are critical to a successful business. Consider the\nproblems you might have if you could not supply what the customer needs...at the time that they need it.\nThe entrepreneur is the role model for employees. If your behavior includes lying to customers,\ntaking money out of the cash register, or taking home some of the inventory or supplies, you\ncannot be surprised if your employees follow your lead. Your family members may see the\nbusiness as their own and take things that really belong to the business. Employees may see this\nas being dishonest, or as a conflict with their needs for a raise in pay.\nThe community expects your business to operate in an ethical manner that enhances the image of\nthe community as a whole. If you are located in a mall, for example, your code of ethics will help\nor hinder customer traffic for the other businesses too. A reputation for telling customers\nanything they want to hear, regardless of the truth, eventually hurts your business and other\nbusinesses around you. It usually isn\'t illegal to lie to customers, but it isn\'t good business.\nEthical behavior is merely making good business decisions based on an established ""code of ethics"". Entrepreneurs should establish a written code of ethics that can serve as a framework for\ndecisions to be made by the entrepreneur as well as the employees. In developing this code of ethics you should consider the following items:\n1. Identify your general principles that would lead to fair business practices.\n2. Check with your industry association for basic standards to review\n3. Allow for the fact that ethical questions do not always have a unique, faultless answer.\n4. Write out specific statements that will assist you and others in making day-to-day ethical\n5. Apply your code of ethics to a written policy and procedure manual identifying the major rules for operating your business.\n6. Train your employees (and family members) to make ethical decisions about the business.\nYour code of ethics will apply to all types of business operations including the following. What others can you add to this list?\n* Handling cash and checks from customers\n* ""Negotiating"" special prices for a friend without permission\n* Accepting gifts from suppliers and business associates\n* Selling damaged merchandise\n* Warranties on products\n* Merchandise return policies for customers\n* Returning merchandise to suppliers\n* Handling shoplifters\n* Accounting procedures for cash sales\n* Employee theft\n* Insurance coverage adequate to protect the business and employees\n* Supporting your advertising promises\n* Checking in merchandise when received from suppliers\n* Keeping the premises clean and free from harmful substances or germs.\n* Handling employee performance problems\n* Telling customers the truth\nUSE DECISION-MAKING SKILLS for ETHICAL DECISIONS\nThe day-to-day operations of a business require everyone to make decisions all the time. Practice in developing a code of ethics and then applying it to situations is important to establishing an ethical business image.\nConsider how the decision-making process will help you improve the\nsuccess of your business:\n1. Define the problem requiring a decision. Often we jump to conclusions about a situation without even taking time to clarify the problem\n2. Consider alternative solutions to the problem. There is always more than one solution to any problem. Practice thinking about possibilities before taking action.\n3. Identify the consequences of alternative solutions. There are many different consequences possible for choosing different alternatives. Entrepreneurs need to think about both the short-term and long-term consequences likely to result from their decisions.\n4. Collect information if you do not have enough to make the right decision. This is where a company policy and procedure guide may help employees check out their approach to a problem.\nAsk the class to form small groups of about 8 persons to work on ideas for ethical decision-making. Provide them with information about a business to use for the activity. This could be a local business, a business idea of your choice or theirs, or a business plan sample that they have\nbeen working with in the class. Ask each group to do the following:\n1. Identify problems the entrepreneur might encounter in running this business in an ethical\n2. Develop a 10-point code of ethics for the business.\n3. Discuss policies and procedures appropriate for this business that would support the code of\n4. List as many ethical problems as possible that might be faced by employees during a normal\nwork day. Discuss the possible solutions for the problems. Consider how a procedure guide might help employees to make the best decisions.\n5. Members of the group should then role-play the process of handling an ethical issue with a customer, with a supplier, with a competitor, and with the son of the owner. Discuss the results of the role-playing exercise. If necessary you may want to modify your code of ethics at this time.\n6. Each group should present their code of ethics to the class and discuss major outcomes of their discussion.\nSource: PACE, available from the Center on Education\nand Training for Employment, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. 1-614-292-4277.', 'Business owners need proper bookkeeping practices to prevent financial hardships and issues that could lead to serious financial losses. The companies must consider how well their financial records are managed and review any signs of inaccuracies that could indicate theft or improper reporting. Off-site accounting services could be the answer to their issues.\n1. Inaccurate Financial Data\nImproper accounting practices often lead to inaccurate financial data that causes serious problems for business owners. If their data is inaccurate, the business owner could overspend and cause a domino effect that could be catastrophic for their company. A great way to avoid these issues and get accurate financial data is to hire an outsourcing firm to complete all Accounting Services. The business owners can learn more about these opportunities by contacting a service provider now.\n2. Missing Tax Payments or Facing Tax Audits\nIf a company misses any tax payments, the IRS can place a lien against their tax refunds and seize money from the company’s bank account. If there is a history of inaccuracies on the tax returns, the IRS can start an audit that could lead to criminal charges if the company isn’t careful with their financial data.\nOff-site accounting services can help the business owner get everything ready for their tax returns and find areas where they can save on tax implications. By reviewing the company’s expenses, the business owner can find new deductions that decrease their tax liabilities and save more of the company’s money.\n3. Failing to Pay Vendors or Suppliers\nIf the financial records are not in order, the business owner will not know if they are up to date on all their accounts. If they fail to pay their vendors, this could present a damaged relationship with the vendors and prevent the company from getting necessary supplies later. All it takes is one inaccurate entry, and the company’s accounts payable are in a terrible mess. Outsourced accounting services ensure that the business pays all their payments on time and build better relationships with vendors.\n4. Destroying the Company’s Credit Rating\nA business owner knows all too well that inaccuracies and discrepancies can lead to financial ruin. If the company isn’t managing its financial data appropriately, they could damage their credit rating and face restrictions when they need financing or when seeking capital for new ventures. Business owners need regular reports for their financial data and accounts to avoid credit-related obstacles. They must keep all their accounts current and decrease the chances of late charges and negative listings on their credit history.\n5. An Inability to Track Theft\nBusiness owners that do not stay on top of their financial data could overlook unethical workers who are robbing them blind. By allowing on-site workers to manage their accounting needs, the business owner is less likely to find the records that show a worker has stolen from them. By sending the records to an off-site accounting service, forensic accountants can find the issues faster and get to the bottom of the issues.\nBusiness owners need accurate financial records each day and must maintain the records according to state and federal laws. For many companies, discrepancies lead to tax audits and the seizure of certain assets. By working with an off-site accounting provider, companies could eliminate common issues that lead to serious risks and keep them in the black.']"	['<urn:uuid:970dff93-9860-4064-a54d-0ea387c8ad65>', '<urn:uuid:e4faca32-3cd2-4fc6-9e89-b4299b777623>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	8	70	1490
96	When thinking about my own identity over time, I'm confused about whether I'm the same person as I was when I was younger. What different theories explain how we remain the same person over time despite all our changes?	There are two main competing theories about identity over time. The psychological view holds that we remain the same person through psychological continuity - our continuing memories, beliefs, personality traits and mental connections to our past selves. In contrast, animalism argues that our identity is purely biological - we are human animals whose continuity depends on maintaining the same biological life and organism over time, regardless of psychological changes.	['Personal identity, in metaphysics, the problem of the nature of the identity of persons and their persistence through time.\nPerhaps the problem that most people think of first when they think about the nature of the mind is whether the mind can survive the death of the body. The possibility that it can is, of course, central to many religious doctrines, and…\nThe notion of personal identity\nOne makes a judgment of personal identity whenever one says that a person existing at one time is the same as a person existing at another time: e.g., that the president of the United States in 1802—namely, Thomas Jefferson—was the person who in 1776 was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence. Matters of great importance often turn on the truth of such judgments. Whether someone should be punished for a crime, for example, depends on whether he is the person who committed it, and whether someone is the owner of something now may depend on whether he is the person who purchased it at some past time. Whether there is personal immortality, or survival of death, depends on whether a person who dies can be identical with a person existing subsequent to that person’s death.\nThe topic of personal identity has to do with what the truth of judgments of personal identity consists of and how it can be known. Equivalently, it has to do with the nature of the persistence of persons through time and their awareness of such persistence. Some scholars, such as the 20th-century American philosopher Roderick Chisholm, have denied that there can be an informative answer to such questions; they think that personal identity is “simple and unanalyzable.” But it seems plausible that something can be said about what the sameness through time of automobiles, rivers, and cities consists of, and so it is natural to think that the same should be true of the sameness through time of persons.\nBodily and immaterial-substance theories\nWhat one normally relies on in making judgments of personal identity in everyday life are facts about human bodies—sameness of appearance, sameness of fingerprints, sameness of DNA, and so on. This fact suggests that the sameness of persons consists of the sameness of human bodies. This suggestion of course raises the question of what the sameness of human bodies consists of. It cannot consist simply of similarity of bodily characteristics: different bodies can be alike in appearance and could be alike in fingerprints and DNA. A better answer would be that it consists of spatiotemporal continuity and continuity of bodily characteristics. A single body’s career traces a continuous path through space-time in which bodily properties change only gradually and in certain ways. Such an account would be unacceptable to those, such as the 17th-century French philosopher René Descartes, who take persons to be immaterial substances, or souls, that are only contingently connected with bodies. These philosophers would say that the persistence of a person consists of the persistence of such an immaterial substance. As to what that consists in, the most common answer is that the identity of such substances is simple and unanalyzable.\nThe psychological view\nBoth of these accounts of personal identity—the bodily theory and the immaterial-substance theory—were rejected by the 17th-century English philosopher John Locke in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689), which contained the first extended treatment of the topic in Western philosophy. Book II, chapter 27, of the Essay, “Of Identity and Diversity,” introduces a famous example in which the soul of a prince, carrying with it consciousness of the prince’s past life, is transferred to the body of a cobbler. Locke argued that the post-transfer cobbler-body person would be the same person as the prince, despite not having the prince’s former body. (Updated versions of this example involve brain transplants rather than soul transfers.) He also held that consciousness can be transferred from one immaterial substance to another, so that the immaterial substance that was initially the mind of one person might become the mind of a different person.\nLocke said that the identity of persons consists of sameness of consciousness. This is usually interpreted to mean that identity consists of facts about memory: someone existing now is the same as someone existing yesterday because he remembers the thoughts, experiences, or actions of the earlier person.\nThe 18th-century Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid objected to this view with what has come to be known as the “brave officer” example. A small boy is flogged for stealing an apple; later, as a young officer, he remembers the flogging; later still, as an old general, he remembers acting bravely as a young officer but does not remember being flogged as a boy. According to Locke’s theory, Reid thought, the young officer is the same person as the small boy, and the old general is the same person as the young officer, but the old general is not the same person as the small boy—a contradiction, because identity is logically transitive (if A = B and B = C, then A = C). The 18th-century English bishop and philosopher Joseph Butler raised a different objection: Locke’s theory is circular, because the notion of memory it employs presupposes the notion of personal identity.\nDespite these objections, views inspired by Locke—called neo-Lockean, or psychological, accounts—have dominated discussions of personal identity since his time, and much of the subsequent history of the topic has centred on debates about whether Reid’s and Butler’s objections can be met. The first response to Reid’s brave officer example, given a prominent statement by the 20th-century British philosopher Paul Grice, was that personal identity consists of continuity of memory. A person’s life can be conceived as consisting of a series of momentary “person stages.” In order for the old general to be identical with the small boy, it is not required that the general remember experiences and actions of the boy but only that the old-general person-stage be linked to the small-boy person-stage by a series of person-stages, each member of which contains memories of something occurring in the immediately preceding stage.\nIn a subsequent elaboration of this response, memory continuity was replaced by psychological continuity, which includes memory continuity as a special case. Psychological continuity consists of the holding of a number of psychological relations between person-stages—e.g., relations that hold when beliefs and desires produce, through reasoning, new beliefs, desires, intentions, or decisions—as well as the holding of relations that are involved in the retention over time of personality and character traits. The shift from a simple memory theory to a psychological-continuity theory goes some way toward answering Butler’s circularity objection, since it is possible to know whether the relevant psychological relations obtain without already knowing whether the person-stages in question are stages of the same person.\nAnother response to Butler’s objection, advanced by the contemporary American philosopher Sydney Shoemaker, is to replace the notion of memory with that of “quasi-memory.” A person quasi-remembers a past experience or action if he has a memory experience that is caused in some appropriate way by that past action or experience. It may be theoretically possible for a person to quasi-remember past experiences or actions—i.e., to have the experience of remembering them as his own—even though they are not in fact his own (see below Fission and special concern). But remembering will be a special case—and perhaps the only actual case—of quasi-remembering. And no circularity will be involved if one uses the notion of quasi-memory in place of the notion of memory in giving one’s account of the psychological continuity that constitutes personal identity. Of course, a psychological-continuity theory based on quasi-memory will be satisfactory only if it contains provisions that determine whether a case of quasi-remembering is a case of genuine remembering.\nFission and special concern\nMost contemporary versions of the psychological view of personal identity assume that persons are physical in nature. As already mentioned, Locke’s soul-transfer example was replaced in the 20th century by brain-transplant examples. The idea is that the recipient of a brain transplant could be expected to have memories corresponding to the past life of the donor, as well as a psychological history generally continuous with that of the donor before the transplant. The recipient would think that he is the donor—and, according to the psychological view, others should think the same. In addition to appealing to the possibility of brain transplants, some psychological theorists have envisaged “teletransportation” devices that move persons around by transmitting information about their neural states from one location to another.\nA variant of the brain-transplant example, due to the British philosopher David Wiggins, in which the two hemispheres of a brain are transplanted into two different bodies, has been extensively discussed since the 1970s. Here the supposition is that after the transplant there are two persons who are psychologically continuous with the person who existed before. Because these two persons are not identical to each other, it is impossible for both to be identical to the original person. Yet neither of them seems to have any characteristic that would make the original person identical to him and not to the other. Because such “fission” cases seem to constitute examples of psychological continuity without personal identity, they have been regarded as a challenge to the psychological view. They also seem to provide examples of quasi-memory that is not memory: the fission products would quasi-remember the past of the original person but arguably not remember it, if neither is identical to the original person.\nSome proponents of the psychological view have responded by saying that what personal identity consists of is not psychological continuity itself but “nonbranching” psychological continuity, the fission cases being examples of “branching” psychological continuity. Theorists differ, however, in how convincing they find this proposal.\nFission cases also raise questions about the special concern that people have for their own future well-being. It seems plausible that a person anticipating fission would have a special concern for the welfare of both of the fission products, even though—strictly speaking—he would be identical to neither of them.\nThe idea of special concern has figured prominently in the work of the contemporary English philosopher Derek Parfit. In Reasons and Persons (1984) and other works, he argued that one’s special concern is not with personal identity per se but with the psychological continuity and connectedness that is normally sufficient for personal identity but is not sufficient in cases of fission. If by “survival” is meant having what is valued, or what matters, in the prospect of continuing to exist with a life worth living, then, according to Parfit, in fission cases there is survival without identity. Parfit’s treatment of fission cases has given rise to a new criterion of adequacy for any account of personal identity: it must explain why personal identity matters in the way it does.\nAnother objection to the psychological view has to do with the possibility of amnesia: the view seems to imply that a victim of complete amnesia is not the same person as he was before he was stricken. Alternatively, the psychological theorist would be committed to saying that, despite appearances, amnesia is not really possible. Defenders of the psychological view reply that the sort of amnesia that actually occurs is compatible with the psychological view, because people can recover from ordinary amnesia—which means that their memories continue to exist in a latent state—and in any case there is more to psychological continuity than continuity of memory. In order for a case of amnesia to be apparently incompatible with the psychological view, it would have to amount to a “brain zap” that destroys not only all the subject’s memories but also all past features of his psychology. There is no reason to think that a person could survive this.\nThe psychological view versus animalism\nA powerful set of criticisms, raised in the late 20th century, has to do with the intuitively plausible assumption that persons are human animals. Although (as mentioned earlier) most versions of the psychological view assume that persons are physical entities, they are committed to holding that a person is not identical to his body, because the relations that constitute personal identity are different from those that constitute bodily identity. For similar reasons, the psychological view is also committed to holding that a person is not identical to the particular human animal (the individual Homo sapiens) that exactly coincides with his body’s physical space. If this is correct, however, then the psychological theorist must accept the existence of “coincident entities”: numerically different things (the person and the animal) that happen to occupy the same space and to be composed of the same matter. For some philosophers, this is reason enough to reject the psychological view. Others have argued that, even if coincident entities are possible, the psychological view implies the counterintuitive claim that persons are not animals.\nToo many minds\nFurthermore, the view also seems vulnerable to what has been called the objection from “too many minds” (or “too many thinkers”). Given that a person and his coincident human animal are physically exactly alike, it would seem (on a physicalist view about mentality) that the human animal should have the same mental states as the person and so should itself be a mental subject and a person, contrary to what the psychological view maintains. It might seem that the only way to avoid this conclusion is to assume that animals cannot think, which is also strongly counterintuitive. (The claim that the psychological view implies that animals cannot think is often referred to as the “thinking animal” objection.\nConsiderations such as these have been raised by proponents of “animalism,” the theory that in the 1990s became the main competitor of the psychological view. According to the American philosopher Eric Olson and others, persons are biologically individuated animals whose persistence through time consists of biological continuity, which is constituted by the biological processes that make up an organism’s life. Animalism is additionally supported by the fact that in actual cases (not involving brain transplants and the like) sameness of person and sameness of human animal always go together.\nDefenders of the psychological view, including Shoemaker, deny that they are committed to too many minds. Although persons and their coincident biological animals share the same physical properties, the result is not the instantiation of mentality in two different things, person and animal, but its instantiation in just one thing, the person. Only in the career of a creature having the persistence conditions of mental subjects—e.g., persons—are the physical-property instantiations embedded in such a way as to realize mental properties. Defenders also maintain that there is a good sense in which persons are animals, though not biologically individuated animals, and that animals in that sense can think. What they hold against animalism is the same as what Locke held against a similar view, the bodily theory: animalism is committed to rejecting the highly plausible intuition that in a brain transplant (or in a Lockean soul transfer) the person goes with the brain (or soul).\nOther topics that have been addressed in contemporary discussions of personal identity include whether there can be survival of death, whether persons can exist in disembodied form, and whether there can be persons that are not constituted by organisms—possibly including computers and organized groups of organisms.', 'Author: Kristin Seemuth Whaley\nCategory: Metaphysics, Philosophy of Religion\nWord Count: 995\nWhat are we? Philosophers often look for answers that capture what we are fundamentally—what makes us who we are.\nMaybe we’re non-physical souls or minds. Maybe we’re our thoughts and our memories. Or, perhaps we’re physical things like bodies or brains.\nAccording to a view called animalism, we’re human animals. This view is the focus of our discussion here.\nAnimalism is the view that each of us is a human animal: a biological organism of the species Homo sapiens. Animalists acknowledge that human animals typically exhibit rationality and levels of intelligence that other animals don’t, but hold that we are animals nonetheless.\nAnimalism has implications for our identity over time, how we’re still us through the past, present, and future, despite the many ways we change. If we’re human animals, then we can’t exist independently of those animals; what’s often called personal identity depends on our being the same animal over time—it’s a matter of biology.\n2. Animalism vs. Psychological Theories\nAnimalism departs from views according to which our identity over time is a matter of our psychology, on being psychologically connected to our past and future selves through our thoughts, memories, and self-conceptions: e.g., if you remember not liking broccoli as a kid but like broccoli now, you’re still the same person because you remember being that kid.\nTo see how animalism and psychological theories diverge, imagine this:\nYou are diagnosed with an untreatable illness. Your doctor proposes a cutting-edge procedure to transplant your brain into another body, and your body will be kept alive long enough to salvage any remaining healthy organs for other patients awaiting transplants. After the procedure, the patient with your brain wakes up and thinks, “Amazing! I have a new body and no illness!”\nWhere are you: with your brain or with your body?\nAccording to psychological theories, the patient with your brain, who is psychologically connected to your earlier self, who remembers being you, is you.\nAccording to animalism, this patient is not you: identity is a matter of biology, not psychology. You are the animal with the illness but no brain, since this biological organism continues to live the same biological life that you were living before. Your brain is joined up with a different animal living a different biological life.\nAnimalism entails that even a human animal on life support with no possibility of conscious activity is still one of us. And we can’t outlive these animals in an afterlife or—if technology ever enables this—by uploading our consciousnesses to a virtual reality, or getting new bodies through brain transplants. So animalism denies some common views about our identity through time.\n3. The Case for Animalism\nWhy do some people accept animalism? The best case for it is the Thinking Animal Argument, directed at a seated reader:\nPremise 1: There is a human animal sitting in your chair.\nPremise 2: The human animal sitting in your chair is thinking.\nPremise 3: You are the only thinking being sitting in your chair.\nConclusion: Therefore, you are the human animal sitting in your chair.\nThe being in your chair is a biological organism, a human animal; this living human organism with (right now) a functional brain, is thinking; you are the only thinker there, no other thinking being is also in your chair.\nIf successful, the argument establishes that you are that human animal. It’s not that you and the animal occupy the same space, thinking the same thoughts. There’s just one thinker there, you, which establishes identity between you and the animal. Therefore, you are a human animal. And, if so, your identity depends on being the same human animal over time.\n4. Resisting Animalism\nRejecting the argument requires denying a premise.\nDenying premise 1—that there is a human animal sitting in your chair—is hard to defend.\nDenying premise 2—that the human animal sitting in your chair is thinking—requires claiming that the human animal isn’t thinking: the organism is not what literally thinks, but it is intimately related to a mind or a soul that does think. But if human animals don’t think, then either other intelligent organisms like dolphins or chimpanzees are not actually intelligent, or they, too, are intimately related to minds that think.\nIf we are thinking minds, not thinking animals, this might challenge some of our everyday judgments about ourselves and our relationship to physical things: e.g., you never actually see yourself in the mirror (you see the organism); if you take a road trip with your dog, Spot, where we normally judge there to be two things are actually four (the human animal, the canine animal, you, and Spot); and you and Spot never snuggle (only the organisms do).\nDenying premise 3—that you are the only thinking being sitting in your chair—instead requires claiming that you are not the only thinker: you’re a thinker, and so is the human animal, with thoughts exactly like yours. But if there are two thinkers in your chair, you won’t know that you’re not the animal. Even if you think, “I’m not the animal; I’m the thinker that’s not the animal,” the animal will think the exact same thing. So, denying premise 3 doesn’t provide any assurance that you’re not an animal.\nAnother way to resist is with a parallel Thinking Brain Argument about the brain located where you are. The argument has analogous support, but its conclusion contradicts animalism: you are a brain not an animal. So we might have equally good evidence for a competing conclusion. At the least, it warrants more discussion of what it takes to be a thinker.\nSo, what are we, fundamentally? Animals? Brains? Minds? Souls? Some combination?\nAny answer has consequences for our self-understanding and raises further philosophical questions: When do we come into, and go out of, existence? Who counts as one of us, and what moral obligations do we have toward them? There’s a lot at stake when considering “What are we?”\n Descartes (1641) argues that each of us is an immaterial thing, a soul or a mind, rather than a physical thing, like a body. For an overview of his argument, see Meditation 6: The Existence of Physical Things and Substance Dualism in Descartes’ Meditations 4-6 by Marc Bobro.\n Olson (1999) is a major proponent of animalism. For additional presentations of animalism and its various forms, see Bailey (2015), Thornton (2016), and Blatti (2019).\n For an explanation of biological identity, continuing to live the same biological life, see Blatti (2019, §1.2); for an opposing view, see Madden (2016). The relationship between animalism and our identity over time is a matter of current debate; see Duncan (forthcoming) and Bailey, Thornton, and van Elswyk (forthcoming).\n Locke (1690, II.xxvii) argues that personal identity is a matter of psychology. For an introduction to psychological theories of personal identity, see section 3 of Personal Identity by Chad Vance.\n Another option is that neither patient is you, even if the procedure is successful. But, at most, you either follow your brain or stay with your body. Perhaps both patients survive as individuals very closely related, but not identical to, you. For discussions of survival as opposed to identity, see Parfit (1984).\n For fictional representations of what this might be like, see Amazon’s Upload series or Black Mirror’s “San Junipero.”\n The general challenge of the afterlife is that if you gain a new body or exist unembodied after physical death, you don’t appear to be the same animal. Some animalists, such as van Inwagen, try to preserve the possibility of an afterlife by arguing that God transports the human organism into a physical afterlife and puts a corpse in its place on earth; see discussion in Hasker and Taliferro (2019). Other animalists suggest different strategies for preserving the possibility of an afterlife, see, for example, Thornton (2019).\n This is a reconstruction of Olson’s argument (2003). For other arguments for animalism, see Blatti (2012) and Bailey (2016).\n If, later, this human animal has its brain removed for a brain transplant, then this human animal would no longer be thinking. But premise 2 is about what’s happening right now.\n Philosophers of personal identity will go to great lengths to preserve the idea behind this premise; theories of personal identity should not lead to the conclusion that there are multiple thinkers where you are. For discussion, see Hershenov (2013).\n Some philosophers would deny premise 1 and endorse mereological nihilism, according to which there are no composite physical objects, such as animals (or chairs, for that matter). For discussion of this view, see Wasserman (2017, §4).\n Chimpanzees and dolphins, like humans, communicate, develop social relationships, use tools, work together cooperatively, and recognize themselves in the mirror, all of which provide evidence of thought and intelligence (Bearzi and Stanford 2010).\n If we were to give an inventory of everything in the car, we’d typically mention things like luggage, Spot’s toys, road trip snacks, water bottle, etc., you, and Spot. But, once we’ve accounted for you and Spot, we would likely fail to account for two things that are very obviously in the car: the human animal and the canine animal.\n Denying premise 3 also requires denying some everyday judgments: there would be twice as many thinkers as we normally recognize; the person and the animal are both thinking. If you do something nice for a friend, you’ve brought happiness to both your friend and the animal located where your friend is. If you say something that hurts their feelings, you’ve actually done it twice over: once to the person and once to the animal.\n The Thinking Brain Argument proceeds as follows:\nPremise 1′: There is a human brain located where you are.\nPremise 2′: The human brain located where you are is thinking.\nPremise 3′: You are the only thinking being located where you are.\nConclusion’: Therefore, you are a human brain.\nBlatti, Stephan (2012). “A New Argument for Animalism,” Analysis (72)4, 685-690.\nBlatti, Stephan (2019), “Animalism,” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\nBailey, Andrew (2015). “Animalism,” Philosophy Compass 10(12), 867-883.\nBailey, Andrew (2016). “You are an Animal,” Res Philosophica (93)1, 205-218.\nBailey, Andrew, Allison Krile Thornton, and Peter van Elswyk (forthcoming), “Why Animalism Matters,” Philosophical Studies.\nBearzi, Maddalena and Craig Stanford (2010). “A Bigger, Better Brain: Observations of Chimpanzees and Dolphins Strengthen the Notion that Humanlike Intelligence may not be Uniquely Human,” American Scientist.\nDescartes, René (1641).

97	What's the difference between Western swing and nu-disco's production style?	Western swing and nu-disco have distinctly different production approaches. Western swing focuses on vocals and fiddles while maintaining swing's basic concept, but without the heavy brass sections typical of traditional swing music. In contrast, nu-disco is characterized by modern technology and pin-sharp production, typically employing synthesizers, samplers, sequencers, drum machines, and electronic keyboards. Nu-disco often includes re-edits of original disco tracks and incorporates elements from 1970s and 1980s disco, while Western swing emerged as a country music variation of swing.	"['|Stylistic origins||American influences\n|Cultural origins||2000s Europe (France)|\n|Typical instruments||Synthesizer, sampler, sequencer, drum machine, bass guitar, electric guitar, vocals, talkbox, drums electronic Keyboards|\nNu-disco (or sometimes referred to as disco house) is a 21st-century dance music genre associated with a renewed interest in 1970s and early 1980s disco, early to mid-1980s Italo disco and boogie, and the synthesizer-heavy Euro disco and P-Funk aesthetics. The genre was especially popular in the mid 2000s. In 2013, the nu-disco style once again became mainstream, as disco-styled songs by such artists as Daft Punk, Justin Timberlake and Robin Thicke filled the pop charts in the UK and the US. This trend continued in 2014, when similar styled songs by Michael Jackson, Katy Perry and Pharrell Williams entered the charts as well.\nThe moniker appeared in print as early as 2002, and by mid-2008 was used by record shops such as the online retailers Juno and Beatport. These vendors often associate it with re-edits of original-era disco music, as well as with music from European producers who make dance music inspired by original-era American disco, electro and other genres popular in the late ′70s and early ′80s. It is also used by Beatport, alsongside alternative dance, to describe the music on several American labels that were previously associated with the genres electroclash and french house.\nIn 2002, The Independent described nu-disco as the result of applying ""modern technology and pin-sharp production"" to ′70s disco and funk. In 2008, Beatport described nu-disco as ""everything that springs from the late 1970s and early 1980s (electronic) disco, boogie, cosmic, Balearic and Italo disco continuum,"" while Spin magazine placed an umlaut over the ""u"" in ""nu"", used the term interchangeably with Eurodisco, and cited strong Italo disco as well as electroclash influences.\nIn the mid 2000s many remixes of songs from the 1980s in the nu-disco style were popular as well as original songs in this style. In 2013, several disco and funk songs charted, this time more in a 1970s style and one source stated that the pop charts had more dance songs than at any other point since the late 1970s. The biggest disco hit of the year as of June was ""Get Lucky"" by Daft Punk, featuring Nile Rodgers on guitar. The song was initially thought likely to be a leading candidate to become the summer\'s biggest hit that year; however, the song ended up peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks behind another major disco-styled song, Robin Thicke\'s ""Blurred Lines"", which spent twelve weeks at number 1 on the Hot 100, and in the process became the eventual song of the summer itself. Both were popular with a wide variety of demographic groups. Other disco-styled songs that made it into the top 40 were Justin Timberlake\'s ""Take Back The Night"" (No. 29), and Bruno Mars\' ""Treasure"" (No. 5).\nDisco edits (re-rubs or re-edits) are traditional disco songs from the 1970s and 1980s which have been edited in some way, often using software but occasionally with a razor and reel-to-reel tape (a tape edit). The distinction between an edit and a remix is that an edit does not incorporate additional production, only the manipulation of the source material, whereas a remix can include as many new instruments and sounds as the remixer prefers. A ""re-rub"" and a ""re-edit"" fall somewhere in between, with re-rubs being tracks that have been cleaned up (from the vinyl source material) and straightened to a regular 4x4 beat, sometimes incorporating additional production. A re-edit is an edit in which the song\'s parts have been re-organized and minor additional production has been added, such as a more prominent drum beat, but the overall tone of the song has been left intact.\nClassic 1970s and 1980s disco remixers and producers such as Larry Levan, Shep Pettibone, Francois Kevorkian, Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers are often cited as influence to modern editors. Many nu-disco producers are also disco editors and often there is a bit of overlap between the two genres as many nu-disco songs feature samples of classic disco tracks. It is also not uncommon for an edit to be made of a modern track.\n- Reynolds, Simon (2001-07-11). ""Disco Double Take: New York Parties Like It\'s 1975"". Village Voice.

It was first introduced in the late 20s as another form of jazz. While jazz has a very distinctive style, swing incorporated more brass and heavy rhythm sections, usually manned by larger numbers of band members than traditional jazz. Artists such as Benny Goodman and Count Basie dominated the scene and brought swing music to the masses by the mid 40s.\nBy 1935 swing had become a worldwide phenomenon. Popular musicians were popping up in parts of Europe. British and American swing had dominated the charts, but German swing was also making a name. Unfortunately, the war aided in the decline of the music. Nazi officials created a campaign trying to squash the appeal of western music, going as far to create their own propaganda albums that degraded leaders of the western world and dropping them in by parachute.\nIn the late 40s pop music began to gain popularity and swingers had to move to a new form of music to keep enjoying the clubs. It was expensive to employ large bands to create the big band sound, and pop music required fewer players. A recording ban from 42-48 also hurt the industry.\nEven though swing music did start to decline, crooners started to make a way in to the scene. Musicians like Frank Sinatra kept some swing elements in their style as they rose to fame.\nThe 90s brought on a rise in the genre. Music from 40 years before started to make a comeback as artists started to incorporate the older styles in their new music. Groups like the Squirrel Nut Zippers and Cherry Poppin Daddies brought a new light to the old genre. By the end of the decade swing music once again dominated the charts, and swing clubs started to pop up all over the country.\nThe style of jazz popular after the turn of the century had a sophisticated feel to it. It was popular in night clubs and bars all over the US after beginning in New Orleans. In the mid to late 20s many artists started to experiment with different sounds, adding more brass instruments and faster beats. This new style required more people playing to pull off, and the name ‘big band swing’ was born. From here its popularity skyrocketed, making way for many notable artists to make history.\nBenny Goodman has always been associated with the early swing movement. Sing Sing Sing composed and performed by Benny Goodman is still widely acclaimed and played in clubs and movies everywhere. But he wasn’t the only noteworthy artist. Art Tatum, Count Basie, Buddy Rich, Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Glenn Miller, and many others made huge names for their selves, and still remain popular today.\nOnce swing music gained world wide popularity other artists wanted to incorporate this style in to their music. This led to the advent of Western swing- a style of country that used swing as its base. Western swing tends to focus more on vocals and fiddles, but also keeps with the same basic concept as jazz swing. Rockabilly became popular as a way to mix the new rock and roll style with swing. Elvis was one famous example of this. Gypsy swing features a dominate swing style minus the heavy brass and percussion. Guitars and bass created the backbone for gypsy swing. Even today swing music still has influences on modern artists.\nIn the beginning of the swinger music movement many unknown musicians were given an opportunity to make it pretty big. As the movement grew, the different types of swing music grew and expanded as well. Today swing still remains popular, and many artists still regularly release albums.\nWhen swing music started to hit its peak in the 30s and 40s, many musicians and groups gained worldwide notoriety. Art Tatum, Benny Goodman, Billie Holiday, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Glen Miller, and Ella Fitzgerald all enjoyed success in this genre. The list of noteworthy artists from this era is exhaustive, but a quick trip to a local music store or a browse through your favorite mp3 download program will yield hundreds of artists that still enjoy popularity.\nShortly after the rise of big band swing, the country music industry started to capitalize on this trend. Western swing features the same styling but with a stronger focus on harmonizing vocals and fiddles. Many western swing groups still used brass instruments, but it wasn’t in the forefront of the music. Groups such as the Texas Playboys, Milton Brown, and Spade Cooley all enjoyed success.\nMedia attention brought about a swing revival. Groups such as the Squirrel Nut Zippers, Brian Setzer, and Cherry Poppin Daddies helped to move swing in to the new century. By the late 90s a revival of swing music led way to new speak easy type bars and dance clubs that featured swing music nights. Even modern artists like Christina Aguilera incorporated swing successfully in to their style.\nWith the resurgence of the swing scene in the 90s, it was only a matter of time before someone created a musical based on that. Paul Kelly came up with the idea of Swing! and watched it come to life in 1999.\nSwing! takes classic music from the swing era from famous artists such as Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman, and forms a story around the music. Unlike other musicals, Swing! features no dialogue. The story is told through high energy dance and the music alone. While many people feared the show would fail, it ended up winning nominations for Tony Awards and other accolades from the musical community. It was nominated for Best Musical, Best Choreography, Best Orchestration, as well as many others.\nSwing! was premiered in December 1999 and ran through January 2001 on Broadway. Even after the show officially closes, many touring productions were able to capitalize on the success by taking the show on the road. It can still be found on the touring circuit if you visit the website devoted to the show. During the touring phase it could be found throughout the US as well as the UK.\nSoundtrack and DVDs\nIf you aren’t able to catch this show live, you can find the soundtrack to the show online or in many music retailers. The soundtrack features 40 tracks from some of the most influential swing artists of the original era. You can also find DVDs from the original Broadway production. This way you can bring the fun and excitement of the show to your living room.\nSwing music is a form of jazz that became popular in the early 30s. It features strong rhythms and brass instruments such as trombones and saxophones. The tempo is typically a faster pace, and doesn’t always have lyrics associated. Swing has been popular since its introduction, and has experienced several revivals over the decades.\nBy 1935 swing music was huge in the United States. By the 40s it was popular in England and Germany. Unfortunately, World War II introduced a decline in the popularity for several reasons. Many of the big band artists were called to fight overseas, the large orchestras known with swing were difficult to finance during the depression, and recording bans due to musician strikes helped to keep the music from hitting the streets.\nBy the beginning of 1949 the ban had ended and swing styles evolved in to new styles. Jump blues and bebop both became popular as a result of swing. The style could be seen crossing all genres of music, including country and rock by the early 50s.\nNew Age Swing\nIn the late 90s another resurgence of popularity occurred. Groups like Big Bad Voodoo Daddies, Squirrel Nut Zippers, and Cherry Poppin Daddies brought swing back to a new generation. Using lyrics that the youth could relate to, and the classic orchestra style swing, it was popping up on the radio and in dance clubs all over the world.\nIt hasn’t faded in to the background quite yet. Many newer musicians still incorporate swing elements in to their albums, and swing music clubs can still be found across the nation.\nIn the early 1900s jazz music began to make its way on the music scene. First being popular only in African American communities, it didn’t take long for everyone to take notice. Before the 20s came rolling in, jazz music could be heard in virtually every club in the states, and was making its way to other countries.\nIn the late 20s musicians were starting to add more players with the addition of large brass and woodwind ensembles. The beats were changed and more syncopation added. This new form of music was edgier, and easier to dance to. The name ‘big band’ was coined, and because the music made you ‘swing’, the name was born.\nThanks to swing music, many forms of dance also evolved. The Lindy Hop was made popular in the early days of swing, and remains popular today. The Jitterbug became hugely popular, and even today dance competitions centered around this style can be found. Shagging was another form that had a more sexual feel to it, and still remains a favorite in many clubs.\nThe dance styles of swing feature high energy moves combined with elements of tap.\nSwing music gave birth to many sub-genres, and some still coming in to the spotlight today. As rock and roll started to become popular, many artists combined the harder sounds with the energy of swing, creating the birth of rockabilly. Country music started to incorporate swing without the brass and woodwind, but with a stronger focus on the fiddle and country lyrics. This is still well liked in the country scene and is referred to as Western swing.\nThe swing music scene was huge in the 30s and 40s, but maintained popularity through today. In the early 90s it hit the scene again in a big way.\nA New Generation\nIn the early 90s the new swing movement (often called the neo-swing movement) was largely underground. Media attention grew, and retro swing started being used in more movies. The soundtrack to the 1993 movie The Mask featured several neo-swing artists, such as Brian Setzer and the Royal Crown Revue. Later in 1993 the movie Swing Kids gained critical acclaim, and brought swing music back in to households all over the world. By the end of the 90s swing music could be found in Gap commercials.\nLater in the 90s ska bands started to introduce the new swing movement to the public. Groups such as The Mighty Mighty Bosstones mixed old school swing with new punk and ska, and the combination worked. By the late 90s swing music was making its way on the air and hitting the charts again. Some of the top charting groups included The Cherry Poppin Daddies, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, the Brian Setzer Orchestra. Older swing music from the 30s and 40s also enjoyed sudden increases in sales.\nSwing music still remains popular, although the popularity has decreased slightly. Those who enjoy the music can still find clubs throughout the US and the UK that dedicate certain nights to swing music. Modern jive is huge in the UK, and vacations can actually be planned around swing events.\nLondon swing has been popular since the 40s, but has more recently enjoyed success again.\nIntroduction in Europe\nWhile swing music originated in the United States in the late 20s, Europe wasn’t far behind. This style of music quickly spread across the pond, and many artists created their own styles of swing. By the late 40s and early 50s swing music could be found globally.\nLondon has long been a hot spot for up and coming artists. While probably more known for rock, swing enjoyed a large influence as well. Rockabilly has been said to have started in London. While no one knows this for sure, it’s not a far out assumption.\nToday swing music remains popular in all parts of the world. In London, a new form of swing that mixes hip hop and house music with a swing backbone has become all the rage with London Swingers. This new form of swing is referred to as electroswing. Heavy dance clubs have long been popular in London, and the Electro Swing clubs of today are no exception to this. Some notable artists include Mr. Scruff, Parov Stelar, and F.M. Einheit. Many of the popular songs take old school swing, such as Duke Ellington, and mixed it with more modern electropop. This new style is gaining popularity and slowly moving to other parts of the world, including the United States.\nThe turn of the century was instrumental in music. In the southern region of the United States, the African American community brought about a form of music that combined blues with syncopation, and jazz was born.\nJazz began popping up in underground clubs, and spread through the communities like wildfire. It spurred several sub-genres of music, including Ragtime, Dixieland Jazz, and the ever popular Swing Jazz.\nSwing jazz was different than the traditional jazz sounds of the early years. By the mid 30s musicians were adding heavy rhythm sections along with brass and woodwind instruments. The result was a large band that belted out music that was smooth and easily danced to. The arrangements for swing tended to be edgier than its predecessor.\nSwing music became huge in the night club scene. Its popularity spread throughout the United States, and started crossing the pond in to parts of Europe. Even German artists were starting to make it big in the swing scene by the end of the 30s.\nThe popularity of the genre couldn’t be squashed, even with declines seen in the aftermath of the war and the depression. While sales declined, the genre led the way for many newer forms of swing music. The rockabilly movement, gypsy swing, western swing, and more modern forms of ska-swing took its place.\nToday swing music remains a commodity. Many newer bands use swing as the base for other forms of music. Acid jazz is a form of swing that is popular in the club scene today. It combines more modern hip hop and funk in with a swing backbone.\nThe New York swing scene has been a large part of pop culture dating back to the 30s. When swing first made its way on the scene in New Orleans in the 20s, it wasn’t long before the style was adopted in New York. During the prohibition era, swing was huge in New York and many swinger clubs were used as a front for alcohol consumption. Beyond that it remained large, and became a part of the culture that has remained strong through today.\nArguably, one of the more notable incarnations of swing in New York was the Acid Jazz movement. This genre of music took a strong swing backbone and incorporated hip hop and funk in to the mix. The result was a more garage feel in music. While acid jazz originated in the UK, it became hugely popular in the New York scene with many New York Swingers. By the 90s, it was hard not to find a club that didn’t feature this type of music.\nSwing and Broadway\nOne of the most famous aspects of New York is the musical theater scene. Swing didn’t escape this avenue. Shows such as Bring in Da Noise, Bring in Da Funk used strong swing elements to captivate audiences. The show combined elements of tap, jazz, and swing to create a continuous rhythm that the dancers used to create a story. Swing! the musical also ran a decent stint on Broadway in the 90s. Elements of swing can still be found in today’s musicals thanks to the influence of musical theater on the New York and worldwide culture.']"	['<urn:uuid:bf65c084-902f-4929-9cc7-8039c4e8d2fc>', '<urn:uuid:2ff707bb-7ec3-4e94-9e01-a0d6bab3c8db>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	10	80	3504

99	When comparing the main way water gets cleaned in a landfill versus a septic leach field, do they use similar processes?	Yes, they use similar processes as both rely on microbes for cleaning. In landfill soils, microbes perform nitrification and denitrification processes to transform nitrogen compounds. Similarly, in septic leach fields, microbes grow and use organics and nutrients to treat the septic tank effluent water, along with physical filtering in the soil.

However, after landfill leachate is applied on land, nitrous oxide (N₂O), an important greenhouse gas, is mainly produced in soils by nitrification and denitrification. Field studies were conducted in Likang Landfill, Guangzhou, PRC, where leachate recirculation has been practiced for 8 years. Monthly productions and fluxes of N₂O were studied from June 2000 to July 2001. The ammoniacal-nitrogen level in Likang landfill leachate was high, about 1,535-4,220 mg L⁻¹. A high emission rate of N₂O at 187 mg m⁻² h⁻¹ was detected from a leachate pond purposely formed on landfill topsoil after leachate irrigation. A high level of N₂O (10.2 ng ml ⁻¹ ) was detected in gas emitted from topsoil 1 m from the leachate pond. Less than 19% of total soil N₂O was produced by autotrophic nitrification; the highest percentage was determined in June 2001. The relative net N₂O production from denitrification ranged from 18 to 100%. Thus, the major source of N₂O production was from denitrification, rather than from nitrification, in leachate-contaminated soil, as quantified by acetylene inhibition tests. The correlations between key environmental and chemical factors and N₂O levels are determined. The quantity of N₂O flux (ng of N cm⁻² h⁻¹) due to leachate recirculation was compared with figures reported in different ecosystems and it was 215-1,652 times higher.|\nToxic substances such as heavy metals in landfill leachate exert a significant impact on the performance of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria. They affect the compound nitrogen mineralization and also the N₂O production in a landfill site. Since copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) are metals commonly found in municipal solid waste, acetylene was again used as an inhibitor to study their effects on the contributions of autotrophic nitrification and denitrification N₂O production. The effects of Cu and Zn on N₂O production, nitrifying and denitrifying activities under aerobic and anaerobic atmospheres were also studied. For a given metal concentration of 250-1,000 mg kg⁻¹, the largest ammonium accumulation (by dissimilatory nitrate reduction) and highest N₂O production were observed for Cu followed by the Zn. Same order was also observed in the largest net mineral N lost from landfill soil, especially in higher metal concentrations. The inhibitory effects of Cu and Zn at 250-1,000 mg kg⁻¹ on nitrification were obvious, since no N₂O was produced from this biological process. Furthermore, the relative net N₂O production from denitrification ranged from 22% to more than 100% after Cu or Zn addition. Although both Cu and Zn solutions could enhance the denitrification N₂O production, Cu contributed more than Zn in this aspect. High concentrations of soil Cu (up to 1000 mg kg⁻¹) could greatly promote denitrification N₂O production under anaerobiosis. Moreover, the results of the effects of these two metals in landfill soils incubated in aerobic and aerobic atmospheres provided evidence that denitrification was the most probable source of N₂O in Likang Landfill soils.\n|Description:||x, 151 leaves : ill.

No item in the PolyU IR may be reproduced for commercial or resale purposes.', 'What is a Trench Leach Field Septic System?\nSeptic leach trenches for disposal of septic tank effluent are one to three feet wide trenches that have up to four feet of aggregate rock with a perforated pipe installed down the middle of the trench on the top of the rock. The pipe is connected to the distribution box and the septic tank outlet pipe. Typically the aggregate rock filling the trench has a diameter of ¾ to 2-inches and has been washed to remove fines. The water leaving the septic tank drains to the perforated pipe in the trench where it leaks out the holes. It then is absorbed in the soil at the bottom and on the sides of the leach trench. Treatment of the septic tank effluent water also occurs in the soil as microbes grow and use the organics and nutrients. Physical filtering of the water also occurs in the soil.\nWhere can they be used?\nIn Arizona the state rules allow a leach trench system to be used after a septic tank when the site and soil do not have any limiting conditions. There must be at least four feet of suitable soil below the bottom of the leach trench.\nThis photo shows a narrow trench installed with observation pipes and filter fabric over the leach rock.\nSoil Testing and Site Investigation\nTo design a leach trench system, the first step is to have a soil and site investigation completed. The state rules require that the testing be conducted by a trained and certified inspector. Some counties require the investigator to be a registered professional engineer, geologist, or sanitarian. The testing including excavating three holes to a depth of 12 feet or to refusal if there is rock or cemented soil. The investigator will log the soil profile noting the structure, texture, and consistence of the soil. In some cases, such as an area with significant rock fragments, a percolation test with water will be conducted. They will use the data to determine the percolation rate and soil absorption rate or SAR. The percolation rate or soil characteristics are used to determine the Soil Absorption Rate or SAR using a table in the state rules. This is the volume of water that will soak into the soil each day in one square foot of sidewall of the leach trench.\nIf the SAR is faster than 1 inch in 1 minute as expected in an area with coarse sand, or gravel and cobbles, then it is too fast for a leach trench. Additional treatment of the waste water is required to clean the water to prevent it from contaminating groundwater . If the rate is slower than 1 inch in 60 minutes in clay soil, treatment will also be required.\nDesign and Sizing\nThe SAR is used by the designer to determine how much sidewall area is needed to absorb the effluent water that will drain from the new building. A trench is sized based on the effective depth and width. The effective depth is the depth from the bottom of the leach pipe to the bottom of the trench. The maximum effective depth allowed by the state rules is 4 feet. The area per foot is calculated by adding each sidewall plus the bottom. The design flow from the building is divided by the SAR to determine the area of soil disposal required. The area is divided by the area per foot of trench to calculate how long the leach trench will need to be for the volume of water. If the length required is more than 100 feet, two or more leach trenches will be required.\nTrenches must meet the normal setbacks from the property line, building, pool, wall, well, or easement. If there is more than one trench, they must be separated by a distance that is at least two times the effective depth of the trench.\nCase Study Example\nWe recently designed a trench septic system for a new house in Rio Verde, Arizona. The house will have three bedrooms and a design flow of 450 gallons per day based on the number of plumbing fixtures. The soil and site evaluation showed sandy loam soil below 14 inches which gives a SAR of 0.6 gallons per day per square foot. The trench will have a 4 foot effective depth and 2 foot width. This gives 10 square feet per foot of trench:\nArea of Trench = 2 (effective depth of 4 ft) + 2 ft wide = 10 ft per square foot\nThe area required for 450 gallons is 750 square feet:\nArea Required = 450 gallons/0.6 gal/day/sq ft = 750 sq ft\nThe required length of the trench is 75 feet:\nTrench Length Required = 750 sq ft/10 sq ft/ft = 75 ft\nWe designed the septic system to have two trenches, each 37.5 feet long, to fit the space available. The overall depth of the trenches will be 7 feet to allow for the depth of the plumbing under the house, the slope of the sewer pipe, and drop through the septic tank.']	['<urn:uuid:2ffd94dc-3ca8-4049-8ff9-1d3638b3a37f>', '<urn:uuid:e0087ca8-756e-4ca4-b20b-81f44c8f9d34>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	21	51	1456

Radiometric corrections may be necessary due to variations in scene illumination and viewing geometry, atmospheric conditions, and sensor noise and response. Each of these will vary depending on the specific sensor and platform used to acquire the data and the conditions during data acquisition. Also, it may be desirable to convert and/or calibrate the data to known (absolute) radiation or reflectance units to facilitate comparison between data.\nVariations in illumination and viewing geometry between images (for optical sensors) can be corrected by modeling the geometric relationship and distance between the area of the Earth\'s surface imaged, the sun, and the sensor. This is often required so as to be able to more readily compare images collected by different sensors at different dates or times, or to mosaic multiple images from a single sensor while maintaining uniform illumination conditions from scene to scene.\nAs we learned in Chapter 1, scattering of radiation occurs as it passes through and interacts with the atmosphere. This scattering may reduce, or attenuate, some of the energy illuminating the surface. In addition, the atmosphere will further attenuate the signal propagating from the target to the sensor. Various methods of atmospheric correction can be applied ranging from detailed modeling of the atmospheric conditions during data acquisition, to simple calculations based solely on the image data. An example of the latter method is to examine the observed brightness values (digital numbers), in an area of shadow or for a very dark object (such as a large clear lake - A) and determine the minimum value (B). The correction is applied by subtracting the minimum observed value, determined for each specific band, from all pixel values in each respective band. Since scattering is wavelength dependent (Chapter 1), the minimum values will vary from band to band. This method is based on the assumption that the reflectance from these features, if the atmosphere is clear, should be very small, if not zero. If we observe values much greater than zero, then they are considered to have resulted from atmospheric scattering.\nNoise in an image may be due to irregularities or errors that occur in the sensor response and/or data recording and transmission. Common forms of noise include systematic striping or banding and dropped lines. Both of these effects should be corrected before further enhancement or classification is performed. Striping was common in early Landsat MSS data due to variations and drift in the response over time of the six MSS detectors. The ""drift"" was different for each of the six detectors, causing the same brightness to be represented differently by each detector. The overall appearance was thus a \'striped\' effect. The corrective process made a relative correction among the six sensors to bring their apparent values in line with each other. Dropped lines occur when there are systems errors which result in missing or defective data along a scan line. Dropped lines are normally \'corrected\' by replacing the line with the pixel values in the line above or below, or with the average of the two.\nFor many quantitative applications of remote sensing data, it is necessary to convert the digital numbers to measurements in units which represent the actual reflectance or emittance from the surface. This is done based on detailed knowledge of the sensor response and the way in which the analog signal (i.e. the reflected or emitted radiation) is converted to a digital number, called analog-to-digital (A-to-D) conversion. By solving this relationship in the reverse direction, the absolute radiance can be calculated for each pixel, so that comparisons can be accurately made over time and between different sensors.\nIn section 2.10 in Chapter 2, we learned that all remote sensing imagery are inherently subject to geometric distortions. These distortions may be due to several factors, including: the perspective of the sensor optics; the motion of the scanning system; the motion of the platform; the platform altitude, attitude, and velocity; the terrain relief; and, the curvature and rotation of the Earth. Geometric corrections are intended to compensate for these distortions so that the geometric representation of the imagery will be as close as possible to the real world. Many of these variations are systematic, or predictable in nature and can be accounted for by accurate modeling of the sensor and platform motion and the geometric relationship of the platform with the Earth. Other unsystematic, or random, errors cannot be modeled and corrected in this way. Therefore, geometric registration of the imagery to a known ground coordinate system must be performed.\nThe geometric registration process involves identifying the image coordinates (i.e. row, column) of several clearly discernible points, called ground control points (or GCPs), in the distorted image (A - A1 to A4), and matching them to their true positions in ground coordinates (e.g. latitude, longitude). The true ground coordinates are typically measured from a map (B - B1 to B4), either in paper or digital format. This is image-to-map registration. Once several well-distributed GCP pairs have been identified, the coordinate information is processed by the computer to determine the proper transformation equations to apply to the original (row and column) image coordinates to map them into their new ground coordinates. Geometric registration may also be performed by registering one (or more) images to another image, instead of to geographic coordinates. This is called image-to-image registration and is often done prior to performing various image transformation procedures, which will be discussed in section 4.6, or for multitemporal image comparison.\nIn order to actually geometrically correct the original distorted image, a procedure called resampling is used to determine the digital values to place in the new pixel locations of the corrected output image. The resampling process calculates the new pixel values from the original digital pixel values in the uncorrected image. There are three common methods for resampling: nearest neighbour, bilinear interpolation, and cubic convolution. Nearest neighbour resampling uses the digital value from the pixel in the original image which is nearest to the new pixel location in the corrected image. This is the simplest method and does not alter the original values, but may result in some pixel values being duplicated while others are lost. This method also tends to result in a disjointed or blocky image appearance.\nBilinear interpolation resampling takes a weighted average of four pixels in the original image nearest to the new pixel location. The averaging process alters the original pixel values and creates entirely new digital values in the output image. This may be undesirable if further processing and analysis, such as classification based on spectral response, is to be done. If this is the case, resampling may best be done after the classification process. Cubic convolution resampling goes even further to calculate a distance weighted average of a block of sixteen pixels from the original image which surround the new output pixel location. As with bilinear interpolation, this method results in completely new pixel values. However, these two methods both produce images which have a much sharper appearance and avoid the blocky appearance of the nearest neighbour method.\nWhat would be the advantage of geometrically correcting an image to geographic coordinates prior to further analysis and interpretation? The answer is ...\nWhiz quiz - answer\nThe advantage of geometrically correcting an image prior to further analysis and interpretation is that it would then allow proper measurements of distances and areas to be made from features in the image. This may be particularly useful in different applications where true measurements are necessary, such as in urban mapping applications. Also, the geographic locations of features could be determined. Once an image is geometrically registered to a known geographic base, it can be combined with other mapped data in a digital environment for further analysis. This is the concept of data integration which is discussed in section 4.8.\n- Date Modified:']"	['<urn:uuid:a2163be6-d62d-410e-9d77-8f4618f18193>', '<urn:uuid:e1040015-3c69-43a2-a6f1-5b3fba7982b9>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:42:09.914312	9	40	1854
